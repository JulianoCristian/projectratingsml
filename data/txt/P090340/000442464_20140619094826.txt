1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1. Of all the transition economies in the region, Moldova had the hardest fall in the
1990s. A tentative revival in 1997 was squashed by the financial crisis in Russia, with
devastating effects for Moldova’s export, the government budget, and debt. In addition to
rising poverty resulting from the economic downturn in the 1990s, the country also
suffered from territorial secession and armed conflict. Between 2000 and 2004, the
economy began to recover: real GDP increased by more than 30 percent and the poverty
rate declined by more than a half. However, the driving force behind this growth was
increased consumption, fueled by rising real wages and workers’ remittances (some 25
percent of Moldova’s active population was working abroad). At 27 percent of GDP,
remittances were reducing the incidence of poverty. Nevertheless, at the time of Project
design, Moldova had the highest poverty rate in Eastern Europe and the Caucasus. The
proportion of the population below the national poverty line was estimated at 49 percent
in 2002, and the rural poor predominated, accounting for 68 percent of all poor people.

2. Education issues and GoM’s strategy. Moldova had expressed strong commitment
to education reform and improving educational quality, access, and efficiency. This
commitment was clearly formulated in the 2004 Economic Growth and Poverty
Reduction Strategy (EGPRS), which also recognized and adopted the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs). The EGPRS encompassed four objectives for education: (i)
to improve the quality of education; (ii) to increase access to education, particularly for
children from vulnerable families; (iii) to raise the efficiency of management within the
education sector; and (iv) to improve the integration of children with special educational
needs and vulnerable children. The EGPRS was integrated with the Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework (MTEF) for 2005-2007.

3. The plans were based on progress already made in modernizing education, much of
it associated with the earlier Bank-financed General Education Project (P008558)
implemented in 1997-2004. However, significant challenges in education still remained,
such as:

   Quality: Learning outcomes suggested that there were still problems with quality at
    the secondary level, but the results of the 2003 international assessment Trends in
    International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) for grade 4 suggested that
    there was hope for improvement arising from the reforms in curriculum, textbooks,
    teacher training, and assessment that were underway: the relatively high proportion
    of 4th grade students demonstrating problem-solving capacity was particularly
    encouraging. However, the TIMSS report also showed that the shortage of resources
    for teaching materials and equipment was still acute. The low level of teachers’
    salaries had an adverse effect on the quality of learning outcomes at all levels,
    making it difficult to attract good young teachers into the profession. Inequities in
    students’ outcomes reflected parental background as well as school quality, and



                                            1
        children from more educated and prosperous families and those in urban areas got
        better results than those from poorer and rural households.

       Access: Moldova lagged behind many of its neighbors in terms of access to
        education. For primary and gymnasium levels (grades 1 to 9), the gross enrollment
        rate was 95 percent in 2003 – lower than rates in the European Union (EU) member
        states and candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), but higher than
        in other western Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries. At the upper
        secondary level (grades 10 to 12), the overall gross enrollment rate of 42 percent was
        less than half that achieved by CEE EU members and well below that in other
        comparator countries. Disparities in enrollment rates also reflected the higher rate of
        dropouts of children from poorer and rural families. Children whose parents were
        working abroad also tended to absent themselves from school and drop out
        prematurely.

       Efficiency: There was a downward trend in the number of young people of school
        age. Between 1990 and 2003, the number of 7- to 15-year-olds decreased by 20
        percent. Between 2003 and 2010, the number of children in this age group was
        expected to continue falling (by 32 percent for the basic education age group) and a
        22 percent fall was expected in the number of 16- to 18-year-olds. The fall in the
        number of school-age children was reflected in a decrease in the average student-
        teacher ratios over recent years (14.7 in primary and secondary schools), with
        worrying variations between schools. Likewise, average class size had also been
        falling. In sum, there were many small schools with small classes and low student-
        teacher ratios, particularly in rural areas. The large number of non-teaching relative
        to teaching staff and high heating costs, due in part to poor insulation of large school
        buildings, were some of the other issues adding to the concerns about low efficiency
        and high costs.

       Public finance of education was in crisis, partly due to the methodology used to
        allocate budgets to schools.

4. Rationale for Bank involvement. The Bank’s support to the sector for the QERM
Project was in line with the strategic and human development priorities outlined in
Moldova’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) FY05-08, which focused on supporting
interventions at the local and community levels in rural areas and small cities, which inter
alia were aimed at improving the quality of and access to social services, including
education services. The QERM Project supported the GoM’s education program,
articulated in the 2004 EGPRS. The Project was also nested in the first strategy and
action plan for the education sector (2006-2008) of the Ministry of Education (MoEd).1


1
 The strategy and action plan was essentially a consolidation of the proposals made in various documents,
particularly the EGPRS and the “Education for All National Action Plan,” but also the Moldova Village
Program, and the Neighborhood Action Plan for European Integration; it also linked the overall plan for the
sector to the costing of the MTEF.

The subsequent Additional Financing (AF) supported activities consistent with the
Project Development Objective (PDO) and the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)
FY09-13.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

5. The original PDO was to increase the quality of education in rural areas of Moldova.
The Project included two key outcome indicators: (i) an increase in the average learning
achievement of students in rural schools; and (ii) a reduction in the gap in average
achievement between rural and urban schools.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators

6. The PDO underwent an editorial change at the time of approval of the AF to ensure
its consistency with the Project’s legal documents. The revised PDO was as follows:
“The objective of the Project is to assist the Recipient in improving the quality of
education in the rural areas in Moldova.” This change was strictly editorial and of no bearing
to the Project’s objectives, thus the ICR uses the revised PDO to assess the project.

7. The key indicators were revised twice during the Project: first in April 2008, when
baseline data became available; and again at the time of the AF. In 2008, the outcome
indicators and targets were modified as follows: (i) Improving learning in schools from
rural areas (Revised target: increasing the overall average and subject’s examinations
averages by 5 percent instead of the original 8 percent from the 2005/2006 baseline); (ii)
Difference in average results of secondary school students from rural and urban area is
decreasing (Revised target: Reduction of the average discrepancy in the exams for
students from rural and urban areas at least 2 percent a year (6 percent cumulative)). At
the time of AF on March 20, 2012, the change to the baseline of the first outcome
indicator from 2005/2006 to 2010/2011 was formally made due to overhaul of the
Baccalaureate exam system in Moldova (Revised target: Increasing the overall average
and subject’s examinations averages from the baseline of 2010/2011).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

8. The Project focused on rural areas and its direct beneficiaries encompass the upper
secondary students in rural areas of Moldova, as well as rural teachers and school
directors as well as central and local education and finance authorities. At the same time,
the Project had positive repercussions for beneficiaries in both rural and urban areas.


1.5 Original Components

9. The original Project consisted of four components: (i) Improving Teaching and
Learning in Rural Schools; (ii) Increasing Access and Equity in Rural Schools; (iii)
Increasing Efficiency in the Use of Resources; and (iv) Strengthening Education Planning
and Monitoring.



                                                 3
10. Component 1: Improving Teaching and Learning in Rural Schools (US$2.86
million). The principal objective of this component was to improve the quality and
relevance of teaching and learning in rural schools, in particular for the upper grades of
the secondary education level (grades 10-12). This was meant to be achieved by
strengthening the MoEd’s three core pedagogical systems: curriculum (upgrading and
modernizing the curriculum and providing new educational materials and textbooks),
teaching (professional development for teachers and staff in the structure and content of
the new curriculum), and evaluation (objective, professional, and efficient evaluation,
monitoring, and student assessment). This component encompassed three
subcomponents: (i) Modernizing the Curriculum for Grades 10-12; (ii) Teacher
Professional Development for Grades 10-12; and (iii) Establishment of National Centre
for Examinations and Quality Assurance under the MoEd.

11. Component 2. Increasing Access and Equity in Rural Schools (US$5.15 million).
The main objective of this component was to provide poor rural schools and communities
with additional resources to improve the quality of and access to adequate education
services. Another objective was to strengthen the capacity of schools to manage
priorities, resources, and educational outcomes. These objectives were to be
accomplished by providing additional resources to eligible schools, which in turn were
required to manage them (including the needs identification and prioritization of a
resource allocation strategy) in a transparent and efficient manner and to be accountable
for results. This component comprised two subcomponents: (i) Rural Schools Equity
Grants; and (iii) Rural Schools Quality Grants.

12. Component 3. Increasing Efficiency in the Use of Resources (US$1.96 million).
The main objective of this component was to improve the efficiency of the system for
allocating public money to schools and the use of resources within schools, in the context
of the projected demographic trends (school-age population, class sizes, and student-staff
ratios were falling and were expected to continue to decline). The component sought to
build on the existing formula-based funding approach, with emphasis on using the signals
that it generates to trigger policy action. This component was subdivided into three
subcomponents: (i) Education Budgeting Improvement; (ii) Formula Funding and School
Autonomy Pilots; and (iii) Grants for the Optimization of School Networks in Selected
Rayons.

13. Component 4. Strengthening Education Planning and Monitoring (US$0.40
million). The main objective of this component was to build capacity at the MoEd to
better manage the education system by strengthening its capacity to promote and monitor
programs. The component’s objective was meant to be met through: (i) development of
human resources of the education sector in policy and monitoring at the ministerial level;
and (ii) improvement in education management and administration at the rayon level (i.e.,
rayon education administration departments). This component encompassed two
subcomponents: (i) Policy and Monitoring Development; and (ii) Rayon Education
Administration Improvement.

1.6 Revised Components

14. The original components were not modified during Project implementation. The AF
supported additional technical assistance to facilitate reform efforts, as listed below:

      Component 1 “Improving Teaching and Learning”: development of standards for
       receiving schools; 2 continued support for Moldova’s capacity to participate in
       international assessments; and a strengthened ability to monitor the quality of
       education through support to the Examination Agency.

      Component 3 “Increasing Efficiency in the Use of Resources”: capacity building and
       training to education personnel at all levels for implementation of formula-based
       financing and school optimization; and capacity building for strengthening the school
       mapping database.

      Component 4 “Strengthening Education Planning and Monitoring”: continued support
       to public relations (PR) activities to support the implementation of the school reform
       program.

1.7 Other Significant Changes

15. Revised Results Framework. The Results Framework (RF) underwent revisions
during implementation: (i) In 2008, the RF was revised to reflect recently collected
baseline data; (ii) intermediate indicators were revised during the October 2009 MTR;
and (iii) at the time of the AF approval. In 2008 targets for outcome and output indicators
were modified based on the baseline data obtained. Also, two output indicators were
dropped: (i) improvement of test scores as measured by annual examinations at grades 4,
9, and 12, as they were not independently conducted assessments; and (ii) expenditure on
quality-related line items as a percent of total school expenditure, due to the lack of data
at the time. Two additional indicators related to new curriculum programs were also
added.

16. The key intermediate outcome indicators were again revised during the MTR
conducted in October 2009. In retrospect, while these modifications were appropriate,
one of the intermediate indicators dropped during the MTR -- the empirical evaluation of
teaching and learning on samples of 8th and 10th grade students -- could have been a good
alternative for measuring Project outcomes. Finally, the MTR introduced third-party
evaluations with a view to more completely evaluating outcomes (which were
subsequently implemented, as shown in Annex 2). A final revision to the RF occurred
with the approval of the AF in March 2012. Specifically, the baseline for the indicator
“Improved learning in rural schools, as measured by average achievement scores in
Baccalaureate examinations” was changed to account for modifications in the exam’s



2
    Schools that receive students from closed or reorganized schools.



                                                       5
methodology; and (ii) there was an increase in the end of Project target for the
intermediate indicator “Implementing formula based funding in two pilot rayons.”

17. Extension of the closing date. The Project was originally designed to be
implemented over a four-year period but ended up having cumulative extensions adding
to 42 months: (i) in May 2010, the Bank agreed with a 24-month extension until May 30,
2012, to make up for initial implementation delays; (ii) in March 2012, as part of the AF,
the Board approved an 18-month extension, with a new closing date of November 30,
2013, to implement the additional activities; and (iii) in May 2012, the Project was
extended by five months to allow time for the AF to become effective.

18. Additional Financing. The GoM requested the AF in the amount of US$1 million
equivalent for technical assistance to scale up the activities initiated under the Project and
to support implementation of its Structural Reform Program in the education sector, as
well as to help avoid a financing gap between the Project and a follow-up operation. The
GoM also asked for an 18-month extension of the closing date of the Project to
accommodate the AF. The AF was approved by the Board on March 20, 2012.

19. Partial cancellation of the Additional Credit. Following the request from the
Borrower dated November 28, 2013, the Bank partially cancelled US$180,000 equivalent
from the Additional Credit (IDA-50800).


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

20. Soundness of background analysis. The Project was designed taking into
consideration findings and recommendations obtained from analytical work conducted as
part of Project preparation, earlier Bank and OECD work reviewing the Moldova
education system, a series of studies financed by a Japan Policy and Human Resources
Development Fund (PHRD) grant, and lessons learned from the implementation of the
Moldova General Education Project. A social assessment was conducted as part of
Project preparation, capturing the opinions and recommendations of teachers, school
principals, and representatives of rayon education departments. There were also
consultations with Moldovan decision makers, civil society, and donor partners to assess
their commitment to improving the governance of service delivery through increased
support of bottom-up approaches.

21. Risk assessment. The risks were appropriately identified and rated and adequate
mitigation measures were put in place.

22. Results framework. The RF for the Project was weak on several fronts: (i) it had
disconnect and attribution problems; (ii) it did not allow depiction of key important
development outcomes achieved by the Project (e.g., improved efficiency of the
education sector was not captured by the PDO-level indicators or the PDO itself); (iii) it


                                              6
focused on narrowing down the performance gap between urban and rural areas although
the Project contributed in significant ways to improving the quality of teaching and
learning in Moldova as a whole, with positive repercussions well beyond rural areas; and
(iv) it relied on only two outcome indicators, both derived from the Baccalaureate exam
results (which has attribution, measurement and timing problems) as further discussed in
section 3.2.

2.2 Implementation

23. Overall, the Project was implemented in a satisfactory way, with the interventions
related to improving efficiency having a much broader scope and impact than was
originally anticipated.

24. Major factors affecting implementation. Key factors that affected Project
implementation encompass:
i. Factors outside the control of government:
 A significant period of political uncertainty. Project preparation and implementation
     cycles transcended four elected Parliaments, with a significant period of political
     uncertainty in 2009-2010 that affected the work of the government and the pace of
     reforms in the sector. There were also five Ministers of Education and five Executive
     Directors during Project implementation, which caused delays in implementation of
     some Project components, notably prior to the MTR.
ii. Factors generally subject to government control:
 Mounting fiscal pressures, particularly during the financial crisis of 2009.
     Government spending on education in 2009 reached 9.4 percent of GDP, way above
     the regional average of around 5 percent, putting the efficiency reforms in the
     education sector among the most urgent priorities for the country (and thus entailing
     a larger scope of work under Component 3, which supported “Increasing Efficiency
     in the Use of Resources”). Also, under these circumstances, the MTEF for the MoEd
     required a decreasing budget, and as a result prioritization of the education programs
     was challenging but the Government tackled it.
iii. Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
 A very wide and politically sensitive agenda for the MoEd to tackle. Enhancing the
     quality of education and strengthening the Baccalaureate exam system was
     conducted in a time of tight fiscal pressures and politically sensitive school network
     consolidation reforms.
 SDR to USD exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a higher actual amount of credit
     proceeds than originally planned in USD. This enabled procurement of school buses
     for transport of students in rural areas (to hub schools from closed or reorganized
     schools), an activity not originally envisaged under the Project.

25. Albeit with some delays, the government implemented politically and socially
sensitive education reforms, including application of a per-student financing mechanism
nationwide, substantial rationalization of the school network, and an overhaul of the
Baccalaureate exam system. The GoM’s program and its objectives were both visionary
and very much in line with the sector’s needs. In this sense, the Project’s support was



                                            7
critical in helping maintain the momentum for the reform program and in continuing to
provide the GoM with strategically placed technical assistance.

26. Mid-Term Review. An MTR was conducted in October 2009, around eight months
before the Project’s original closing date. The DO and IP ratings at the time were
Moderately Satisfactory. As mentioned above, as a result of political turmoil, there were
delays in the implementation of some Project components prior to the MTR. After that,
however, implementation remained steady for the last four years of the Project.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

27. Design. The Project’s M&E design was weak. The RF had disconnect and attribution
problems. It did not fully convey the development hypothesis implicit in the Project or
the cause and effect linkages between the intermediate results and the PDO. Thus, many
Project achievements were not captured, including better efficiency of the education
sector and creation of an improved learning environment in both urban and rural areas.
Indeed, a significant part of the Project’s interventions, including Component 3
“Increasing Efficiency in the Use of Resources” (which accounted for 43 percent of
actual Project costs), was not reflected in the outcome indicators. While most of the
Project-supported interventions had national coverage, the PDO focused only on rural
areas.

28. At the time of Project design and later during the preparation of the AF, the Bank's
team opted to use Baccalaureate exam results as a proxy for the achievement of the PDO.
In hindsight, this decision proved to be wrong on many fronts. Student assessment results
are not a reliable indicator to assess this type of project, as there are generally attribution,
measurement, and timing problems associated with this indicator. In terms of attribution,
the ICR team is of the opinion that the PDO should have been defined in more
constrained terms, referring to beneficiaries’ schools only and comparing the envisaged
changes with a control group of comparable non-beneficiary schools. As to the
measurement issue, Baccalaureate exams are not designed to measure quality
improvements, but rather provide a gateway to university entrance. Further, in the case of
Moldova, this decision proved to be even less adequate as, on one hand, the MoEd
changed the exam's application methodology during Project implementation and, on the
other hand, introduced a new curriculum into the classroom without reflecting this
change in the Baccalaureate exam. The timing issues associated with this indicator
include, for example, the fact that the exam results for the school year 2010/11
(conducted in May-June 2011) were made available in a national report only around
October-November 2011.

29. Implementation. In line with M&E design, Results Framework and the
Arrangements for Results Monitoring of the Project presented in Annex 3 of the QERM
PAD were used by the MoEd to monitor the Project implementation. The heads of the
MoEd technical departments and rayon staff routinely reported on
components/subcomponents progress, outputs and implementation shortcomings, and
Bank supervision visits used these tables to review the progress with the project



                                               8
implementation. At the same time, information on the key outcome indicators was not
accurately and timely reported to the Bank by the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) of
the MoEd preventing the Bank team from revising the outcome indicators for the project
during four restructurings. The preliminary data from Bacca 2011/2012 made available at
the time of ISR 16 resulted in the downgrade of the DO rating from Satisfactory to
Moderately Unsatisfactory as the Bank team found many inaccuracies in the data (this
was the first set of data following the new baseline of Bacca 2010/2011 established at the
time of AF). In January 2013 the MoEd finally informed the Bank that it had changed the
exams application methodology and resubmitted the exam results. Even then, the MoEd
subsequently submitted revised results to the Bank as there have been still issues with
data accuracy.

30. Utilization. The M&E framework served as a good basis for monitoring progress on
activities and output indicators. At the time of approval of the Additional Credit, the
Bank team was informed of the changes introduced by the MoEd to the Baccalaureate
exam in 2010/2011 and revised the baseline for the PDO indicator accordingly. However,
in 2011/2012 and 2012/2013, the MoEd continued “fine-tuning” the exam and
application methodology without informing the Bank in a timely manner. For example,
the MoEd submitted explanations of the changes to the Baccalaureate exam application
methodology for the 2011/2012 school year only in January 2013 (less than 11 months
before Project closing). A similar situation occurred in the subsequent year (2012/2013),
and clarifications were provided to the Bank in October 2013, one month before Project
closing. This did not provide sufficient time to revise the outcome indicators or to design
and implement an alternative and sound ex-post evaluation.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

31. Safeguards. The QERM Project did not trigger any safeguards.

32. Procurement. Procurement ratings oscillated between Satisfactory and Moderately
Satisfactory. Lower ratings were given in the first years of implementation since the
MoEd lacked procurement capacity and a general understanding of procurement
procedures. Procurement post-reviews found that procurement processes were generally
reliable, timely, and transparent, with some corrective actions requested by the Bank
related to the evaluation of candidates. Procurement aspects were generally addressed in
a timely and qualitative manner.

33. One of the major procurement activities under the Project was procurement of 35
school buses to provide a means of transport to students in rural areas of Moldova. The
purchase of buses was completed in January 2012. The procurement followed
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures. Shortly after the buses started
operating, the Minister of Education received several complaints from rayons and schools
about bus suppliers’ alleged non-compliance with their contractual obligations. The
MoEd also raised issues related to the high prices of the buses. In response to the
concerns raised, the Bank conducted an audit on buses in November 2012. The audit led
by transportation and procurement specialists, included a review of the technical and



                                            9
procurement aspects of the process. A transport specialist visited two rayons, reviewed
the technical conditions and maintenance of the buses, and verified the degree of
compliance of the bus supplier with the conditions of the supply contracts. The team also
reviewed general operating conditions and itineraries of the buses in the two rayons. The
audit concluded that all buses inspected were in good condition and technically sound,
and met all the requirements of the technical specifications of the contracts. The Bank
also found that the supplier met the conditions of the contracts in terms of warranty
obligations. Technical problems had been resolved with reasonable delays. Further, the
audit concluded that the poor quality of roads was causing problems in the buses.

34. The procurement review concluded that the ICB procedure was carried out according
to Bank guidelines and the contract was awarded to the lowest evaluated compliant
bidder in accordance with the requirements and evaluation criteria of the Bidding
Documents. The issue of overpricing was also dismissed as, in addition to the price of the
buses, the contract price included the required additional services such as transportation,
insurance, training for drivers, and three years’ warranty, as provided by specific contract
clauses.

35. Financial Management. Generally, financial management arrangements were
satisfactory throughout the Project implementation. Yet using country systems for
financial management created some challenges at the beginning. All problems were
eventually overcome, resulting in efficient disbursement of IDA credit funds. Quarterly
interim financial management reports were submitted on time and according to a format
agreed with the Bank; such reports were always found acceptable. Annual audit reports
were submitted in a timely manner and with an unqualified audit opinion. In addition to
the audit of Project financial statements, Project auditors were required to review the
existence and condition of assets purchased out of Project funds, especially the assets
procured for rural schools. Initially, there were some deficiencies noted in storage,
maintenance and accounting of the assets, which were eliminated later on.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

36. Improving the quality, relevance, and efficiency of the education system continues to
be one of Moldova’s main priorities, as strong and robust economic growth and
development will necessarily have to rely on the country’s human capital. To support the
government’s priorities, a follow-up operation financed by IDA, the Moldova Education
Reform Program, was approved by the Board in early 2013. It will continue supporting
key activities initiated or implemented under the QERM Project, including: the
development of a student-level Education Management Information System (EMIS) for
primary and secondary education; (ii) continued participation in the Program for
International Student Assessment (PISA) to monitor quality improvements; (iii) hub
school upgrades based on some of the quality assurance standards developed under the
QERM operation; and (iv) implementation of efficiency measures such as aligning class
sizes with commonly accepted international standards, adjusting the size of the existing
school network and reallocating students to “receiving” schools, and continued
implementation of per-student financing nationwide.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation
Rating: Substantial

37. The Project was highly relevant at the time it was designed and remains equally
relevant today, pertinent to the country’s development priority to provide schooling
aligned with labor market needs and those of the broader economy, as stated in the
Moldova 2020 National Development Strategy. Quality-enhancing policies substantiated
by efficient financing in the education sector were vital to the advancement of the sector
and in accordance with national priorities. Likewise, Project objectives were consistent
with the CAS FY05-08, and the Project’s focus on improving the quality of primary and
secondary education in rural areas was also fully aligned with the Bank’s Education
Strategy and its three pillars of investing early, investing smartly, and investing for all. At
the time of closing, Project relevance remained high in terms of country priorities and its
activities with respect to strengthening the quality of education and enhancing the
efficiency and management of Moldova’s education system. The Project also remained
consistent with the Country Partnership Strategy FY09-13. Therefore, the relevance of
objectives of the Project is rated as High.

38. Relevance of project design and implementation is rated Modest as: (i) component 1
of the project was not ‘rural focused’ despite the PDO: it tackled curriculum reform,
teacher development, and textbook provision for grades 10-12 (textbooks for grade 12
only); (ii) equity and quality grants under component 2 activities were too small and
incongruously targeted to provide poor rural schools with additional resources to improve
quality of and access to adequate education services; and (iii) lack of proper coordination
with the QAA in the course of project implementation had a detrimental impact on the
Project’s final rating.

39. The overall Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation is rated
Substantial, reflecting High rating for relevance of objectives and Modest rating for
relevance of design and implementation.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Efficacy Rating: Modest

40. The project was transformational on a number of fronts as shown below.

41. Component 1. Improving Teaching and Learning in Rural Schools. New
standards for secondary education were developed and approved and the curriculum was
upgraded in line with these standards. Based on existing data and the beneficiaries’
assessment, there is strong awareness of the new and improved curriculum in place for
upper secondary education, albeit further reform is needed to make it more focused on
the development of core skills and competencies like problem solving or communication
skills. The Project made a significant contribution by publishing 17 curriculum guides to
assist teachers to improve teaching and learning in classrooms using the revised



                                              11
curriculum. Anecdotal evidence gathered during the field visits (as reported in the MTR
aide memoire) suggests that these guides are highly valued by teachers. Also, the new
textbooks for grade 12 in mathematics, physics and astronomy, chemistry and biology
were published and widely distributed (to all rural and urban lyceums in the country –
28,500 textbooks for each subject, 21,000 in Romanian language and 7,500 in Russian).
All teachers for grades 10-12 in 10 selected rayons received training. In April 2007, over
8,000 teachers were trained on the curriculum introduced in 2006. In addition, in
November 2008, the MoEd (outside of Project finds) through the Institute of Education
Sciences trained almost 400 trainers (one per rural lyceum), who then trained over 16,000
teachers and administrators on the general teaching methodology. According to the
results of the MTR, the MoEd evaluated both training sessions and found them to be
successful. In summary, it is notable that in terms of the number of teachers trained, the
target was exceeded.

42. The Quality Assurance Agency was established and institutionalized within the
MoEd, and the Project contributed to its capacity building through various training
programs for its staff. The members of the QAA also benefitted from a number of
international study trips. The QAA led Moldova’s participation in the TIMSS 2007 3 and
the PISA 2009 Plus international assessment of student learning, which was successfully
implemented and the results have been widely disseminated and discussed).4 Results of
PISA 2009 Plus became available only in 2012 and thus the MoEd decided not to
participate in PISA 2012 assessment which would have given robust data on education
quality developments and student learning outcomes (including by urban/rural divide) in
the country. The QAA also worked on modernization and improvement of the
Baccalaureate exam system, including strengthening its integrity. As a result, it is now
considered as a credible instrument and is driving students to study harder (see Annex 5
for beneficiaries’ assessment results). Under the AF, the Project continued to support the
MoEd to participate in international assessments (e.g., preparations to participate in the
PISA 2015 assessment, to which Moldova subscribed) and to strengthen the MoEd’s
ability to monitor the quality of education through support to the QAA (for design and
analysis of the tests, and maintenance of the ADPS database of Moldovan students’
Baccalaureate exam results).

43. Also under the AF, quality assurance standards for schools were developed and will
serve as the basis for school upgrades under the follow-up Moldova Education Reform
Project. Overall, by Project completion, upper secondary education students and teachers
had benefited from: a revised curriculum in all 17 subject areas; training on the new
curriculum and new curriculum guidelines; and textbooks distributed to all 12th grade
students in math, physics, biology, and chemistry (mostly in rural areas). At the same
time, the Ministry's QAA continued to improve the Baccalaureate exam, and Moldova
joined and completed the PISA 2009 Plus assessment, publicly disclosing its results.


3
  Although the results were not acceptable to the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational
Achievement – IEA.
4
  Even though Moldova’s PISA results were quite poor compared to OECD and regional comparators.



                                                     12
Likewise, 4th and 9th grade national assessments are now carried out annually, and there
are ongoing efforts to improve the quality and reliability of those tests. By financing the
above inputs, teaching and learning conditions have improved in schools, mostly in rural
schools but also in urban ones. At the same time, it is not possible for the team to
determine whether these improved conditions translated into better learning. Although
the reliability of the Baccalaureate exam results today is believed to be better than in
2006, it is not possible to derive any trend from this, much less attribute it to the Project.

44. Component 2. Increasing Access and Equity in Rural Schools. At appraisal,
about 1,100 schools were expected to benefit; early ISRs set that target at 1,176. The
Project surpassed targets for the number of schools that received equity and quality grants.
At Project completion, 1,190 equity grants and 304 quality grants had been awarded to
rural schools 5 . Rural schools, more poorly equipped compared to urban ones, were
provided through equity grants with additional resources (learning materials such as maps,
geometry triangles, dictionaries and other books, sports equipment, and other supplies).
The MoEd developed criteria for selection of schools and reviewed school proposals
jointly with rayon authorities. As a result of this process, only qualified schools with the
capacity to use these grants received them. The quality grants were also awarded on a
competitive basis and focused on improving conditions in chemistry, biology, and
physics school labs by providing equipment and supplies (like visual aids, equipment and
materials for experiments and so on, as well as a computer with a projector). An
evaluation of this component conducted in 2010 found that the majority of principals,
teachers, and students felt that the grants had improved conditions in their schools (see
Annex 2 for details).

45. Also, the results of the social assessment of beneficiaries’ perceptions of the
education changes, conducted as part of the ICR preparation, showed that both students
and teachers in rural areas consider that, as a result of the endowment of educational
institutions with equipment and training of teaching staff, the level of mastering of school
subjects by students has increased and students’ skills and competences improved
(including logical, analytical, and critical thinking). Equipment procured through equity
grants included school lab equipment, projectors, computers, etc. These materials are
used widely and are seen to contribute to student learning. The effect looked more
prominent in smaller schools in rural areas (important as the most vulnerable groups at
risk of poverty in Moldova remain those with low education levels and those in rural
areas). Lessons became more interactive and encouraged participative learning. Most
teachers underlined that the curriculum guides (developed and distributed in the
framework of the Project) provided new opportunities to teaching staff in enhancing their
pedagogical competences and served as an important support in designing and
conducting lessons and evaluating learning results (see Annex 5 for beneficiaries’
assessment results).




5
    4 schools of national subordination out of 304 under quality grants were urban.



                                                       13
46. In addition, during the ICR mission in October 2013, the team had the opportunity to
visit schools that had benefited from the equity and quality grants, and confirmed that in
most cases these materials had been the only ones received since Moldova’s
independence in 1991. The team’s perception is that the equipment was much more
relevant and of greater potential impact in smaller schools, which typically do not have
any other resources (e.g., parent-teacher associations) to draw upon. At the same time,
according to teachers, there is still a lack of school lab equipment, understandable given
the one-time quality/equity grant interventions under the Project. Teachers also reported
issues with the quality and durability of biology and chemistry lab equipment.

47. Component 3. Increasing Efficiency in the Use of Resources. This component
surpassed its original objective as it not only supported the establishment of a more
efficient budget allocation system, but also set the stage for broader education reforms,
including a national school rationalization program that has already impacted the
efficiency of resource allocation and created fiscal space for quality improvements (see
outputs by component in Annex 2 and the economic and financial analysis section
presented in Annex 3). Per-student based financing of schools ended up being
implemented nationwide after it was successfully piloted in two rayons. School
rationalization has already led to an adjustment in the school network, including halting
the inefficient pulverization of resources across schools that are too small to function
efficiently and with acceptable quality. Overall, the average class size in the country grew
from 19.0 in the 2010 school year to 20.2 in 2013. In the same period, the student-teacher
ratio for grades 1-12 showed a positive trend, increasing from 10.5:1 to 11.0:1.

48. A competent team of highly experienced local consultants of the MoEd (that had
been working on the formula-based funding) worked closely with the Ministry of Finance
(MoF), the Treasury, rayon authorities, and school principals and accountants on the
development of school budgets – initially for pilot rayons and eventually for all primary
and secondary schools in Moldova. The team conducted multiple seminars involving
central and local education and finance authorities to train them on the new financing
methodology and school budget preparation. Also, a national feasibility study of the
optimization of the school network was prepared based on the school mapping exercise,
and served as the basis for development of the Structural Reform Program in the
education sector approved by the GoM in 2011. In addition, numerous discussions,
conferences, and other events were conducted with the participation of the government,
Parliament, rayon authorities, communities, school management, teachers, parents,
students, and mass media all over the country to raise support for the much needed but
politically sensitive school network optimization reform.

49. Under per-student based financing mechanism the schools were also granted the
right to allocate resources in line with their needs and priorities. An assessment of school
directors’ job satisfaction and sense of empowerment as a result of these changes showed
noticeable positive differences for schools in those rayons that switched to per-student
financing (pilots at the time) including in terms of improved transparency of budget
allocations, school autonomy, incentives for efficiency and education quality (details are
available in the Annex 2). Also, to support the school optimization reform, in particular



                                            14
transportation of students from optimized to merged schools in rural areas, the Project
procured 35 school buses that were delivered in 2010-2012 (10 to the first two pilot
rayons and the rest to those subsequently joining the pilot).

50. Component 4. Strengthening Education Planning and Monitoring. At appraisal,
the critical institutional shortcoming of the MoEd was emphasized. The MoEd had seen a
significant number of staff leave and had little capacity to carry out its strategic mandate.
The staff of the MoEd Department for Information Technologies was complemented with
consultants to accelerate the institutional capacity building and development of the
Education Management Information System (EMIS), intended to better monitor the
development and performance of the education sector. The MoEd had several
restructurings during the course of the Project, which led to creation of the Analysis,
Monitoring, and Policy Evaluation Department. Its specialists, together with other
ministry specialists responsible for policy development and heads of directorates (overall
20 participants), received training on: (i) educational policies, development, and
implementation; and (ii) techniques for developing education policy documents. In
addition, 70 rayon-level staff received training in administration and educational
management. Also, a PR strategy was developed and conducted to support the education
reform program. Continued support to PR activities was also provided under the AF to
the Project.

51. The project also supported training activities for rayon administrators at the local
level. Rayons are a critical element in monitoring the education system’s performance.
Training was provided in the areas of education administration, education management,
and data and information management in support of the national program. Overall, 94
rayon-level staff received training in ICT in education, meeting the target for this activity.
Activities planned under this component were completed and training targets for both
components were met. Together with the AF, the Project supported: (i) design of an
EMIS; (ii) training of central and rayon-level staff on formula-based funding, policy
making, and ICT-related matters; (iii) creation and strengthening of the Ministry's QAA
to prepare, conduct, and analyze student assessments; (iv) Moldova's participation in the
PISA 2009 Plus international assessment; and (v) dissemination of education information
to stakeholders, such as the results of the PISA 2009 Plus and Baccalaureate exam results.
On a less positive note, while the MoEd’s institutional capacity is probably better today
than in 2006, it remains relatively weak and concentrated among a small group. That is
partially due to the difficulty in attracting qualified professionals into public service in
Moldova, a situation not unique to the education sector. The EMIS was developed and
data entry was conducted in November-December 2013 (the work is continued under the
follow-up Moldova Education Reform Project). At the same time, its sustainability will
depend on the political will of the Ministry's leadership to support it, use it for policy
making, and allocate proper resources for its regular update and maintenance.

52. Notwithstanding the positive findings, neither the Board-approved outcome
indicators nor additional information and evidence collected during the preparation of
this ICR are conclusive to support a rating above Modest.




                                             15
3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Substantial

53. The Project was efficient on a number of fronts. The economic analysis confirms that
the Project’s investments of US$12.09 million in 2006-2013 were well justified and the
interventions brought benefits and savings far exceeding the Project’s initial costs. The
most substantial benefits of the Project are the gains in sector efficiency that surpassed
the Project's original objectives. Per-student based financing of schools ended up being
implemented nationwide after it was successfully piloted in selected rayons and
municipalities. School rationalization has already led to an adjustment of the school
network. From the 2009/10 to the 2013/14 school year, 131 schools were closed,
representing 9 percent of the total. Maintaining these schools in 2013 alone would have
required government spending of US$26 million, or an additional 5 percent of total
education sector spending. In addition, through consolidation of the school network and
an increase in average class and school sizes, existing capacities are used more efficiently,
freeing up resources for quality-enhancing inputs. Also, as a result of per-capita financing,
schools are now able to reallocate resources according to their needs, allowing schools to
spend resources according to their priorities.

54. At the same time, the Project costs of US$12.09 million are relatively small –
equivalent to less than 1 percent of public expenditure on primary and secondary
education over the eight-year period 2006-2013. The economic analysis at appraisal took
the framework of a traditional cost-benefit analysis, though no estimates of the net
present value (NPV) were made at that time. Given the high uncertainty associated with
predicting the labor market outcomes of individuals and linking those outcomes to
investments made today, the cost-benefit analysis at the ICR stage focused on the benefits
of the Project associated with the fiscal savings from the efficiency measures targeted
under Component 3. The NPV of the savings was calculated based on a discount rate of
10 percent and covered the period of 10 years from Project completion (2013-2033).
Under these assumptions, the savings from the school consolidation alone amount to
about US$154.6 million in NPV terms, equivalent to 29.6 percent of Moldova’s
education budget in 2013.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

55. Project relevance was substantial at its design and remains so today. Likewise,
Project interventions resulted in current and future gains in efficiency. Conceding the
shortcomings in the outcome indicators, alternative indicators are assessed on whether the
Project achieved its objective of assisting Moldova in improving the quality of education
in rural areas. That task presented two challenges. The first was to determine whether
there was any improvement in the quality of education in rural areas. The second was
establishing whether those improvements could be attributed to the Project. A key
difficulty in this process is that the overall quality of education data for Moldova is poor,
particularly data that would support measuring the Project's impact. Traditional education
indicators such as enrollment, repetition, and graduation and dropout rates, while



                                             16
important, speak little to the quality of education and are also problematic in Moldova.
Further, the country does not have a track record of continuous participation in
international assessments, which could show some trend in performance. Thus, Project-
financed inputs/activities that have contributed to improvements in education quality are
identified. A social assessment of beneficiaries’ perceptions was conducted to gauge the
impact of the reforms introduced under the Project, and visited several rural schools to
“review” their conditions and to talk to teachers and directors about the use of school
grants. The key conclusions of the survey and of those visits are that teaching conditions
improved in the schools surveyed, particularly in terms of the availability of teaching and
learning materials. Despite the additional information and evidence collected, it was not
possible to substantiate whether the Project contributed to improving education quality in
rural areas. As such, the overall outcome of this Project is rated as Moderately
Unsatisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

56. The project focused on most vulnerable groups at risk of poverty in Moldova (those
with low education levels and those in rural areas). Gender gaps in upper secondary
education are found to be negligible.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

57. One major institutional accomplishment of the Project was the establishment and
equipment of the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA), including: the development and
installation of an automated data processing system (ADPS) and training of relevant staff
in managing the Baccalaureate exam database; capacity building and training of QAA
personnel to conduct national and participate in international assessments; and
strengthening of the QAA’s ability to monitor the quality of education in Moldova. As
shown in the results of the beneficiaries’ assessment, strengthening the integrity of the
Baccalaureate exam system laid the groundwork for a more meritocratic way of
determining university admission and driving students to learn harder.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

58. The grant writing training received by schools carried over to other areas, which
allowed some schools to independently raise funds for school investments from other
sources. Also, as reported by several school principals, with the per-student based
funding, schools now recognize the need to improve the quality of the education they
offer to attract more students to their institutions.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

59. As part of the ICR preparation, a social assessment was conducted in early 2014 to
document beneficiaries’ perceptions of the overall project impact on the quality of
education in rural areas. Survey respondents perceived an improvement in the quality of



                                            17
rural schools in recent years and attributed to the project the following interventions: (i)
provided laboratory equipment and visual aids that helped students better understand
abstract scientific concepts; (ii) supported the development and training of teachers on a
new competence-based curriculum (which is more practical than the old curriculum, and
helped students improve their communication, team work, and learning skills); (iii)
enhanced school principals’ autonomy, allowing them to seek efficiency savings and
reallocate funding, including towards quality-enhancing investments; and (iv) helped
improve the quality and reliability of national student assessments that, together with the
measures on strengthening the integrity of the Baccalaureate exam system, laid the
groundwork for a more merit-based way of determining university admission and
increased students’ academic efforts. The general perceptions of trends in education
quality are positive over the time that the educators have been in their jobs (between 4
and 20 years).

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Low
60. The key project achievements have been institutionalized including Quality
Assurance Agency, curriculum for 10-12 grades, per-student based financing, autonomy
of schools in managing financial and largely human resources. It will be difficult to revert
these arrangements. For example, for the second year now the primary and secondary
education system operates nationwide under the new financing mechanism. The GoM is
unlikely to give up on this methodology and it will be difficult to take back the wider
decision making powers granted to schools. Of course, the elections pose threat to
optimization reform (school closures and reorganization and staff reduction) but
nevertheless, overall rating for Risk to development outcomes stands Low.

61. Also, a follow-up project financed by IDA –Education Reform Project (P127388)—
will continue providing support to the MoEd to ensure that school optimization is
accompanied by unwavering efforts to improve the quality of schools and of education in
general, so that stakeholders can benefit from it and support the changes. In particular, it
will work to ensure that: (i) the MoEd has the institutional tools it needs to continue
steering the education sector and measuring its achievements; (ii) a large number of
schools meet adequate operational standards; and (iii) teachers and principals receive
training and compensation commensurate with the roles expected of them. In addition,
Global Partnership for Social Accountability grant promotes the use of social
accountability tools in the education sector. Making stakeholders (students, parents,
teachers and communities in general) informed about their schools’ performance will
enable them to hold schools and teachers accountable for quality of education services
provided and use of resources (in particular, in the context of the ongoing education
reform and wider autonomy of schools in managing resources granted under the new per-
student based financing mechanism).

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
62. During Project preparation, the Bank: made sound technical analysis using findings
and recommendations from analytical work conducted as part of Project preparation and
lessons learned from the implementation of the completed Moldova General Education
Project; involved multiple stakeholders, capturing their opinions and recommendations
and reflecting these in project design; and correctly identified risks and mitigation
measures for the operation. At appraisal, the critical institutional shortcomings of the
MoEd were emphasized, including its low capacity to carry out its strategic mandate.
While this was acknowledged, the allocation to the MoEd team’s capacity building to
better manage the education system (supported by Component 4) was envisaged to be
only 4 percent of total Project costs. Also, weaknesses in the RF during Project
preparation (as described in sections 2.1 and 2.3), regrettably resulted in a Moderately
Unsatisfactory rating for the overall Project outcomes.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
63. Implementation was under the responsibility of five task team leaders (TTLs). There
was appropriate continuity in the reporting despite the transition in leadership. Bank
supervision took place on a regular basis, providing appropriate advice and observations
to counterparts. A local education staff regularly followed up on implementation.
Eighteen ISRs were prepared during the life of the Project, about one every six months,
except during the transfer period from one TTL to another, when the ISR update took 12
months. There were regular implementation support visits to Moldova, including
fiduciary supervisions. By and large, implementation support visits included the
appropriate skills mix to support and advise the government on areas targeted by the
Project. The findings of each supervision visit were conveyed to Bank management
clearly and in a candid fashion, including implementation shortcomings and potential
risks (for example, the situation with the Baccalaureate exam). Ratings were in line with
the situation described in the supervision reports. When the Bank team was informed of
the changes introduced by the MoEd to the Baccalaureate exam it revised the baseline for
the PDO indicator accordingly. However, the MoEd continued to make changes to the
Baccalaureate exam without timely informing the Bank. Importantly, all the flaws with
the PDO-level indicators were revealed very late in the process (11 months before project
closing) not providing sufficient time to revise the outcome indicators. However, given
the failure to revise them, the ICR rates the Bank’s supervision performance as
Moderately Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
64. The overall Bank performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory, accounting for the
final rating of the development objective.


                                           19
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
65. The Project preparation and implementation cycles transcended four elected
Parliaments, with a significant period of political uncertainty in 2009-2010. During this
period, Parliamentary elections were conducted in April 2009, July 2009, and November
2010, affecting the work of the government and the pace of reforms in the sector.
Nevertheless, although with some delays, the government implemented politically and
socially sensitive education reforms, including implementation of a per-student financing
mechanism nationwide and substantial rationalization of the school network.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
66. The MoEd completed all activities envisaged under the Project, albeit with initial
delays, and took important but politically challenging decisions in the process, including
leadership over school consolidation, piloting and subsequent implementation of a per-
student-based financing mechanism, and overhauling and strengthening the integrity of
the Baccalaureate exam system. There were five Ministers of Education and five
Executive Directors during Project implementation. The political uncertainties caused
delays in the implementation of some Project components prior to the MTR, but since
then the implementation remained steady for the past four years. Fiduciary performance
was also mostly satisfactory. The advice given and the actions agreed during the Bank
missions and reflected in the aide memoires were implemented.

67. The key shortcoming of the MoEd during implementation was its failure to inform
the Bank in a timely manner of the changes to the Baccalaureate exam, as well as the
results. Only in January 2013 did the MoEd submit the Baccalaureate exam results,
including: (i) corrected baseline data for the 2010/11 school year; and (ii) achieved scores
for the 2011/12 school year, with explanations on the changes to the methodology. Even
then, the MoEd subsequently submitted revised results to the Bank as the provided set
had many mistakes. Unfortunately, this shortcoming had significant implications for the
Project’s final rating.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
68. The overall Borrower performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory, reflecting the
Satisfactory rating of the government’s performance and the Moderately Satisfactory
rating of the implementing agency’s performance.

6. Lessons Learned

69. Project design must be based on a well-defined RF, allowing capturing key results
influenced by the project. The RF should convey the cause and effect linkages between
the intermediate results and the objective (avoiding a disconnect between the two), and


                                            20
should clearly depict the development hypothesis implicit in the project. For example,
while at appraisal it was acknowledged that the Project had several features contributing
in significant ways to improving the quality of teaching and learning in Moldova as a
whole, with positive repercussions well beyond rural areas, but this was not reflected in
the M&E framework. Instead, the RF focused on narrowing the performance gap between
urban and rural areas. In terms of quality improvements in rural areas, the PDO and
outcome indicators should have been defined in more constrained terms, referring to
beneficiary schools only and comparing the envisaged changes with a control group of
comparable non-benefitted schools.

70. Both top-down and bottom-up approaches are needed for the efficiency reforms to be
successful. The MoEd’s ownership was important to guide the policy agenda, while
increased autonomy granted to local stakeholders empowered them through greater
decision-making authority and the more flexible and predictable financing defined by a
transparent formula (in particular, decisions about managing staff and school budget,
including reallocation of funds across budget lines). The assessment of school directors’
sense of empowerment showed a number of noticeable positive differences between pilot
rayons (which switched to a per-student financing mechanism and received greater
autonomy in managing their budgets) and non-pilot rayons (see Annex 2). The
assessment showed that school autonomy provides a number of advantages as part of a
comprehensive strategy for school and education system improvements, including the
incentive to use funds more efficiently. In addition, school directors also believed that
school autonomy can have a positive impact on education quality.

71. Adequate resourcing for capacity-building activities is fundamental. The PAD
acknowledged the MoEd’s low capacity to carry out its strategic mandate due to the low
capacity of its staff. In addition, the risks section emphasized that the ambitious plan of
school network rationalization could impact the MoEd's capacity to implement the
Project. At the same time, an insufficiently low percentage of Project funds (only 4
percent) was allocated for building capacity of the Ministry of Education to better
manage the education system and to promote and monitor policies and programs. This
was partially addressed at the time of approval of the AF, which supported technical
assistance to the MoEd for implementation of the initiated reforms.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

75. Component 1. Improving Teaching and Learning in Rural Schools. The
principal objective of this component was to improve the quality and relevance of
teaching and learning in rural schools, in particular for the upper grades of secondary
education (grades 10-12). This was meant to be achieved by strengthening the MoEd’s
three core pedagogical systems: curriculum (upgrading and modernizing the curriculum
and providing new educational materials and textbooks), teaching (professional
development for teachers and staff in the structure and content of the new curriculum),
and evaluation (objective, professional, and efficient evaluation, monitoring, and student
assessment). This component encompassed three subcomponents: (i) Modernizing the
Curriculum for Grades 10-12; (ii) Teacher Professional Development for Grades 10-12;
and (iii) Establishment of National Centre for Examinations and Quality Assurance 6
under the MoEd.

76. Subcomponent 1.1. Modernizing the Curriculum for Grades 10-12. New
standards for secondary education were developed and approved and the curriculum was
upgraded in line with these standards. Based on existing data and the beneficiaries’
assessment, it is known that there is an improved curriculum in place for upper secondary
education, albeit further reform is needed to make it less heavy and more focused on the
development of core skills and competencies like problem solving or communication
skills. The Project made a significant contribution by publishing 17 curriculum guides to
assist teachers to improve teaching and learning in classrooms using the revised
curriculum. Anecdotal evidence gathered during the field visits (as reported in the MTR
aide memoire) suggests that these guides are highly valued by teachers. Also, the new
textbooks for grade 12 in mathematics, physics and astronomy, chemistry and biology
were published and widely distributed (to all rural and urban lyceums in the country –
28,500 textbooks for each subject, 21,000 in Romanian language and 7,500 in Russian).

77. Subcomponent 1.2. Teacher Professional Development for Grades 10-12. All
teachers for grades 10-12 in 10 selected rayons received training. In April 2007, over
8,000 teachers were trained on the curriculum introduced in 2006. In addition, in
November 2008, the MoEd (outside of Project finds) through the Institute of Education
Sciences trained almost 400 trainers (one per rural lyceum), who then trained over 16,000
teachers and administrators on the general teaching methodology. According to the
results of the MTR, the MoEd evaluated both training sessions and found them to be
successful. In summary, it is notable that in terms of the number of teachers trained, this
subcomponent’s target was exceeded.

78. Subcomponent 1.3. Establishment of National Centre for Examinations and
Quality Assurance under the MoEd. The Centre was established and institutionalized
within the MoEd, and the Project contributed to its capacity building through various
trainings of its staff. The members of the National Centre also benefitted from a number


6
    Currently the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA).



                                                    23
of international study trips. The Centre led Moldova’s participation in the TIMSS 20077
and the PISA 2009 Plus international assessment of student learning, which was
successfully implemented and the results have been widely disseminated and discussed).8
The Centre also worked on modernization and improvement of the Baccalaureate exam
system, including strengthening its integrity. Under the AF, the Project continued to
support the MoEd to participate in international assessments (e.g., preparations to
participate in the PISA 2015 assessment, to which Moldova subscribed) and to strengthen
the MoEd’s ability to monitor the quality of education through support to the QAA (for
design and analysis of the tests, and maintenance of the ADPS database of Moldovan
students’ Baccalaureate exam results).

79. Also under the AF, quality assurance standards for schools were developed and will
serve as the basis for school upgrades under the follow-up Moldova Education Reform
Project. Overall, by Project completion, upper secondary education students and teachers
had benefited from: a revised curriculum in all 17 subject areas; training on the new
curriculum and new curriculum guidelines; and textbooks distributed to all 12th grade
students in math, physics, biology, and chemistry (mostly in rural areas). At the same
time, the Ministry's QAA continued to improve the Baccalaureate exam, and Moldova
joined and completed the PISA 2009 Plus assessment, publicly disclosing its results.
Likewise, 4th and 9th grade national assessments are now carried out annually, and there
are ongoing efforts to improve the quality and reliability of those tests.

80. The ICR team assessment is that by financing the above inputs, teaching and
learning conditions have improved in schools, mostly in rural schools but also in urban
ones. At the same time, it is not possible for the team to determine whether these
improved conditions translated into better learning. Although the reliability of the
Baccalaureate exam results today is believed to be better than in 2006, it is not possible to
derive any trend from this, much less attribute it to the Project. At the same time, since
the Bank's team found no evidence of whether these improvements translated into better
teaching and learning in rural classrooms compared to urban ones, the achievements
under this component are rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

81. Component 2. Increasing Access and Equity in Rural Schools. The main
objective of this component was to provide poor rural schools and communities with
additional resources to improve the quality of and access to adequate education services.
Another objective was to strengthen schools’ capacity to manage priorities, resources,
and educational outcomes. These objectives were meant to be accomplished by providing
additional resources to eligible schools, which in turn were required to manage them
(including the needs identification and prioritization of resource allocation strategy) in a
transparent and efficient manner and to be accountable for results. This component

Achievement – IEA.

comprised two subcomponents: (i) Rural Schools Equity Grants; and (ii) Rural Schools
Quality Grants.

82. At appraisal, about 1,100 schools were expected to benefit; early ISRs set that target
at 1,176. The Project surpassed targets for the number of schools that received equity and
quality grants. At Project completion, 1,190 equity grants and 304 quality grants had been
awarded (i.e., schools receiving quality grants were also eligible for equity grants). The
equity grants were offered to gymnasiums, middle schools, and lyceums, and the quality
grants to lyceums. Grants were used for the purchase of educational inputs such as
science laboratories and teaching materials. The MoEd developed criteria for selection of
schools and reviewed school proposals jointly with rayon authorities. As a result of this
process, only qualified schools with the capacity to use these grants received them.

83. Subcomponent 2.1. Rural Schools Equity Grants. All schools satisfying the
eligibility criteria received a small grant of US$3,000-US3,500 per school based on the
size of their student population. Considering the relatively small size of the equity grants,
at appraisal schools were anticipated to and did select inexpensive learning materials such
as maps, geometry triangles, dictionaries and other books, sports equipment, and other
supplies. Rural schools which are more poorly equipped compared to urban ones were
thus equipped through equity grants with these additional resources 9 . The Project
provided 1,190 equity grants, surpassing its target of 1176 grants.

84. Subcomponent 2.2. Rural Schools Quality Grants. The quality grants were also
awarded on a competitive basis and focused on improving conditions in chemistry,
biology, and physics school labs by providing equipment and supplies (like visual aids,
equipment and materials for experiments and so on, as well as a computer with a
projector). The Project at appraisal set a target of 300 rural schools for quality grants. At
Project completion, 304 schools had received quality grants. Also, throughout Project
implementation, the schools received capacity-building training and assistance for quality
grant proposal preparation. It was found during the ICR field visits that the training
schools received in grant writing was useful and later allowed school managers to
independently raise funds for school investments from other sources.

85. An evaluation of this component was conducted in 2010.10The utilization and user
satisfaction assessment of the equipment purchased with the grants was considered

   Report on Sociological Study under the Project "Quality Education in Rural Areas of Moldova", Centre
for Sociological Research and Marketing 'CBS AXA', Chisinau 2010. At the first stage of the study,
interviewing covered: 168 school directors; 545 teachers from gymnasiums; 139 teachers of biology,
chemistry, and physics from secondary schools; 1,624 students studying in grades 8 and 9; and 471
students studying in grades 11 and 12. Sampling procedure for the equity and quality grant beneficiaries
was as follows: probabilistic, stratified, representative of institutions benefiting from the Project;
stratification criteria: the residence, administrative-territorial units, type of institution, beneficiaries from
both components or only the equity component; and random selection method. The sample size for equity
grants was 161 institutions (52 lyceums, 36 general middle schools, and 73 gymnasiums) and for quality

satisfactory. It found that the majority of principals, teachers, and students felt that the
grants had improved conditions in their schools. The quality grants, which provided
equipment and materials for school labs, made an especially positive impact on the
perceptions of those interviewed (Figure 1).

86. In general, equipping institutions with didactic materials and equipment was assessed
positively by teachers: around 76.6 percent of them stated they were satisfied with the
materials received. More teachers (83.8 percent) noted that the received equipment and
materials helped them when teaching new topics and 86.7 percent of teachers believed
that the equipment and new materials contributed to students’ better understanding of the
topics. However, 29.6 percent of teachers underlined the fact that they were dissatisfied
with the materials received, because some were not priority-driven for their discipline.
Chemistry teachers were the most dissatisfied (35.7 percent). Over 56 percent of teachers
agreed that the received didactic materials and equipment contributed to changing the
teaching methods of their discipline. Also, according to 80 percent of teachers, the
possibilities for realizing practical lessons increased (an opinion most popular among
physics teachers).

87. According to students, teachers who most often used11 the equipment and didactic
materials during lessons taught geography (71.7 percent), physical education (71.4
percent), mathematics (68.8 percent), physics (68.5 percent), and history (65.9 percent).
Teachers’ responses were somewhat different with regard to the frequency of use: three-
quarters (75 percent) of computer science teachers reported using the materials often or
very often, followed by teachers of chemistry (73.6 percent), history (73.1 percent), and
Romanian language and literature (73 percent). Teachers’ and students’ perceptions

directors; and 12 in-depth interviews with teachers.

88. Overall, the evaluation found that information about the QERM was known by 61.4
percent of teachers. Over 70 percent of teachers evaluated the selection process for
equipment and didactic materials as transparent and objective. The quality of the
equipment was assessed an average of 7.8 on a scale from 1 to 10 (where 1 means “very
poor quality” and 10 means “very good quality”). However, around 20 percent of the
teachers faced problems in using the new equipment. About one-third of the teachers
considered the main shortcoming of the grants to be the limited financial resources
provided to the institutions compared with the real needs of the school.

89. During the ICR mission in October 2013, the team had the opportunity to visit
schools that had benefited from the equity and quality grants, and confirmed that in most
cases these materials had been the only ones received since Moldova’s independence in
1991. The team’s perception is that the equipment was much more relevant and of greater
potential impact in smaller schools, which typically do not have any other resources (e.g.,
parent-teacher associations) to draw upon. At the same time, according to teachers, there
is still a lack of school lab equipment, understandable given the one-time quality/equity
grant interventions under the Project. Teachers also reported issues with the quality and
durability of biology and chemistry lab equipment (see Annex 5 for beneficiaries’
assessment results). As such, the final assessment of the component's performance is
Moderately Satisfactory.

90. Component 3. Increasing Efficiency in the Use of Resources. The main objective
of this component was to improve the efficiency of the system for allocating public
money to schools and of the use of resources within schools, in the context of the
projected demographic trends (school-age population, class sizes, and student-staff ratios
were falling and were expected to continue to decline). The component sought to build on
the existing formula-based funding approach, with emphasis on using the signals that it
generates to trigger policy action. This component was further subdivided into three
subcomponents: (i) Education Budgeting Improvement; (ii) Formula Funding and School


                                                            27
Autonomy Pilots; and (iii) Grants for the Optimization of School Networks in Selected
Rayons.

91. Subcomponent 3.1. Education Budgeting Improvement. A competent team of
highly experienced local consultants of the MoEd (that had been working on the formula-
based funding) also worked closely with the Ministry of Finance (MoF), the Treasury,
rayon authorities, and school principals and accountants on the development of school
budgets – first for two pilot rayons and later expanded to all primary and secondary
schools in Moldova. The team conducted multiple seminars involving central and local
education and finance authorities to train them on the new financing methodology and
school budget preparation. The subcomponent also included preparation of the detailed,
analysis-based Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) projections for the whole
education sector. While the MoEd jointly with the MoF developed the MTEF for various
periods (e.g., MTEF for 2009-2011), the decision at the MTR was to drop the activity of
development of the methodology for MTEF in education. The MTR mission
recommended that the MoEd restart this work with its own funds and personnel once the
country’s financial situation improves (after the financial crisis of 2009) and when there
is a need for MTEF budgeting. This is now the case and the MTEF for education is
implemented by the MoEd together with the MoF and other stakeholders.

92. Subcomponent 3.2. Formula Funding and School Autonomy Pilots. By May
2009, all required analytical work on simulation of the formula-based funding had been
conducted. Following some delays due to political uncertainties, the GoM in 2009
approved a resolution for piloting per-student based financing and a budget ceiling for
primary and secondary education. By Project completion, a new school funding formula
had been adopted and implemented, initially in two pilot rayons (Rîşcani and Căuşeni) in
2010. Nine additional rayons and two municipalities were added in 2012. The system was
rolled out nationwide in January 2013. The logic behind per-student formula-based
financing is simple: expanding the autonomy of school directors and allowing them to
manage their own budgets empowers local actors to make better informed decisions
related to their schools. Giving a predictable budget defined by a transparent formula to a
school’s management and allowing it to allocate resources in the manner it judges best
produces a more efficient outcome. At the same time, local actors should be held
accountable for the quality of service provision.

93. Indeed, formula-based financing offers a transparent mechanism for budget
allocation and creates positive and negative incentives for rayons to rationalize school
networks. Schools that were too small to remain open were forced to close and their
students transferred to neighboring schools. The schools were also granted the right to
allocate resources in line with their priorities. As a result, in spite of the tight fiscal
environment, primary and secondary schools in both pilot rayons found the fiscal space to
allocate resources for capital investments, fixed assets, and capital repairs, and for the
first time since 2006, they could afford capital spending above the country average.




                                            28
94. An assessment of school directors’ job satisfaction and sense of empowerment as a
result of these changes showed noticeable differences between the pilot and non-pilot
rayons.12 The assessment drew the following findings in each area of interest:
         Transparency of budget allocations: a larger share of school directors from pilot
        rayons knew their school budget in detail (95 percent compared to 83 percent in
        non-pilot rayons) and thought that resources in their rayons were allocated
        transparently (62 percent versus 38 percent);
         School autonomy: the majority of school directors in pilot rayons wished to have
        full autonomy, while in non-pilot rayons, administrators wanted subordination to
        rayon or municipal authorities;
         Sense of empowerment: the majority of school directors in pilot rayons thought
        that they (or their school boards) had considerable responsibility for deciding on
        budget allocations within the school and allocating funds for teachers’
        professional development, while in non-pilot rayons this responsibility was
        viewed as being held primarily in the mayor’s office;
         Incentives for efficiency: a larger share of directors in pilot rayons compared to
        non-pilot rayons thought that their current system of funding provided incentives
        to create bigger classes and to reduce the number of non-teaching staff;
         Job satisfaction: looking ahead, school directors in pilot rayons were slightly
        less optimistic about serving in their job than their non-pilot counterparts;13 and
         Education quality: the vast majority of school directors in pilot and non-pilot
        rayons believed that school autonomy can have a positive impact on education
        quality.

95. Since 2012, the GoM has expanded the pilots to an additional nine rayons and two
municipalities, and rolled out per-student financing nationwide in January 2013. It merits
stating that during the process of closing schools, the MoEd protected certain schools,
whenever alternative ones were not feasible or adequate for their students, to ensure that
the rationalization process did not result in student dropouts. Overall, the average class
size in the country grew from 19.0 in the 2010 school year to 20.2 in 2013. In the same
period, the student-teacher ratio for grades 1-12 showed a positive trend, increasing from
10.5:1 to 11.0:1.

96. Subcomponent 3.3. Grants for the Optimization of School Networks in Selected
Rayons. The piloting of per-student formula financing and optimization of the school
network initially took place in two rayons – Rîşcani and Căuşeni (rayons from different
regions of the country, with different demographic trends and school network
composition). In both rayons, optimization grant investment plans were developed and


12
     The assessment covered 241 participating school principals (72 from the pilot rayons of Rîşcani and
Căuşeni and 169 from the non-pilot rayons of Donduseni, Anenii Noi, Drochia, and Cimislia). Social
Impact Assessment of School Optimization Reforms in Moldova , Magenta Consulting, March 2011.
13
      This finding may be the result of the transition period and the need for more information materials and
training for school directors joining the new financing scheme —therefore, the follow-up Moldova
Education Reform Project supports an updated modern system for training school directors.



                                                    29
sent to the MoEd. To support the school optimization reform, in particular transportation
of students from optimized to merged schools in rural areas, the Project procured 35
school buses that were delivered in 2010-2012 (10 to the first two pilot rayons and the
rest to those subsequently joining the pilot). Also, a national feasibility study of the
optimization of the school network was prepared based on the school mapping exercise,
and served as the basis for development of the Structural Reform Program in the
education sector approved by the GoM in 2011. In addition, numerous discussions,
conferences, and other events were conducted with the participation of the government,
Parliament, rayon authorities, communities, school management, teachers, parents,
students, and mass media all over the country to raise support for the much needed but
politically sensitive school network optimization reform.

97. This component surpassed its original objective as it not only supported the
establishment of a more efficient budget allocation system in the education sector, but
also set the stage for broader education reforms, including a national school
rationalization program that has already impacted the efficiency of resource allocation
and created fiscal space for quality improvements (see subcomponent 3.2. above and the
economic and financial analysis section presented in Annex 3). An unexpected impact of
these changes, as reported by several school principals, is that schools now recognize the
need to improve the quality of the education they offer to attract more students and
ensure their financial sustainability, as well as to increase the resource envelope available
to them. For that reason, the component is rated as Highly Satisfactory.

98. Component 4. Strengthening Education Planning and Monitoring. The main
objective of this component was to build capacity at the MoEd to better manage the
education system by strengthening its capacity to promote and monitor programs. This
objective was meant to be met through: (i) development of the education sector’s human
resources in policy and monitoring at the ministerial level, and (ii) improvement in the
education management and administration in rayon education administration departments.
This component encompassed two subcomponents: (i) Policy and Monitoring
Development; and (ii) Rayon Education Administration Improvement.

99. Subcomponent 4.1. Policy and Monitoring Development. At appraisal, the
critical institutional shortcoming of the MoEd was emphasized. The MoEd had seen a
significant number of staff leave and had little capacity to carry out its strategic mandate.
The staff of the MoEd Department for Information Technologies was complemented with
consultants to accelerate the institutional capacity building and development of the
Education Management Information System (EMIS), intended to better monitor the
development and performance of the education sector. The MoEd had several
restructurings during the course of the Project, which led to creation of the Analysis,
Monitoring, and Policy Evaluation Department. Its specialists, together with other
ministry specialists responsible for policy development and heads of directorates (overall
20 participants), received training on: (i) educational policies, development, and
implementation; and (ii) techniques for developing education policy documents. In
addition, 70 rayon-level staff received training in administration and educational
management. Also, a PR strategy was developed and conducted to support the education



                                             30
reform program. Continued support to PR activities was also provided under the AF to
the Project.

100. Subcomponent 4.2. Rayon Education Administration Improvement. This
subcomponent supported training activities for rayon administrators at the local level.
Rayons are a critical element in monitoring the education system’s performance. Training
was provided in the areas of education administration, education management, and data
and information management in support of the national program. Overall, 94 rayon-level
staff received training in ICT in education, meeting the subcomponent target for this
activity.

101. Activities planned under this component were completed and training targets for
both components were met. Together with the AF, the Project supported: (i) design of an
EMIS; (ii) training of central and rayon-level staff on formula-based funding, policy
making, and ICT-related matters; (iii) creation and strengthening of the Ministry's QAA
to prepare, conduct, and analyze student assessments; (iv) Moldova's participation in the
PISA 2009 Plus international assessment; and (v) dissemination of education information
to stakeholders, such as the results of the PISA 2009 Plus and Baccalaureate exam results.
On a less positive note, while the MoEd’s institutional capacity is probably better today
than in 2006, it remains relatively weak and concentrated among a small group. That is
partially due to the difficulty in attracting qualified professionals into public service in
Moldova, a situation not unique to the education sector. The EMIS was developed and
data entry was conducted in November-December 2013 (the work is continued under the
follow-up Moldova Education Reform Project). Still, the EMIS’s sustainability will
depend on the political will of the Ministry's leadership to support it, use it for policy
making, and allocate proper resources for its regular update and maintenance. In light of
these considerations, the ICR team feels that the rating for this component is Moderately
Satisfactory. At the same time, the team recognizes that those objectives were too
ambitious given the scope of interventions supported by the Project, including the actual
financing allocated to them, which represented 6 percent of the actual overall Project cost.

102. This annex presents the economic and financial analysis of the QERM Project in
two parts. The first is a discussion of the macroeconomic and fiscal trends, including the
situation in Moldova’s education sector with a particular focus on the primary and
secondary education subsector. The second summarizes the economic analysis carried out
to identify the economic gains resulting from implementation of the Project.

Macroeconomic and Sector Context

103. The Republic of Moldova, a resource-poor and landlocked country, is undergoing a
difficult transition from a planned to a market economy. Although a deep economic
collapse marked its first decade of independence,14 economic growth resumed in 2000
and continued at an average annual rate of 5.9 percent until the 2008 global financial
crisis. The economy recovered from the 2008-09 global economic crisis with average
annual GDP growth exceeding 5 percent over 2010-2013. As a result, Moldova
experienced the highest cumulative GDP growth among all regional partners’ relative to
the pre-crisis year of 2007. At the same time, as a small open economy in which
agriculture has a significant role, Moldova’s growth performance has been strong but
volatile, reflecting vulnerability to climatic and global economic conditions.

104. Moldova’s recent economic performance reduced poverty and promoted shared
prosperity. The national poverty and extreme poverty rates fell from 30.2 percent and 4.5
percent, respectively, in 2006 to 16.6 percent and 0.6 percent in 2012, making Moldova
one of the world’s top performers in terms of poverty reduction. Similarly, consumption
growth among the bottom 40 percent of the population outpaced average consumption
growth: estimates for 2006-11 suggest an annualized overall growth in consumption of
2.9 percent over the period, as compared to 5.8 percent for the bottom 40 percent. These
developments were driven by economic growth and the associated growth in earnings, as
well as by an increase in private transfers such as remittances. Despite a sharp decline in
poverty, Moldova remains one of the poorest countries in Europe. Based on the Europe
and Central Asia (ECA) standardized poverty lines of US$5/day and US$2.50/day at
Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), 55 percent of the population was poor and 10 percent
was extremely poor in 2011. The most vulnerable groups at risk of poverty in Moldova
remain those with low education levels, households with three or more children, those in
rural areas, families relying on self-employment, the elderly, and Roma. Also, labor force
participation in Moldova is extremely low, particularly among women, rural residents,
youth (15-24 years old), older workers (55 years old and more), and those with low
educational attainment.

105. Indeed, education represents an important factor that influences the level of poverty.
There is also substantial evidence that human capital – defined as the accumulated stock


14
  During 1991-1999, GDP declined by almost 60 percent (with the exception of 1997, when GDP grew 1.6
percent).



                                                32
of education, knowledge, and skills – is important for economic development and
growth. 15 Not surprisingly, improving the quality, relevance, and efficiency of the
education system is one of the main priorities of the GoM. However, the demographic
and fiscal realities of the country have not made it easy for the government to fulfill its
mandate in education. Over the years, Moldova’s education sector has witnessed uneven
education quality and lack of efficiency.

106. Moldova’s performance on OECD’s Programme for International Student
Assessment (PISA) 2009 Plus (supported under the Project) is a substantive illustration of
the symptoms of quality challenges faced by the system. Its results showed that the
performance of the country’s 15-year-olds in reading, math, and science is among the
lowest in the region. The performance gap with OECD peers was equivalent to a little
more than two years of schooling. Overall, around 60 percent of Moldova's 15-year-olds
were shown to lack the basic levels of proficiency in reading and math literacy needed to
participate effectively and productively in society. Widespread cheating and corrupt
practices demotivated students to study.

107. In addition, as a result of demographic decline, Moldova’s student population has
shrunk significantly (by more than 50 percent since 1991), but the school network has not
adjusted accordingly. The traditional system of education financing in Moldova has
provided few incentives to improve sector efficiency by reducing resource utilization in
response to a shrinking school-age population. The old financing system tied resources to
teachers not students, thus making teachers a “free resource” from the point of view of
local authorities. This arrangement has left Moldova with some of the smallest classes
and lowest student-teacher ratios in the world, mainly in the country’s rural areas. In
2009, the GoM spent 9.4 percent of GDP on education, way above the regional average
of about 5 percent, indicating the urgent need for efficiency reforms in the sector.

108. Moldova’s education sector was characterized by an oversized network of
increasingly small schools and a high number of poorly paid and aging teachers (with
relevant consequences for quality and the social prestige of the profession). The 2011
feasibility study conducted under the Project examined the network of 970 rural primary
schools, gymnasiums, and lyceums and identified up to 283 low-enrollment institutions
(29 percent of the rural school network) that could be optimized in the short term without
impairing access to education for students in rural areas. Overall, it concluded that up to
half of Moldova’s rural schools may need to be reorganized or shut down in the next
three to five years to counteract the sharp population declines that have taken place over
the last 20 years.16 An average school in Moldova operated at 54 percent of the capacity
for which it was designed, leading to wasteful expenditures in the form of heating bills
and public utilities. As a result, a high proportion of the education budget went toward

Study, IPP (2010).

the financing of personnel expenditures and maintenance costs of school buildings
(including expenditures on heating and utilities), crowding out much needed quality-
enhancing investment in capital and educational materials.

109. Under Project support, in 2009 the government developed a new formula-based
funding mechanism and school optimization plan and implemented them in two pilot
rayons beginning in 2010. In 2011, based on the strong analytical work conducted under
the Project (in particular, completion of a feasibility study on school optimization) and
under World Bank Public Expenditure Review technical assistance, the GoM embarked
on a set of ambitious initiatives reflected in the Action Plan for Education Structural
Reform Implementation prepared by the MoEd and endorsed by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF). 17 Activities under the QERM Project both informed the
development of the government’s Education Reform Program and supported its
implementation.

110. Since January 2012, the government has expanded formula-based financing to nine
additional rural rayons (Criuleni, Cantemir, Călăraşi, Nisporeni, Taraclia, Ştefan Vodă,
Glodeni, Leova, and Sîngerei) and two urban municipalities (Bălţi and Chişinău).18 With
the piloting of per-student financing under the Project, the GoM took critical steps to
improve the efficiency of resource allocation in primary and secondary education. This
commitment was further strengthened by Parliament’s passage on April 26, 2012 of the
much needed and groundbreaking package of amendments to the existing laws on
education, labor, and local public finance. These legal changes created an enabling
environment that allowed implementation of efficiency reform measures, such as the
introduction of per-student financing nationwide and the change in the responsibility of a
school from the mayor to the rayon council, thus enabling rationalization of school
networks. Subsequently, in January 2013, the government rolled out the new per-student
financing mechanism nationwide.19

111. With these reforms in the sector, the GoM was able to bring education spending
onto a fiscally sustainable footing. The education budget was approved and executed
largely in line with MTEF projections for the period As a result, total education spending
decreased as a percent of GDP from 9.4 percent in 2009 to 7.1 percent in 2013.

Economic analysis

112. The economic analysis both at appraisal and at the time of ICR preparation took the
framework of a traditional cost-benefit analysis (though no estimates of the NPV were
made at the time of appraisal).

113. The actual Project costs of US$12.09 million are relatively small – equivalent to less
than 1 percent of public expenditure on primary and secondary education over the eight-
year period of 2006-2013. At the same time, the QERM Project has a number of benefits
and economic gains. The most substantial benefits of this Project are: (i) the gain in
efficiency in the primary and secondary education subsector (also, due to consolidation of
school networks and increases in class and school sizes, existing capacities are used more
efficiently, freeing up resources for quality-enhancing inputs); and (ii) creation of an
improved learning environment in upper secondary schools.

114. Primary and secondary education is the largest subsector in Moldova’s education
budget, representing around half of the education spending. From 2005 to 2010, public
spending in this subsector grew 2.4 times (28 percent annually on average). The
oversized and overstaffed network would have continued to require increasing resources
for its maintenance: if the trends of 2005-2010 persisted, spending on primary and
secondary education would have reached MDL 4.59 billion by 2013 (




                                            35
115. Figure 3). Over 2010 to 2013 – that is, since the launch of the per-student financing
pilots followed by school consolidation and efficiency reforms in the sector – an
additional MDL 1.45 billion (US$108 million) would have been required, 38.9 percent of
the primary and secondary education budget or 20.6 percent of the total education budget
in 2013.

116. From the 2009/10 to the 2013/14 school year, 131 schools were closed, or 9 percent
of the total. Maintaining these schools in 2013 alone would have required an additional
MDL 357 million from the government (an additional 5 percent of the total education
spending). The MoEd also conducted a reorganization of school networks and created
hub schools. During 2005-2013, 206 general education institutions were reorganized.
This process consisted of transforming lyceums into gymnasiums (lower secondary
education institutions) and gymnasiums into primary schools. As a result, average class
size increased from 19.0 in 2010 to 20.2 in 2013 (in comparison, in 2002 and 2003 there
were 22 students per class) and the student-teacher ratio increased from 10.5 in 2011 (the
lowest since 1991) to 11.0 in 2013 (Figure 4).

117. Optimization is not a goal in itself. The main purpose of the reforms was to improve
the quality of education through consolidation of schools and better utilization of
resources (human and physical), and was a long-overdue response to the effects of the
demographic transition. Indeed, through the consolidated school network and increases in
class and school sizes, existing facilities were used more efficiently, freeing up resources
for quality-enhancing inputs such as increased investments into teaching aids and
methodological literature, books and periodicals, training, informational technologies,
and personal computers (
118. The nationwide application of per-student financing of education in 2013 facilitated
the restructuring of the school network with two main impacts: efficiency and equity.
Under the more flexible per-student financing arrangement, school principals are able to
reallocate funds as they see fit within the budget envelope determined by the financing
formula. The size of the budget gain was found to be positively correlated with a number
of school characteristics, including average class size, the student-teacher ratio, the ratio
of students to non-teaching staff, building capacity utilization, average number of
students per grade, and total number of students. This indicates that the formula is more
favorable to lower-cost schools than was the old input-based financing system. The
relationship between proportional budget change and the prime drivers of per-student
costs—class size and the ratios of students to teachers and students to non-teaching
staff—is consistent with this conclusion. All three variables generally rise in line with
proportional budget change. The index of community deprivation—which measures the
relative well-being of the communities in which the schools are located—has a very
small and statistically significant inverse correlation with proportional budget change,
indicating that schools in more deprived areas tend to experience a positive budget
change (see Table 2).

119. Figure 5). This can already be seen in the period since the initiation of the first pilots
and subsequent roll-out of the optimization and efficiency reform in the sector, though
there is still room for improvement relative to the pre-crisis period.

121. The formula promotes efficiency, benefitting larger schools over smaller schools,
and incentivizes rayons and cities to reorganize small, costly, and inefficient schools. It
also favors rural schools over urban ones, which in the case of Moldova suggests that the
formula promotes efficiency by enabling urban schools to reduce costs by decreasing the
number of small classes without impairing access. Overall, the uniform per-student
amount gives favorable efficiency incentives in Moldova by encouraging rayons and
cities to reorganize their school networks to ensure that schools can finance their costs
within their respective budget allocations.



                                                    38
122. The results of the beneficiaries’ analysis also showed that Project activities
contributed to improving the quality of education in rural areas as follows. Laboratory
equipment and visual aids provided under the Project helped students to better understand
abstract scientific concepts. The development of a new competence-based curriculum and
training of teachers to apply it helped students improve their communication, team work,
and learning skills. Enhanced autonomy of schools allowed school leaders to make
efficiency savings and reallocate funding towards school needs and quality-enhancing
investments. Improved quality and reliability of national student assessments together
with the measures on strengthening the integrity of the Baccalaureate exam system laid
the groundwork for a more merit-based way of determining university admission and
increased students’ efforts in the classroom.

123. Upper secondary education (the focus of the QERM Project in terms of quality
improvements) plays an important role in the progression from compulsory education
either to further education (in particular, higher education) or to the world of work. Given
the lack of national data regarding the progression of upper secondary graduates to higher
education institutions by urban-rural divide (plus the existing quota system for publicly-
financed seats), the labor market outcomes of graduates were reviewed, with the caveat
that these largely depend upon labor market conditions (of both the supply and demand
side). A substantial share of Moldova’s employed population (19 percent) has an upper
secondary education degree: 16 percent in urban areas and 21 percent in rural areas.
According to National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data, after a drop in 2010, graduates
with an upper secondary education degree increasingly report being able to find and take
on jobs above their education level (Figure 6). The share of unemployed 15- to 24-year-
olds with an upper secondary education in rural areas is declining (Figure 7), although the
gap in the disposable labor-related income of graduates from rural and urban areas is
widening.

124. Given the high uncertainty associated with predicting the labor market outcomes of
individuals and linking those outcomes to investments made today, the cost-benefit
analysis focused on the benefits of the Project associated with the fiscal savings from the
efficiency measures targeted under Component 3. The NPV of the savings is calculated
based on a discount rate of 10 percent and covers the period of 10 years from Project
completion (2013-2033). Under these assumptions, the savings from the school
consolidation alone amounts to about US$154.6 million in NPV terms, equivalent to 29.6
percent of Moldova’s education budget in 2013.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results


125. As part of the ICR preparation, a study was conducted to document beneficiaries’
perceptions of the overall impact of the QERM Project on the quality of education in
rural areas. The study also took into account the social assessment conducted in 2005 in
preparation of the Project to gauge beneficiaries’ perceptions of Project interventions, and
replicated its design to have a baseline for comparison. The 2005 assessment
encompassed 21 in-depth interviews among high-level rayon officials, mayors, school
directors, teachers, and parents. In addition, five focus groups were conducted among
teachers, students, and parents to discuss the major problems faced by schools and the
proposed solutions.

126. The most pressing problems identified in 2005 were: (i) the lack of modern quality
teaching and didactic aids as well as appropriate school premises; and (ii) the shortage of
sufficient and satisfactory teaching staff. Most respondents agreed that these issues were
compounded by the high level of curricula complexity, low quality of textbooks, poor
school libraries, and lack of computers and internet access. Increased autonomy of
schools was seen as beneficial in the opinion of some respondents; the low number of
students will make it inevitable in the future to establish school networks, which could
help improve school facilities/maintenance and solve the problem of teacher shortages in
particular subjects. In addition, taking into consideration the needs, views, and
recommendations raised in other studies,20 specific activities were built into the Project to
address and mitigate concerns expressed by stakeholders. For example, regarding more
participatory local government, the Project included the introduction of formula-based
funding together with decentralization and higher financial autonomy of schools.

127. The 2014 study covered the same three rayons as those in the initial social
assessment (Făleşti in the North, Teleneşti in the Center, and Leova in the South). In each
of the three rayons, rural high schools (lyceums) were targeted, bringing the total number
of schools to 21. Overall, 30 in-depth interviews with key informants (education
department officials, school directors, and principals) and 15 focus groups (with parents,
students, and teachers) were conducted. To gauge beneficiaries’ perceptions of the impact
of Project interventions, it covered the relevant areas of curriculum, teaching and learning
materials, school financing and autonomy, school grants, and learning assessments.
Schools principals and teachers were the ones found to be most familiar with the Project.
They identified it with the laboratory equipment received through the quality and equity
grants, participation in the competence-based curriculum training for teachers and
provision of the associated curriculum guides, and the financial autonomy training for
principals and accountants.

128. The results showed that Project activities contributed to improving the quality of
education in rural areas, as the Project: (i) provided laboratory equipment and visual aids
that helped students to better understand abstract scientific concepts; (ii) supported the
development of and trained teachers on a new competence-based curriculum (which is
more practical than the old curriculum, and helped students improve their
communication, team work, and learning skills); (iii) enhanced the autonomy of school
principals, allowing them to seek efficiency savings and reallocate funding including
towards quality-enhancing investments; and (iv) helped improve the quality and
reliability of national student assessments that, together with the measures on
strengthening the integrity of the Baccalaureate exam system, laid the groundwork for a
more merit-based way of determining university admission and increased students’
academic efforts.

129. The new competence-based curriculum is considered by beneficiaries to be more
practical, applied, and clear than the old one, emphasizing interactive participation from
students. This has resulted in more student interest in the subject matter and greater focus
on peer learning. Students now have better communication, teamwork, and learning skills,
as well as “life skills.” Several principals cited the curriculum reform as one of the factors
contributing to the improvement in learning over time. The new curriculum was
significantly simplified. However, some principals and teachers think that it is still too
heavy. A greater focus on interdisciplinary approaches is needed (e.g., between physics
and math), as well as better alignment of curriculum and teaching materials and textbooks.
Also, while the curriculum is competence-based, evaluation still largely focuses on
reproduction of material learned rather than on competencies. Nevertheless, most
teachers confirmed that the curriculum guides provided for all subjects in high school
under the Project were very useful and timely and supported introduction of the new
curriculum into the teaching process. Most teachers were satisfied with the content of the
guides and considered them useful in preparing and conducting lessons and in evaluation.

130. School principals had positive perceptions towards per-student-based financing and
wider autonomy of educational institutions, stating that this provides them with the
opportunity to solve the most pressing problems of their institutions. Principals generally
preferred the new financial autonomy regime, despite having doubts about the new
responsibilities prior to its rollout. None preferred to go back to having these decisions
made at the municipal level, and all stated that all per-student allocations reach the
educational institutions. School managers also reported receiving sufficient support (of
high quality and usefulness) and training (abundant in information) in implementing the
new measures of school financial autonomy. They have succeeded in undertaking some
improvements in terms of equipping their institutions. Savings have been channeled to
installing new energy efficient windows and purchasing new teaching materials or
computers. Procurement processes have become more efficient because school directors
know better what they need as opposed to municipal accountants, who were the de facto
decision makers under the previous system. The new financing mechanism is seen to
work well for schools with high capacity utilization.




                                             44
131. Beneficiaries reported that prior to the quality and equity grants provided under the
Project, schools rarely received equipment (some had not received new supplies for
around two decades). Equipment procured through grants included projectors, computers,
etc. These materials are used widely and were seen to contribute to student learning. In
general, school principals and teachers confirmed that the schools’ lab equipment was
useful. The labs served as visual aids for students, very important for helping them learn
interactively, visualize abstract concepts, and better prepare to study science-related
disciplines. At the same time, teachers reported issues with the quality and durability of
biology and chemistry lab equipment. Some teachers mentioned the lack of freedom to
select certain items of lab equipment within the total amount of the grant. Rather, they
received sets that sometimes contained items the school would prefer to replace with
other necessary equipment. There is still a lack of school lab equipment, understandable
given the one-time quality/equity grant interventions under the Project. At the same time,
the training that schools received in grant writing under the Project was reported as useful,
allowing school managers to independently raise funds from other sources for school
investments later on.

132. According to beneficiaries, thanks to the strengthened integrity of the Baccalaureate
exam system, both students and teachers started to treat studies more seriously,
particularly from grade 10, though some students opted for vocational education for fear
of failing the exam. Now students get a score based on what they know, motivating them
to study harder; this is expected to have a positive impact. These views are generally
shared by most school principals and teachers. In the long run, the reform of the
Baccalaureate exam system is likely to improve the quality and meritocracy of education
by boosting student effort and forcing students to study to receive higher results. Parents
and students in schools confirmed that they had been informed about the new exam rules,
as well as the exam results for their school.

133. Lastly, in terms of awareness of Moldova’s participation in international
assessments, it was mostly representatives of rayon education departments who were
familiar with the PISA 2009 Plus and its results, as they were discussed at a meeting of
rayon education heads in Chisinau, as well as at rayon meetings. Some math teachers
were also aware of the PISA as it was discussed during the methodological meetings for
teachers in terms of the results and related issues of practical application of students’
knowledge. These educators’ general perceptions of trends in education quality were
positive over the time that they had been in their jobs (ranging from 4 to 20 years).
Nevertheless, despite the fact that the equipment of rural schools has considerably
improved over the last five years, there is no conclusive evidence that the gap in the
quality of education in rural and urban areas has narrowed, since urban schools are
generally better off due to the greater capacity of authorities and parents in urban areas to
support them.

134. Project achievements are reviewed in light of what was planned, what was modified
during implementation (with justification for the causes of changes), the actions
undertaken, and the results obtained.

Component 1. Improving Teaching and Learning in Rural Schools
135. The main objective of this component was to improve the quality and relevance of
teaching and learning in rural schools, especially in lyceums (grades 10-12), by
strengthening the three basic (MoEd) pedagogical systems: curriculum, teaching, and
assessment. The component was implemented by the MoEd Department for Preschool
and General Education and by the QAA. The component consisted of three
subcomponents.

Subcomponent 1.1. Modernizing Curriculum for Grades 10-12

136. The basic objective was to complete the modernization of the national curriculum by
finalizing and revising its design, implementing a new curriculum for grades 10-12, and
supporting the new curriculum with new textbooks and teaching materials. Implemented
activities focused on the main approved directions and the results are as follows:
    (i) A Reference Framework for the National Curriculum was developed, edited,
           and distributed in all lyceums in the country;
    (ii) Guidelines for the implementation of the modernized curriculum for 17 school
           subjects were developed;
    (iii) Training on the guidelines was provided to 8,284 teachers from lyceums;
    (iv) 1,190 schools from rural areas were endowed with equipment for some
           disciplines and their curricular areas strengthened under the equity grants
           program.

Subcomponent 1.2. Teacher Professional Development for Grades 10-12

137. The objective of this subcomponent was to deliver training to teachers from lyceums
in rural areas to support implementation of curriculum for grades 10-12 (secondary level).
The achievements of this subcomponent are as follows:
    (i) Standards were developed for teachers’ continuous education training for general
          secondary education;
    (ii) Base courses (10 guides for training school teachers) were developed. 3,000
          copies of each of the 10 guidelines were published in Romanian and 500 copies in
          Russian, for a total of 35,000 copies;
    (iii) Methodological training of teachers was conducted in the 10 selected rayons;
    (iv) The training provider’s performance was assessed;
    (v) Ten training centers at the rayon level (Rîşcani, Donduşeni, Floreşti, Rezina,
          Teleneşti, Nisporeni, Anenii Noi, Leova, Cimişlia, and Gagauz Yeri) were
          equipped with training equipment (notebooks, printers, and projectors). The
          procurement and distribution of equipment was completed in September 2009.




                                           47
138. To achieve these results, the MoEd approved the regulation of assessment and
accreditation of institutions (and continuous education training programs) by Order No.
203 on March 29, 2008. Meanwhile, due to changes in the MoEd structure, the
assessment function was transferred to the QAA.

139. Methodological competence development of teachers from rural lyceums was
conducted with the effort of the MoEd, the Training and Science Institute, rayon
education departments, lyceums’ administrations, and Project consultants. At the central
level, the Training and Science Institute trained 394 local trainers in November 2008. At
the local level, trainings were organized with support from rayon education departments:
451 seminars were held on methodological competences development for 16,909 teachers
in lyceums, of which 11,875 or 70.2 percent were from rural areas (369 schools), while
5,034 teachers, or 29.8 percent, were from urban areas (82 lyceums).

Subcomponent 1.3. Establishment of National Centre for Examinations and Quality
Assurance
140. The objective of this subcomponent was to establish a National Centre for
Examination and Quality Assurance under the MoEd (currently the QAA), to effectively
assess students, examinations and testing, and accreditation and to strengthen national
capacities for measurement in education. Another objective was to strengthen the security
of exams, especially the Baccalaureate exam, which is highly important in Moldova’s
education system. To achieve these objectives, the following activities were undertaken:
   (i) Establishment of the Quality Assurance Agency
       The QAA was created based on Government Decision No. 1469, dated December
       2006. The goal of the QAA is: “assuring quality education, carrying state’s policy
       on external evaluation of the secondary general educational system, and
       improving national capacity in educational measurement.”
   (ii) Development and installation of specialized software for the QAA
       Development and installation of the ADPS (automated data processing system)
       software was done between February and October 2008. In December 2008, the
       QAA organized training courses for local trainers from rayon education
       departments and for 120 staff responsible for managing the database of the 2009
       Baccalaureate exam for general secondary education institutions, higher education
       institutions, and republican status lyceums. Additional training for 440 users was
       organized in January 2009.
   (iii) Provision of equipment for the Evaluation and Assessment Agency (now QAA)
       The multiplication equipment, advanced computers, scanners, projector, servers,
       and furniture for the QAA were delivered by June 2008.
   (iv) Organization of study visit for Moldovan specialist in evaluation
       A study visit was organized from November 10–17, 2007 to the National
       Examination Centre in Lithuania. The quality of the management process of pre-




                                           48
         university education assessment, the Republic of Lithuania’s experience in
         evaluation, and other aspects of the evaluation process and review were studied.21
     (v) Training of teaching staff on in-classroom formative evaluation methods
         Training on this topic was carried out in 2008. Training of trainers was held in 10
         republican vocational centres (Rîşcani, Donduseni, Floreşti, Rezina, Telenesti,
         Nisporeni, Anenii Noi, Leova, Cimişlia, and Gagauz Yery). The training was
         organized for 173 local trainers, who conducted the training for lyceum teachers.
         These trainings were organized in each rayon with support from the rayon
         education departments.
     (vi) Implementation of baseline survey in 2007
         A baseline evaluation of the basic capabilities of 8th and 10th grade students was
         made by the State Institute of Continuing Education (SICE). The main study
         objective was to prepare a baseline of education results to enable comparison of
         Moldova with other countries. The study included:
          Collection of data to monitor the capability of students in mathematics and
             native language based on the curriculum for grades 8 and 10;
          An assessment of the quality of pre-university education in rural areas;
          A comparison of students’ results depending on their residential environment;
          A comparison of students’ current test results with results obtained in other
             national and international evaluations;
          Identification of variables that affect students' abilities, such as training,
             language, time spent working on computers, Internet use in preparing lessons,
             parents' level of education, and level of study students intend to obtain.
     (vii) Support for completion of tests at the end of primary cycle and exams at the
         end of the gymnasium cycle in 2007, 2008, and 2009, and for completion of the
         annual Baccalaureate exam.
         The most important activity was implementation by the QAA of the final
         assessments for grades 4 and 9, the Baccalaureate exam, and the graduation exam
         at the end of 11th grade of general school. For these purposes, the Project
         supported the QAA in:



21
   Topics of study and research were: the development of statistical basis, its correlation between areas and
steps of school, and participation of the Republic of Lithuania in international assessments (PISA and
TIMSS). Within these objectives, participants heard and discussed communications presented by
employees of: the National Examination Center of Lithuania, the Ministry of Education and Science, the
Center for Development of Education, the Municipality of Vilnius, the Center of Information Technologies,
two gymnasiums, and National Agency for the Evaluation of Schools.
Studying the practice of the Republic of Lithuania in the field of assessment of academic results by the
National Examination Center had a positive impact on QAA’s activities on: organization and evolution of
the exam administration procedure in Moldova; development of exam programs; development of the items
bank; organization of the pre-test; content establishment; correlation of the structure of the test exam to the
level of curricular areas; development of a test focused on competences and administration of the test
during examination; and development of the statistical basis and its correlation to areas and steps of the
school.



                                                     49
          Organizing trainings for the heads of rayon education divisions and the heads
           and deputy heads of training for republican methodological centers;
          Publishing programs for all subjects on which examinations are held for the
           school steps and a newsletter (in the state language and in Russian) that
           contained exclusively regulations on the organization and conduct of
           examinations and other acts aimed at the evaluation process;
          Launching the QAA’s webpage (http://www.aee.edu.md);
          Providing online access to the centralized database to any student who takes
           exam, allowing them to review their test results.
   (viii) Participation in international tests
       One of the objectives of the QAA was to encourage Moldova’s participation in
       international tests and assessments of school performance. With the financial
       support of the Project, the QAA under MoEd ensured Moldova’s participation in
       the TIMSS 2007 and the PISA 2009+ assessments. By participating in the PISA
       2009+ test, Moldova met the following PISA objectives: (i) evaluation of the
       skills of 15-year-old students who participated in the test; (ii) identification of the
       skills students need to integrate into society; (iii) and analysis of the knowledge
       application students have gained in school in reading/understanding of text,
       mathematics, and science as well as skills in solving concrete life problems. The
       Project covered the costs related to preparation of training materials, organization
       of a pre-test, basic PISA 2009 + testing requirements, etc.

Additional Financing for Quality Education Activities

141. Under the AF for the Quality Education Financing Agreement, Component 1 was
charged with undertaking the following additional activities:
   (i) Carrying out studies to support the development of standards for receiving
       schools
       The Quality Assurance Standards developed for schools with Project support were
       approved by the MoEd Order No. 970, dated November 10, 2013.
   (ii) Strengthening the ability to monitor the quality of education
       The Project: supported the QAA in the development of various academic skills
       assessment tools; developed a brochure containing assessment tool samples; and
       delivered a 4-day training for group coordinators and members of groups that
       developed tests for the final assessments in primary and secondary education.

Component 2. Increasing Access and Equity in Rural Schools
142. The objective of this component was to grant schools and poor rural communities
additional resources to improve the quality of and access to educational services. Also,
eligible schools would be helped to learn to manage the additional resources in a
transparent and efficient manner and to be accountable for results. Responsibility for
implementation of Component 2 was given to the MoEd’s budget department, and was
implemented through two subcomponents.




                                             50
Subcomponent 2.1. Rural Schools Equity Grants
143. The purpose of this subcomponent was to provide educational institutions in rural
areas with basic didactic materials and equipment for subjects of study and curricular
areas by providing a grant estimated at about US$2,000 to each eligible school. To
achieve these objectives, the following activities were undertaken:
   (i) Purchase of teaching equipment
   All rural schools in the country that fit eligibility criteria set by the MoEd received
   equity grants. The list of eligible institutions was developed within the school
   mapping project database and carried out during the pre-Project phase. Eligibility
   criteria developed by the MoEd were placed in catalogs of equipment and educational
   materials published during the pre-Project phase and distributed to all educational
   institutions of the country (two catalogs per institution).
   Schools selected equipment and didactic materials from these catalogs based on the
   amount allocated and according to their current needs. Equity grants comprised the
   two curricular areas of arts and technology and language and communication, and
   disciplines such as physical education, biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics,
   geography, IT, and history. Equipment and didactic materials were purchased in
   October – December, 2006.
   (ii) Distribution of teaching equipment to schools in rural areas
   All types of educational institutions in rural areas benefited from equity grants, except
   for primary schools and other types of schools with less than 80 students. Equipment
   and didactic materials purchased within that tender were distributed to 1,190 eligible
   institutions in rural areas (gymnasiums, secondary schools, and lyceums) from 2007
   until the beginning of 2008.
   Equipment and materials included: illustrative teaching materials, some tools, molds
   and equipment for arts and technology; a sports inventory for physical education;
   tools and tables for mathematics; teaching materials for Romanian, Russian, and
   foreign languages; maps and globes for geography; tables for informatics; maps and
   tables for history; and some equipment for physics, biology, and chemistry.

Subcomponent 2.2. Rural Schools Quality Grants
144. The objective of this subcomponent was to provide quality grants on a competitive
basis to eligible rural lyceums to supply basic didactic equipment of laboratories for
physics, chemistry, and biology as well as to supply them with information on techniques,
thus improving the quality of studies in these disciplines. Also, the subcomponent was
intended to encourage lyceums to manage their resources effectively, to prioritize needs,
and to be accountable for school performance results. The following activities were taken
to provide schools with equipment:

   (i) Criteria development and evaluation of grant proposals
   Quality grants were awarded via a competition to which all eligible lyceums from
   rural areas registered at the time of the announcement could apply. To participate in
   the competition, rural lyceums had to: prepare and submit a project proposal for
   school unit development; demonstrate the need for resources to achieve their goals;


                                            51
and prove their availability to contribute 10 percent of the size of the grant, provided
through services or in cash. All stages of granting the quality grants were made in
accordance with the Grants Operations Manual (GOM) component of the QERM’s
Project Operational Manual approved by the World Bank.
(ii) Assistance to schools in developing grant proposals
To assist rural lyceums in preparing and presenting grant proposals, the first phase of
training seminars for school directors and members of Regional Grant Review and
Approval Committee (RGRAC), created under all rayon education departments, took
place between October and December 2006.
Of the 343 rural lyceums registered by September 1, 2006, 336 participants from
lyceums (98 percent) and 144 members of RGRAC sites attended the first stage of
training.
By the end of 2006, all lyceums in rural areas had worked on development of projects
for participation in the competition, and 251 lyceums presented projects for the
competition. Under decision of the National Grant Review and Approval Committee
(NGRAC), MoEd Order No. 134 of March 16, 2007, quality grants were awarded to
131 lyceums.
Beginning in summer 2007, the program of training for school directors, members of
the focus groups, and RGRAC members continued: 220 people attended seminars
with focus groups, and 228 people attended the second stage of training for school
directors. By the end of 2007, 199 projects had been drafted and presented for the
second phase of the contest. After evaluation, based on NGRAC decision, by MoEd
Order No. 102 of February 26, 2008, quality grants were awarded to 173 lyceums.
(iii) Purchase and delivery of teaching equipment
Extensive laboratory equipment for physics, chemistry, biology and IT technology
was purchased for the 131 schools selected in the first phase of the contest and
distributed to them by the end of the 2007/08 school year.
International tender for the procurement of equipment for the 173 lyceums selected in
the second phase of the competition took place on May 23, 2008, and the equipment
was distributed by the end of 2008.
(iv) Impact assessment of the grants programs
A study of the grants’ impacts was initiated to: determine the degree of equipment use
in the educational process; establish gaps in procurement and distribution of
equipment; measure the immediate effects of the use of grants in the educational
process; evaluate the impact of the training program for lyceum directors in the
preparation and implementation of the projects; evaluate the capacity of the school
management in project implementation; and determine the visible and measurable
impacts of the Project on target groups. The first phase of this survey took place from
February to April 2009. A report on the survey’s findings on initial achievements was
submitted to the MoEd on May 12, 2009. The survey’s conclusions were that:
 The process for selection of equipment and teaching materials was generally
   regarded as transparent and objective.




                                        52
      The quality of equipment received was assessed as satisfactory for both types of
       grants.
      Project benefits identified by teachers were: improvements in the technical
       materials base; facilitated teaching of the material and its assimilation by students;
       increased opportunities for implementation of practical work; and greater
       opportunities for students to perform practical work and to work in small groups.
      The shortcomings were mainly as follows: a few materials were not satisfactory
       and not all materials requested were received (notebooks, educational software);
       some were received without being needed (selection not of particular items but of
       the whole module); there was a long process for materials distribution; there was
       unfair granting of certain subjects; there was incomplete training of teachers in
       use of equipment; and there was lack of sufficient information about the Project.

Component 3. Increasing Efficiency in the Use of Resources
145. The basic objective of this component was to increase the efficiency of the public
financial allocation to schools and to encourage more efficient use of resources in schools,
in the context of projected demographic changes (school-age population, class sizes, and
student/staff ratios), including the use of formula-based funding in all schools.
Responsibility for implementation of the component, which consists of three
subcomponents, was delegated to the MoEd budget department.

Subcomponent 3.1. Education Budgeting Improvement

146. The objective of this subcomponent was to improve and increase the capacity and
role of the MoEd in preparation of annual budgets and its capacity in costing activities
based on MTEF projections for the education sector.

147. A local consultant worked with MoEd staff and used sector data to prepare the
methodology that formed the basis for two new regulations developed in consultation
with the MoF: (i) regulation of the relationship between the MoEd and other central
authorities with subordinate educational institutions; and (ii) regulation of the relationship
between the MoEd and rayon education departments.

148. For the purpose of training specialists involved in MoEd budget costing, data
collection and preparation MTEF forecasts, an organizational plan to conduct seminars in
the area was developed, but methodology of preparation of MTEF was not developed.
MTEF development work is currently managed by the MoF.

Subcomponent 3.2. Formula Funding and School Autonomy Pilots

149. The objectives of this subcomponent were to:
    Pilot a system of self-financing and governance of schools in selected rayons to
       increase efficiency in resource utilization by the end of 2010;
    Approve a formula-based financing mechanism for primary and general education
       schools by the end of 2010;
    Implement the formula across the country by the end of Project life;



                                             53
      Collect data on dropout rates of students affected by the school rationalization;
       and
      Provide training to personnel responsible for formula-based financing and school
       optimization.
    (i) Formula piloting
To develop a new formula-based funding mechanism that would meet the necessary
requirements and standards, an international consultant with extensive experience in the
field was hired competitively to provide assistance to the MoEd. Together with the MoEd
budget department and MoF staff, the consultant prepared three variants of formula-based
funding. In July 2008, the variant of the formula considered most acceptable for Moldova
(variant 1B) was approved. To estimate formula parameters, data from 1,202 schools (81
percent of the total), covering 357,000 students (76 percent), were used.
The percentage of schools reorganized in two pilot rayons based on the new formula-
based funding mechanism was as follows:
    2007/08 - 40 percent of all schools
    2008/09 - 80 percent of all schools
    2009/10 - 100 percent of schools.
   (ii) Formula approval and implementation across the country
The final formula now in use was approved by Government Decision No. 728, dated
October 2, 2012. As of January 1, 2013, all school budgets from primary and general
education system in the country have been approved based on the provisions of the new
formula.
    (iii) Data on dropout rates
The dropout indicator was needed to better monitor the school network optimization
reform’s effects. This indicator was considered and introduced into the database during
implementation of the school censorship and improvement of the school mapping system
(and creation of the new student-level Education Management Information System). This
helps tracking the reform process (monitor dropouts and support mitigation measures),
especially given the uncertainty of the previously available data.
   (iv) Training on formula application and school optimization
A series of trainings were organized during the formula’s pilot and after its approval. In
June 2009, a team of consultants prepared and organized two informative seminars on the
new formula-based funding and school autonomy in the pilot rayons. Seminars in both
rayons were attended by over 200 people, including heads of rayon councils, heads of
rayon education departments, heads of finance departments, school managers, and
accountants. The seminars were deemed successful, registering the interest of local
representatives in application of the new formula as well as in the expansion of school
autonomy. Between December 2012 and February 2013, another round of training on the
formula’s application was delivered by Project budget experts. Other trainings were
organized at the request of local authorities through the end of the Project.




                                           54
Subcomponent 3.3. Grant for the Optimization of School Networks in Selected
Rayons

150. This subcomponent had two main activities:
    Conduct of a feasibility study; and
    Implementation of a grant program for optimization in pilot rayons and evaluation
       and dissemination of the results.

151. During the first quarter of 2009, the Project team conducted a study on the "Current
situation of general secondary education in pilot rayons Căuşeni and Rîşcani," referring
to the school network, provision of space for educational institutions, provision of human
resources, and school spending. The analysis identified several odd situations that
required clarification. For a deeper analysis of the situation in schools, an "Assessment of
Educational Institutions" was developed, enabling the collection of additional
information as necessary to improve analysis of information in both pilot rayons’ schools
and improve the formula used for funding. Key findings include:
   a) The analysis of pilot rayons’ schools’ building capacity and number of students
      found that about 41.8 percent of the existing capacities were not used, creating
      undue costs, which in turn reflected on the current state of schools: in Căuşeni, the
      average rate of capacity utilization of the premises was 62.5 percent; in Rîşcani,
      the average rate of capacity utilization of the buildings was 52.5 percent, 10
      percent less compared to that in Căuşeni.
   b) The analysis of schools’ human resources found that the student/teacher ratio was
      11.8 on average in the Căuşeni rayon, and the ratio of students/other staff was
      10.9. The student/teacher ratio in Rîşcani was 10.8 on average, or 8.8 percent less
      compared to Căuşeni, while the student/other staff ratio was 10.6.
   c) The total expenditure planned for 2009 for educational institutions in Căuşeni
      constituted 60.34 million leu, or 4880.35 lei per student on average, while in
      Rîşcani, total expenditure planned was 37.34 million lei, or 4785.98 lei per
      student on average. Expenditure for payment of goods and services constituted an
      average of 23 percent of the total in Căuşeni and 24.7 percent in Rîşcani. The
      largest shares of these costs were for: meals for students (about 6.3 percent and
      6.2 percent of total spending in Căuşeni and Rîşcani, respectively); gas (4.9
      percent and 4.8 percent, respectively); fuel (3.1 percent and 4.8 percent,
      respectively); electricity (2.3 percent and 2.1 percent, respectively); and current
      costs for repairs (1.4 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively).
152. To encourage and support pilot rayons and to create improved conditions for the
schools under constituency, an expenditure of US$1 million was planned to benefit
schools undergoing restructuring, if they matched the criteria to be developed. The funds
were used to procure 10 buses. Additionally, 11 hub schools benefited from one
computer class each. In nine rayons, 304 blackboards were delivered.




                                            55
Component 4. Strengthening Education Planning and Monitoring

153. The main objective of this component was to develop the MoEd’s capacity to better
manage the education system by strengthening its capacity to promote and monitor
policies and programs. Implementation of this objective was made possible through
focused activities targeted at:
  (i) Development of human resources in the education sector in policy and monitoring
       at the ministerial level; and
  (ii) Improvement in education management and administration at the rayon level.
154. The Project financed the initial mobilization of investments through on-the-job
training in policy formulation and monitoring. The component consists of two
subcomponents.

Subcomponent 4.1. Policies and Monitoring Development

155. The former Computerization and Didactic Provision of Education Directorate was
responsible for implementation of this subcomponent. According to the original concept,
a Strategic Policy and Program Group (SPPG) had to be created to consolidate and make
more cohesive the various educational-related initiatives.

156. When the MoEd structure changed at the end of 2006, “The data analysis,
monitoring and evaluation policies unit” (DAMEP) was created. Subsequently, a new
“Concept and Action Plan” for the entire subcomponent was developed and approved in
early 2007. These changes required a new concept for the subcomponent and a review of
the Project Operational Manual (developed and approved by the MoEd Order in April
2007). Out of Project funding, both directorates responsible for the component were
equipped with IT equipment, and DAMEP was also equipped with office furniture.

157. Training of MoEd staff in educational policy development was done by Centre
"Education 2000 +", Romania, in consortium with the Institute for Public Policy from
Moldova, which organized a training in the first quarter of 2008. Training focused on two
modules: I - Educational Policies Development and Implementation; and II - Techniques
for Developing Educational Policy Documents. Twenty persons attended these training
seminars, and each participant received course support, books, and other materials related
to policy and education management.

Subcomponent 4.2. Rayon Education Administration Improvement

158. This subcomponent supported training activities for representatives of rayon
administrations to improve management capacity at the local level. Training focused on:
(i) administration of education; (ii) educational management; and (iii) management of
data and information required to support the national program.
   i) Training activities
The purpose of these activities was to ensure effective training of rayon staff. Rayon
education divisions were equipped with the necessary materials to conduct training



                                           56
seminars and other related activities. This equipment was purchased together with the
endowment of the MoEd Directorates described under Component 4.1.
In 2008 and 2009, a series of trainings were conducted on two modules:
   a)     Implementation of ICT in education; and
   b)     Data management.
Seminars were attended by 94 people in the first round of trainings and 70 people in
second round. Participants were technical specialists responsible for IT, heads of
methodological centers, and specialists (e.g., economists from rayon education
departments).
   ii) The public information campaign
The results of the public information campaign were most visible in the last year of
Project implementation. A series of articles about the school network optimization were
published in central and local newspapers and two roundtables were organized on the
school optimization reform.
A documentary was produced that covered the positive results of the school network
reorganization and hub school creation. It reported on improvements in the educational
process and the changes made to optimize education spending.
