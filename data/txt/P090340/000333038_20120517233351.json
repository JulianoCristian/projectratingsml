This will\n            be the Project's second extension for a cumulative\n            period of 29 months. In line with its Project Development\n            Objective (PDO), the Project has continuously contributed to\n            improving the quality of education in the rural areas of\n            Moldova.  Since its approval, the Project has steadily moved\n            toward achieving its PDO which has, throughout its lifetime,\n            oscillated between the ratings of moderately satisfactory\n            and satisfactory.  The latter has been the rating for the\n            past twelve months.  The PDO is measured through the\n            improvements in average learning in rural schools and the\n            reduction in the gap in achievements between rural and urban\n            schools.  The Project has, moreover, served as a catalyst in\n            jumpstarting education efficiency reform measures outlined\n            in the Government's Education Reform Program. This\n            five-month extension is being sought in order to avoid a\n            financing gap for the Project as the Additional Financing\n            (AF) of the Project, which was approved by the Board on\n            March 20, 2012, is not expected to be effective before the\n            current closing date of May 30, 2012.  The AF will be\n            effective once it is ratified by the Parliament of Moldova\n            which could take up to five months.  The original Project\n            was financed through a Grant and a Credit in the amounts of\n            SDR 3.6 million each (US$5 million equivalent, for a total\n            of US$10 million equivalent) to be implemented over a\n            four-year period.  The Project was approved on February 14,\n            2006, and became effective on August 7, 2006."}, "docdt": "2012-05-10T00:00:00Z"}
