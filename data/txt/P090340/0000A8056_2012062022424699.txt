                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         An Additional Financing to this Project was approved by the World Bank Board on March 20, 2012. The Additional Financing will become effective once it is ratified by the Moldovan
                         Parliament. The Project's closing date has been extended until October 2012 in order to avoid a gap in financing during Parliament's ratification process.
