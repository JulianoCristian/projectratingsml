It provides\n            for the financing of technical consultancy services in the\n            areas of management information and control systems,\n            productivity improvement, manpower planning and training.\n            The project would also finance the procurement of related\n            equipment for the SEEs and the training of staff in\n            implementing new systems. The project would, in addition,\n            finance technical assistance to the Borrower to strengthen\n            its external debt reporting system. The project would enable\n            the selected SEEs to increase the efficiency of their\n            operations through the improvement of specific and critical\n            areas of management. Success of the project could serve as\n            an example to other SEEs of the efficiency improvements that\n            can be achieved. The project would also strengthen the\n            Government's ability to compile and evaluate external\n            debt data rapidly and accurately."}, "docdt": "1984-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
