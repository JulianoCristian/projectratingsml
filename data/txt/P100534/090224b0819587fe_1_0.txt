                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Implementation progress has continued to catch up since the previous mission in September 2012. Disbursements have reached 25 percent (up from 16 percent in September) and
                         commitments remain at 54 percent of project funds. This momentum needs to be kept up by all implementation agencies, with close follow-up from Ministry of Labor and Ministry of
                         Planning and International Cooperation, so that the project completes its activities and reaches its new objectives by closing date in September 2013.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The following key next steps were agreed during the January 2013 mission wrap-up meeting:

                         Ministry of Labor/ Development and Coordination Unit (DCU) and Vocational Training Corporation will ensure that the piloting of new business, governance and training models in
                         three VTC Centers starts implementation in April 2013.

                         The contributions of the project to the institutional development of the E-TVET Sector must be widely disseminated in the remaining project implementation time. The DCU is to
                         conduct dissemination activities of tools and procedures developed and delivered by the project to raise stakeholders’ awareness and understanding, and to encourage stakeholders’
                         adoption of such tools in moving towards a more employer-driven orientation of the sector.

                         The Bank Team will continue to provide intensive implementation support over the remaining 8 months of the project's life.
                         Next mission is scheduled for March 10 - 14, 2013.
