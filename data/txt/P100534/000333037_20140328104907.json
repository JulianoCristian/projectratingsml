Some lessons learned\n            included: project design and supervision attempted to\n            minimize the political risk that was identified at appraisal\n            by situating the project firmly within the framework of the\n            Government-endorsed national agenda, and later the National\n            Employment Strategy, and by developing institutional\n            capacity and broader ownership among stakeholders. At\n            appraisal, the Government's high-profile endorsement of\n            the national agenda appeared to offer adequate assurances\n            that the Government will provide the leadership to achieve\n            the objectives of the project. There are important lessons\n            to be drawn where the project encountered three kinds of\n            problems with technical assistance: (i) unrealistic or\n            unclear terms of reference; (ii) lack of optimal\n            representation or appropriate skills on the part of\n            technical assistance (TA) evaluation committees, or to\n            subordination of quality factors to cost factors in\n            evaluation (including English language, evaluation of\n            technical proposals vis-a-vis TORs); and (iii) insufficient\n            supervision/ contract management of consultants. EDSDP\n            supervision benefited from an unusual degree of staff\n            continuity, with the same core team (albeit three Task Team\n            Leaders), sector manager, and sustained support from the\n            country management unit from project identification through\n            project completion. Staff continuity provided a strong\n            consistency of vision and supervision standards throughout\n            implementation, and contributed to the 'moderately\n            satisfactory' rating for Bank performance. Yet, as it\n            is clearly evident in this project, high quality supervision\n            cannot compensate for lack of Government commitment and weak ownership."}, "docdt": "2014-03-21T00:00:00Z"}
