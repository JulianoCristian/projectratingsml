This restructuring is to: 1) revise the\n            Project Development Objective (PDO); 2) revise project\n            components; 3) cancel component three (related to the E-TVET\n            fund); 4) revise the project's results framework; 5)\n            reallocate funds within expenditure categories; and 6)\n            cancel US$1.21 million from the loan, which is due to\n            revising activities under component one 'E-TVET council\n            development with employer participation' and cancelling\n            component three related to the E-TVET fund. The\n            restructuring will allow the project to focus on activities\n            that are relevant and realistic in the current country and\n            sector context. The disbursement rate is low at 17.2 percent\n            (US$1.3 million out of the total Loan amount of US$7.5\n            million) and the percentage of disbursed and committed funds\n            remains at 55 percent of total project funds, with net\n            commitments at US$2.15 million. The government of Jordan\n            (GOJ) has indicated that project activities after\n            restructuring can be completed by the original closing date,\n            and thus has not included a closing date extension in its\n            formal request."}, "docdt": "2013-02-05T00:00:00Z"}
