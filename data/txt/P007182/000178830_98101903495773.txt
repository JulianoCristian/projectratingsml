APPRAISAL OF AN EDUCATION PROJECT
SUTIMARY
i.     The Government of Guatemala has applied to the International Bank
for Reconstruction and Development for financial assistance to construct
and equip: (a) a secondary teacher training school at the national univ-
ersity; (b) an extension of the Technical Institute of Agriculture; and
(c) twenty-five new general secondary schools. During appraisal, ten
schools in item (c) were deleted by the Government but may be included
in a later request to the Bank.
ii.    National development plans call for changes at all levels of
education to assure an adequate response to manpower needs. This nec-
essitates expansion at the secondary level; better geographic distrib-
ution of public schools; increased provision for science and practical
subjects; a full-time, fully-qualified secondary teacher force; and
the initiation of post-secondary technical specializations in agriculture,
iii.   The project as now proposed is a first priority program of the
Government in its economic development plan. The teacher training school
would provide 700 places for an annual output of 300 and by 1974 would
satisfy about 85% of the estimated annual demand for secondary teachers.
The capacity of the Technical Institute of Agriculture would be raised
frcm 275 to 600: the annual output of "perito3" would triple and two-
thirds (80) of these would continue to complete "tecnico" level. Total
enrollment in the 15 general secondary schools would be 13,4OO with an
annual output of 2,600 graduates.  In aggregate the project would provide
for 14,700 places in the education system.
iv.    The supply of qualified entrants to project schools is assured
and job opportunities exist for those who do not proceed to further
study. The large size of the schools should effect economies in oper-
ation and would permit efficient use of staff on a full-time basis.
v.     Secondary schools would have new and improved curricula with
increased science and practical courses. There would also be advances
in secondary teacher training and agricultural education. All project
schools would be supplied with adequate, up-to-date and reasonably
priced equipment.
vi.    The project schools would be located in various zones in the
capital city and in nine other locations throughout the country not
adequately served by public education at this level.
vii * The teacher-training school would emphasize science, mathematics
and practical subjects to supply qualified teachers for new and existing
secondary schools.



ii
viii.     To initiate and operate the project, the Government has
requested additional technical assistance for the Technical Institute
of Agriculture from USAID and for the Secondary Teacher Training School
from UNDP. Programs will also be organized by the Ministry of Education
to give on-the-job training to principals and department heads of the
project schools.
ix.       The project schools are suitably located and satisfactory
sites have been selected and are being acquired. Schedules of accommodation
are economical and consistent with functional needs. Estimated cost
is based upon austere construction standards and is reasonable. Contract
awards and procurement would conform to international competitive bidding
procedures.
x.        A project office responsible for construction and maintenance
would be set up by the Government to implement the project. It would
operate in close liaison with the staff training and curriculum revision
units of the Ministry of Education. Employment of private architects
would be necessary. Competent local building contractors are available.
xi.       The estimated cost of the project is US$l2,6 million, with
a US$1.0 milflion allowance for the cost of land and the project office
and with a US$3.6 million foreign exchange component. Approximately
54% of the US$11.6 million is for constructicri of school buildings for
instructional purposes, 3% for dormitories and staff housing, 9% for site
development, 16% for furniture and equipment, 7% for professional services
and 11% for contingencies. The disbursement period would be about four
years.
xii.      With the fiscal measures recently taken, the Government can
meet its share of the capital cost of the proposed project and the
consequential recuirrent expenditures, which have been accorded priority
in the public investment program and the budget.
xiii.     The project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of
US$6.3 million for a period of 25 years including a grace period of 10
years.



APPRAISAL OF ALT EDUCATION PROJECT IN GUATE2ALA
1. INTRODUCTICN
The Request
1.01    The Government has applied to the International Bank for Recon-
struction and Development for financial assistance for an education pro-
ject. Unesco identified the project in 1965 and subsequently assisted
in its preparation. Changes in Government and the need for a cooperative
agreement between the Ministry of Education and the national university
on secondary teacher training caused some delays.  The Ministry and the
University reached an accord in February 1967, following Bank/Unesco
discussions with the Government. Adjustments were then made in the items
originally identified and the formal request wjas presented to the Bank
in September 1967.
1.02    The project as modified during appraisal and now recommended includes
construction of and equipment for:
(i) a training center at the national University of
San Carlos to prepare and upgrade secondary school
teachers;
(ii) extension and improvement of the Technical Insti-
tute of Agriculture; and
(iii)  fifteen new general secondary schools.
The major change from the original request was the deletion of 10 general
secondary schools in the capital city.  The Government decided to postpone
these due to a shortage of qualified teachers but may include them with
other education and training needs in a later request to the Bank. Due
to the urgent need for teachers, the Government wfill now open the Secon-
dary Teacher Training School in January 1969, using temporary facilities.
1.03    This report is based on an appraisal of the project undertaken
by Messrs. M?. Adamson (general educator), K. Blakey (economist), W. Moller
(secondary and technical educator, Unesco), R. Tellez IfMolina (agricul-
tural educator, FAO) and J. Kulski (consultant/architect) in January-
February 1968.
Salient Socio-Economic Factors
1.04    Location:  Guatemala is the northernmost of the Central American
republics and its area of about 109,30D km2 fronts on both the Pacific and
Atlantic oceans. The country is divided by mountain ranges into three
regions: the Pacific slope, most prosperous from an economic viewpoint,
being well suited for agriculture and with a developing manufacturing
industry and communication network; the northwest Atlantic slope, which
is most isolated and farthest behind in development but offers extensive



- 2 -
agricultural potential; and the northeast Honduran Gulf region, to a
large extent arid but capable of irrigation and pcssessTng a potential
for m 1ning activity.  Tl-.e rugged diversity of topcgraphy has made com-
munication and economic and social integration di-liicult.  Among the
indigenous groups intercommunication has been so limited that miore than
20 different Indian dialects are spoken although the official language
is Spanish.
1.05    Population:  The population growth rate is 3.1% per year and
latest estimates based on the 1964 census give a total of 4.7 million
inhabitants. As 52,% are under 19 years of age, there is a heavy pressure
on the school system.  Population is irregularly distributed with 35d
urban and   65% rural, with the latter mostly in villages of less than
1,000 inhabitants. Five provinces have 500 of the population while in
the other 17 distribution is sparse (Annex 1). This concentration is
accentuated by migration to the more favorable economic and social oppor-
tunities in the capital city which has more than 15%J of the total popu-
lation and a growth rate in excess of 6% per year. The rural dispersion
and the growing concentration in the capital city create difficulties
for public services, contribute to a high index of illiteracy, make for
an unbalanced national market and leave large areas with natural resources
unexploited. Conditioned by these population growth and distribution
trend; national development policy requires the education sector to pro-
vide greater opportunities outside, as well as in, Guatemala City.
1.06    Economic Situation:  Industry has been the most rapidly increas-
ing sector in recent years but agriculture continues as the prime (29%)
contributor to GDP. From 1955 to 1966 agriculture production increased
by 60% and manufacturing by 10%.   The growth rate of GDP was 4.7% in
1967 and prospects are that this rate will continue in 1968. Official
estimates project this level through 1972. Influenced largely by the
demand for agricultural products, the rate of increase of GDP has fluc-
tuated sharply since 1960, with a high of 10% in 1963 and a low of 0% in
1965 and an average of 4.5%. Per capita income is estimated at $302;
unemployment, concentrated among the illiterate majority segment of the
population, is estimated at 10%. The tradition of having experts from
abroad operate or manage principal business enterprises or provide essen-
tial technical and advisory services is changing. Industrial employers
are relying increasingly on better qualified local workers as they be-
come available to the labor market.
1.07    Labor Force:                      The labor force was estimated
at 1.4 million in 1966 with the following distribution by sectors:   63.3%,
in agriculture; 15.2% in industry; and 21.5% in services (Annex 2). An
education profile indicates 0.68% of the labor force has had higher ed-
ucation; 1.9% high school education; and 8.9% primary education (para.
4.01). Over 60% of the total population age 7 and above is illiterate.
The economy has development prospects but a principal constraint
is the lack of people with appropriate levels of training and education.
1.08    Development Plans:  To enable Guatemalans to participate more ac-



- 3 -
tively at all levels of economic life, government development planning
gives high priority to improvement and expansion of the education and
training system. A new comprehensive program for economic development
is in preparation for 1972-76.  As a preludethe education sector is
completing a 3-year plan for 1969-71.
2. EDUCATION AND TRAINING
Administration and Structure
'.Ol    The formal education system comprises four levels:  pre-primary,
)rimary, secondary and higher, with the Ministry of Education responsible
Cor all education except higher education and certain specialized sclhools
tChart 1). Private schools require government authorization to operate,
ire subject to inspection and must meet official standards.
?.02    Administration of the education system is highly centralized
(Chart 2). A'lthough various Directorates exist, the Ilinister of Education
Cormulates policy, prescribes educational legislation and regulates by de-
3ree the curricula, syllabi, diploma awards and appointment of teachers.
3upervisors in each province inspect and advise on programs and perform-
mnce but have no financial control as this is exercised for individual
schools by the Controller in the Ministry. An Office of Integral Plan-
aing of Education is established by law to plan and program the system.
Preparation of the proposed project brought this Office into a close work-
ing relationship with the National Economic Planning Council, the Ministry
af Finance and the universities. The benefits have become evident and
the interchange arrangement is to be maintained.
R.03    Pre-primary education begins at age four, attendance is voluntary
and enrollment insignificant. The six-year obligatory primary school
starts at age seven and is followed by a three-year first or basic cycle
secondary school program. The latter can be terminal, but selected
students. may progress into a second, diversified cycle of two or three
years. They may take an academic, primary teacher training, commercial,
agricultural or technical industrial program leading to a "bachillerato"
or other diploma of graduation and entitlement for examination for en-
trance to the university.
Growth of the System
2.04    Demand at all levels has caused expansion of the system, as is
reflected in the enrollment pattern for the past ten years:

289                 198,329    22,7              0.0
Primary Education
2.05    In the past ten years enrollment in primary school has grown from
34.8% to 43.4% of the relevant age group. Education at this level suffers
from unequal distribution (74% of urban school age population attend vs.
23% of rural); inadequate facilities (78% of rural public schools have
no classes beyond grade 3); high dropout rates (72% in urban and 98% in
rural areas for the 1960 cohort); and an uneven student/teacher ratio
(range in 1966 was from 14 to 100 pupils per teacher with 1:38 as the
national average). Overall, less than 70%,, and in the case of rural areas
only 40%, of the teachers are qualified. Private schools take 214% of
total enrollment, with class size often higher and teacher preparation
level lower than for public schools.
2.06    Government actions to remedy these conditions include a pilot
plan for unitary schools and automatic promotion for the first three
grades. A policy to convert rural schools to offer six years and, in
other cases to feed into regional schools, is to be implemented (para.4.03).
Thus the flow of students through the primary system should improve. The
quality of education should be enhanced as free textbooks are becoming
available (500,000 distributed in 1966) and as the upgrading program for
in-service teachers, especially rural, is strengthened.
Secondary Level Education
2.07    Enrollment and Programs:  About 75% of those completing primary
school go on to secondary level in which enrollment has trebled in the
last decade but still constitutes only 6W6 of the estimated age group.
The share of private education during this period has grown from 34% to
51% (Annex 3). The concentration of enrollment in primary teacher train-
ing programs and commercial courses (Annex 4) is not consistent with em-
ployment opportunities and the quality of secondary education suffers
from lack of provision of adequate facilities for courses in science
and technical subjects. On the average, during the past 10 years about
40% of secondary school entrants completed their 5- or 6-year course.
Programs of study prescribed by the Ministry for all schools tend to em-
phasize theoretical aspects rather than practical application and problem
solving. Instructional materials are very limited; textbooks must be
purchased by students and while adequate in supply are costly and of
variable quality.



2.08    Classrooms:  W4ith the rapid increase of demand, schools have en-
rolled beyond normal capacity,e.g., 440 pupils in 8 classrooms designed
for 280. Shift use of buildings by several institutions is commron,e.g.,
morning for first cycle, afternoon for normal school and evening for
commercial. Existing Government schools have inadequate laboratory and
workshop space and equipment.
2.09    Teacher Supply:  The supply of teachers is inadequate in quantity
and inferior in quality. In 1965,out of a teaching force of 6,291, almost
entirely part-time, only 65 (Annex 5) had the full qualifications required
by law, viz., a three-year university course. Pre- and in-service teacher
training programs have existed as an adjunct of the Faculty of Humanities
of the national University of San Carlos but few complete such programs.
This is because the program is only a subsidiary responsibility of the
Faculty, cooperative arrangements with the employing authority--Ministry
of Education--have not existed and incentives are lacking for teachers to
pursue the program as in practice appointment and promotion are often
based cn personal factors and seniority rather than appropriateness of
education and quality of performance.  The practice of utilizing teachers
on a part-time basis, with employment in several schools on the same day,
also has adverse effects.
2.10    Technical Education:  There are four industrial schools and two
vocational technical institutes for boys and one for girls. At basic
secondary cycle the industrial school courses include electricity, print-
ing, radio and television. Their low level of intake (after grade 6),
age of pupils (13 to 14), poor equipment and insufficient staff make the
schools unsuitable for vocational training. The vocational technical in-
stitutes operate at second cycle level and offer three-year programs of
study. The girls school which gives courses in handcrafts, the arts and
home economics is poorly housed, badly equipped and not very effective.
Programs at the two institutes for boys lead to an industrial "bachil-
lerato," with courses including general mechanics, foundry work and con-
struction trades. Pupils spend over 40% of their time in '-torkshops and
use vacation periods for practical work in local industry, often leading
to first employment on graduation.  The institute in Guatemala City,
established in 1961 with U. S.technical assistance, has a capacity for
1,000 students and a current enrollment of 800. About one-third of the
output goes on to attempt university studies. This institute, in coopera-
tion with the national university, is starting a course to prepare techni-
cal teachers (Annex 5).  The other school in Mazatenango, equipped and
staff ed with assistance from the Federal Republic of Germany, has a capacity
of 270 and an annual intake of 100. The first class graduated last year
and all found employment, though with some delay.  Both institutes are
excellently equipped and well operated.
2.11    Agricultural Education:  The pattern of agricultural education is
shown in Chart 4. The only secondary level program in agriculture is
offered under the Ministry of Agriculture at the Technical Institute of
Agriculture at Villa Nueva, where it has 200 hectares of farm and 600
hectares of forest land. It was established in 1967 through consolidation



- 6 -
of the National School of Agriculture (1921) and the Central American School
of Forestry (1957) in an effort to respond to manpower needs at middle
level. At present a three-year ttperito'l program is offered following corm-
pletion of basic cycle secondary; because of limitations of physical
facilities and of trained faculty only one-third of the qualified candidates
can be admitted (Annex 6). It is planned to expand enrollment at "perito"
level and to add in 1969 two-year post-secondary "tecnico"l specializations
in natural resources, animal husbandry, crop production and agricultural
mechanics. A joint committee of the institute, the University of San
Carlos and technical advisers of USAID is responsible with the Ministry
of Agriculture for this development.
2.12    Introduction of new curricula and teaching techniques has been
handicapped by lack of facilities in all types of secondary education ex-
cept vocational technical for boys. Given the flood of enrollment and
the deficiencies of the teaching force, educational plant and instructional
materials, the result is secondary schools of low quality and limited
output. Prerequisites to improvement are a closer control of entry to
secondary education, improved facilities and more qualified teachers.
Youth and Adult Education
2.13   The ~provision of evening programs of primary and secondary education
for working youths who dropped out of school is a promising adjunct of the
education system. A variety of training courses are being offered by the
Ministry of Education wnd other Government entities (Chart 1). These are
illustrative of the extension of Government interest in educat;ional train-
ing at all levels and for all ages both in and outside the formal education
system.
Higher Education
2.1L    The national University of San Carlos founded in 1678 and three
private institutions--University Rafael Landivar, University of the Valley
and University Mariano Galvez--established within the past five years pro-
vide higher education. An initial general studies program of two years is
followed by specialization for L-5 years leading to a "licenciaturari; at
the national university further studies lead to the doctorate. Each uni-
versity has its main campus in the capital city. There is an encouraging
trend to establish branch campuses or extension programs in other parts
of the country. The University of San Carlos receives an annual subven-
tion of not less than 2½% of total budgetable expenses of the nation.
The others are privately supported by fees and donations.
2.15    University enrollment has more than doubled in the ten years to
1967 (para. 2.0h). Over 50% of secondary school graduates enter university,
one-third of whom come from public secondary schools. Of those admitted to
the national university 13.h% graduate. Traditionally, the concentration
of enrollment has been in law, economics and medicine. The initiation of
the common general studies core in 1964 has laid the groundwork for chang-
ing the distribution pattern toward technical and scientific fields (Annex 7)



- 7 -
2.16   Post-secondary agricultural education is presently provided only
at the Faculties of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine of the University
of San Carlos. These have the lowest intake and enrollment of any faculty
in Guatemala City (Annex 7). Average annual output over 10 years has been
five in agriculture and, since the first graduating class in 1962, seven in
veterinary medicine. This later faculty operates as a regional school for
Central America.  Recently a close uorking relationship has been estab-
lished between the University and the Technical Institute of Agriculture;
this could lcad to an ir.proved flow of students to the University.  No
provisicn exists for agricultural teacher training, w.-hich must be obtained
abroad.
School Building
2.17   Throughout Guatemala existing school buildings are extremely over-
crowded, poorly maintained, usually antiquated and functionally inappro-
priate (para. 2.08).
2.18   Design and Planning:  The Ministry of Public Works is technically
charged with this responsibility for nll public buildings. However, since
1960 when the Education Iinistry set up a School Constructicn Office,
the Ministry of Public Wiorks has only been marginally involved in the design
and construction of school buildings.  Neither Ministry is staffed with
qualified school architects or school building specialists and school
architects in private practice are seldom employed. Schoo'ls built by the
Committee have often been designed without due consideration of education
and climatic requirements and are generally substandard in construction.
Indigenous building materials, conditions and skills have not been used
to advantage. Modern facilities exist at some private schools, designed
by local and foreign architects in private practice.
2.19   Construction:  The building construction industry consists of
about a dozen large local firms including some subsidiaries of foreign
contractors. During the last three years there has been more than US$55
million equivalent value of construction annually. Local contracting
firms could expand to handle increased construction demands. The tender-
ing and contract awards system presently used is satisfactory.
2.20   Construction costs in Guatemala are reasonable.  Local building
materials are plentiful; skilled labor is available in all major cities;
and adequate roads assure access and economical transportation of labor
and materials. Detailed attention to the choice of building method and
materials and careful supervision of construction would assure more
economical buildings.
2.21   Furniture: School furniture of satisfactory quality and reason-
able costs is produced in Guatemala City. The Ministry of Education
also has an emergency program for school furniture construction at the
Technical Vocational Institute in Guatemala City (para. 2.10).
2.22   Maintenance:  Maintenance of government buildings has generally
been a responsibility of the Ministry of Public Works. Funds for main-
tenance of existing school buildings and the present organization are



- 8 -
grossly inadequate and even recently constructed schools show signs of
neglect. In 1967, a small school maintenance section with an inadequate
budget was established in the Ministry of Education.
3. INVESTMENT IN EDUCATION
Present Expenditures
3.01      Recurrent expenditure on education by the Government has
increased about 50% from 1963 to present (Annex 8). In 1966 these recurrent
expenditures totalled US$26.5 million equivalent. At the same time input
from the private sector has risen to an estimated US$6.6 million equivalent
(Annex 9).
3.02      Of the government expenditure in 1966 for public schools and
the National University, 62% was for primary, 19% for secondary and 12%
for higher education (Annex 9). Government is providing about 60% of
the financial resources utilized by secondary education (Annex 9).  The
1963-67 annual average of less than US$2 million for capital expenditures
was totally inadequate (Annex 8).
3.03      Foreign Aid: Guatemala has obtained loans, grants and technical
assistance for education development from bilateral and multilateral sources
Major inputs have been from USAID for primary education (rural classroom
construction-US$2.1 million, rural primary teacher training, textbook
development and planning) and from IDB at the University of San Carlos
(US$780,000 for basic sciences and other facilities). There has been little
external assistance for secondary education other than the substantial
inputs by USAID and the Federal Repuolic of Germany for vocational
education (para. 2.10).
Financial Aspects
3.04      Recognizing the need for continued and expanded investment
in education to augment the supply of trained and trainable manpower, the
Government plans further increases in expenditures for education in the
years ahead. The need at all levels of education for expansion and
improvement is to be met by a major investment program for the next three
years, to be continued at a diminished rate through 1975. Substantial and
sustained growth in recurrent expenditures will follow. This program is
reflected in the following estimates:

1/  Ministry of Education and University of San Carlos expenditures only,
estimated on the basis of Ministry of Finance data and OPIE studies
of development of enrollments, staffing and curriculum development.
3.05      The main financial problems of the education planners are
reflected in the relation of these projected expenditures to planned
enrollment and output of the system. Expansion of recurrent expenditures
must be achieved, first, in order to remedy poor conditions in existing
schools due to inadequate staff, supplies and maintenance, and then to cover
operating costs of new schools. Owing to present financial stringency,
the first of these requirements must be the object of a long-term program.
The recurrent costs generated by the education investment program will have
a delayed impact and, with the effects of tax measures being taken this
year, public revenue could in the 1970's provide for these costs. In
addition, it is proposed that provincial and local bodies which at present
make no significant contribution to education finance should bear an
increasing share of the burden of recurrent costs but this has not affected
the central government estimates given above.
3.06      The estimated allocation of expenditures required by the
education plan is as follows:
ALLOCATION OF EXPENDITURES

3.07      With the tax measures taken this year, the Government
should be able to cover the projected outlays on capital account which
reflect the priority given to investment in education in the total investment
program.
3.08      Current and capital expenditures for secondary and further
agricultural education are part of the budget of the Ministry of Agriculture.
while higher level is included in the University of San Carlos budget.
Wqhile these constitute minor items of expenditure, aggregate allocations
have risen from US$546,00o in 1962 to $711,600 in 1967 and are expected to
grow at a comparable rate to 1975.
3.09      Plans for financing education development, including external
public loans, and for more liberal provision for recurrent expenditures,
are well devised and realistic. They match projected disbursements which
are aligned with educational needs and manpower requirements.

4. NEED FOR THE PROJECT
Manpower for Development
4.01      The difficulty of supplying manpower needs for development stems
mainly from inadequacies of the education system. Over 60% of the working
age population is illiterate and the average education level of the
remainder is low (Annex 2). Estimates of future employment opportunities
based on overall expansion in production at 4.7% a year (made up of 4% in
agriculture, 6.2% in industry and 4.6% in services, with productivity
increasing at 2%, 3% and 1% respectively in the three sectors) would require
an increase in trained personnel at all levels. That means an increase in
demand for university graduates of the order of 5% a year; for secondary
school graduates 6% and primary school graduates 6%. In addition, an
existing deficiency at each of these levels remains to be supplied. The
following distribution of employment opportunities results from the addition
of growth requirements for manpower to the existing deficiencies:

Central America (CSUCA) documents and Office of Integral Planning of

2/ Actual employment, as estimated, does not show the unsatisfied demand for
more highly qualified personnel.
National Planning and the Education Sector
4.02      The Government has begun preparation of an economic plan for 1972-76
as the existing plan for 1965-69 is obsolete as a guide for development
programming. Education has led the way in this reconstruction of planning
for national development. The Office of Integral Planning of Education in
consultation with The National Planning Office and the Ministries of Finance
and Education has established the main outlines and much of the project content
of a Three-Year Education Plan 1969-71. This bridges the gap between the
1965-69 plan and the projected comprehensive plan for 1972-76.
4.03      Sector Goals:  New plans for education include these prime
objectives.. (i)improvement of primary education with special emphasis on the
adaptation of teaching in rural areas to local conditions and extension of
opportunities for children to complete primary school (para. 2.06); (ii)
reconstruction of the secondary school system with focus on adjustment of
programs to manpower requirements, better distribution of educational
opportunity and improved teacher quality (paras. 2.07 to 2.09);



- 12 -
(iii) expansion and amplification of training for agriculture based
primarily on extension of the Technical Institute of Agriculture (paras.
2.11, 2.12); (iv) extension and improvement of higher education at both
the University of San Carlos and in independent universities with continuing
emphasis on increased output in the critical fields of agriculture, science
and industry (para. 2.10).
4.04      To implement this plan the Government has, in its estimates for
public investment (paras. 3.oh1, 3.06), given first priority to these
education projects and has approved important supporting measures. It has
also applied to multilateral and bilateral agencies, including USAID and
IDB, for financial and technical support.
Secondary Education Development Targets
4.05      The planned enrollment target for secondary education in 1980
is 115,000 (Annex 4), with the further aim of increasing the proportion
of public sector enrollment to 60% (Annex 3). This constitutes an
average annual increase of almost 5,000 during 1970-80. This estimate is
minimal as it does not incorporate provision for the increased flow
through primary education which should result from new and projected
initiatives (para. 2.06). Improvement in the quality of secondary education
and its reorientation in line with economic and social development needs
is as important as the quantitative objective.
Manpower Implications of Educational Plans
4.o6      The education sector target would provide a supply of graduates
as close to the prospective demands shown in para. 4.01 above as is
feasible within the means available. This is illustrated by the following
estimates, which allow for present deficiencies, replacements and development
requirements.

* See para. 4.01 and footnote.



- 13 -
4.07   The program is actually the first stage of the plan to meet man-
power requirements. By raising the job potential of graduates at all
levels, it would prepare the way for the next stage-- the development
of vocational training and particularly in-service training in agricul-
ture, industry and services.
h.o8   Secondary Teacher Supply:  National educational objectives also
call for creation of a full-time, fully-qualified teaching force for the
secondary schools by 1980. The output target is 3,440 new teachers and
1,300 retrained. This necessitates the establishment of a training
institution to provide teachers in the quantity and of the quality
required (para. 2.09).
4.09 About 2,900 new full-time qualified teachers will be needed
between 1971-1980 to handle targeted enrollment (para. 4.05). Output
of the projected Secondary Teacher Training School should fill 85% of
this need and the remainder would come from other universities and the
exterior. Overall demand for and supply of qualified teachers is
summarized as follows:_

time equivalent) is al.ar izrerat4ve as tbaes are at bent only noninally

from the Government.
4.11   Agricultural training:  The most important opportunities for devel-
opment in the economay are in agriculture and processing of agricultural
products. However, although agriculture provides employment for 63% of
the work force and makes the largest sectoral contribution to national
output, its needs in terms of overall planning and specialist manpower
have been neglected. At present extension services and other forms of
in-service training for agriculture are rudimentary and the demand for
technicians for both private and public enterprise cannot be supplied.
To some extent these deficiencies are compensated by technical assistance
especially for development projects. However, to improve the situation
an expanded institutional base is essential for training for future
needs including replacement of technical assistance personnel.



5. THE PROJECT
General
5.01   The proposed project involves the construction of and equipment
for (i) a new Secondary Teacher Training School; (ii)  additions to
an existing Technical Institute of Agriculture; and (iii) 15 newi general
secondary schools.
5.02   The anticipated enrollment and annual output of project schools
when in full operation (1974), together with estimated capital cost, is

7/  Excludes $1,000,CCO for cost of land and project office.
NOTE:  Further details presented in Annex 10 ald 11.
5.03   Location of proposed secondary schools accords with the geographic
distribution of population (Map 1) and is consistent with government pol-
icy (para. 4.03) to make public secondary education more available in
provincial areas and in heavily populated residential zones of the capital
outside the central commercial area (Map 2).
5.04   The construction would include 269 classrooms, 56 laboratories,
91 workshops and 96 special subject rooms (Annex 10). The emphasis on
practical--teaching spaces reflects the needs of new programs under the
project -- practical courses in diversified cycle secondary schools;
"teenico" spocializations in agriculture at the post-secondary level; and
the secondary teacher training curriculum at the national university
(Chart 1). Double-bunk boarding accommodation and a minimum of staff
housing are included for the Technical Institute of Agriculture (Annex 10)
which draws its students from throughout the nation. Boarding and staff
housing will not be required at other project schools as they will be
located closer to student and staff supply.
5.05   Lists of equipment presented by the Government for project schools
are adequate and economical.

Elements of the Project
5.06      Secondary Teacher Training School: This new institution at
the national University of San Carlos would annually enroll 700 full-time
day students and offer training courses to about 180 in-service teachers.
The annual output of 300 new teachers and 75 in-service teachers would
contribute about 85% of the new and 50% of the retrained personnel
required to fulfill the objective of a fully-qualified secondary school
staff by 1980 (para.4.07).
5.07      The school would function under the cooperative sponsorship of
the University and the Ministry of Education by an accord reached in
February 1967 (para. 2.09). The curricula patterms which have been jointly
developed include a pre-service program to extend two years beyond a year
of general studies required of all university students; and one for in-service
teachers to be adjusted in terms of previous education and experience.
Practice teaching at the demonstration school to be built on the University
site as part of the project will be supplemented by practice classes in
other secondary schools throughout the country. Wqhile training would be
provided in most fields of teaching specialization, emphasis will be on
science, mathematics and practical subjects. The new facilities are to be
available in 1971, but will begin on a limited basis in 1969 using temporary
facilities.
5.08      Full-time students will be recruited and selected from the
University's general education program which should be an adequate source
(Annex 7). Teacher trainees will not be required to pay university fees.
The university will provide 100 scholarships annually of Q 500 each and
the Ministry of Education 150 of Q 1000 each, and an assurance to this
effect has been obtained from the government. Acceptance of an award
would involve a commitment to teach an equivalent number of years after
graduation. The Ministry of Education has given assurance that, beginning with
the graduating class of 1971, graduates of the school will receive
preference for new or vacant positions; secondly, they will be placed on
the salary schedule at a step which gives recognition to their level of
training; thirdly, all those employed would be full-time teachers. Thus,
there should be no difficulty in placement (para. 4.11).
5.09      The school will need a full-time day teaching staff of 33, with
six additional for the in-service program. Cualified staff would be
available locally for the limited enrollment of the first year, but beyond
that point a shortage would exist. A request has been sent to UNDP for
technical assistance over a five-year period and for fellowships for
Guatemalans for further training. The proposal presented is adequate and
appropriate and should coineide with beginning operations of the school.
The acquiring of such technical assistance and the provision of evidence
to the Bank that all other necessary steps have been taken by government
to create and operate the school are conditions of effectiveness.
5.10      Technical Institute of Agriculture: New workshops, laboratories
and dormitories, plus renovation of existing academic, administrative and
communal facilities would permit the Institute to increase enrollment
from 275 to 600; to triple its output at the "perito"' level with a revised
modernized curriculum; and to begin the new two-year post-secondary
technician specializations (para.2.11) w,hich would graduate 80 annually
(Annex 6).



- 16 -
The latter should be a valuable source of students to augment enrollment
in agricultural and veterinary medicine at the University (para. 2.16).
The "perito"' diploma will be awarded by the Yinistry of Agriculture and
that for "tecnico" jointly with the University of San Carlos. An ample
supply of qualified candidates exists (Anniex 6) and employment opportunities
are excellent.
5.11      A staff of 35 teachers, mostly full-time, will be needed.
Through upgrading of present and other selected staff via fellowship study
abroad, these could be Guatemalan personnel by about 197h. In the interim
an extension of the USAID technical assistance program would provide
additional advisory service and supplementary teaching and training resources.
5.12      General Secondary Schools: The 15 new schools would provide
facilities for program improvements (para. 2.12) at both basic and
diversified cycles. Initially, enrollment will be concentrated at the
basic cycle; however, 1l schools will offer both cycles, with facilities
allowing for flexibility in curricula. The curriculum for the basic cycle
will remain largely as at present but afford greater opportunity for
practical work in science and industrial arts. At the diversified or upper
cycle improved facilities will be available for commercial and academic
streams and for the new practical stream. Courses of study will be adapted
to the requirements of pre-vocational training, making pupils better
suited to enter specialized training or employment with on-the-job training.
5.13      Present and projected enrollment of output from primary level
is such that the approximately 3,900 new places at seventh grade in project
schools will only partially fill the demand in Guatemala City but would
adequately meet the demand for places in the provinces. The Government
plans scholarships and travel grants for poorer pupils both in rural and
urban areas. The provision of these in adequate number has been assured
by the Government. The overall retention rate should improve (para. h.06)
although attrition at the end of basic cycle could increase significantly
by 1974 unless the additional facilities envisioned in government plans
(para. 4.13) are provided at diversified cycle. To ensure that secondary
education development is in accordance with projected needs and to safeguard
the quality of education in the project schools, assurances have been
obtained from the Government that the enrollment levels for the project
secondary schools (Annex 11) will be adhered to.
5.14      Secondary Teacher Supply:  The teacher requirements for the
project secondary schools are given in Annex 12. An initial core of
teachers and administrators can be obtained by redeployment from existing
schools. Full staffing of project schools will be dependent on output
of the secondary teacher training school, whose first graduates (about 150)
will be available for employment in 1971, the year the project secondary
schools begin operation. By 197hs the schools should be in full operation
and the secondary teacher training school would be providing a supply of
qualified teachers to satisfy demand (para. 4.09). Therefore, the
secondary teacher training school should enrol about 200 in January, 1969
and a program for the in-service training of school administrators and
supervisors be initiated by 1970. Assurances have been obtained from the
Government on these points.



- 17 -
5.15      To ensure greatest possible improvement in project and other
secondary school output the Government has given assurance that it wrill.
(i) staff the schools with qualified teachers on a full-time basis; and
(ii) appoint trained personnel as directors and supervisors.

5.17      Unit costs used in the above estimates are based upon those for
recently constructed school buildings in Guatemala. Costs per square
meter of $70.00 for one-story and of $80.00 for two-story schools in
Guatemala City are considered reasonable. In other parts of Guatemala
construction costs vary from a 5%, to a 15% increase because of transportation
rates and labor availability.
5.18      Site development costs include construction of roads, covered
walkways and utilities. A contingency of 13% of the estiimated project
cost is included for expected increases in building costs and unforeseen
items.
5.19      Capital cost per student place is about $933 for the secondary
teacher training school, $645 for basic and diversified cycle secondary
schools and $540 for basic cycle secondary schools, which is considered
reasonable. The capital costs include all items (Annex 11) except
contingencies, cost of land and project office. The foreign exchange
component ranges from 15% for site development to 95% for equipment.



- 18 -
5.20      Annual recurrent costs are estimated at about $3,hoOD,OO and
will be provided by the Government of Guatemala. Approximately 13% of
the recurrent costs will be provided by the University of San Carlos,
15% by the Ministry of Agriculture and 72% by the Ministry of Education.
Construction
5.21      Land: The Ministry of Education has selected and is acquiring
sites for the proposed secondary schools; the Technical Institute of
Agriculture has ample land for expansion; and the Secondary Teacher
Training School will be located on University of San Carlos property.
All of the 17 required sites have been approved. Assurances have been
obtained that sites not yet acquired at time of signing the loan agreement
will be obtained within six months after signing.
5.22      Accommodations: Classroom sizes are between 1.4 and 1.7m  per
student and are considered reasonable. Other teaching spaces and communal
facilities are based on equally reasonable space standards.
Implementation
5.23      Architects acceptable to the Bank will be commissioned to
design all project schools and be responsible for the preparation of
master plans, preliminary designs, site studies3 working drawings and
specifications, supervision of tendering, contract awards and construction
work. and should authorize payment.  Employment of such architects is
a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan.
5.24      Provision for maintenance would be included in the recurrent
expenditure budget of the Ministry of Education for general secondary
schools, the University of San Carlos for Secondary Teacher Training
School, and the Ministry of Agriculture for the Technical Institute of
Agriculture.
5.25      A full-time Project Director acceptable to the Bank has been
selected and is to be attached to the Ministry of Public Works. His
appointment is a condition of signing the proposed loan. To assure
maximum efficiency in implementation the Project Director should have
overall responsibility for the project and be directly responsible to the
Minister. The Project Director's office, which should be established prior
to the effectiveness of the proposed loan, should consist of the following
divisions: architectural; equipment procurement; and accounting. A
committee composed of the representatives of the Ministries of Public Works,
Education, Finance and Agriculture and of the University of San Carlos
should be formed to advise the Director on interrelated aspects of the
project.
5.26.     Procurement for building construction, equipment and furniture
would follow international competitive bidding procedures.



- 19 
Financing of the Project
5.27      The total cost of the project is estimated at US$12.6 million,
of which the foreign exchange component is presently estimated at
US$3.6 million.  The proposed Bank loan of US$6.3 million would finance
50% of the total project costs.
Disbursements
5.28      For equipment and professional services, the Bank would
disburse 100% of the foreign exchange costs thereof. For construction
contracts and furniture, the Bank would disburse on the basis of a
percentage which is presently established at 45% of the total cost of
these items. For the cost of land and project office, there will be
no disbursement. In case of an increase in the total cost of the project
(including the contingencies), the percentage would be adjusted in the
following order of priority:
(i) to maintain, to the extent practicable, an
average contribution of 50% by the Bank towards
the total cost of the project;
(ii) to maintain the Bank's contribution towards the
foreign exchange cost of equipment and professional
services at 100% thereof; and
(iii) to spread disbursements throughout the period
required to execute the project.
If the total costs were less than estimated, the contribution of the
Bank would be maintained at 50% thereof and would, consequently, be lower
than US$6.3 million. Expenditures incurred prior to the signing of the
loan will not be eligible for reimbursement.
6. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      A deficiency of educated and trained manpower is one of the
main restraints on economic and social development in Guatemala. The
proposed project would improve the training for secondary school teaching ,
expand programs of agricultural technician training and enhance the
supply and quality of secondary school graduates. It would be of special
significance in meeting middle-levrel manpower requirements of educationl,
agriculture and industry (paras. 4.01, 4.o6).
6.02      The Secondary Teacher Training School would be established by
the national university in cooperation with the Ministry of Education.
Training in science, mathematics and practical subject areas would be
emphasized. School output would become available in 1971 coinciding with
teacher demand for the project secondary schools (paras. 4.09, 5.07).



- 20 -
6.03      The reorganized Technical Institute of Agriculture would
expand enrollment, improve curriculum at "perito" level and start
two-year specializations at post-secondary level in cooperation with
the University of San Carlos. These outputs would contribute toward
fulfillment of current and future needs of agricultural production and
services (paras. 2.11, 5.10).
6.o1      The required intake for the proposed 15 general secondary
schools is assured and output can be absorbed by the employment market.
The new facilities would permit introduction of modern curricula and
teaching techniques to improve the quality of secondary schools and
increase the overall productivity of the system (paras. 4.06, 5.13).
6.05      The location of the schools accords with distribution of
school age population and priorities established by national planning
policy (para. 5.03).
6.06      Schedules of accommodation, equipment and furniture lists
are adequate and cost estimates are reasonable. All procurement will
be by international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines
(paras. 5.05, 5.22, 5.26).
6.07      With the tax measures taken, the Government is expected to
be able to meet its share of project costs and cover the recurrent
expenditures generated by the project when it would be in operation
(paras. 3.05, 3.07).
6.08      The proposed project would be an integral part of the overall
education sector plan within the National Development Program. It
would mesh with other projects prepared for consideration for external
assistance to expand the improved primary (USAID) and higher (IDB)
education. Liaison with these entities has been established and
effective coordination of efforts is anticipated (paras. h.02, 4.0h).
6.09      The technical assistance required for the Secondary
Teacher Training School has been requested from UNDP which initiated
preliminary operations in August 1968 (para. 5.09). The Technical
Institute of Agriculture is receiving technical assistance from USAID
which has been requested to expand its program in coordination with
project requirements (para. 5.f1).
6.10      Assurances have been obtained from the Government on the
following:
(i) completion of appropriate in-service training progrgms
by all unqualified secondary school teachers (para. 4.10);
(ii) revision of teacher appointment conditions to give
recognition for training at the Secondary Teacher
Training School (para. 5.08);



- 21 -
(iii)  provision of scholarships for the Secondary Teacher
Training School and to the project secondary schools
(paras.5.o8, 5.13).
(iv)  enrollment levels for the project schools (para. 5.13);
(v)  enrollment of a first class of about 200 in the
Secondary Teacher Training School in January 1969
(para. 5.14);
(vi)  establishment by 1970 of in-service training of
school administrators and supervisors (para. 5.14);
(vii) appointment of qualified teachers to project schools
on a full-time basis and of qualified and specially-
trained directors and supervisors (para. 5.15); and
(viii) acquisition within six months of signing the loan
agreement of all school sites (para. 5.21).
6.12      Appointment of a full-time Project Director is a condition
of signing the loan agreement (para. 5.25).
6.13      The following would be conditions of effectiveness of the
proposed loan:
(i) establishment and staffing of a Project Unit in
the Ministry of Public Works under the full-time
Project Director (para. 5.25);
(ii)  employment of architects acceptable to the Bank,
to design and supervise construction of the project
schools (para. 5.23);
(iii) securing adequate technical assistance for operation
of the Secondary Teacher Training School (para. 5.09),
and
(iv) furnishing the Bank with evidence that all Government
actions to create and operate the Secondary Teacher
Training School have been taken (para. 5.09).
6.14      Subject to the fulfillment of the conditions described
above the project provides a suitable basis for a loan of US$6.3 million
for 25 years, including a grace period of 10 years.
