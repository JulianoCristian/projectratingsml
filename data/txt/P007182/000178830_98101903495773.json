     construction and equipment of (i) a new secondary teacher\n            training school; (ii) additions to the existing Technical\n            Institute of Agriculture; and (iii) 15 new general secondary\n            schools. The secondary teacher training school would provide\n            700 new places and contribute about 85 percent of the new\n            and 50 percent of the retrained personnel required to have a\n            fully qualified secondary teacher force by 1980. The new\n            secondary schools would provide for 13,400 student places\n            and revised curricula which would reflect the demand for\n            skills of different kinds. The expansion of the Technical\n            Institute of Agriculture would raise its places to 600,\n            triple the present output at the skilled worker level and\n            graduate annually 80 at the technician level."}, "docdt": "1968-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
