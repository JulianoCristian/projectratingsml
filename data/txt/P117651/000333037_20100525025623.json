The ESES DPL2 is grounded in the development goals\n            articulated in Turkey's ninth development plan. It\n            supports the governments policies for long-term sustainable\n            growth across the economy and in the energy sector in\n            particular. The ESES DPL2 program continues to support the\n            government program for energy security, energy efficiency,\n            and clean energy first supported under the 2009 Programmatic\n            Electricity Development Policy Loan (PEDPL). At the request\n            of the government, it also includes policies, strategies and\n            specific measures related to climate change and\n            environmental management. The government has concluded the\n            energy efficiency, energuy security, and environmental\n            issues are most effectively addressed in an integrated\n            program. By supporting the government broader sustainable\n            development agenda, the bank scales up its engagement with\n            Turkey on the environment and climate change."}, "docdt": "2010-05-14T00:00:00Z"}
