F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)
The original program development objective as reflected in DPL1 was to support the
implementation of the Government’s program that aims to address the projected electricity
supply-demand imbalance: (a) through energy efficiency measures to reduce the rate of growth of
demand for electricity, and (b) by enhancing the efficient supply of electricity.

Revised Program Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The revised program development objective as reflected in DPL2 and DPL3 was to help: (a)
enhance energy security by promoting private sector clean technology investments and
operations; (b) integrate principles of environmental sustainability, including climate change
considerations, in key sectoral policies and programs; and (c) improve the effectiveness and
efficiency of environmental management processes.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

This ICR evaluates three predominantly energy and environment-oriented development
policy loans (DPL). The first loan, entitled Programmatic Electricity Sector DPL
(PEDPL1)1, was designed and approved in 2009 as an energy (primarily electricity) DPL
under the Turkey Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) FY2008-11. The CPS was adjusted
at mid-term to support the transition from weathering the global financial crisis to
returning to sustainable growth. In that context it was agreed to deepen the engagement in
the area of sustainability and inter alia agreed to broaden the energy DPL program to also
support policies, strategies and specific measures related to climate change and
environmental management in the re-named new Environmental Sustainability and
Energy Sector (ESES) DPL program. This design provided an integrated approach to the
energy security - energy efficiency - environment nexus and is consistent with the
European Union’s (EU) energy, climate and environmental goals. The second and third
of the operations, accordingly entitled ESES DPL22 and the ESES DPL33, were approved
in 2010 and 2012, respectively. This ICR evaluates the series of three operations termed
PEDPL1, ESES DPL2 and ESES DPL3. For ease, we refer to these operations throughout
the report as DPL1, DPL2 and DPL3, respectively and the series is referred to as the
ESES DPL series.

The predominant energy and environment-orientation of the ESES DPL series was
possible as the Bank was implementing in parallel a separate series of predominantly
macro-oriented DPLs. The Second Programmatic Public Sector DPL4 was prepared in
parallel with DPL1 and was approved in 2008. It was followed by two DPLs in the
Restoring Equitable Growth and Employment (REGE) DPL series5. They were prepared
in parallel with DPL2 and DPL3 and approved in 2010 and 2011, thereby supporting
Turkey in managing the impact of the global financial crisis. An Implementation
Completion and Results Report of these macro-oriented operations was prepared in 20126.
While predominantly energy and environment-oriented, the ESES DPL series also
supported the macro economy by helping to contain large energy-related import costs,
supporting large-scale energy privatizations helping produce significant privatization
proceeds and providing a complementary contribution to strengthening the public sector’s
long-term sources of financing.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

The ESES DPL program was grounded in the development goals articulated in Turkey’s
Ninth Development Plan (2007-2013). The top priorities of the Ninth Plan included: (a)
sound macroeconomic and related structural fiscal policies to maintain stability and
reduce short and medium term vulnerabilities; (b) investment climate, labor market, and
skills reforms to increase competitiveness and create jobs, especially for women and
youth; (c) fundamental education reforms and continuing health and social welfare
reform to increase productivity and help share the gains from growth through equal
opportunities; and (d) continuing energy and water sector reforms and investments to
further increase energy efficiency, the use of renewable energy, and energy security and
help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate and adapt to climate change. The
Ninth Development Plan linked growth and sustainable development focusing inter alia
on energy, mining, environment, water and natural resources.

After a banking crisis in 2001, when GDP contracted by 5.7 percent, and an expensive
recapitalization of its banks; Turkey had embarked on a path of concerted reform.
Turkey’s macroeconomic policies and structural reforms over the past decade had yielded
robust economic growth. However, in 2008 the global economic downturn hit Turkey’s
economy through the export and financial channels. Growth decelerated and GDP
actually fell in the 4th quarter of 2008 bringing the annual growth for the year down to 1.1
percent. The government forecast Turkish economic growth to be -3.6 percent in 2009
and the outlook for 2010 was uncertain. Actual decline in 2009 turned out to be even
deeper at -4.8 percent, but the economy rebounded quickly and registered a growth of 9
percent for 2010.

The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY08-11 was endorsed by the Board of
Directors on February 28, 2008 and the Progress Report on January 7, 2010. The FY08-
11 CPS was shaped directly by Turkey’s Ninth Development Plan to contribute to three
of the Plan’s development pillars: (a) improved competitiveness and employment, (b)
equitable human and social development, and (c) efficient provision of high-quality
public services. During the preparation of the CPS, the Government expressed strong
interest in DPLs to accompany and support Turkey’s ongoing reform agenda, primarily
because of the Bank’s comparative advantage in policy advice and support linked to
flexible budget financing. In the CPS Progress Report in 2010, Turkey and the Bank
adjusted the Partnership Strategy in light of the global crisis. The program for the
remainder of the CPS period was focused sharply on areas crucial for renewed growth:
stimulating private sector, especially small and medium enterprises, business and job
creation; sustainable energy and infrastructure; and human capital. The Government and
the Bank also agreed to broaden the Electricity DPL program launched in FY09, to
include climate change and key environmental sustainability reforms in the re-named
ESES DPL program (which is the subject of this ICR). It was triggered by Turkey’s
signing of the Kyoto Protocol and the opening of the EU Environment Chapter for
negotiations.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

The original program development objective as reflected in DPL1 was to support the
implementation of the Government’s program that aims to address the projected
electricity supply-demand imbalance: (a) through energy efficiency measures to reduce
the rate of growth of demand for electricity, and (b) by enhancing the efficient supply of
electricity.

The original key indicators for the program were: (i) Improved management of electricity
demand-supply imbalance; (ii) Improved functioning of the wholesale market; (iii)
Improved payment performance for transactions through the wholesale market; (iv)
Provision of budgetary allocations on a priority basis in line with approved transmission
system investment plans; (v) Cost-reflective tariffs achieved; (vi) Improved financial
performance of the power companies; (vii) Improved operational efficiency in privatized
companies; (viii) Attraction of private sector investments in new generation; and (ix)
Enhanced public awareness of benefits of energy efficiency (x) Rate of electricity
demand (GWh) growth contained.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

In accordance with the request of the Government for the Bank to provide broader
support to the Government’s sustainability agenda, the revised program development
objectives as reflected in DPL2 and DPL3 were to help: (a) enhance energy security by
promoting private sector clean technology investments and operations; (b) integrate
principles of environmental sustainability, including climate change considerations, in
key sectoral policies and programs; and (c) improve the effectiveness and efficiency of
environmental management processes. The Government had concluded that energy
efficiency, energy security and environmental issues are most effectively addressed in an
integrated program. Furthermore, this energy security - energy efficiency - environment
nexus is consistent with the EU’s energy, climate and environmental goals and
effectively contributes to Turkey's EU accession process (the Environment Chapter had
been opened for negotiations in 2009). Details are provided in Annex 2.

The revised key indicators for the program’s main policy areas are.

      Energy Sector: (i) day-ahead electricity market launched and operates
       effectively; (ii) cost–reflective tariffs maintained; (iii) improved financial
       performance of power companies, with losses for TEDAŞ and receivables for
       TEIAŞ and EÜAŞ reduced; (iv) attraction of private investment in the power
       sector; (v) rate of electricity demand growth contained; and (vi) a new gas import
       contract signed by BOTAŞ or a private gas importer;

      Climate Change: (i) An inter-ministerial Climate Change Coordination Board
       and a Climate Change Department at the Ministry of Environment and
       Urbanization are working to coordinate and ensure complementarity between


                                             3
       sector specific climate actions; and (ii) a framework established for monitoring
       the implementation of the National Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan
       agreed; and

      Sustainable Environmental Management: (i) An integrated system for
       environmental “e-permits” is operational; (ii) Increased transparency,
       accountability and public participation in the environmental consent process; (iii)
       increased share of population served by sanitary landfills; (iv) Clean Air Center in
       Marmara fully functioning and staffed to implement the Clean Air Action Plan;
       and (v) at least 15 of the 25 river basins have developed watershed protection
       action plans.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved):

The program was originally focused exclusively on the energy sector. DPL1 included
nine prior actions. They are discussed in section 2.1. The implementation of the energy
program continued under the broadened ESES DPL series. Eight energy sector policy
actions were originally (at the time of DPL1) envisioned as prior actions for the energy
PEDPL2. Seven of these original eight energy sector actions were completed by the
Government. Three of these completed actions were included as prior actions for ESES
DPL2. The other completed energy actions originally envisaged for PEDPL2 were not
included as prior actions for ESES DPL2, for reasons of program balance and focus i.e.
too many energy actions. One of the original eight actions – a capacity mechanism for
electricity generation - was removed from the Government’s agenda and was substituted
in DPL2 with the electricity generation privatization strategy Thus, the prior energy
actions for DPL2 were focused on the most important measures within the expanded
ESES program For DPL3 some further energy actions were added.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas

In accordance with the request of the Government for the Bank to provide broader
support to the Government’s sustainability agenda, the program was expanded to support
policies, strategies and specific measures related to climate change and environmental
management. For that purpose the original Energy Sector Pillar was complemented by
two additional pillars, one for Climate Change and one for Sustainable Environmental
Management. The new prior actions are discussed in section 2.1.

1.6 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)

The original program design, focused on the energy sector, envisioned a series of two
DPLs: PEDPL1 in FY09 and PEDPL2 in FY10. The revised program design, expanded
to included climate change and sustainable environmental management, consisted of a
series of three DPLs; PEDPL1 ( DPL1), ESES DPL2 and ESES DPL3. PEDPL2 became
ESES DPL2 and was approved in FY10. Fund allocations were determined in the


                                            4
context of the Country Partnership Strategies FY08-11 (DPL1 and DPL2) and FY12-15
(DPL3). Therefore, notwithstanding the expanded scope of ESES DPL2, at Euro 519.6
million (US$ 700 million equivalent), the loan amount was less than the Euro 548.4
million (US$ 800 million equivalent) of PEDPL1. The loan amount of ESES DPL3 was
the smallest in the series at Euro 455.4 million (US$600 million equivalent). The total
program amounted to Euro 1,523.4 million (US$2,100 million equivalent).

The prior actions are summarized by pillar and policy objective supported in Annex 5.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

Overall, the implementation of the program supported by the DPL series went as planned.
One of the major factors underpinning such performance was Turkey’s stable political
situation throughout the program period. Turkey has been governed by the Justice and
Development (AK) Party, which has an overall majority in Parliament since 2002 and


                                                 6
was most recently reelected in June 2011. The program implementation reflected this
political stability and benefited from continuity and strong Government ownership, as
well as Government commitment and implementation capacity. While there were delays
in some individual components including a major setback in the third phase of the
electricity distribution privatization program (discussed below), overall the program
implementation progressed steadily and adjustments/replacements were agreed within the
overall framework.

The macroeconomic situation varied in an unusually pronounced manner during the
program period. After years of solid growth after the 2001 banking crisis, growth
decelerated as the global crisis hit Turkey in 2008 and the economy contracted by almost
5 percent in 2009. A considerable change in the direction of government policy, tilting
away from structural reforms and towards efforts to contain the impact of the crisis, was
necessary. The crisis and the resulting shift in government policy did not affect the
design of the program supported by the ESES DPL: the assessment was that energy
reforms needed to continue and the Government even expanded the scope of the program
to climate change and sustainable environmental management as important long-term
priorities. There was, however, a significant reorientation in the Bank’s parallel
primarily macro-oriented DPL operations resulting in the REGE DPL program which
supported Turkey’s transition from crisis management to recovery and growth . The
crisis affected the electricity distribution privatization program. The winning bidders in
the third phase of the program could not fulfill their bid obligations, ultimately rebidding
became necessary and the privatization program was finally completed in 2013 instead of
the original 2011 schedule. This risk had been identified in the program design.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

The Undersecretariat of the Treasury was responsible for coordinating actions among
other concerned ministries and agencies. A number of other agencies were involved in
the implementation of the program supported by the ESES DPL series including: (1) the
Ministry of Development (MoD); (2) the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources
(MENR); (3) the Ministry of Environment and its successor entities the Ministry of
Environment and Urbanization (MoEU) and the Ministry of Forestry and Water Affairs
(MoFW); (4) the energy regulator (EMRA), (5) the Privatization Administration (PA),
and 6) the energy utilities. The Treasury played an effective role in monitoring progress
on agreed policy areas and maintaining frequent contact with the Bank team. Treasury
staff and the Bank team had joint meetings with line ministries. The Treasury also
maintained separate lines of communication with the Ministry of Development and the
participating line ministries and the Privatization Administration. The Bank reviewed the
progress of the program and helped identify and participated in discussions on
adjustments as the program evolved. Reviews focused on the impacts of the various prior
actions. Monitoring indicators were tracked. A noteworthy feature in project design was
the agreement to set the closing date of the March 2012 DPL3 loan as June 30, 2013, to
allow for the monitoring to continue longer than usual after the approval of the final loan
in the ESES DPL program.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation :

The Government and the Bank are at the concept stage of formulating a new DPL
program. The new DPL series will be an integral part of the new Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS), which covers 2012-2015. A multi-sectoral programmatic series of two
DPLs is envisioned. Energy has been tentatively selected as one of the pillars for the
proposed new program. Envisioned prior actions for the first future DPL and indicative
triggers for the second future DPL have been identified. They are key elements
supporting the continued implementation of Turkey’s energy reforms. A multi-year
energy sector technical assistance program is expected to be implemented in parallel with
financing from the EU’s Instrument for Pre-Accession program for Turkey. Financing
and Administration Agreements for the first Euro 11.8 million project have been finalized.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The completed program was grounded in Turkey’s Ninth Development Plan (2007-2013).
The program supported policies and reforms included in the Ninth Plan and various
national strategies including the Electricity Market and Security of Supply Strategy
(2009), the Energy Efficiency Strategy (2012), and the National Climate Change Strategy
(2010) and Action Plan (2011). As such the objectives, design and implementation of
the program were directly relevant to Turkey’s priorities. Turkey’s 10th Development
Plan (2014-2018) approved by the Parliament in July 2013 builds on these strategies and
reforms.

The goal of the CPS FY08-11 was for the Bank Group to be a partner with Turkey in
realizing her development vision - to achieve fast and sustained growth with equity -
through full integration into the Government’s formulated development strategy.
Accordingly, the CPS was shaped directly by Turkey’s Ninth Development Plan and by
the Government’s Program, and aimed at contributing to three main development pillars:
(a) improved competitiveness and employment, (b) equitable human and social
development, and (c) efficient provision of high-quality public services. The CPS
envisaged substantial Bank Group financing in the electricity sector, with private sector
development playing a central role and IFC actively engaged in this sector. The
emphasis on the electricity sector reflected the importance of electricity supply security
and energy efficiency for the economy, as well as the priority the Government places on
the energy sector and on continued substantial Bank Group engagement in this sector.
During preparation of the CPS, the Government expressed strong interest in DPLs to
accompany and support Turkey’s ongoing reform agenda, primarily because of the
Bank’s comparative advantage in policy advice and support linked to flexible budget
financing.

Turkey and the World Bank Group had originally agreed not to use the environment as a
pillar in CPS FY08-11, reflecting limited advancement of the environmental agenda
during 2004-2007. Discussions on possible engagement were started at Turkey’s



                                            8
initiative during the 2008-2011 CPS period, in parallel with Turkey’s accession to the
Kyoto protocol and the opening of the Environmental Chapter of the EU acquis in 20097.
The long-standing Turkey-World Bank Group partnership on energy provided the
opportunity and strategic entry point for a new engagement on this topic: (a) The energy
DPL series was broadened into the ESES DPL series; (b) Turkey joined the Trust Fund
Committee of the Clean Technology Fund (CTF) and in May 2009 Turkey became the
first country to access the CTF with a project focused on renewable energy and energy
efficiency; and (c) Turkey also joined the Bank-administered multi-donor Partnership for
Market Readiness (PMR). IFC’s large energy program supports low carbon solutions to
help Turkey meet its growing electricity demand.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

Rating: Satisfactory
DPL1: Satisfactory     DPL2: Satisfactory      DPL3: Satisfactory

Policies, strategies and reform actions undertaken as part of the program included:

       Adoption by the High Planning Council in early 2008, and quarterly
        implementation by the energy sector regulator, EMRA, of a cost-based energy
        pricing mechanism;
       Electricity Market and Security of Supply Strategy (2009), Clean Air Action Plan
        (2010), National Climate Change Strategy (2010) and Action Plan (2011), and
        Energy Efficiency Strategy (2012);
       Electricity distribution privatization, 2008-2013;

  Turkey is a candidate country for EU membership. Accession negotiations started in October
2005. Turkey views the accession process as her own, fundamental “modernization project”.
After the June 2011 elections, the Government upgraded the institution overseeing all EU
accession matters into a new Ministry for EU Affairs.

The program has achieved in a satisfactory manner its development objectives as
measured against the key indicators (listed in Section 1.3) for each of its three pillars.

Pillar I: Energy. Included in DPL1, DPL2 and DPL3
Rating: Highly Satisfactory

The program has achieved its development objectives in a highly satisfactory manner: (i)
A day-ahead electricity market has been launched and operates effectively. Trading
currently accounts for over one quarter of Turkey’s electricity supply. Earlier major
collection and payment issues have been resolved and on-time payments exceed 99%.
(ii-iii) Financial recovery has been achieved in the power sector. Up to 2008, prices often
did not cover costs and collection was less than 100 percent, and large arrears were
accumulated. With the implementation of the cost-based pricing mechanism, electricity
tariffs have reflected costs since 2008. (Reasonable costs as accepted by EMRA).
Collections started to improve through 2009. Collections reached 100 percent in 2010
(some privatized distribution companies collected more than 100 percent, i.e. also
recovered past arrears). The main state-owned utilities achieved profitability – EUAŞ
from 2009, TEIAŞ from 2010 and TEDAŞ from 2011 - and have paid their arrears to
private sector generators. Cross-payables and receivables between public sector
companies were cleaned-up through special legislation enacted by the Parliament. (iv) A
large volume of private investment has been attracted, including the development of
about 15,000 MW of new generation capacity in the 2008-2012 period and about
US$12.7 billion in investment in the electricity distribution privatization program
completed in 2013. (v) Turkey’s electricity and gas supply security have improved. The
projected electricity supply imbalances in 2010 and 2011 were avoided. The rate of
electricity demand growth in the 2008-2011 period was about 4.9 percent/annum well
below the target 7 percent/annum. This result was in part facilitated by the economic
slowdown in 2009 caused by the global crisis. (vi) Agreements for the purchase of gas
for Turkey’s gas market and transit to Europe have been signed between the
Governments of Azerbaijan and Turkey and their gas companies SOCAR and BOTAŞ.

Pillar II: Climate Change. Included in DPL2 and DPL3
Rating: Satisfactory

The program has achieved its development objectives in a satisfactory manner. A
National Climate Change Strategy was approved in May 2010 and a National Climate
Change Action Plan was approved in May and issued in July 2011. A framework has
been established to monitor their implementation. An inter-ministerial Climate Change
Coordination Board and a Climate Change Department at the Ministry of Environment
and Urbanization (MoEU) have been established. They are active/operational and
working to coordinate and ensure complementarity between sector specific climate
actions. The progress and the change in Turkey’s approach and attention to climate
issues during the program period has been significant, when compared to the preceding



                                              10
long period of limited attention namely: (a) Turkey ratified and became a party to the
Kyoto Protocol in 2009 (Annex I Party to UNFCC but Annex B Party to the Protocol
without a specific target assigned) and stepped up its participation in international fora;
and (b) as far as collaboration with the Bank is concerned, Turkey joined CTF and PMR
and has received investment project financing for energy efficiency, renewable energy
and related transmission system and electricity market development with CTF financing
and four Bank investment loans approved in the 2009-2013 period. MoEU has prepared
and issued a regulation on the monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) of
greenhouse gas emissions. The regulation is modeled on a similar regulation in place in
the EU and initially covers over 1,000 installations. The Ministry is working with the
Turkish accreditation and standards institutes to deliver training to auditors (part of which
is funded by the PMR). Turkey’s international engagement and participation,
collaboration with the Bank, as well as the National Climate Change Strategy and Action
Plan, are grounded on studies and analyses carried out by the MoEU, the Ministry of
Development and several line ministries including the Ministry of Energy and Natural
Resources on renewable energy and energy efficiency.

Turkey also made progress with voluntary carbon markets and decreasing energy
intensity by focusing on renewable energy and energy efficiency. There are 218
voluntary carbon market projects in operation which reduce carbon emissions by an
estimated 16.3 Million tons per year. Most of these projects are renewable energy
projects, mainly hydropower projects and wind projects, and together these two
categories account for 79% 0f the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. Going forward
this progress enables inter alia Turkey’s effective participation in the international effort,
which aims to prepare and agree to a new climate change regime by 2015.

Pillar III: Sustainable Environmental Management. Included in DPL2 and DPL3
Rating: Satisfactory

The program has achieved its development objectives in a satisfactory manner: (a)
institutional and policy framework in support of harmonization with EU Environmental
Acquis and improved inter-sectoral coordination in environmental management has been
strengthened; (b) increased public participation in environmental decision-making is
facilitated by the new EIA process; (c) the institutional framework for environmental
monitoring and regulation has been improved with the new e-environment system for
permits and licensing; (d) waste management (including the management of hazardous
substances and chemicals and associated risks) has improved through an improved
regulatory framework and the proportion of the population served by sanitary landfills
has increased from 47% to 55% (e) the management of air quality is improved with the
Clean Air Center at Marmara fully functioning and staffed to implement the clean air
action plan, and f) water resources are better managed with 19 watershed protection
action plans by end-2012 and all of the 25 river basins having developed watershed
protection action plans by end-2013.

The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Directive of the EU has been largely
transposed into the Turkish legislation. Turkey strengthened the public consultation



                                              11
practices with the recent amendments. However there has been minimal progress
regarding the transboundary conditions and Turkey is not a signatory of the Espoo
Convention. While the EIA procedures have matured, Turkey is in the process of
transposing the Strategic Environmental Assessment Directive (SEA) of the EU. SEA is
going to be implemented after the completion of capacity building studies in the coming
years.

A Regulation (and three amendments) on Permits and Licenses to be taken in Accordance
with the Environmental Law was issued by the Ministry of Environment and
Urbanization (MoEU). This regulation combined all the licenses and permits required by
the industrial installations into a single “e-permit” to streamline the application process
for the applicants and to make the licensing and permitting, monitoring/inspection and
enforcement by the MoEU more effective. Moreover, the former separate environmental
permits used to have different validity periods which made it difficult for both the
companies and the governmental officials to monitor compliance. The MoEU has
reportedly reduced the number of official documents from 199 to 16, by implementation
of this regulation and enacted a related regulation on requirements for accreditation of
“environmental official” and “environmental consultancy” companies involved in the
process of applying for the e-permits.

In part to align Turkey’s policies with the EU directives, several steps have been taken to
improve the Water Sector regulatory framework. A new Water Law, calling for new
practices (such as a catchment-based water management and allocation system, water
management on the basis of quality and quantity factors, user pays and polluter pays
principles, ownership of all water resources by the state, stakeholder participation in
management, development of flood legislation, etc.) has been drafted and is being
discussed at the national level. As of early 2013, Protection Action Plans have been
completed for all 25 river basins in Turkey. In line with the Water Framework Directive,
these protection plans are being converted to River basin management Plans. However,
the institutional framework for water management is still not organized at the river basin
level. Coordination and institutional strengthening is necessary for the management of
basins with a multi stakeholder approach. The World Bank is working on a new project
which will support the government in testing the multi stakeholder approach with an
integrated basin management approach.

Significant progress in terms of harmonization with the EU acquis has been achieved in
solid waste management but implementation remains an issue in Turkey. Several
regulations - including on Solid Waste Control, Medical Waste Control, Hazardous
Waste Control, and Solid Pollution Control - were recently revised and the waste
electrical electronic equipment directive has been adopted to be in harmony with the EU
acquis. The effectiveness of implementation of these regulations is hampered by the
limitations in number and capacity of waste management facilities. Good progress has
been achieved regarding landfills. The number of sanitary landfills increased from 15 to
69 between years 2003 and 2013.




                                            12
MoEU is also working on improving the air quality management scheme in Turkey. In
addition to establishing the Marmara Clean Air Center, they are working on the
preparation of an Air Quality Action Plan at the national level. This will be followed by
detailed air quality plans at regional / local scale based on the results of preliminary
assessment studies that will be finalized by 2014. Preparations are also continuing for the
transposition and implementation of the EU National Emissions Ceilings Directive.


3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory
DPL1: Satisfactory     DPL2: Satisfactory     DPL3: Satisfactory

The program was relevant to Turkey’s priorities and supported its Ninth Development
Plan 2007-2012 and was one of the core deliveries in Bank CAS FY08-11 and FY12-15.
Its development objectives have been achieved in a satisfactory manner for each of the
three pillars as discussed above. Based purely on the achievements shown in 3.2 above, a
good case could be made that this series of loans should be rated highly satisfactory.
However, as also indicted above the Bank was engaged in investment lending and
technical assistance which supported these reforms and the EU Candidacy of Turkey also
provided emphasis to undertake them. It is therefore difficult to attribute all of these
achievements to the energy/environment DPL Loan series although these loans clearly
played a major role. The overall satisfactory outcome rating is considered fully justified. .

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The program strengthens the framework for long-term sustainable growth across the
economy and in the energy sector in particular. As a result the overall social and poverty
impact of the program is positive. The actions and reforms under the program help: (a)
sustain economic growth, which in turn will increase employment generation and reduce
poverty; (b) improve the environment, which in turn will improve the quality of life and
health; and (c) improve the quality of electricity supply and service to consumers through
privatization, infrastructure investment and increased competition

The program did not contain gender-specific interventions. Direct impacts specific to
women as a result of the program are not expected.

However, while helping to ensure access and improve service delivery some of the
energy reforms (pricing and privatization) are also expected to affect the affordability of
energy services for the poor. The program’s initial poverty and social impact analysis
predicted that the overall impact of pricing and privatization on households, including
poorer households, would be limited. Available data also suggest that past electricity
privatizations have not had a large adverse impact on the poor. Yet, evidence from other
countries suggests that actions to increase payments for usage may affect poorer



                                            13
households disproportionally. In addition, two privatizations in areas where payment
rates are low (Van region with 50% and Dicle Region with 30%) have been completed
very recently and in those areas the imperative to raise collection rates may generate
more difficulties at the household level than previous privatizations.
In response to these potential impacts, under the ESES DPL 3 program, it was agreed that
a joint monitoring program by the Ministry of Development, UNDP and the World Bank
would be implemented in 2012 – 2014 in order to understand the impacts of electricity
distribution privatization on households in Turkey, and help inform and plan mitigation
measures, if necessary, for low-income households. As part of the first phase in FY13,
UNDP (in consultation with the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, the Ministry
of Development, Privatization Administration, Energy Market Regulation Authority
(EMRA), the Turkish Electricity Distribution Company (TEDAS), the Turkish Institute
of Statistics (TURKSTAT), the Consumers Rights Association and the World Bank)
developed and piloted a qualitative and quantitative poverty and social impact
methodology. In 2014, this methodology will be used in all distribution regions in
Turkey to comprehensively monitor the impacts of electricity privatization across the
country and inform policy dialogue for possible social assistance measures.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

A well-functioning electricity market has been developed, operated by a department
within the electricity transmission system operator TEIAŞ. The next step will be its
establishment as an independent company with private sector participation. A major
transformation has been accomplished in electricity distribution, which has been
privatized under the program. The concerned agencies, the Privatization Administration,
EMRA and the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (MENR) have strong
implementation capacity in this area. They have put into use in the electricity generation
area. A strategy for generation privatization has been adopted and implementation begun
once the distribution program had reached an advanced level of implementation. An
inter-ministerial Climate Change Coordination Board and a Climate Change Department
at the Ministry of Environment and Urbanization (MoEU) have been established. They
are working to coordinate and ensure complementarity between sector specific climate
actions. MoEU is also building up its capacity by creating departments for permitting,
monitoring and inspection in provincial directorates, to strengthen the environmental
monitoring and inspection practices.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

The expansion of the program into climate change and sustainable environmental
management provided positive outcomes and impacts. Turkey and the World Bank
Group had originally agreed not to use the environment as a pillar in CPS FY08-11,
reflecting limited advancement of the environmental agenda during 2004-07.
Discussions on possible engagement were started at Turkey’s initiative during the 2008-
11 CPS period and the long-standing Turkey-World Bank Group partnership on energy
provided the opportunity and strategic entry point for a new engagement on this topic.
This was prominently reflected as one of the three main strategic objectives and pillars in



                                            14
the new CPS FY12-15 approved together with DPL3 in March 2012: Strategic Objective
1 - enhanced competitiveness and employment; Strategic Objective 2 - improved equity
and public services; and Strategic Objective 3 - deepened sustainable development.


3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Beneficiary surveys and stakeholder workshops were not carried out for this core ICR
and related annexes are not included in the ICR.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Significant
DPL1: Significant     DPL2: Significant      DPL3: Significant

There are four main risks to the program’s outcomes: (i) economic risks; (ii) political
risks; (iii) implementation and social risks in the energy sector; and (iv) program and
implementation risks in the climate change and environmental management areas.
Notwithstanding low political risks, the overall risk rating is significant.

Economic risks: The global financial crisis had begun to affect Turkey when DPL1 was
being prepared, and resulted in a sharp reduction of credit availability, consumer and
investor confidence, and exports. This hit domestic demand and caused a 4.8 percent
reduction in economic output during 2009. A considerable change in the direction of
government policy, tilting away from structural reforms and towards efforts to contain
the impact of the crisis, was necessary. The crisis and the resulting shift in government
policy did not, however, affect the design of the program supported by the ESES DPL-
the assessment was that energy reforms need to continue and the Government even
expanded the scope of the program to climate change and sustainable environmental
management as important long-term priorities. The global economic environment was
uncertain during the preparation of the DPL2 and events impacting Turkey lay largely
outside of government’s control. Although the Turkish economy recovered impressively
from the crisis by DPL3, it remains at considerable risk from sudden changes in the
external environment, since it has a significant current account deficit which is financed
by capital inflows. An additional economic risk stems from events in Syria. Increasing
numbers of Syrian refugees are putting a strain on the budget. Finally Turkey is at risk of
economic problems in its major export market of Europe. If one or more of these risks
materializes and the Turkish Economy falters: it not likely that the program would be
reversed. Rather what is more likely is that the program would be slowed- perhaps quite
significantly.

Political risks. Turkey has had a stable government since 2002 under the Justice and
Development Party (AKP), facilitating the implementation of major reforms. Social
consensus on the reform program and institutional capacity are needed for the
implementation of the reform program. There is a risk that a prolonged focus on
Turkey’s constitutional reform agenda could narrow the coverage and scope of the



                                            15
program or lead to delays in its implementation. However, the EU accession anchor
continues to mitigate political risks since the program is entirely consistent with and
assists in meeting the requirements for EU Membership. If this incentive were to be
removed, the risks would rise although again it is unlikely the program would be reversed
since it has strong domestic support.

Energy Sector risks. Turkey’s strategy to achieve and maintain energy security faced
significant implementation risks. The strategy emphasizes private sector participation –
both in the new areas of renewable energy and energy efficiency where substantial
barriers have to be overcome, as well as in the mainstream energy production and
distribution areas where the investment needs are very high. The envisioned privatization
and implementation schedules for the electricity distribution companies could not be
realized as global market conditions worsened. However, with the successful rebidding
of the third phase of electricity distribution privatization the program has been completed.
The generation privatization program has just started and significant volumes of
investment in new generation capacity will also continue to be needed. Implementation
risks were mitigated by the energy regulator, EMRA’s and the Privatization
Administration’s strong track records and the Government’s continued commitment.
Currently retail electricity tariffs in Turkey are fairly high by historical standards and
there could have been a political back lash against these tariffs (which are market driven)
however no significant back lash emerged. Available data suggest that past electricity
privatizations have not had a large adverse impact on the poor, though the 2008-2009
recession increased the financial burden of electricity prices increases on the poorest
households. Also, two privatizations in areas where payment rates are low have been
completed very recently. In those areas, the imperative to raise collection rates may
generate more difficulties at the household level than previous privatizations, and more
attention may need to be paid to progress. The energy regulator, EMRA, already monitors
the performance of the privatized companies on a quarterly basis, including collections
and disconnections and should be able to observe and take action to mitigate such risks.
EMRA took strong corrective action with a non-performing company by replacing its
management.

Climate change risks. Turkey’s climate action agenda is long term and its
implementation has only recently started. The successful implementation of this action
agenda requires the broadening and deepening of Government ownership and public
support in Turkey and maintaining the momentum of the international negotiation
process. This is made more difficult since the issues of emission reduction obligations
and finance have not yet been resolved in the international process within the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Although the nationally approved
Climate Change Action Plan offers major emission reductions in primary energy intensity
and energy savings in the buildings, industry, transport, waste, agriculture and forestry
sectors, no overall domestic target was adopted. Awareness-raising on opportunities and
challenges of climate action is needed at all levels. The risks of declining support for
climate change mitigation are decreased by a growing public awareness of the
implications of climate change for Turkey and by the recognition that climate action is in




                                            16
Turkey’s own national interest. Nevertheless if economic or political conditions change
very significantly, the support for the climate action agenda could dissipate rapidly.

Environmental management risks. Turkey’s environment agenda is long term and
challenging, and implementation capacity risks are high. While there is Government
ownership of environmental management reforms and the MoEU and the MoFW are
progressing, Turkey’s experience and capacity in public environmental management and
enforcement remains limited. This risk is mitigated by projects currently targeted toward
the institutional strengthening of the MoEU and the MoFW, supported under the EU pre-
accession financial and technical assistance programs. The European Union opened the
negotiations on the Environment Chapter in December 2009. The mid-2011 merger of
the environment and urban ministries into a single ministry has raised a concern that the
urban construction agenda will prevail over the environment. As with the climate change
risks, significant political or economic changes could slow or at worst stop the country’s
environmental management agenda.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory
DPL1: Satisfactory DPL2: Satisfactory        DPL3: Satisfactory

Policy lending in Turkey was a part of a long standing relationship between the
Government and the Bank based on knowledge sharing, policy dialogue, and
development financing. In knowledge sharing the Bank successfully channeled
worldwide experience through sector analytical work customized to the country’s needs.
Policy dialogue was shaped by the fact that Turkey is a large, sophisticated middle-
income country with a broad-based policy agenda and complex political economy. In
those circumstances, successful design and structuring of institutional reforms must be
tailored to specific Turkey needs and agreed with a number of stakeholders through a
complex consultation and buy-in process. The program was based on a longer-term
policy dialogue (going back to the 1990s in case of energy reforms) and was selectively
underpinned by strong analytical work and technical support.

The preparatory work was well-coordinated within the Bank’s multi-sector team
including experts and practitioners in the energy, environmental, social, and macro-
economics areas. The program design was sufficiently flexible to accommodate changes
in the implementation schedules of individual elements. The timing of individual
operations in the DPL series was tailored to Turkey’s needs: the first operation was in
sync with the approval of the Ninth Development Plan, the second supported the Bank’s
timely response to the global crisis, and the third supported a smooth transition from
short-term crisis response back to longer-term structural reforms.
(b) Quality of Supervision




                                            17
Rating: Satisfactory
DPL1: Satisfactory DPL2: Satisfactory        DPL3: Satisfactory

The Bank reviewed the progress of the program and helped identify and obtain agreement
on adjustments to the program as needed. In this programmatic series, there was no
formal distinction between preparation and supervision; it was one continuous process.
(In the Bank’s budget system, the work was financed under a succession of lending
codes/budgets and parallel task codes/budgets). A noteworthy feature in project design
was the setting of the closing date of the March 2012 ESES DPL3 loan as June 30, 2013,
to allow for the formal monitoring phase to continue longer than usual after the approval
of the final loan in the DPL programs. The monitoring effort was anchored in a strong
field-based country team8 which maintained a continuous policy dialogue on reforms
supported by the DPL series and monitored the agreed outcome indicators. Supervision
effort was often closely related to ongoing ESW and investment project work (discussed
below) which provided a broader reform context and enabled a greater depth of the
monitoring work and related dialogue. In its supervision activities the Bank team
engaged with the Treasury (formal policy counterpart), Ministry of Development, the
concerned line ministries (MENR, MoEU and MoFW), agencies (EMRA and PA) and
energy utilities responsible for the design and implementation of reforms supported under
the program.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory
DPL1: Satisfactory DPL2: Satisfactory        DPL3: Satisfactory

Bank performance during preparation/at entry and supervision benefitted from the long-
term relationship and close dialogue with the Government on reforms, as well as ongoing
analytical/advisory and investment project work. This improved the choice, content, and
coherence of reforms and paved the way for good performance. New energy sector
investment projects were approved in parallel with the ESES DPL program in 2009
(energy efficiency in large enterprises, renewable energy development), 2010 (electricity
market and transmission system), 2011 (energy efficiency in large enterprises, and
renewable energy development) and 2013 (energy efficiency in small and medium
enterprises) and the implementation of earlier approved electricity and gas sector projects
continued. The Bank has been providing analytical support through its advisory support
program, including: 1) provision of expert advisory services on sustainable wind energy
development; 2) report on the security of electricity supply; 3) studies related to a gas
sector strategy and to green field gas distribution; 4) analytical work on demand-side
energy efficiency potential and opportunities in Turkey – including a report “Turkey:
Tapping Energy Savings Potential in Industry and Buildings”; 5) an assessment of

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory
DPL1: Satisfactory     DPL2: Satisfactory    DPL3: Satisfactory

Turkey greatly values long-term collaboration with the Bank in acquiring: 1) access to
global knowledge on policy and institutional issues, 2) developing country specific
diagnostics, 3) maintaining policy dialogue and shaping specific sector reforms, as well
as 4) obtaining long-term budget support financing under favorable terms. The Deputy
Prime Minister Economic and Financial Affairs has the leading role in the design of
macroeconomic policy and institutional reforms coordinated within the Economic
Council which additionally included core economic ministers and relevant line ministries.
This institutional set-up strengthened the ownership and commitment of the government
to the reform program, and facilitated policy dialogue on the choice of viable reforms in
the context of Turkey. It helped to navigate the broad-based policy agenda and address
complex political economy issues to arrive at institutional reforms tailored to the
country’s circumstances. This energy/environmental DPL series was developed in this
overall framework, as an extension of macro/multi-sector development policy loans
started in the aftermath of the 2001 crisis.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory
DPL1: Satisfactory DPL2: Satisfactory        DPL3: Satisfactory

As the coordinating and implementing agency, the Treasury played an effective role in
monitoring progress on agreed policy areas and maintaining frequent contact with the
Bank team. The Treasury also maintained separate lines of communication with the
Ministry of Development and the participating line ministries and the Privatization
Administration. Communications with EMRA and energy utilities were primarily
through and by the MENR. The possibility of an energy sector DPL was first raised by
the Energy Minister, then discussed with Treasury, conceptualized and incorporated in
the CPS FY08-11. The initiative to extend the program to include climate change and
sustainable environmental management came from Treasury and was then discussed with
the Ministry of Environment, conceptualized and incorporated in the CPS FY08-11 at the
mid-term review. The Treasury strongly supported the addition of DPL lending to the
Bank’s menu of instruments including having Treasury staff join the Bank team to
explain the functioning of the Bank’s DPL instrument to the concerned staff at: 1) MENR,
2) Ministry of Environment and its successor entities MoEU, MoWF; 3) EMRA, 4) PA


                                            19
and 4) the energy companies. It also helped design and implement their respective
components in a satisfactory manner as detailed in earlier sections of this ICR.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory
DPL1: Satisfactory     DPL2: Satisfactory     DPL3: Satisfactory

Throughout the program the Borrower worked closely with Bank in designing and
implementing policy reforms aligned with the country’s medium-term development plan
and immediate needs. The Deputy Prime Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs
and the Treasury had the lead role in shaping the policy content of the operations,
overseeing progress and adjusting the priorities in line with the evolving policy and
reform agenda in the country. This helped maintain relevance and promote the
achievement of results envisaged under individual operations and the series overall.

6. Lessons Learned

The use of a DPL was a strategic choice of instrument after an extensive and substantial
engagement of investment lending and AAA work in the energy sector. It allowed (a) for
developing a programmatic DPL in a short period of time when the opportunity was there
and the demand was formulated; (b) for responding to strong ownership at the level of the
Deputy Prime Minister in charge of Economic and Financial Affairs; and (c) for building
good coordination across key government institutions as Treasury was the implementing
agency. Such a DPL would have not been possible to launch without such a context and
on-going relationship.

The Bank has a long relationship with Turkey, has been active in many sectors and has
provided numerous analytical and advisory services. There is a great deal of experience
and a number of lessons learned in this relationship. The design of the Bank program
benefited from that experience and the lessons, perhaps even more than usual, given the
timing of the program during a period of global crisis. The proactive use of the flexibility
in the country partnership strategy process and the DPL instrument were very important
in order to adapt to both external and internal political economy factors. This enabled the
Bank to remain relevant and continue dialogue with the government as the global crisis
unfolded and the Government’s reform agenda adapted. A considerable change in the
direction of government policy, tilting away from structural reforms and towards efforts
to contain the impact of the crisis, was necessary. The crisis and the resulting shift in
government policy did not affect the design of the program supported by the ESES DPL:
the assessment was that energy reforms need to continue and the Government even
expanded the scope of the program to climate change and sustainable environmental
management as important long-term priorities.

The bulk of the adaptation by the Bank to the impact of the crisis was through the REGE
DPL program which effectively consolidated macro and public sector reforms and
financial and social sector reforms into a large multi-sector DPL program. This was the



                                            20
Bank’s primary response to Turkey’s request for assistance with the global crisis (REGE
DPL1) and Turkey’s transition from short-term crisis response back to longer-term
structural reforms (REGE DPL2). While predominantly energy and environment-
oriented, the ESES DPL series also supported the macro economy by helping to contain
large energy-related import costs, supporting large-scale energy privatizations yielding
significant privatization proceeds and providing a complementary contribution to
strengthening the public sector’s long-term sources of financing.

The flexibility of the DPL instrument was also utilized to maximum effect and longer
term benefit when the scope of the original energy DPL program was extended to climate
change and environmental management in response to the Government’s readiness to
raise the dialogue on these important cross-cutting development themes to a significantly
higher level with the international community including the Bank. Turkey and the WBG
had agreed not to use environment as a pillar in CPS FY08-11, reflecting limited
advancement of the environmental agenda during 2004-2007 and a decision to consider
jointly a possible re-engagement, at Turkey’s initiative, later during the 2008-11 CPS
period. Turkey’s accession to the Kyoto protocol and the opening of the Environmental
Chapter of the EU Acquis in 2009 then provided the opportunity and strategic entry point
for a new engagement on environment and climate change. The new engagement grew
out of the long-standing Turkey-WBG partnership on energy. The electricity DPL series
was broadened into the ESES DPL series, with three components: energy, climate change
and environmental sustainability. This work led to collaboration in preparation for the
2012 UN Sustainable Development Conference (Rio+20). IFC used its support for
Turkey’s liberalization program to secure low carbon solutions to meet growing
electricity demand.

Even with the strongest commitment, sometimes reforms cannot be implemented
according to the original schedules. This was most visibly the case with the
Government’s distribution privatization program, which stalled at phase 3 (DPL3) after
two earlier successful phases (supported under DPL1 and DPL2). Agreement was
reached with the Government that replacements were to be made in the scope of DPL3
and an unusually long supervision period was built into the loan agreement to provide for
monitoring through much of 2013. The distribution privatization program was restarted,
rebid and has now been successfully completed. The closing date of the March 2012
DPL3 loan was set as June 30, 2013, to allow for the monitoring to continue longer than
usual after the approval of the final loan in the DPL program.

A DPL that cuts across several themes brings considerable additional complexity in the
design but at the same time high pay-off as it pursues a more holistic approach. It takes a
Bank team that is fully committed to cross-sectoral working together.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies

The Borrower’s ICR, which includes input from concerned agencies, is attached as
Annex 3. The Borrower highlights that the ESES DPL series “have built on our mutual
understanding with the World Bank to address our Government’s programs for energy,
climate change and environment with an integrated approach. In this sense, we agreed
that our development policy cooperation with the World Bank in energy sector to be
broadened to include climate change and sustainable environment management. The
three pillars of the ESES DPL program (i) energy sector; (ii) climate change; and (iii)
sustainable environmental management have complemented one another in many ways.”

(b) Cofinanciers - There was no co-financing.

Introduction

1. Environmental Sustainability and Energy Sector Development Policy Loan (ESES
   DPL) series, which have comprised of three loans, have built on our mutual
   understanding with the World Bank to address our Government’s programs for
   energy, climate change and environment with an integrated approach. In this sense,
   we agreed that our development policy cooperation with the World Bank in energy
   sector to be broadened to include climate change and sustainable environment
   management. The three pillars of the ESES DPL program (i) energy sector; (ii)
   climate change; and (iii) sustainable environmental management have complemented
   one another in many ways.


2. Our comments about the implementation of the structural reform program supported
   by ESES DPL series are as follows:


Energy Sector

3. Turkey has a dynamic energy agenda and accordingly has been implementing an
   ambitious energy sector program with a view to meeting the country’s growing
   energy demand in an efficient and sustainable manner in order to support economic
   and social development while taking environmental concerns into account. In this
   context, our energy policy aims; (i) to enhance energy supply security, (ii) to utilize
   both public and private means within the framework of free market practices, (iii) to
   decrease import dependency, (iv) to strengthen our country’s position in regional and
   global energy trade, (v) to achieve diversification in energy resources, routes and
   technologies, (vi) to ensure maximum use of renewable sources, (vii) to improve
   energy efficiency and (viii) to minimize negative environmental impacts.


4. In this vein, the reforms being undertaken broadly comprise; (i) unbundling of the
   electricity sector into its different business activities (transmission, generation,
   distribution, wholesale trading and retail supply), (ii) creating an independent energy
   market regulator and implementing a regulatory framework and a licensing regime;
   (iii) privatizing the state-owned electricity distribution and generation businesses; and
   (iv) creating a competitive market in electricity both at the wholesale and the retail
   levels, which are overall in line with the EU Acquis Communitaire.


                                            32
5. In the context of these policies, our Government has developed two important
   strategy documents regarding energy sector. First one is the Electricity Market and
   Security of Supply Strategy, which was approved by High Planning Council on May
   18, 2009, sets out a very ambitious goal to increase the share of renewable sources in
   electricity generation to at least 30 percent by 2023. Moreover, this strategy envisages
   the total 20.000 MW installed capacity of wind energy and 600 MW installed
   capacity of geothermal energy by 2023.


6. The other significant strategy is the Energy Efficiency Strategy which was approved
   by the High Planning Council in February 2012, sets out an overall target of reducing
   Turkey’s energy intensity by 20 percent by 2023 in comparison to 2011 level.
   Furthermore, the Energy Efficiency Strategy has some ambitious goals such as,
   decreasing the energy consumption in buildings, achieving market transformation for
   energy efficient appliances and products, promoting energy efficiency in
   transportation and improving the efficiency in electricity generation, transmission and
   distribution.


7. In achieving these goals, which are embedded in our main policy documents; our
   fundamental strategy is to encourage the participation of private investors through
   new investments and also through privatizations. Within this context and in line with
   our liberalization policy in the energy sector, the share of public investments in
   energy sector is being gradually decreased. We have successfully completed the
   distribution privatization program as of September 30, 2013 and hereby the sector has
   been wholly privatized. In the energy generation side, all the Government owned
   power plants, except the hydroelectric power plants of nearly 7,500 MW in capacity,
   are envisaged to be privatized with the coordination of Privatization Administration,
   giving priority to the coal-run plants. The Electricity Energy Sector Reform and
   Privatization Strategy Paper, which sets out the short and medium term road map for
   market reforms and privatizations, was approved in 2004 and significantly
   contributed to this process.


8. We have also taken important steps in restructuring the government institutions in
   energy sector. The former Integrated Generation and Transmission Corporation
   (TEAŞ) was closed and three new institution have been established, which are the
   Electricity Generation Corporation of Turkey (EÜAŞ), the Electricity Trading
   Corporation of Turkey (TETAŞ) and the Turkish Electricity Transmission
   Corporation (TEİAŞ). Besides, Electricity Distribution Corporation of Turkey
   (TEDAŞ), which has been already separated from TEAŞ earlier, was restructured into


                                            33
   separate regional distribution companies in preparation for their privatization. As of
   end-September 2013, all regional distribution companies were privatized each of
   which had been divided into two as wholesale and retail companies. Regulation on
   Measures Regarding Distribution and Supply Licenses in Electricity Market was
   issued on August 2, 2013 to protect the consumers and to avoid disruption in services.


9. With regard to the electricity sector reforms, one of our main principles is to create
   and maintain a market structure that would ensure supply security. In this vein, a
   bilateral contract market, which is integrated with a balancing and settlement system,
   has been put in operation. Consumers whose annual consumption exceeds 5 MWh are
   currently eligible to choose their own supplier.


10. Our Government, in parallel with the privatization process, is focused on creating an
    enabling legal and regulatory framework for private investments in the energy sector
    and ensuring the energy supply security through supervision and monitoring
    activities. With the Electricity Market Law (Law No. 4628), which was enacted in
    2001, the liberalization process for electricity markets was initiated. The Electricity
    Market Law also envisaged the establishment of a regulatory authority, namely;
    Energy Market Regulatory Authority (EMRA). EMRA’s mandate covers licensing,
    approval of market rules and codes, tariff setting and customer service issues.


11. Regulation on Electricity Market Balancing and Settlement has been issued in
    compliance with the provisions of Electricity Market Law in 2004. With the
    effectiveness of this Regulation a new unit, the Market Financial Settlement Center
    (PMUM), has been established under the body of TEİAŞ that shall operate the
    settlement side of balancing and settlement system by calculating amounts payable or
    receivable by legal entities operating in the market. EMRA issued new balancing and
    settlement regulations in 2009 to improve the functioning of the electricity market.
    Accordingly, facilities for hourly balancing and hourly settlement have been
    implemented and PMUM moved to hourly settlement in December 2009. Moreover,
    the day-ahead market was launched on December 1, 2011, which made it possible for
    market participants to balance their own portfolios and hence to offer to the operator
    (TEİAŞ) a balanced system one day earlier. This aims to serve to reduce the real –
    time balancing during the day and to further develop the electricity market.


12. In order to monitor, evaluate and adopt measures for the security of electricity supply
    the Electricity Market Law was substantially amended in 2008. The name of Law No.
    4628 has been changed as Law on the Structures and Duties of EMRA with the



                                            34
   enactment of the new Electricity Market Law (Law No. 6446), which was published
   in March 30, 2013. The new Electricity Market Law has ensured that the
   establishment of Energy Markets Operation Company (EPİAŞ), as a result of
   restructuring of PMUM, will enable to handle the spot transactions in the energy
   markets.


13. The Renewable Energy Law (Law No. 5346) was enacted in 2005 to promote private
    renewable energy investments. Furthermore, in order to engage the renewable energy
    sources to the economy by enhancing the utilization of these sources in electricity
    generation to the extent possible, the Parliament has approved an amendment to the
    Renewable Energy Law in December 2010, which was entered into force in January
    2011. The Law provides technology-based feed-in tariffs and additional incentives for
    the use of domestically produced equipment. Certification of renewable energy
    sources is set out by Regulation on the Certification and Support of Renewable
    Energy Sources issued on October 1, 2013 by replacing the former regulation.


14. The Energy Efficiency Law (Law No. 5627) was enacted in 2007 and its secondary
    legislation has been put in place, which resulted with obligatory implementations
    regarding the use of energy and energy sources efficiently.


15. With the Gas Market Law (Law No. 4646), which was enacted in 2001, BOTAŞ lost
    its monopoly and the privatization process of natural gas distribution companies has
    been started. Now we are in the process of drafting an amendment to the Gas Market
    Law to ensure supplying the natural gas in a more sustainable manner, and also to
    establish a more stable and transparent gas market.


16. Regulation on the Unlicensed Electricity Generation was issued on October 2, 2013
    to replace the previous regulation enacted on July 21, 2011. The main aim is to meet
    the electricity needs by the nearest generation facility to the consumption point which
    adds small-scale facilities to the system, decrease transmission loss and consequently
    improve security of supply.



Climate Change

17. Turkey became a party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
    Change (UNFCCC) on May 24, 2004 and to the Kyoto Protocol on August 26, 2009
    in order to deal with challenges of the climate change in cooperation with



                                            35
   international community. In this vein, Turkey has embraced the framework of
   “common but differentiated responsibilities” regarding the contributions to the
   international efforts on climate change mitigation. In this context, our Government’s
   obligation is to develop national policies, compatible with sustainable development
   principles, in combating climate change and to take necessary measures in order to
   build resilience to climate change.


18. Turkey’s vision on climate change is to become a country using energy more
    efficiently, increasing the share of clean and renewable resources in energy
    generation, and hence providing its citizens a high quality of life with low – carbon
    intensity. In this regard, the National Climate Change Strategy was approved by the
    High Planning Council on May 3, 2010. The Climate Change Action Plan, which has
    been prepared within the context of the Strategy, was approved by the Coordination
    Board on Climate Change in May 2011. The Action Plan sets out the mitigation
    activities in relevant sectors and the urgent adaptation measures to increase our
    country’s resilience to climate change.



Sustainable Environment Management

19. Our Government has put in place a number of legislative and institutional reforms to
    protect the environment with achieving harmonization with the environmental
    policies of EU being the main anchor. Our efforts on this front is built around the
    concepts of “pollution prevention” rather than “pollution control”, prevention of
    pollution at source, minimization of waste, utilization of best available techniques and
    technologies, the efficient use of energy, cleaner production, sound management of
    chemicals, effective application of the inspection system and application of the
    “polluter pays” principle.


20. In this vein, the transposition of 96 EU environment related directives to the national
    law has been completed in a considerable extent with the enactment of 2 laws, 47
    Regulations, 19 Communiques and 55 Circulars, and still the process has been
    continuing on the preparation of 13 Regulations. Furthermore, to reach the targets
    mandated by these legislations and to improve the environment quality we have
    adopted action plans and strategies including EU Integrated Environmental
    Approximation Strategy (2007-2023), Waste Management Action Plan (2008-2012),
    Waste Water Treatment Action Plan (2008-2012), Environmental Noise Action Plan
    (2009-2020), Clean Air Action Plan (2010-2014), National Climate Change Strategy
    (2010-2020) and Climate Change Action Plan (2011-2023).



                                            36
21. The measures we have taken for a sustainable and cleaner development path include
    the following Regulations;


   (i) Regulation on Large Combustion Plants aims to control emissions from energy
       generation facilities and to prevent their negative impacts on the environment and
       human health.


   (ii) Regulation on Industrial Air Pollution Control provides the framework conditions
        and limit values for the operation of industrial activities including energy
        production facilities.


   (iii)Regulation on the Control of Soil Pollution and Contaminated Sites by Point
        Sources covers principles and methods for prevention of soil contamination;
        identification, cleaning and monitoring of contaminated or potentially
        contaminated sites, has been put into force with the aim of achieving more
        efficient water and soil management.


   (iv) Regulation on Permits and Licenses and its amendments in accordance with the
        Environment Law establishes an integrated system that combines all
        environmental licenses and permits required by industrial installations into a
        single e-permit.


   (v) Regulation on Monitoring, Reporting and Verification of Greenhouse Gas
       Emissions aims the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions of the private sector
       plants which are operating in one of the sectors of electricity generation,
       petroleum refinery, petro chemistry, cement, iron-steel, aluminum, brick,
       ceramics, lime, paper and glass, starting from 2016.
