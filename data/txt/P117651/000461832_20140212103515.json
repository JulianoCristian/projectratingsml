Programmatic Environmental Sustainability and Energy Sector\n            Development Policy Loans Programs for Turkey had overall\n            satisfactory outcomes, with the performances of the Bank and\n            the borrower being deemed satisfactory as well. Of the\n            thirty-two project development objective indicators, eleven\n            targets were exceeded, nineteen were fully achieved, one was\n            mostly achieved, and one was not achieved. All three\n            intermediate outcome indicators were completely achieved.\n            Significant lessons learned during implementation of the\n            programs include: 1) the use of a Development Policy Loan\n            (DPL) was a strategic choice of instrument after an\n            extensive and substantial engagement of investment lending\n            and Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA) work in the\n            energy sector; 2) proactive use of the flexibility in the\n            country partnership strategy process and the DPL instrument\n            were very important in order to adapt to both external and\n            internal political economy factors; 3) the flexibility of\n            the DPL instrument was utilized to maximum effect and longer\n            term benefit when the scope of the original energy DPL\n            program was extended to climate change and environmental\n            management in response to the government's readiness to\n            raise the dialogue on these important cross-cutting\n            development themes to a significantly higher level with the\n            international community including the Bank; 4) even with the\n            strongest commitment, sometimes reforms cannot be\n            implemented according to the original schedules; and 5) a\n            DPL that cuts across several themes brings considerable\n            additional complexity in the design but at the same time\n            results in high pay-off as it pursues a more holistic approach."}, "docdt": "2013-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
