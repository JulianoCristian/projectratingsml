                         The proposed APL project, Phase A, would increase The City of Buenos Aires resilience to flooding through protection of its critical infrastructure and the introduction
                         of a risk management approach to the government investment program. The project would focus on the issue of risk identification and reduction through prevention,
                         mitigation, education and training.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project has continued with a good implementation pace, the construction of the short and long tunnels has been completed and the short tunnel is in operation. The performance
                         tests for the long tunnel are planned for June 2012.

                         Works for the first of six groups of secondary drainage networks (group A) have now started construction and the procurement process for group B is completed. The supervision of

                         these works will be done by the Ministry of Urban Development. City representatives have informed that funding from the 2012 City Budget had been allocated to the construction of
                         these two groups. The Bank and the City agree on the importance of continuing with the construction of all planned secondary network groups (C,D,E,F) in the Maldonado basin in
                         order to maximize Project benefits in terms of flood vulnerability reduction, and City representatives are currently looking for possible funding alternatives.

                         Non-structural measures have lagged behind in implementation, and efforts by the implementation unit (UPEAM) have focused in the structural measures which consumed most of
                         the financial resources. Nevertheless, there have been important achievements under an ongoing contract for the preparation of a Master Plan for the management of green areas
                         and urban forestry, which early products have been used as inputs for the mathematical flood model and for the regulatory and legislative proposals for public policies to include the
                         flood risk topic. Another important focus of the non structural measures has been the development of a hydro-meteorological monitoring system (SIHVIGILA), which is now under
                         tender. The bidding documents were approved on November 2011 after many rounds of revisions by the Bank and the City experts (including the participation of Defensa Civil).
