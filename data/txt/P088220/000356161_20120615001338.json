To adjust to\n            implementation experience the following changes are in\n            process: 1) changing the project indicators and target\n            values to simplify the results framework, clarify\n            ambiguities around the quantification of certain values, and\n            accurately reflect activities financed under the project and\n            their outcomes; 2) extension of the closing date to August\n            31, 2012 (amounting to 2 months) and completing ongoing\n            technical assistance activities and works; and 3)\n            reallocation of funds from two of the loan agreement\n            disbursement categories to the 'consultants services\n            and project audits' disbursement category.
