                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The proposed APL project, Phase A, would increase The City of Buenos Aires resilience to flooding through protection of its critical infrastructure and the
                         introduction of a risk management approach to the government investment program. The project would focus on the issue of risk identification and reduction
                         through prevention, mitigation, education and training.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project has a good implementation pace, the construction of the short tunnel has been finalized and is in operation, and the long tunnel is expected to be finished by the end of
                         the year followed by performance tests.

                         Works for the secondary drainage network (group A) have now started construction and the procurement process for the group B secondary drainage and B is almost completed. The

                         Bank has approved the supervision of these works by the Urban Development Ministry. There is not enough funding for the group B secondary drainage works under the current
                         Bank loan, and City officials are looking to identify other sources of funding.

                         The implementation unit (UPE) has prepared and finalized the bidding documents for the hydro-meteorological monitoring system (SIHIVIGILA). The bid document was approved on

                         November 16th 2011 after many rounds of revisions among the Bank and the City experts (including Defensa Civil). The procurement process should be launched soon.

                         The Bank and the UPEAM (Project implementing Unit within Ministry of Urban Development) are preparing the grounds to undertake a detailed supervision mission that will take
                         place on December 12 to 16 2011. At the end of the mission, the team will prepare an aide-memoir to be signed with the authorities and will update the Implementation Status Report.
