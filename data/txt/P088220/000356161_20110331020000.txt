SUMMARY
1.     This Restructuring Paper reflects the following proposed changes with regards to
the closing date and other features of the Argentina, Urban Flood Prevention and
Drainage Project APL2 (the Project), Loan No. 7382-AR, P093491 requested by the
Borrower:

       (i)    Extension of the loan's closing date for eighteen (18) months from March
       31, 2011 until September 30, 2012 to enable the completion of ongoing contracts
       and the preparation of additional subprojects; and

       (ii)    Creation of a new category of disbursements for Operating Costs and
       reallocation of loan proceeds to enable payment of rent of office space and other
       administrative costs related with Project management.

       (iii) Update of the Project's Results Framework based on implementation
       experience.



PROJECT STATUS
2.      Implementation Status: Currently, around 28% of the total loan proceeds have
been disbursed while a total 39% is committed under signed contracts for works and
technical assistance. At present, two works have been fully completed and commissioned
and four are under execution (one of them with an expected completion date of April
2011). Commitments for an additional 26% under three additional subprojects and
technical assistance activities are in an advanced stage of preparation. Project
implementation progress has been slow mainly due to: (i) a significant delay in reaching
effectiveness (21 months); and (ii) difficulties and delays in the signature of subsidiary
loan agreements and approval by the provinces. The implementation and disbursement
lag must be interpreted however in the context of a reduced implementation period, as the
Project has been under implementation for three years since its effectiveness in March
2008.

PROPOSED CHANGES
3.    Results Indicators: Some of the indicators to monitor PDO and intermediate
outcome achievement, and some of the target and achieved values have been revised in


                                            3
view of implementation experience. Details are attached in Annex 1. The main changes
made are the following:
   · Target value for PDO Indicator No. 1 (Size of area protected by proposed works
       in selected provinces) was changed from 2,630 Ha to 3,099 Ha based on the
       current implementation plan and subprojects under execution and preparation;
   · PDO Indicator No. 2 was re-worded to include elements that need to be present in
       a risk mapping exercise (Number of Municipalities for which land use planning
       includes risk mapping, including identification, location, quantification and
       characterization of population) and its target value was changed from 13
       municipalities to 5 municipalities based on the current implementation plan
   · A new PDO indicator No. 3 (Population with reduced flood vulnerability as a
       result of proposed works in participating provinces) was introduced to permit
       tracking of total project beneficiaries

4.      Financing: As a result of the incorporation of the new category of disbursements
and reallocation of loan proceeds described in paragraphs 5 and 6 below, proposed
Project Costs would be as follows:

5.     New Category of Disbursements: The addition of a new category of
disbursements for "Operating Costs" under Part D of the project is proposed to enable
payment of rent of office space and other administrative expenses related with Project
management during the extension period.

6.     Reallocation of funds: The reallocation is necessary to allocate funds to the new
category of disbursements. Proceeds for the Loan would be reallocated as follow:

7.    Extension of Closing Date: The closing date for the Project would be extended
from March 31, 2011 until September 30, 2012.

8.       An Action Plan for the implementation during the extension period has been
agreed with the Borrower. With this plan, it is estimated that at least around 70% of the
total funds could be committed and almost fully disbursed during an 18 month extension
under a base case conservative scenario, allowing around 400,000 people in total to
benefit from flood protection and urban drainage works. The proposed 18 month
extension would enable the following: (i) the completion of all works under the different
ongoing subprojects with signed contracts; (ii) the initiation and almost completion of 3
subprojects that are in the final stage of preparation (expected to benefit around 250,000
people); and (iii) the undertaking of several consultancies and technical assistance
activities already identified by the provinces.

9.     This would be the first extension of the Project. Project objectives continue to be
achievable.
