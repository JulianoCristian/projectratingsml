Attached is the "Project Completion Report on Myanmar -- Third Port
Project (Credit 1372-BA)" prepared by the East Asia and Pacific Region. No Part
II we prepared by the Borrower.
Bank assistance to the port sector began with the 1956 A&U&M  Port
ktolget (Loan 140-BA) and continued with the 1976 Second Port Prolect (Credit
671-BA). The Third Port Prolect (SDR46.4 million of May 1983) vas to enable the
port of Yngoan (formerly Rangoon) to handle, until about 1990, forecasted growth
in Seneral cargo and containerized traffic by improving port efficiency through
capital livestments, and technical assistace. The credit closing date was
extended three times for a total of four years. The PCR notes that, at the time
of writing (May 1993), the credit had not been fully disbursed sad that the
account had not yet been closed.
All project components were implemented but little waJ achieved In
terms of operational improvements. During the project period there has been a
sharp downturn of the economy accompanied by domestic instability since 1988, and
the Ministry of Pinance was unuwlling to allow tariff adjustments. As a result,
total traffic hardly increased, container traffic is running at 202 of the
appraisal forecast, productivity is low, the re-estlasted economic rate of return
is between 4-52 (as against 292 estimated at appraisal), financial objectives
were not met and the rate of return on assets dropped below the 61 mandated In
the Development Credit Agreement.
The PCR gives a thorough account of project preparation and
Implementation, and points at the principal obstacles (macroeconomic, political,
administrative and procurement) which prevent the Myanuss' Port Authority to
Increase productivity and make full use of the fine facilities that have ben.
provided. Overall, the project is rated as unsatisfactory, its sustainability
as unlikely, and its institutional impact as negligible.
The project may be audited along with the Second Port Project.

This is dhe Project Completion Report (PCR) for the lTird Port Project in the Union of
Myanmar (fortely the Socialist Republic of the Union of Buma), for which International
Development Asociaon (IDA) Cretdit 1372-BA in the amount of SDR46.4 milion (equivalent to
approximatly US$50.0 miion at appl) ws appwved on 24 May 1983. The Closing Dat for the
redit was 30 September 1992, but the  t  acount has not yet been dosed because an ounding
sum in the Special Account has not yet been accounted for by the Govenment or refinded to IDA.
MTh credit dosing dte was exended three times for a totl of four yem The acedithas not been fully
disbursed, and it is xped  tht an amount of SDRO.5-SDRI.0 million (equivalent to US$0.7-
US$1.4 million) will be cancelled. The final disbursement was made on 6 January 1993, when all the
disb-rsement from the Credit toulled US$60.7 million.
The PCR was jointly preaed by the Infraucture  ions DWision, County De   nt
I of the East Asia and Pacific Region (EAIIN) and the Infr ture Division of the    Technical
Department (ASI PN)Pefae Evaluation Summary and Pats I and III), and the Bormwer, which has
not provided its comments and observations (Pat II). The PCR is based, inter alia4 on the Staff
Appraisal Report (SM); the Development Credit Agrement (DCA); supemion reports; the
Boowe's own records and monthly pross reportS; cortondence between IDA and the Borrowew
and internal IDA memoranda.

The aim of thc project was to enable dte port of Yangon (formedy Rangoon) to handlb, untl
about 1990, dte projected growth in intenational breakbulk general cargo and containcrised traffic by
improving port efficiency and basic porserces. It was exp d that, aft 1990, a new port at
Thiawawoud bc requircd. The main objeie were to:
(a)  (O provide additional general and continerised cago handling equipment and paLls to
a e   geeral cargo and container opeations; (u) provide telecommunicadons
equipment for seting up a centralised operadng control center for cago andling
operatons; (ii) install impwved lighting to operating areas of the por; and (iv)
introduce measures to reduce cago dwel time and delas in ddiry of rice and timbe
to sips betthed at theport
(b)   constuct a container yard and container fig  stion (CFS), and enred timber log
and rice storagreas;
(c)   renew and rehabilitate MPAs harbour craf and n n  aids with provision for:
(i) acquisition of two new marine vesels; (ii) constution of small gab dredgrs, self-
proplled hopper barges and mooring buoys in MPAs yards; (i rd bilitation of tree
sece vessels, mooring and navigation buoys, work baqes and boas in MPA!s yads;
(iv) ovaraul and provision of spa for the suction dredger Thaung Naing Yay (TNY);
and (v) procurement of ancillary equipment for dockyard workshops and for
communkations and navigatioa aids;
(d)   rehabilitate floaing pontoon berths used for the foreshore jetes and two deep sea
bers, tosherwi apprach bddges and ancillary equipmem
(c)   provide consutnts' services to supetvise (i) constuction of the container yard and CPS;
and (ii) consrucion oftwo new harbour vesseh; and
(f0   provide training coures for MPA!s staff in major port activities and provision of
taninequipment
The Thir Port Project was appraised in October 1982, the Credit was approved on 24 May
1983 and became effective on 18 October 1983. The IDA Credit (1372-BA) for t  project anounted
to SDR 46 milion (equivalent to approximately US$50.0 million at appraisal) The Crodit has not
ben filly disbursed and the acoount has not been dosed because of an oustnding sum in the Special
Accunt, which has not yet been acunted for by the Borrower.
The project staed slowly bcaue procuement procedure wihn the ovn     b    y
were lengthy and involved, lardy due to inexperience on the part of the sa. The contrcts with
Public Works, which was to carry out the civil works by force account, and with the international
consultans who were to supvise were not signed until the end of 1985. Even then, work proceeded
slw  as a decision on whetier the cduld be srfaced with gavel, asphalt or concre
blocks could not be made until adequatdy strong concrete blocks could be fabricated. This process

spare p wa boe down by there bng too many mconuc to process. Eventually these were
agrgtd into largr contat and the proeu  ran more smoothly.
As the project wore on, it becme dear that ther were going to be considerble  in the
prceeds of the Cret. Wth IDA peamission, these savins were applied to futher civil wolcs and to
the prouteumet of addiional equipment and mateal. The Crd dosed four yer afiter the original
dlosing date
The project evennlly acheved all its physical and kntitutional objectves but achieved litdc in
the way of operaonal improvements, exept for the containa  operation  FinanCial objeaives were
not achieved because of   hayp downtum in the economy, the ci  distrbances of 1988, and the
Minist of Fiance (MOF) reing to allow MPA to reflect a realistic amset value in its balance sheet
and to adjust  accooringly.
The post-projet Economic Rate of Retun (ERR) was esdtmated to be 4-5%, which compares
unfamourably with the 29% simated at appraisal. This poor result was achieved beause taffic hardly
incread ove the petiod of the project. Container traffic, which has shown an inctease, is running at
only 20% of the appraisal foecast.
Prvision of cargo handling equipment, improvents tO sh- facilities as well as renewal of
marine suppoit senvices has hdped the port to handle the throughput, but produci  of the faclity
eve under redvl low volumes suffes from a number of causes. Lack of fuel and foreip exchange
for spare pam prevents much of dte shore equpment and SUpport harbour vessels from being used to
their fill capacity, and a lower thn exeted cago throughput does not help the siuation.
On the financial side, after incuring a net loss of KY30 Million in 1989190, MPA has
i mproved its revue perfornce and operating ratio over dte past tee yeas y bec    of the additional
revenue derived as a rsult of he tariffteiw carried out as part of the projec  The return on assets is
sadsfaowy pwvided the assets continue to be valued and depreciated in accordance with GOM
inucions, iLe. based on original cost. If, however, values for depreciation, based on   ement
cs, and inteest epense are induded, the rate of retun on asset drops sharply to below te 6%
madatd in the DCA. At the present level of trafflc and port efficiency, port charges and revenues
barely cover opeating e ses and depedaton (on a     ecost basis).
Ihe project should aist the port in meedng demand over the medium term. The container
yard and support fcilities with esmated capacity of 40,000 to 46,000 ThU/year (23,000 import
TEU) could handle potentially more, pedrps 33,600 import TEU with deceased dwel times and
more efficient yard opations. Tot   cpr city, depnding upon the traffic mix, is in the order of 3
million tonS Achieving this volume depends upon increased Vng productvity and reduction of cao
and woking dels, as wl as eedig movement of caprg throh the port There is at present litde
indication tha dse  pents are ly to be achieved as there does not seem tO be the necessa
incensive

lTi project cannot be dassed as a &ilure. but neither can it be heralded as a success StO,
largely beca   of the sharp downturn in the econouLy. Many foundations were laid for future
improvm    in permances but these wi not be achieved without a mwed improvement in the
economcsituation or the necsay incive on the part ofdt management and emplyees of MPA to
incre producivity and make fidl use ofthe fine failitU that have been provided.

2.01      Myanmar has a land area ofabout 262,000 sq mi comprising lowlands in the basins of the
four maor rivers, the Ifrawaddy, Chindwin, Sitang and Salween, surrounded by more mountainous
remain to the east north, and west, and divided by a range of hills  north to south in central
Myanmar. The country is well endowed with natual rsourmcs and had, in 1983, a popuion of about
35 million, which was growing at a rv  of 233% per annum. About one quarter of tie population was
living in urbana   and the rest was dispersed in a lap number ofvila mody lced in the main
jicultual areas in the river basins and the Ir waddy dela.Te main centers of populton and
eonomic acrvity ae Yangon (formerly Ragoon) and Mandalay. Yangon is the capita, the sea of
enment and as the countys only intraionA I port and airport.
2.02      Becaus of damagesuered duri Wodt War II, interl urest and a decade of economic
stagnation during a period of social restructurig from the mid-Ws to the mid-70s, Myanmar's
economy ws in a poor ste by 1976. In the lte 1970's, the then Govement of Burma (now the
Governent of Myanmar (GOM)) initated a seris of refo  which aimed to expand the output of

economic growt and to rea    a surplus in the balce of payments, while avoiding undesirable
inationaypressures Such a prgrm required, inter alia (a) recovey and m'intenance of forestry and
agricultural production; (b) further i vments in capacity utilamion and productivity, especially in
Utsport and indust  (c) a more s     approach tO puic invtment projects; and (d) sufficient
resources, bot frgn and domestic, to car out the invesent program.
2.03      In 1983, transport and communicaions togeter accounted for about 5% of GDP and
over 3% of tol employment. Between 1976/77 and 1980/81, mechanized feit traffic, in terms of
tons loaded, increased from 49 million to 63 million tons at a gwth rae of 6.5% per annum. It was
seen dth continued economic devdopment would be reflected in increasd levels of imports and
export whih would put additional prssu  on the port of Yangon which handled over 95% of all

4.02      In oraer to ty and ens  a rapid start to the implementation of the vaious civil works and
nari   vessel contra  and also of instituional refoms which wre avial  rdient of the p- jeca, a
number of key da  were incoporate into covena  in            t Crdit Ageeet (DCA).
These covered deadlines and conditions for: (a) site clace frthe containe yar; (b) achievement of
improved productivity aWs and the coDection of operdonal dat on a regular basis for the
computadon of efficiency indicators; (c) reduction of carp dwel times; (d) establishment of Progress
Coordinaton, Intemal Audit and Traing Divisions; (e) avaluaion of the repair or replacement of
MPAs existing dredger, (fl reiuation of MPAs fixed assets and incotporation of the revsed value in
its balance shoet and (g)  out a tariff review, especially for the newly emering container traffic,
so that MPA woud continue to obtain a retur on assets of at least 6%.
4.03      Responsibility for implementation was vsted in MPA, which signed a Subsidiary Loan
Agreement with GOM, which onent the procoeds of the credit to MPA at 8.5% interest In order to
effctively manage the project, MPA set up a Project Implementation Unit headed by a Project
Minager and appropriate      sappotff. Supervision of ciil wodrs and marine vend ciiistruction
contracts was to be ciet out by inteaionl conltants.
4.04      The total cost of the project induding tae and duties, was esdmed at about US$98
million equivalent, with a foreig e  component, to be financed by the Credit, of US$50 million
equivalent. Taking a con e  iei of the future prospects of Yangon Port, the economic rae of
return (       was calulated to be 29%.
405       The project was not particulady innovative in any respect, but was well conceived and
dwef4 hught-out.
5.    EW
5.01      The credit was signed on July 18, 1983 ad became effective on October 18, 1983. Initial
progress ws very slow, however, and the contiact with Public Wodcs (PW) (formery the Constuion
Corporation) for the cnatuction of the coniner yard and CFS was not signed until two years later, in
October 1985. The conmct for constuion superviWon of the civil works was signed with a fim of
intertional consultants shoty afier this, in November 1985.
5.02      Many other components of the project, some of which should have been completed by
dates laid down in the DCA, were also vey Iate in swdn
(a) the requited insttutional chans, whih should have been effected by the end of 1983,
were not completed on ime; formation of the Progress Coordinaion, Intnal Audit and
Training Divisions took place formally in July 1985, but the or ons were not
finalied and implemented untl eary 1986;
(b) revaluaion of MPA's fixed assets should have been completed and the revsed value
incorporated in the balance sheet by March 31, 1985; revaluation was not completed unti
late 1986 and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) would not allow the new value to be
incorporated into MPA's accounts, despite the Government's agreement for doing this,
which is contined in the DCA;
(c) a rview of port tadfli should have been completed by 1985 takdng account of the revised
asset value arived at as a result of the above  luaton; this review was not completed and
pUt into effc until mid 1990, with MOP sill refusing to permit MPA to take ccoount of
tde relistic value of its asset;

(d) sudit rports were inibly lae but this improved towards the end of the project, in
1991;
(e) the intnsive dredging  tpertion cared out by the dredger TNY, in order to evluate
whether it should be rehabilitated or replacd, did not pgrs as planned; there were
fiequen inteons bcause of lack of fud, mechanical breakdown or absece of the
captain;
(0  site dearance for the contaer yard, which should have been completed by the end of
1983, ws completed in November 1986; and
(g) a comprehensive       rogramme was formulated in eady 1985, but few if any of the
courses were taken up when p d; most of the training was carried out twards the end
of dte exted project, in 1990-92.
5.03       he civil wodrs contract, to consuct a contner yard and CFS, progsed slowly when it
did entualy start, in late 1985. Deays we incured by shortaes of cement and fued and by the lak
of a decision on what type of surficing to put on the container yard. MPA wanted to use concrete
blocki6 but, becamse of the poor quality of Myanma cement and the variable quality ofthe agghe
te spemens of adequate strength were difficut to produce, even under abotator conditions. The
Bank sgested to MPA that a gravel su ed container yard would be an excelent choice for Yangon
as it coul bequidHy laid, drained wdl, would save about US$1.0 million, would not constrain MPA as
to any other form of surficing that it might want to lay in the fiture if container on'utons were to be
moved to a new port, and had prmvd very successful in seval countries The Baa arranged and pid
for a sympoim on gavd surfaot cotaier yards to be ien in Yangon, but MPA was not impressed
a  even sharply cdiised the Bank for aring it. MPA suggestd at normal concrete ufcing be
used, but this was reected on the grounds of the poor cement and the necessity for impor-  steel
reinfrcement. Eventually blocks of adequate sengt were produced using cement from a di
domestic source, and then there was a further dely, whle the block-making machine was procured.
Block production stared in eady 1988, but dtis was followed by a suspension of work caused by ci
disturbances during 1988. In order to address the fuel shortage, the credit aeement was amened, in
November 1987, and US$0.56 million of the credit funds wee rea ocated for petoleum products
This did not immediaely solv the problem, but the siuaion eased considerably afier IDA urged
GOM t make the raMllocatd funds vilable from the aodi for the purchase of fiie  Tlhe conmainer
yard was finally compleaed a the end of 1991.
5.04      The procureame  and delive of new equipment,  aion aids, spare part and matrials
for the constuion and rehabiitaton of marine cra  pontoons and buoys, were delaed by slo-w
bureauriic procedures. FInl deliie were not made untl 1991. Bccause of lower than expected
tender prices, changes in irndona exchandge rms le     to an appreciation of the SDR ad the
distortions inrouced by the unrlisdc official exdange rate, sains fom the credit funds amounted
to over US$20 million. With IDA approval, dtee savings were expended on firther purhase of
materials and equipmet, induding a new suction dredger to replace the one that was to hawe been
overhauled under the project, and on additional civil wor6 induding wharf  ghenig and slipway
ension. Delivery of dtis equipment ant compledon of these contcts we achieve in eay 1992,
by which time the credit dosing da  had been exended thr  times for a tota of four years, from 30
Septmber 1988 to 30 Septembr 1992
5.05      In April 1989, the coporme struce ofrthe  r Burma Por Corpoation was changed
to dtat of a GOM authority. Tis change, which under the crcmstammn  wss a retogrde move, was
ac-ompanied by MPA having to tun over to GOM al its splus fniD  and to apply to the govenumt
for all fre fiunding requ     Much of the incentie to  iov the efficiency of opaons was
thereby lost.

6.01      Te ptoject eenually achieved Al its physl and insti;sonal objecdtis, but achieved
litde in the way of operational improvnu, ecept for the containr options. Fanci ob ves
were not acbhaied bose of a sp downturn in dte eoonomy, the civil disturbances of 1988, and
MO F        to alow MPA to rect in its balance sheet asset values based on replkacment costs and
to adjust t     accodiy.
6.02     The orginal objectives of the project were to enable the Port of Yangon to handle an
z    dc growth in inertional ao and containe tafc dwough improents to port opaons
ad efficiency. Becaue of onomic stag on as wel as politi   srons over tet  yea snce
appraisal of the project, traffic     insutead of gwin ffc lees i 1991/92 were 80% of those
reahedten yew earier. The new container yad and CFS provied at Bo Aung Gyaw Street Whares
(BSW) (formedy Brooking Street Wharves) is curndy handling about 1000 TEU per month.
Container traffic is once again growing, up fiom an aver  6QO TEU/month during 1991/92, but this
would stdll repsent less dtan 20% of the appraisal forecs Provision of cago handling equipment,
improvments to shore ficilities as well as ewal of marine support senices has helped the port to
handle the thmughput but rduivty of the fcilit e   unde relaively low volumes suffers from a
number of causes. Lack of fuel and foreign echange for spare pam prevents much of the shore
equipment and support harbour vessdes from being used. Ddays in berthing and vessed wodring are
to dimb with rcoovy of traffic, this being a product of delays in cargo ddivery and dearance.
which has not imprv  appreciably since the eady 1980s. Poor producivity from the dredging fleet
firther resicts use of certain whanr  at Sule Pagoda. On the other hand, effort have been made to
deas  ca  dweil dme which has been rduced fiom 30 to 12 dy, which is within the target range
sta  in the SAR Handling productvity is reoing from the iow point of 1988/89, and import
ar  gang pF       e i bette tan in 1980. Ra    than enable the port to handle an inasing
volume oftrffic, the projt isted allowed MPA to cope with a lowe or stagnt lvd oftafflc more
nas MPA allwed its resource to run down. On this basis, the c ted benefits of avoided
berth invatmen and vessd delays, which produced a projected ERR of 29% at appraisal, did not
meIalisev  On the other hand, the project has allowed a basic level of tdffic dtough t  port to
condnue. On the basis of sustaining his levd of actvity, a post-project ERR in the order of 5% has
been estimated, using a more alistic exchange rate of US$1 - Ky7O, instead of the official rate of
US$1  Ky6. If the official rate were to be used, the ERR would be much lower.
6.03.    A useful taining program was impemented, albeit rather late in the project Despite a
ange ofpolicy within MOTC prohibiting oveseas training pms, seal MPA staff a ded
courses and seminar oversa. The knowledge gained sholdd prove beneficial to MPAs fitmre
opcrtions.
6.04      Costs for iidual conacts and project components were generlly bdow appraisal
estimts, and beause of the appreciation of the SDR. US dolar funds were available to procure
additional eq    ent materials and civil works The project com shown in Table 5 in Par III are
based on the o   acil res of xca   (Ky8 to Ky6 - US$1) ruling at the time of appraisal and during
implemention and are thereorc heavily inflated in economic terms. The true cos, using a ralisdc
exhange rat of Ky7O - US$1 would show local costs being reduced by a factor of about 10. At the
time of  ing the credit ccount had not been closed as there was a sum still outanding from the
Special Account of SDRO.087 million, which had not been accounted for by the Borrower. Ile
present undisbused baance is SDRO.595 million, which will be acled  alng with any remaning
sum in the Special Account once this has been finalised.

7.01      The proje* should assit the port in metdng demand ov  the medium term. The
tai  yard and support faciliti with estimated capiy of 40,000 to 46,000 T'U/year (23,000
import  W) could handle potendaily more, pehaps 33.600 import TEU with docraed dwel tims
and more efficient yard opetdons Total port apacit, depending upon the taffic mix, is in the order
of 3 mion ton  Addciing this volume tepends on the economy improving sufficiently to generate
-ufficient tafic, and on incrased gang producvi and rduction of cargo and worlng delays, as wel
a expediting movement of cro through de port. he   is at present litde indicadon dut these
improeen  are likely to e achieved as dwe es not sm to be the nece    incentive or pressure
on xing fcidites and equipment because of thc low klvel of economic activity. A new pot, whi
has been proposed by the Government, at Thilawa annot be reascally supported untl  e abe
thrughputS are achieed and the ports capciy is being filly udlised. On the financial side, afer
incug a net loss of Ky3O Million ip 1989/90, MPA has improved its revenue performance and
operting ratio ovr the past three years becas of the additional rvenue derived as a result of the tariff
reviewcarried out as part of dte project The reum  on assets is satisfitory provided the assets continue
to be valued and depredated on an origina cost basis in accordance with GOM instrctions. If,
however, values for depteciaton, based on the repement cost of assets, and interest expense are
included, the rate of return on assets drops shaply to below the 6% mandated in the DCA. At the
present level of tmffic and port efficiency, port chaus and revenues bary cover operating expenses and
depredation (on a replacg n cost basis).
7.02      Some of the benefits generated by the project could well be lost beause of the acurent
fize on      tO Mynnar. Certinly the benefis arising out of the new equipmnt will continue as
lg as it can be maintained in sviceable condidon. How long this will take depends on the
development of the economy and On GOM permitting MPA to use some of its forign exwhange
earnng for the puchs of spae parts.
8.01      The project was well prepared and  gulady supervised, although, because of the 1987
rernization ofthe World Bank, tee were seeral   s    in pernne going on the supervsion
missionS. This lack of continuity is generlly not well receid by Borrowers and this should be taken
into considerton by the Wold Bank when plannig such organisarional chanle Te Bank dislayed
libili in the ttment of issues dw ae uing p       tion and impltation, particulay m
extending the dosing date of the credit for four years in order to complet all the componens and to
enble  e aving to be expended.
8.02      The main lessons leamed by the Bank were
(a) it is impomnt to allow more time than is usual for impementing project components in
dtose countries, such as Myamar, where the b       passociated with
prrem  areslowand cub uome; and
(b) reortions in the Wodd Bank resut in disruptions to the desirable dose relationships
betwMCn IDA opeation staff and the Borrower and Exeutin Agency.

9.02      The main lessons lamed by the Bonrwer were:
(a) Government procurement procedurs  must be sreamlined for any fiutre projects in order
to ficiliate tmel implemenmtion
(b) the use of asset values and depreciation provisions based on replacement cost, together
with appropre tariff levels, are essentJfor the finanial healt of MPA and to provide
adequte funds for fuue investments; and
(c) unralisdc exchange rates produces distortions within the ewnomy with significant

10.01     A feature of the project was the good rdeaonships dat were built up during preparation
and impl.emetion of the project, despite frequent personnel danges in the supcmsion missions sent
by IDA during impletatio. IDA staff we always wdl received by their Myanma colleagues, who
