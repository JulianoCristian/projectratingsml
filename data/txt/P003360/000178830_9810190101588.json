services. The project will obviate the need to\n            construct additional berths and will include: (a) provision\n            of additional general and containerized cargo handling\n            equipment and telecommunications equipment to increase\n            throughput of existing twelve general cargo berths; (b)\n            construction of a container yard and freight station; (c)\n            improvements to port area lighting, electrical installations\n            and pontoon berth repairs; (d) acquisition of two new marine\n            vessels; (e) renewal and rehabilitation of BPC's\n            existing service vessels, harbor craft, and navigation aids;\n            (f) dredger overhaul; and (g) consultants' services and\n            training of staff."}, "docdt": "1983-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
