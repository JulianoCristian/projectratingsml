Considering the emergency situation and the\n            current security conditions in Iraq, the Environmental and\n            Social Screening Assessment Framework (ESSAF) designed for\n            Iraq will be used for this project. This project entails\n            road rehabilitation, improvement of village access roads,\n            rehabilitation and upgrading of the Erbil to Altun Kopri\n            Road, replacement of existing pontoon bridges, and,\n            technical support. Work projects will therefore be subject\n            to an environmental screening, based on an environmental\n            analysis which includes an evaluation of alternatives,\n            including the \"no-action alternative\" and an\n            examination of the direct and indirect effects of proposed\n            actions, and, an environmental and social management plan\n            will provide a framework for mitigation, monitoring and\n            institutional strengthening actions to be integrated into\n            the design and implementation of the project. Public\n            consultation will be undertaken and environmental studies\n            disclosed to the public. It is specified cultural property,\n            i.e., monuments, works of art, or sites of significance,\n            defined as having archaeological, historical, architectural,\n            or religious significance - will be avoided, and, should new\n            finds occur the authorities should be notified, and steps\n            taken to preserve archaeological sites. Mitigation measures\n            include appropriate engineering design, and, the project\n            will assess feasible alternative/temporary options on a\n            case-by-case basis, to comply with the local ecology.\n            Wastewater must not enter streams without settling ponds,\n            filters, or other processes. Co-ordination with\n            stakeholders, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) must\n            begin in the design phase itself. The natural landscape\n            shall be preserved to the extent possible, through\n            operations that prevent unnecessary destruction, or scarring\n            of natural surroundings. The report also addresses potential\n            resettlement, and compensation issues, including in\n            particular, ethnic groups to ensure these groups\n            participate, and benefit from the project implementation.\n            Grievance mechanisms will be in place to ensure compliance\n            with these safeguards."}, "docdt": "2012-07-05T00:00:00Z"}
