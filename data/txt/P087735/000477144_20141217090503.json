Emergency Road Rehabilitation\n            Project for Iraq had a moderately satisfactory outcome with\n            substantial risk to development outcome. Performance by the\n            Bank and the borrower was moderately satisfactory as well.\n            The project was restructured twice. The first restructuring\n            was to (a) extend the closing date to allow for the\n            implementation of the Um Qasr Al Zubair highway\n            rehabilitation, and (b) to reallocate funds between\n            expenditure categories for Part B to cover escalating\n            construction costs in the Works category. The second\n            restructuring was to (a) extend the closing date to complete\n            on-going works and technical assistance (TA) components for\n            Part A, (b) revise the key performance indicators to reflect\n            realistic results for road and bridge rehabilitation, and\n            (c) to modify the project scope to include a requested\n            supplementary activity to prepare a Transport Sector Master\n            Plan. It is important to note that in 2010 a change in\n            mandate of the implementing agency for Part A, the State\n            Commission for Roads and Bridges (SCRB), meant that the\n            responsibility for village access roads now fell under each\n            Governorate, which financed the rehabilitation of village\n            access roads from their own funds going forward. As a\n            result, all remaining village access road sub-projects for\n            Part A were cancelled as was the development of a road asset\n            management (RAM) system for rural roads to be implemented at\n            SCRB. The following lessons were learned from this project:\n            (1) Timely ratification is important to avoid implementation\n            delay. (2) Generous price contingencies are necessary to\n            control cost overrun in an environment where sourcing and\n            mobilizing material is challenging. (3) More attention\n            should be paid to attract much-needed international\n            expertise by reducing the security risk and increasing the\n            interest level of bidders. (4) In a challenging operating\n            environment, it is important to be able to rely on local\n            agents to monitor safeguards issues in the absence of\n            Bank-led supervision missions. (5) High level commitment is\n            crucial for effective project implementation, particularly\n            in fragile operational environments marked by conflict. (6)\n            Remaining flexible, engaging in continuous dialogue, and\n            showing readiness to adjust to new circumstances should be a\n            top priority when implementing projects in Iraq."}, "docdt": "2014-11-25T00:00:00Z"}
