                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is scheduled to close as planned on June 30, 2014. The overall disbursement is currently at 74% and is expected to reach about 80% by end of June. Already, 150km of
                         main (about 65% of revised target) and 40km of village access roads (100% of revised target) have been rehabilitated and improved in Central and Southern Iraq. Similarly, 38.5km
                         of main (100% of target) and 81.6km of village access (109% of target) roads have been rehabilitated and improved in Kurdistan Regional Government area. Three of four (75% of

                         revised target) critical river crossings (bridges) have been constructed in three governorates, replacing old pontoon bridges. The two technical assistance activities (Road Asset
                         Management and Transport Sector Master Plan) (100% of revised target) are in the final stages and are expected to be completed before the end of June 2014. Sixty One (61) staff
                         members of State Commission for Roads and Bridges (SCRB) in Baghdad and General Directorate for Roads and Bridges (GDRB) in KRG have been trained on Technical Road

                         Implementation of some of the remaining works activities being financed by the Credit continue to progress, but with difficulty, so that the Credit will not be fully disbursed. These
                         works activities include: Um Qasr - Al-Zubair road rehabilitation project (81km), Samawa - Nasiriya road rehabilitation project (20km) and Al-Daraji Bridge construction, are expected
                         to achieve 53%, 85% and 50% completion, respectively. The State Commission for Roads and Bridges (SCRB) has already requested additional funds from the Ministry of Planning
                         (MOP) to complete the works activities that remains after June 30, 2014. MOP agreed to review and allocate the necessary budgets upon SCRB's submittal of the final budget after
                         the Credit closing date.
