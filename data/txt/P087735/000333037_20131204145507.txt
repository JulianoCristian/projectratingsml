Al-Daraji Bridge Environmental & Social Management Plan

                            EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.      Introduction
This executive summary reflects the main issues (project description, baseline conditions,
impact analyses, mitigation measures and monitoring arrangements) of the
Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) conducted for the construction of a
new bridge in Al Daraji (which replaces the temporary bridge with a steel bridge). The
main objective of the ESMP is to examine the environmental and socio-economic
impacts of the project (both construction and maintenance phase), and to propose
mitigation measures.

The wider objective of the project is to improve the condition of rural road networks. The
specific objective is to replace the temporary bridge structures (floating bridge rapidly
approaching the end of its useful life) in Al Daraji by a new stationary bridge.

 The project is expected to result in significant socio-economic benefits for the local
communities and surrounding areas as it will improve the speed and ease of transport,
including for movement of locally products to markets. Increased traffic flow resulting
from the bridge improvements will also increase livelihoods opportunities for local
residents through small businesses service passing traffic. .

2.     Legal and Administrational Framework
For legal aspects, the work during construction and operation must follow the Iraqi laws
and regulations for the Environmental Standards. These are laws of the environment
protection No.3 issued in 1997 and the published regulations. No environmental
regulations for gaseous emissions, noise and other air pollution standards are in force and
legally binding. However, limits for water disposal in any surface waters and main
sewers are regulated according to the regulations no. (25)/1967 and their update
modifications released from the ministry of health and the ministry of the environment.
Law of heritage and antiques no. (55) Issued in 2002, while for a sanitary waste
(municipal) the regulations of the MOE must be followed, and for the rubbles
(construction &demolition waste) the regulations, legislations and instruction of both
MoE and MMPW must be followed.

It should be noted that legislation relating to social safeguards issued in Iraq since 2003
has focused primarily on the ratification of international conventions and protocols on
issues such as cultural heritage. As yet there are no formally adopted requirements for
social assessments relating to road works. Hence, social safeguards issues remain very
largely uncovered except to the extent they are referred to under environmental laws.

Al-Daraji Bridge Environmental & Social Management Plan

In addition to the Iraqi laws and regulation the ESMP will comply with key safeguards
policies and procedures of the World Bank–specifically OP/BP4.01 Environmental
Assessment and OP/BP 4.12 Resettlement.

3.     Project description
The scope of project consists of a fully paved two lane bridge with a total length of
(160m) (with the approaches from both river banks), 9m width and two pedestrian walk
of (1.5 m) width. The bridge will be fully lighted with electrical posts. The bridge was
under construction with approximately 55% accomplished rate. All board piles, columns,
cross beams (except P1), abutments and earth work have been implemented (see annex 1
for photographic evidence). The initial works were guided by ESIA for four bridges
issued in July 2012.

The initial scope of work of Al Daraji bridge project was to replace the old pontoon
bridge that links Euphrates banks at Al Daraji town by a concrete bridge. Due to slow and
unsatisfactory contractor’s implementation, the contract was terminated and then re-
tendered to carry out the remaining works of the bridge. However, the design of the
bridge was revised and modified to steel superstructure for engineering reasons. This
resulted in demolition of some parts of the pre-constructed failed concrete girders.
Despite the changes in the design no additional area will need to be taken to cover the
new design demands.

While the previously constructed pillars are to be reused as the basis for a steel-based
deck, the concrete girders, reinforcing bar and other deteriorated construction material
will remain to be disposed of. The shaped and stockpiled steel bar might, after
rehabilitation, be suitable for small buildings where structural loading is not a significant
consideration. If this is not feasible, the steel should go for recycling. The 20 m long pre-
stressed girders might be broken up, the steel recycled and the concrete crushed for use a
sub-fill in the new bridge abutments.

Official dumpsite used by the former contractor for construction waste generated by the
project is located 6 km south east of the bridge less than 100m from the Euphrates River.
The new dumpsite is located 20km south west from the bridge in a distance of more than
15km from the Euphrates. The dumpsite is designated for disposal of the project
construction waste including the concrete girders installed by the former contractor. It is
an unsanitary dumping site with no technical or environmental provisions. The works
require one borrow pit (located 6 km west of the site) and one spoil site.

The former contractor’s and worker’s camp (accommodating about 50 workers) was
located about 100 from the northern bank of the Euphrates River. It included two septic
tanks in a distance of 150m from the river. New location of the worker’s camp is
immediately to the west of the former camp (75m from the river bank). The site will be
equipped with two septic tanks located about 150m from the river bank.

4.     Environmental and Social baseline conditions
The baseline environmental and social data were collected through research, field visits
and public consultations.
Land in the vicinity of the bridge is used mainly as farmland and fallow fields. Land
being used for bridge construction is all State-owned land (see Annex 3). The villages in
the vicinity of the bridge are not close to or adjacent to the bridge or on-ramps. . Only
seven small buildings are located within 100m of the project site, and these include a
small water pumping station and storage shed. None of these buildings are sufficiently
close to the bridge construction area that they are likely to be adversely affected by either
the construction activities or the operation of the bridge once it is in use.
The climate of the area is dry with the average annual precipitation below 100mm. The
ambient air quality is good. The concentration of pollutants is well below allowable
standards. The noise levels are elevated due to the traffic congestions on the temporary
pontoon bridge. There are no protected areas or endangered species in the site vicinity.
The site adjacent area does not include any historical or cultural sites. No additional land
is needed to proceed with the project.
The Euphrates is polluted with chemicals from agriculture, industry, and sewage making
it an unreliable source for domestic use and restricting it for other usage. The former
bridge contractor had in-filled the river for more than 50% of its width, releasing large
volumes of sand and silt into the already sediment-laded river. The bund created must be
removed on completion of the project and the river width returned to that immediately
upstream and downstream of the construction site.

5.     Public Consultations

Bank policies require that broad and open public consultations be held with PAPs on the
project. Ideally, these consultations would commence prior to the launch of project so
project affected peoples (PAPs) are provided with the opportunity to engage in the
planning process, to raise questions and receive input and responses to their concerns,
and so any PAPs likely to be adversely affected by project activities are informed in
advance of their rights to mitigation and/or compensation. In the case of the al-Daraji
bridge, public consultations were not held prior to the initial commencement of works.
However, serious efforts were made to remedy this shortcoming with the cancellation of
the initial contractor’s contract and with the redesign of the bridge.
To obtain sound and representative information on the possible socio-economic
circumstances of the local community members, and better understand any possible
adverse socio-economic effects of project activities on PAPs and the local community,
local residents were consulted using two approaches, a structured survey questionnaire
that was fielded to 8 randomly selected individuals, and open small group discussions,

                                             iii
Emergency Road Rehabilitation Project
Al-Daraji Bridge Environmental & Social Management Plan

conducted over several days to community members in the vicinity of the bridge and in
different areas of the community and neighboring agricultural areas in the vicinity of the
bridge. Additionally, a few local officials were sought out and asked to respond to the
survey questionnaire, while consultations and open small-scale discussion groups were
also held around the construction site. It was felt that this multi-faceted approach ensured
wider participation and representation by more diverse community groups than would
one formal consultation process. The survey questionnaire and the open multiple
consultation/discussion sessions gathered information on the public’s impressions,
experiences prior to and during construction, and expectations of the new bridge
structure. The outcomes of the consultations and discussions revealed widespread
support for the project activities which are widely anticipated to have positive impacts on
people’s social and economic circumstances. No comments were made during the
consultations on issues relating to water quality in the river which was already known to
be very poor prior to commencement of bridge construction. The consultations and
discussions confirmed that there has been no requirement for any relocation/resettlement
of households or businesses/vendors as a result of project activities, and hence no claims
for mitigation/compensation for loss of income or income-generating activities made.

6.        Environmental and Social Impact Analysis

Overall, based on the field surveys and environmental and social assessment, Al-Daraji
Bridge is unlikely to have major negative impacts on the environment during the
constructional and maintenance phases, and is anticipated to have significant positive
social impacts on the local communities. While a number of minor impacts on the
environment may occur during the two phases, these minor impacts will have no
significant influence on the environmental parameters and conditions. The main
environmental impacts of the project will be associated with activities during the
construction period. These include soil erosion, river siltation, noise, dust, generation and
handling of construction and other waste, and health and safety concerns associated with
construction workers. Mitigation measures will be taken to minimize the environmental
costs by reducing the identified adverse environmental impacts.
The minor expected negative environmental impacts include:
     1.   Increased noise level and deterioration of air quality resulting from the
          construction phase.
     2.   River siltation by earthworks on the soil bund in the river.
     3.   Soil erosion of the river banks due to the construction activities.
     4.   Vegetation cover, flora and fauna affected by the constructional phase.
     5.   Possible river pollution by the discharge/leakages of oil, chemicals and domestic
          sewage from the river camp.
     6.   Contamination of soil and river by construction and municipal waste generated
          and stored within the site.

Emergency Road Rehabilitation Project
Al-Daraji Bridge Environmental & Social Management Plan


From the socio-economic perspective, both the construction and maintenance phases are
expected to have positive impacts on the communities living near the area.
Transportation will be significantly enhanced which will facilitate movement of locally
agricultural production to markets. Additionally, the anticipated increase in through-
traffic resulting from ease of movement across the new bridge will create new business
and vending opportunities for local residents, improving livelihood opportunities.
Moreover, the new bridge will reduce the current traffic congestion and the risk of
accidents compared to the previous floating bridge.

7.         Mitigation Measures
The required mitigation measures for each of the minor environmental impacts and any
adverse socio-economic impacts that arise have been considered. . Furthermore, a
complete monitoring and auditing system were suggested for each environmental
parameter in order to sustain the environmental situation in the area of the projects. These
measures should significantly reduce the identified potential minor impacts.
The mitigation measures address the environmental and social impacts of the project.
They include:
     1.    Minimize noisy operations at night.
     2.    Noisy machines should be replaced by manual workers wherever practicable.
     3.    Maintain vehicles and machinery in good condition in order to minimize exhaust
           emissions.
     4.    Application of water spraying using a daily water tanker during the construction
           works.
     5.    Preventing earthworks on the soil bund in the river during rainy days and
           turbulent river flows.
     6.    Avoid discharging or leakages of any chemicals in the site or in open spaces.
     7.    Ensure that construction preparations are located away from populated areas.
     8.    Confining ad hoc vehicle maintenance and refueling areas within the site.
     9.    Temporary storage of construction and municipal solid waste in locations agreed
           with the local community. Disposal of waste in newly designated sites.
     10.   Domestic sewage from the workers’ camp must be stored in properly sealed septic
           tanks, and discharged to sewage treatment plants.
     11.   Any hazardous waste must be collected and stored in sealed containers prior to
           disposal in a designated area approved by the authorities.
     12.   Protection of vegetation during the construction works.
     13.   Operation of a GRM system prior to commencement of works on the steel bridge,
           and its continued operation for one year subsequent to opening of the bridge to
           traffic. Any emerging adverse socio-economic impacts of the project can be
           channeled by the public to this GRM for discussion, resolution and, if appropriate,
           mitigation.

Al-Daraji Bridge Environmental & Social Management Plan


The major issue in this Project is environmental in nature, and concerns the fate of the
failed concrete graders that must be managed according to good environmental practice.
The proper mitigation measures were identified and explained, and the coordination was
made with the official partners and stakeholders (resident engineer, MMPW, MoE,
contractor) for safe and proper management and disposal of these items. The designated
borrow pit for demolished concrete has been designated by the municipality of the
district. The borrow pit is located 6 km to the west of the bridge. Once the works started
at the project site a focal point was assigned by the local authorities to overseeing the
dumping process.
The proposed mitigation measures are affordable and practical. They will ensure a
minimum impact on the environment as it was recorded in the field visits to the sites and
meetings with the local population. The proposed measures reflect the expectations of the
local communities obtained during the public consultation process.

8.       Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP)
The measures in the ESMP are based on the assessment of the impacts as stated in this
document. The cost of implementing the ESMP will be integrated into the contactor ’s
cost for each parameter. The total cost of implementing the ESMP is estimated at $
42,000, and broken down as follows (see tables 1, 3 and 4 for details):

        Mitigation measures = $ 9,000 (captured in the construction contract)
        Monitoring = $ 11,000
        Training and institutional strengthening = $ 22,000.

9.       Monitoring & Institutional Strengthening
A complete monitoring, auditing and reporting program was set forward in order to
ensure proper implementation of mitigation measures, and maintain or improve the
environmental and the socio-economic characteristics of the area adjacent to the new
bridge during the construction and operation phases of the project.

The monitoring program will focus on noise impact, air quality and water quality, plus
any emerging socio-economic adverse effects. The monitoring activity will monitor the
application of environmental and social mitigation measures and the result of monitoring
activities shall be reflected in the monthly reports. An institutional framework and
strategy for the involved official institutions were suggested in order to strengthen the
capacity buildings in the field of the environmental monitoring and reporting procedures
and methodologies.
An approximate estimate of US$ 11,000 will be required to implement the monitoring
actions, and US$ 22,000 is envisaged for training and institutional strengthening
activities (see tables 3 & 4).

   1. INTRODUCTION
The concept of the Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) is to propose measures
to protect the environmental, social and socio-economic situation of the communities that may be
adversely affected by development of the project, and to assist the competent authorities in
taking decisions regarding the approval conditions for the project. This ESMP was developed to
cover the activities associated with the construction and maintenance of the access road and the
bridge. The ESMP identifies key environmental and social impacts of the project activities
during both the construction and the maintenance phases, and defines the necessary mitigation
measures addressing potential negative impacts, as well as monitoring procedures, that should be
addressed and implemented during the Al-Daraji Bridge construction and maintenance phases.

The ESMP study was carried out according to requirements of the current environmental
regulations of the World Bank (OP 4.01 and OP 4.12) and Iraqi regulations. In this report the
WB, and Iraqi environmental and social standards and regulations were followed to ensure the
national and international acceptance and compliances of the ESMP.

The ESMP is designed to be dynamic and responsive. It was prepared and revised during the
consultation and detailed design phases.

This updated ESMP presents an additional analysis of the conditions due to change in project
scope and status. The initial project scope was to replace the temporary pontoon bridge with a
more permanent concrete structure. Due to a number of reasons the construction was halted and
the contract was terminated. In reviewing the project, a revised designed was considered to
construct a steel bridge compared to a concrete one. Therefore, and as results of the previous
construction stage some of the elements of the old scope including failed tested concrete beams
will need to be properly disposed, within the environmental regulations and standards, in order
not to harm the environment and the community and in accordance with mitigation measures
presented in this ESMP. This ESMP provides also guidance on the measures to be adopted to
discard the old pontoon bridge which will be removed once the new bridge is constructed and
open to traffic.

 1.1   Objectives

The objectives of this ESMP are to provide:

   Practical and achievable plans to ensure that the project’s adverse environmental and social
    impacts are properly mitigated.
   An integrated plan for monitoring, assessing and controlling potential impacts.
   Support to Local and State authorities to enable setting approval conditions for the project
    based on relevant standards and procedures.

    Concentrate on positive aspects and benefits, mitigate negative impacts and avoid serious
     and irreversible damage to the environment and people
    An opportunity for holding consultation with the communities to get their input on the
     changes in the bridge design and to determine whether the bridge construction has, or is
     likely to, adversely affect the environmental and the local community.
    To inform the local community about the revised project activities and the environmental
     and socio-economic protection measures that are being followed; provide information on
     residents’ rights if they are adversely affected by project activities and bridge operation,
     and inform the local community of the existence of a grievance redress management
     (GRM) system through which they might lodge complaints and expect prompt and fair
     consideration.
ESMP establishes a framework for the identification of environmental protection, mitigation,
monitoring measures to be taken during construction and maintenance phases of the project. The
ESMP includes project description, mitigation measures, monitoring plan, management plans
schedule, institutional arrangements, and public consultation. The ESMP will aim to achieve a
good environmental and social performance during construction and maintenance. To meet this
goal, the following activities, measures and programs must be followed:

   (i) Environmental regulations
   (ii) Application of all environmental and social mitigation and management measures.
   (iii) Environmental and social monitoring plan.
   (iv) Emergency and contingency plan.
   (v) Institutional plan.
   (vi) Environmental and safety measures.
   (vii) Effective and open consultations with communities, community representatives and
          potentially affected persons.

Environmental and social monitoring is an important component of the ESMP. It provides the
information for periodic review and refinement modification of the ESMP as necessary, ensuring
that environmental and social protection is optimized in all project phases through monitoring
and early detection and effective remediation of unwanted environmental and social impacts.
Lastly, it will also demonstrate compliance with national and international regulatory
requirements.

   2. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The wider objective of the project is to improve the condition of rural road networks. The
specific objective of the project is the provision of permanent bridge and its approaches. It will
also promote the country’s economic integration, facilitate trade, and support reconstruction
efforts across all sectors.
The initial scope of work of Al Daraji bridge project is to replace the old pontoon bridge that
links Euphrates banks at Al Daraji town by a concrete bridge.
The new bridge remains partially constructed and has clearly remained so for some months. All
board piles, columns, cross beams (except P1), abutments and earth work was implemented.
Approximately 55% of the bridge works was completed. These works were guided by ESIA for
four bridges issued in July 2012. The aerial view of the project site is shown below.
Photographic evidence is provided in annex 1.
For failing to meet contractual schedules and because of poor quality workmanship the original
contractor, Khairat Al-Jinoub, was dismissed. The project was re-tendered in May 2013 to carry
out the remaining works of the bridge. However, the design of the bridge was revised and
modified to steel superstructure for engineering reasons. Location of the project is presented in
figure 1. Despite the changes in the design no additional area will need to be taken to cover the
new design demands. The demolition and handling of the pre-constructed failed concrete girders
will need to be managed in an acceptable environmental approach.
The bridge will consist of a fully paved two lanes with a total length of 245 meters, 200 meters
approaches from river banks, 9 meters width and two pedestrian walk of 1.5 meters width, and
appropriate safety barriers, signage and lighting.

      3. BASELINE CONDITIONS
3.1      The Project Area

Samawah city and its suburban area have a long historic background of several thousand years as
part of the Euphrates civilization. The principle agricultural activity in the area is date palm.
Farming is the major economic activity of the surrounding area along the Euphrates River.
Samawah is a major core city and has satellite towns and villages located along the river plain.
On the left bank of the bridge there are farm land fallow fields. On the right bank, houses are
located nearby the project location. Pumping facilities and administration facilities are situated
near the likely access to the new bridge.

      3.1.1 Existing Buildings

Land in the vicinity of the bridge is used mainly as farmland and fallow fields. There are very
few buildings or houses in the vicinity of the project location. The following table shows a
summary of existing buildings within 20m of project site (10m both sides of the road center
line), within 100m of the project site (50m both sides of the road center line) and within a 500m
circular area of the project site. The existing buildings are described in table 5.

The majority of buildings surrounding the area are houses of the local community, school and a
small water pumping station. As per the questionnaire (Annex 2) conducted with local
community, the existing buildings of the local community were not adversely affected by the
bridge construction activities and operation of the bridge.

In constructing the piers, the contractor infilled a section of river, effectively curtailing flow over
more than 50% of its width. While emplacing this bund, primarily with bankside soil and
generally fine material, substantial volumes will have been lost to the river, increasing
downstream sedimentation. Subsequently, during periods of rain and turbulent flows, material
from the bund will have been eroded into the river. Notwithstanding this, Euphrates Basin
watercourses are heavily silt-laden and the usual ecological impacts, such as the smothering of
river bed flora and bottom feeding fauna, may not have been as severe as might otherwise be
expected.

   3.1.2 The site Description

The bridge is located 19 km from the main intersection road between Nassirya- Samawah- Basra.
When completed, the bridge will provide a crossing of the Euphrates River some 45 km ESE of
Samawah, 50 km WNW of Nasiriyah.

The surrounding of the bridge is an open area with a flat plateau. The main activities in the area
are farming and agricultural activities.

The bridge is under construction with approximately 55% completion rate. The piling of piers
has largely been completed. The alignment of the new bridge is marked by the line of six piers
constructed prior to contract termination, on which a new steel superstructure is to be placed.
The site contains much construction debris, primarily cast pre-stressed concrete girders and
abandoned materials, all generally badly corroded, for which a sound plan for reuse or disposal is
required.

The alignment of the new bridge is marked by the line of six piers constructed prior to contract
termination. The five on the northern bank are all complete, while the sixth, a short distance off
the southern bank is clothed in shuttering and remains to be cast.

Also on the northern bank are 10 pre-stressed concrete girders intended to span between the piers
and the reinforcing bar for another is shaped in preparation for casting. All reinforcement,
whether protruding from the cast girders, pre-shaped, or just stacked on site, is badly corroded
and ill-suited to future use. One of the parapet sections has broken due to sub-standard concrete,
and elsewhere the finish of the sections appears poor. The concrete in the piers appears to be
better quality.

   3.1.3 Previous situation of the site

The location was served by a temporary pontoon bridge deck steel plate. With a bridge length of
(150 m) and width of (4m), large vehicles such as trucks were not able to cross the bridge. The
condition of the pontoon bridge is unstable and rapidly approaching the end of its useful life.
Several of the steel plates covering the timber decking are partially detached and lift as traffic
passes.

Official dumpsite used by the former contractor for construction waste generated by the project
is located 6 km south east of the bridge less than 100m from the Euphrates River. The dumpsite
was recently closed by the Samawa municipality that designated another location as municipal
dumpsite. The new dumpsite is located 20km south west from the bridge in a distance of more
than 15km from the Euphrates (see figure 2). The dumpsite is designated for disposal of the
project construction waste including the concrete girders installed by the former contractor. It is
an unsanitary dumping site with no technical nor environmental facilities (see photo 1). The
works require one borrow pit (located 6km west of the site) and one spoil site.

The former contractor’s and worker’s camp was located about 100 from the northern bank of the
Euphrates River, and about 150m from the road alignment leading to the bridge. It included two
septic tanks in a distance of 150m from the river (see figure 3 and photo 2). According to the
MOCH PMT, the new location of the worker’s camp is immediately to the west of the former
camp (75m from the river bank and 50m from the road alignment). The site will be equipped
with two septic tanks located about 150m from the river bank. The expected number of workers
accommodated in the camp is about 50.

 3.2   Environmental and Social Baseline conditions

The environmental baseline section is presented to give clear overview of the environmental and
social conditions in the vicinity of the project location prior to commencement of works. The
elements of the environment include: climate and meteorology, air quality, surface and
groundwater quality, river sediment and soil, topography, noise and vibration levels, traffic,
rivers and waterways, biodiversity including flora, fauna, rare or endangered species, and
sensitive habitats. It also includes consideration of socio-economic characteristics (such as
population, land-use, planned development activities, community structure, employment,
distribution of income, goods and services, recreation, cultural properties, customs, and attitudes.
The following sections present such information.
   3.2.1 Climate

Muthanna governorate is located in the southern part of Iraq and has an arid climate with sparse
rainfall during the months of May to October. Highest temperatures in July and August reach
over 45 degrees centigrade. Rainfall is normally recorded during the months of December to
March. However the area of Muthanna governorate near to the Saudi Arabian border has very
low rainfall.

   3.2.2 Rainfall, wind velocity and temperature

Muthana area considered one of the arid areas in Iraq (climatologically atlas of Iraq 1998).
According to this atlas the average seasonal annual rainfall is less than 100mm. It is
characteristic to have rainfall from the end of November to March. According to the
(environmental survey statistics/ Ministry of planning 2010) records, in 2010 the annual
precipitation in Samawa governorate was 47.5mm.

Monthly wind velocity record in recent years is shown in the table 6. Generally, average wind
velocity is approximately 2.3m/sec accordingly.

exceedence of the maximum permissible concentrations for SO2, NO2 and CO (table 9). As the
Al Daraji site is located in rural surroundings at the edge of the Euphrates that allows good
ventilation and dispersion of any air pollutants, it is expected that the ambient air quality values
for Al Daraji are at least at the same level of Basra.

   3.2.4 Site Topography

The project sites of Samawah and its suburban area represents an extension of the flat plateau
areas that starting from the middle of Iraq till the mid-southern parts of the country. No specific
terrains or natural land obstacles are presented in the project area. The area is free of mountains,
cliffs, and valleys.

   3.2.5 Land use

The land use of area surrounding the project is of agricultural nature. This rich agricultural
region provides the governorate and the closest areas with winter and summer agricultural
products. A spectrum of the community living in the vicinity of the project depends on the
farming activities as major or additional financial revenue.

   3.2.6 Geotechnical survey

Samawah city and its suburban area is a lay basin of the lower reaches of the Euphrates River,
and alluvial soil is dominant in this region. Geotechnical characteristics of the region are deep
silt-clay strata.

   3.2.7 Seismic Activity

The site is located in southern of Iraq inside the borders of Governorate within the river
Euphrates. No Seismic activities had been recorded for more than 25 years.

   3.2.8 Water Quality and Flooding

The Euphrates is polluted with chemicals from agriculture, industry, and sewage making it an
unreliable source for domestic use and restricting it for other usage (particularly below
Baghdad). There are many sources of the Euphrates water pollution including petroleum fuels
and by-products, sewage, solid waste, heavy metals, herbicides, pesticides, radioactive waste,
toxic wastes, nutrient and sediments. The water quality in the project area is affected by high
suspended solids (above 50 mg/l), BOD (5-10 mg/l) and increased salinity (Temporal and Spatial
changes in water quality of the Euphrates river, Iraq; Lund University Sweden; 2011).
The analysis of the water quality in September 2013 from the Khedr city (located in the Al
Daraji district) show (see table 10) that the river water is not suitable for irrigation. It is brackish
and has high sulfates, calcium and magnesium content. The parameters indicated pollution by
municipal sewage and agricultural fertilizers. The site survey found that the local community
uses treatment and desalinization station (treating water from the Euphrates) for drinking and
household water, and does not use groundwater. Nevertheless, the local population uses the river
water for irrigation.
Flooding is a possible hazard in the project area. The metrological data & observation station
show that the lowest water level in Al-Daraji bridge was found to be (2.6m) and highest water

lend was (8m) with river cross- sectional discharge of (1700 m3/sec) as design reline. However,
for the past 40 years no flooding was recorded.

   3.2.9 Traffic Level

The residents prior to the construction of the concrete bridge were dependent on the floated
bridge. This caused many traffic problems, as this kind of bridge do not allow vehicles to pass by
in two directions. In-turn it causes traffic congestion on the both sides of the bridges the vehicles
from one side must wait in order to allow the vehicles from the other side to cross the bridge.
Such cases were reported continuously on the bridge causing traffic problems and
misunderstandings between the drivers.

   3.2.10 Noise

As the result of the traffic congestion on both side of the floating bridge use of horns, shouting,
engine noise are reported. These add an extra tension and stress to the bridge users (drivers and
pedestrians).

Emergency Road Rehabilitation Project
Al-Daraji Bridge Environmental & Social Management Plan

   3.2.11 Heritage Environment

The construction site of the bridge does not pass through any historical, cultural sites. There are
no sites of historical or cultural importance in the area, and therefore the construction and
operation of the plant will have no impact on archaeology or cultural heritage.

No cemeteries, historical-cultural monuments, churches, mosques near the project need to be
removed in order to construct the bridge and the access road.

   3.2.12 Land Acquisition

In this project and according to the official documents (attached), no additional land needed to be
purchased, to allow construction works. The land needed for project implementation is state-
owned. . There are no livelihoods in the project vicinity that are likely to be adversely affected
by the project, hence neither involuntary nor voluntarily relocation of people is necessary or
expected.

   3.2.13 Social Aspects

There are no villages or community structures in close proximity to the bridge or the on-ramp to
the bridge. . The bridge is being constructed on state land, and no land or property expropriation
has been necessary. No roadside vendors, either licensed or non-licensed were displaced.

Although, bridge construction work was stopped temporarily and the task withdrawn from the
previous contractor due to technical construction issues, the area and the approaches areas on
either side of the bridge, even the temporary access roads, are not settled on or utilized by any of
the local population. All the areas around and within the site remain clear of any settlement or
economic use and are ready for continuation of the works, no interference were registered from
the local community which is eager for the works to be completed. Also in spite of this
stoppage, no new agriculture activities of any kind were initiated the project area, no vendors
(licensed or unlicensed) established themselves, and no new buildings, shops, houses etc. were
constructed or part-constructed within the project area. One of the major necessities of the locals
in the area is to have a good accessible bridge to the other side of the river bank, as the previous
floated bridge had many operational and maintenance difficulties that preventing in some cases
the locals to ally transport between the river sides, in turn affecting their socio-economic
situations.

An unfortunate social consequence of the dismissal of the original contractor has been that many
of the local community members he employed have not been paid for the work they performed.
Efforts are ongoing by MoCH to recoup these outstanding wages from the contractor.

   4. LEGAL ASPECTS
 4.1   Iraqi environmental legislation


The work during construction and operation must follow the Iraqi laws and regulations for the
environmental standards. These are:
    Laws of the environment protection No.3 issued in 1997 and the published regulations.
       No environmental regulations for gaseous emissions, noise and other air pollution
       standards are in force and legally binding. However, limits for water disposal in any
       surface waters and main sewers are regulated according to the regulations no. (25)/1967
       and their update modifications released from the ministry of health and the ministry of
       the environment.
    Law of heritage and antiques no. (55) Issued in 2002 (this law defines all movable and
       immovable antiquities, archaeological properties and artifacts in Iraq. It regulates
       communication channels between the public and the authorities for each type of Contact
       between the public and the revealed and non-revealed archaeological sites.
    New environmental framework Law No. 27 of 2009 for the Iraqi national government,
       have been introduced but the executive decrees remain to be prepared. There are as yet no
       formally adopted requirements for environmental assessment.
    Regulations governing contact with archaeological sites extend also to encompass
       developmental activities like road construction and rehabilitation wherever these
       developmental activities lie within archaeological vicinity.
       Regulations of the MOE on sanitary waste must be followed, and for the rubbles
       (construction &demolition waste) the regulations, legislations and instruction of both
       MoE and MMPW.

 4.2   Iraqi social legislation


New legislation issued in Iraq since 2003 has focused primarily on the ratification of
international conventions and protocols on issues such as biodiversity and cultural heritage.
Subsequent to these ratifications, a new Law, No. 27 of 2009, on the Protection and
Improvement of the Environment was been introduced, but the executive decrees remain to be
prepared. As yet there are no formally adopted requirements for social assessment. Hence,
social safeguards issues remain very largely uncovered except to the extent they are referred to
under environmental laws

 4.3   The World Bank Safeguards Policies


In addition to the Iraqi laws and regulation the ESMP follows two key policies and procedures of
the World Bank:

                                                14
Emergency Road Rehabilitation Project
Al-Daraji Bridge Environmental & Social Management Plan

   OP/BP 4.01 - the key Operational Policy describing the environmental assessment procedure.
    The Bank requires environmental assessment of projects proposed for Bank financing. The
    objectives of the EA are to:
          Ensure that projects proposed for Bank financing are environmentally and socially
           sound and sustainable.
           Inform decision makers of the nature of environmental and social risks.
           Increase transparency and participation of stakeholders in the decision-making
            process.

   Involuntary resettlement OP/BP4.12 which focus on the following principles:
           Involuntary resettlement is avoided wherever feasible, or minimized, exploring all
            viable alternative project designs;
           Where it is not feasible to avoid involuntary resettlement, activities are conceived and
            executed as sustainable development programs. Displaced persons are to be
            meaningfully consulted and have opportunities to participate in the planning and
            implementing of resettlement programs affecting them; and
           Displaced persons are assisted in their efforts to improve their livelihoods and
            standards of living, or at least to restore them, in real terms, to pre-displacement levels
            or to levels prevailing prior to the beginning of project implementation, whichever is
            higher. The mechanism of assisting displaced persons is based on full and prior
            mitigation and compensation for loss of assets or livelihoods.
           OP 4.12 applies whenever, in a Bank-financed project, land is acquired involuntarily
            or access is restricted in legally designated parks or protected areas.

Bank procedures for road works require that Grievance Redress Mechanisms (GRMs) be
established and operational prior to commencement of the road works, and that they continue to
operate for one year following completion of the works. A checklist of issues to be considered in
the design of the GRMs includes the following:
       An inventory of any reliable conflict mediation organizations or procedures in the project
        area be undertaken and an assessment made to determine if any of these entities or
        procedures might be used instead of having to create new ones. A careful examination of
        possible existing procedures was undertaken for the al-Daraji bridge work and it was
        determined that no existing organization or procedure was pre-existing. It was thus
        decided that a grievance redress mechanism specific to this project activity offered the best
        means of ensuring that complaints were received and addressed in an effective, timely and
        transparent manner.
       Good practice is to ensure that PAPs can apply orally and in the local language and to
        impose explicit time limits for responding to grievances received. Appeal procedures need

                                                  15
Emergency Road Rehabilitation Project
Al-Daraji Bridge Environmental & Social Management Plan

      to be specified, and this information is made publicly available. The GRM established for
      this specific project activity will, therefore, allow for both verbal and written grievances to
      be lodged with the local project authorities, who will transmit these to the local level
      committee for review, consideration and response.
A GRM has been established and its operation complies with the Bank’s requirements. The
objective of the GRM is to respond to the complaints received from PAPs in a timely and
transparent manner. The mechanism is designed to be easy, transparent and fair. The procedure
will follow the following approach:
     At the first stage, PAPs will register their complaints and grievances to the grievance
      redress committee which will have to provide a written response to the PAPs, within
      fifteen calendar days of receiving the complaint.
     If the PAPs are not satisfied with the decision of the RC, the PAPs will present the case to
      the MOHC within fifteen (15) calendar days of receiving the written response from the RC
      authorities. The decision of the RC should be sent to PAPs by no later than fifteen calendar
      days of receipt of the PAP’s appeal.
     If the PAPs are not satisfied with the decision at the second level, the case may be
      submitted for consideration to the Governorate Council, or Municipality Council.
     PAPs will be exempted from all administrative and legal fees.

   5. PUBLIC CONSULTATIONS

Bank policies require that broad and open public consultations be held with PAPs about the
project. Ideally, these consultations should commence prior to the launch of project activities so
PAPs are provided with the opportunity to engage in the planning process, to raise questions and
receive input and responses to their concerns, and so any PAPs that are adversely affected by the
project are informed in advance of their rights to mitigation and/or compensation. In the case of
the al-Daraji bridge, public consultations were not held prior to the initial commencement of
works. However, serious efforts were made to remedy this shortcoming with the cancellation of
the initial contractor’s contract and with the redesign of the bridge.

To obtain sound and representative information on the possible socio-economic circumstances of
the local community members, and better understand any possible adverse socio-economic
effects of project activities on PAPs and the local community, local residents were consulted
using two approaches, a structured survey questionnaire and open small group discussions,
conducted over several days to community members in the vicinity of the bridge and in different
areas of the community and neighboring agricultural areas in the vicinity of the bridge.
Additionally, a few local officials were sought out and asked to respond to the survey
questionnaire, while consultations and open small-scale discussion groups were also held around
the construction site. It was felt that this multi-faceted approach ensured wider participation and
representation by more diverse community groups than would one formal consultation process.
The survey questionnaire and the open multiple consultation/discussion sessions gathered
information on public impressions, experiences prior to and during construction, and
expectations of the new bridge structure. The outcomes of both the structured questionnaire
survey and the consultations and discussions reveal widespread support for the project activities
which are widely anticipated to have positive impacts on people’s social and economic
circumstances. The survey and consultations/discussions confirmed that there has been no
requirement for any relocation/resettlement of households or businesses/vendors as a result of
project activities and hence no claims for mitigation/compensation for loss of income or income-
generating activities made. No concerns regarding water quality in the river were raised during
the consultations; water quality is well-known to have been of very low quality prior to project
activities and local communities do not appear to think that project activities are significantly
worsening the situation. The first contractor necessarily built earthen berms in the river in order
to install the bridge pillars; interestingly, the few local fishermen in the area have reacted very
positively to these berms because they have aided their fishing activities. Attached is the Arabic
and English version of the survey questionnaire and summaries of the main responses to
questions and issues raised from the consultations. Table 11 refers to the questioner form and the
responses of the respondents.

From the consultations all people agreed that the bridge, when finished, will enhance social and
economic conditions in the immediate locality and also in adjacent areas. The main conclusion
also reached was that no local groups, tribes, clans, or individuals have lodged claims for
compensation, and no person’s household, business or livelihood has been adversely affected by
the project activities. It was also clear that no removals of any implanted areas (productive trees,
palm dates trees, crop production, vegetation cover etc.) have occurred or is likely to be required
during construction works on the steel bridge. The construction activities have not crossed
(intercepted) any infrastructure in the area, and no re-location, re-settlement or displacement of
any individuals or families has been necessary due to the re-design and construction of the
bridge. There are no demographic changes, or damage done to community and social networks
by the bridge construction. And as an overall conclusion and from the survey, discussions and
consultation, the community is strongly supportive of the bridge construction given the
enhancements it is expected to bring to the community’s social and economic conditions.

   6. IMPACT ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION MEASURES
 6.1   Construction Phase

This section of the report describes the environmental impacts that are likely to result from the
construction of the bridge, and mitigation measures addressing them.

The Environmental actions, procedures and responsibilities as required during the construction
phase must comply with the available specifications, legislation, laws issued by the MoE.

The construction contractor will be responsible for compliance with the ESMP provisions during
the construction phase of the project. The contractor will be also in charge of undertaking work
in a manner which complies with all relevant environmental procedures, adheres to all legislative
requirements, and ensures that all environmental objectives associated with the contract are
achieved.

The key environmental and social impacts are described below.

   6.1.1 Soil Erosion
The earthworks to reduce/eliminate the soil bund in the river made during the former
construction works may lead to significant erosion and siltation of the river. This impact can be
mitigated by preventing such earthworks during the winter rainy season.
The bridge construction will intensify the effects of natural soil erosion that may be due to
vegetation removal, soil disturbance, and exposure of bare soil surface. There will be no
significant soil disturbances as the site will not need any preparation activities such as blasting.
The key problems will be borrowed pits and spoil sites (only one borrow pit and one spoil site
are planned), as well as bridge and culvert construction sites, particularly during rainy days. The
eroded material may affect aquatic habitats and alter aquatic species’ life cycle events by
increasing turbidity, changing the water temperature, changing the depth of water bodies, runoff
of nutrients into the river.

These impacts can be mitigated by civil engineering control measures including: slope
stabilization, vegetated buffer strips, silt fence. The soil erosion may cause damage to agriculture
lands.

   6.1.2 Water Quality
The primary impact of the project on the Euphrates is related to the fine material and soil bund
established during the former construction of the piers and curtailing river flow over more than
50% of its width. This bund is subject to gradual erosion and associated siltation of the river
particularly during periods of rain and turbulent flows. By the end of the construction phase, the
bund will have to be eliminated or substantially reduced and this may cause short-term intensive
siltation of the river. Notwithstanding this, Euphrates Basin watercourses are heavily silt-laden
and hence the significance of this impact is considered low to medium.
                                                20
Emergency Road Rehabilitation Project
Al-Daraji Bridge Environmental & Social Management Plan

The project is predicted to generate small volume of domestic sewage within the workers’ camp
located about 100m from the river bank and used by about 50 workers. However, the sewage will
be collected in sealed septic tank that will be regularly checked and emptied when filled up.
Hence, the impact is considered minor.
Wastewater and hazardous materials (fuel, oil, acids, caustics, etc.) may drain into streams and
drainage areas, causing pollution to the river or groundwater. This is particularly true for bridge
construction activities, construction campsites, and staging areas where workers, construction
equipment, and building materials are most concentrated.
The vehicles and machines used by the contractor will operate in the immediate vicinity of the
river. Oil or fuel leakages can impact surface water quality. This impact can be substantially
reduced by regular maintenance of vehicles.
There is no available official data and information regarding the ground water quality in the area,
as the main dependence of the residences in the area is on the surface water, no monitoring or
sampling station for the ground water is available in the area. The impact on the aquatic system
of the completed works seems negligible. The fishermen had no complaints about the deficiency
of fish species or quantities. No official records for the aquatic ecosystem were recorded for the
area.
Other construction activities of the project are predicted to have very minor impact on the river
quality and groundwater resources in the project area. Significance of these impacts is low due
to relatively poor water quality in the Euphrates.
The mitigation measures: elimination of the soil bund in the river must be take carefully during
low water flow and not during the winter rains period; domestic sewage must be collected in
sealed septic tanks and discharged to water treatment plan; water from construction site must be
discharged to river channel in a manner that does not cause siltation or erosion into the water
course; fuels and chemicals must be stored and sealed to avoid leakages; contractor’s vehicles
and machines must be regularly serviced to eliminate leakages of oil and fuel.
   6.1.3 Air Quality Impacts
Construction activities - particularly earthworks, increased traffic, and the use of cement, asphalt,
and other building materials will produce excessive airborne dust and toxic asphalt fumes. This
will affect local air quality.

To minimize the dust impact, construction fields and major access roads and haul roads must be
watered on a set schedule, particularly during the dry season. Construction materials storage and
concrete mixing plants must be sited more than 100m away from dwellings. All the mixing
equipment must be closed systems with dust extractors. Dust-generating materials must be stored
and hauled in bags or containers with appropriate covers. Air quality needs to be monitored
periodically.

Emergency Road Rehabilitation Project
Al-Daraji Bridge Environmental & Social Management Plan

   6.1.4 Noise
Noise impacts are expected to increase during construction due to the use of construction
machinery and earth-moving equipment. It is estimated (considering major construction
equipment to be used) that the daytime noise levels must be within the applicable standards of 85
dB when the noise receptor is at a distance of 50m or more from the noise source - except for
high noise equipment like pneumatic hammers. Due to the fact that most villages and schools are
located 300m away or more from the bridge, no significant noise impacts are expected during
daytime.
The mitigation measures include:
  Construction site yards, workshops, and other noisy fixed facilities should be located well
   away from noise sensitive areas.
  Noisy operations should be combined so that they occur where possible at the same time.
  Construction activities are to be contained to reasonable hours during the day and early
   evening. Night-time activates near noise sensitive areas should not be allowed.
  Equipment must be kept in good working order and where appropriate fitted with silencers
   which are kept in good working order.
  Use of personal protection equipment for workers.

   6.1.5 Solid Waste
Due to the construction activities, various types of solid waste will be generated. Construction
materials wastes, cements, bricks, sand, and gravels, as well as food remains, plastic tins, glass,
paint cans, and jars may be expected. To manage wastes from construction in such a way that
any potential impacts on the environment are minimized or avoided, the following approached
should be applied:
  Minimizing waste generation.
  Simple waste management plan for specific waste streams must be developed by the
   construction contractor prior to construction commencing.
  General waste must be collected and transported to local council approved disposal sites.
  Food wastes must be collected, where practicable, considering health and hygiene issues, for
   disposal off-site.
  Refuse containers must be located at each worksite.
  Where practical, waste must be segregated and reused / recycled (e.g. scrap metal).
  Containment bunds and/or sumps must be drained periodically to prevent overflow and
   subsequent pollution of the surrounding land and/or water body.
  Chemical wastes must be collected in 200 liter drums (or similar sealed container),
   appropriately labeled, for safe transport to an approved chemical waste depot or collection
   by a liquid waste treatment service.
  Storage, transport and handling of all chemicals must be conducted in accordance with all
   legislative requirements.

                                                22
Emergency Road Rehabilitation Project
Al-Daraji Bridge Environmental & Social Management Plan

  All hazardous wastes must be appropriately stored in bounded areas away from watercourses
   and in accordance with legislative requirements.
  Hazardous waters, such as solvents, rust proofing agents and primer must be managed in
   accordance with the requirements of relevant legislation and industry standards.
  A hazardous materials inventory for the construction period must be prepared.
  Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for hazardous materials must be available no-site
   during construction.
  Hydrocarbon wastes, including lube oils, must be collected for safe transport off-site for
   reuse, recycling, transport or disposal at approved locations.

One of the major issues and arising concerns, are the failed concrete structures, and the panels
left by the former contractor. Such materials must be treated with care, as they are not classified
as municipal waste. The failed concrete structure, first of all must be cut to a number of
separated parts. Popular way to deal with such case is to put these cut parts into the rubble
crushers (these are only available in the mayoralty of Baghdad), these crushers will turn these
concrete parts into fine particles (coarse powder) that can be re-used as a filler (binder) material
in the asphalt industry. However, as there is no such equipment available in the site, the
following procedure should be followed.

First, this concrete structure must be cut and then pilled in a designated zone (isolated) within the
site. Then an official letter must be sent to the municipality that related to the site (copy to the
MOE) in order to inform them that such materials (rubbles) are accumulated on the site, and
request designated disposal site for such waste. Transportation of these materials to the new
designated disposal site (20km south-west from the project site) must be done under the
monitoring of the MOE staff to ensure proper disposal.

   6.1.6 Health and Safety
During the construction phase of the project, there are risks posed to human health by industrial
accidents resulting from the use of heavy construction equipment. In order to minimize these
risks:
      Qualified personnel must be employed for the construction equipment, and personnel
       must be trained for health and safety issues.
      Working shift of workers of construction activities must be limited.
      Personal protection equipment such as eyeglasses, gloves, hard heads and safety belts
       must be supplied.
      Personnel must be monitored to assure they use protection equipment.
      Emergency health care and firefighting must be available within the project area.

An emergency plan must be prepared in order to cover all the possible risks that may result from
different civil work activities. Such plan must deals with the following items:
     Any accidents to be reported and treated within site as a first aid procedure.
     Safety training for the workers.
                                                 23
Emergency Road Rehabilitation Project
Al-Daraji Bridge Environmental & Social Management Plan

      Safety posters and brochures instructing the workers for the safe usage of the equipment
       and machineries.

   6.1.7 Flora & Fauna
No significant faunal activities were observed in the project site vicinity. The bridge construction
is expected to have negligible effects on the natural habitat of the fauna species. Furthermore no
impacts are expected on the vegetation.

The following steps should be followed to prevent or minimize any adverse impacts:
      Any disturbance must be restricted to designated work areas.
      Physical barriers must be installed around significant vegetation areas in order to restrict
       unauthorized access and avoid disturbance.
      Clearing and excavations works must occur progressively to minimize the length of time
       the ground is exposed or open excavations.
      Clearing and disturbance to the river must be minimized to that necessary construction
       and safety reasons and meet environmental requirements (e.g. separation of stockpiles,
       erosion control).
      Removed vegetation should be replanted if possible.
      Controls to prevent temporary barriers to fish and other fauna movement must be
       implemented.

   6.1.8 Rare & Endangered Species
There is no evidence of rare (or/and) endangered terrestrial or aquatic species that may be
affected by the construction activities of the bridge. The history of the area is not recording any
habitats of rare or endangered species. According to the MoE Annual Environment Report
(2010) no endangered species were recorded in the vicinity of the area. The most threatened
species are found in the Iraqi marshland, which is located in a long distance from the project site.

   6.1.9 Ecosystem
The most important impact of the project on the ecosystem is the siltation caused by the solid
bund made in the Euphrates during the past construction works (especially during its
elimination). This impact can be mitigated by preventing major earthworks during the winter
rain season. The significance of this impact is low due to the high existing siltation and pollution
of the river.
Other impacts of construction works on ecosystem will be negligible since there be:
  No sensitive habitats located in the vicinity of the project site.
  No removal or interference with prey of predators.
  No removal of predatory animals resulting in increased prey populations that exceed the
   carrying capacity of the local environment.

                                                 24
Emergency Road Rehabilitation Project
Al-Daraji Bridge Environmental & Social Management Plan

  Insignificant effluent discharges.
  Insignificant noise disrupting breeding behavior or use of breeding grounds, resulting in
   shifts in population dynamics.

   6.1.10 Topography and landforms
The local topography will not be altered by the project activities.

   6.1.11 Climate and Meteorology
Impacts on the microclimate of the local area will be negligible. There will be no changes in
surface and no aerodynamic disturbances.

   6.1.12 Traffic Management
In order to minimize air and noise impacts associated with traffic generated by the project’s
construction traffic, the following measures must be implemented:
      All heavy vehicles travelling to and from the site must follow previously decided heavy
       vehicle routes to avoid built-up areas.
      Use of carpooling and bus services must be implemented where practicable where
       practicable to minimize worker trips during the construction.
      Where practicable, truck deliveries must be restricted to daytime working hours.
      Dangerous goods must be transported along routes preferred for dangerous goods.
      If possible, the transport of oversize loads must be restricted to non-peak periods to
       minimize traffic disruptions, and will be provided with appropriate escorts and approvals
       from both the Main Roads Department and the Police.
      Clear traffic signs and signs signals must be installed on-site to provide for safe traffic.

   6.1.13 Socio – Economic Impacts

As was mentioned above, no adverse socio-economic impacts have been identified as being
associated with project activities at this time from site visits and from input received from the
public consultation process. . Local community members overwhelmingly support the bridge
construction because of its potentially very significant contribution to local transportation,
marketing of local produce, creation of short-term employment on road and bridge crews, and
stimulation of local business opportunities from new passing traffic.

The consultations revealed that there has been no removal of plants, trees etc. from the areas
owned by the local community. Hence, no community members have lodged claims for
compensation. In this regard also the consultations revealed that no permanent or temporary
infrastructure has been, or will be adversely affected, and no displacement or re-settlements of
any person(s) were needed. The land required for the bridge and road access is state-owned. .



                                                 25
Emergency Road Rehabilitation Project
Al-Daraji Bridge Environmental & Social Management Plan

During the construction phase, the Project will generate additional new employment
opportunities for local community residents. These will be for both skilled and unskilled
workers. It is agreed that, for both work categories, first preference will be given to local
residents who are most needy/poor.

Transmission of diseases, and specifically HIV/AIDS, is common in many countries where road
construction is ongoing and where road construction crews live adjacent to communities for
some time. The spread of such diseases is anticipated to be a very low probability in the case of
this project given very conservative social norms in this locality (as is the case in most of rural
Iraq). However, the operation of a GRM during construction, and for one year following
completion of the bridge, will keep a line of communication open for receipt of complaints and
identification of adverse impacts and any associated mitigation needs.


 6.2   Maintenance Phase

   6.2.1 Soil Erosion
No impacts are expected during the project maintenance phase.

   6.2.2 Water Quality
The maintenance phase of the project will have no impact on the surface- and ground-water
quality of the area.
   6.2.3 Air Quality
The vehicle emissions and fugitive dust emissions are considered the main air pollutants during
the maintenance phase. The concentration of (NOx) is expected to be below the standard limits
throughout the operational period. To reduce the air pollution in the sections that are located near
residential areas, water spraying must be applied, trees must be planted between the villages and
the alignment, and the maintenance vehicles must be kept in good operational conditions.

   6.2.4 Noise
The noise levels during the maintenance phase shall not exceed 85 dBA in a distance of few
meters off-site (except for extra heavy duty trucks). To control the noise level impacts during the
maintenance phase within the permissible standards the following measures should be applied:

  Restricting maintenance works to the day hours.
  Keeping maintenance vehicles in good condition.
  Controlling the type of the heavy truck that allowed to pass over the bridge, this may be
   done with the coordination of the traffic police in the governorate.

Emergency Road Rehabilitation Project
Al-Daraji Bridge Environmental & Social Management Plan

   6.2.5 Solid Waste
During the maintenance period, some littering and waste generation resulting from the repair
activities will occur. Littering may occur due to wind action. All the above solid waste must be
collected and disposed by the municipality trucks and vehicles.

   6.2.6 Health and Safety
During the maintenance period, no impacts of significance are expected other than for the
contractor’s workers. Personal protection equipment such as eyeglasses, gloves, hard heads and
safety belts must be supplied. The bridge must be provided with suitable post lighting at night to
reduce the probability of the accidents.

   6.2.7 5.2.7 Flora and Fauna
No impacts are expected during the maintenance period. During the operation phase, the effects
on flora will be basically from the NOX emissions. The NOX emissions may be causing
discoloration in plant leaves and then to lesions (brown or dark brown spots) if the concentration
of the pollutant are high. The loss of carotene and reduction of chlorophyll are the major
responses from plant exposed to NOx emissions.

   6.2.8 Topography and Landforms
Local topography will not be affected.

   6.2.9 Climate and Meteorology
No impacts during the maintenance phase.

   6.2.10 Ecosystem
No impacts during the maintenance phase are expected.

   6.2.11 Geology and Soils
No impacts during the maintenance phase are expected.

   6.2.12 Rare &Endangered Species
No impacts during the maintenance phase are expected.

   6.2.13 Sensitive Habitat
No impacts are expected during the maintenance phase.

   6.2.14 Socio-Economic impacts
During the maintenance period, the project is expected to result in very positive socio-economic
outcomes for the local communities. Socially harmful consequences of bridge operation are not
anticipated. However, the continued operation of a GRM for one year following opening of the
bridge for use will ensure that local community members have an accessible, fair and transparent
means of reporting any emerging adverse impacts, and a means of obtaining mitigation.

              8. MONITORING
        Regular monitoring of all significant environmental and social parameters is essential to
        ascertain compliance with the project’s mitigation measures and relevant laws and regulations
        and policies. The objectives of the monitoring are as follows:
          To measure the compliance with the ESMP mitigation measures
          To verify the results of the project’s environmental impact assessment
          To study the trend of construction values of the parameters, which have been identified as
            critical.
          To ensure that all safety concepts were implemented properly during the bridge operation.
          To ensure no harm is incurred by local communities from bridge operation, including to
            land, productive plants, infrastructures, and livelihoods.
        To ensure the proper implementation of the environmental and social mitigation measures, an
        environmental and social monitoring program has been established for the construction phase.
        The monitoring program will focus on noise impact, air quality, and water quality within the
        project area, as shown in Table 15.

        Routine environmental monitoring of the bridge will be conducted to ensure performance
        standards put in place are met. Monitoring (in coordination with the MoE) will be periodically
        conducted in accordance with site-specific monitoring plans. Specialist studies to investigate
        particular aspects of the environment (e.g. flora and fauna, hydrological risk) will be periodically
        commissioned when needed.

   9. REPORTING AND AUDITING
To ensure that the mitigation and monitoring measures are being carried out effectively with the
required frequency, a clearly defined and regular reporting and response system must be
established.

All inspection and audit reports of environmental performance should be stored in the Audit and
Inspection Manager (AIM) system. The AIM is an electronic database that is used to enable
corrective actions identified during the inspection \ auditing process to be recorded, tracked and
closed out. The information will be made available to the relevant regulatory authorities as
required. In addition to the monitoring and reporting requirements documented in the relevant
sections of the ESMP, the following reporting regime will be implemented:

  All incidents or accidents during the bridge and road construction should be reported
   immediately to relevant authorizes. Detailed reporting must be provided within days.
  All corrective measures must be discussed to ensure compliance with laws and regulations.
  Reports for personnel training on environmental issues or emergency practices must be
   produced.
  Progress reports, environmental monitoring report and other inspections reports must be
   produced periodically.
  Reports produced from operation of GRM system, including on numbers of complaints
   lodged and mitigations/resolutions.

Provision scheduling of reporting is presented in table 16.

   10.TRAINING AND COMMUNICATIONS
All construction personnel and contractors are required to undertake appropriate environmental
training and induction programs including, importantly, on GRM procedures.
All managers and supervisors will be responsible for ensuring that personnel under their control
have the requisite competencies, skill and training to carry out their assigned tasks in accordance
with the requirements of the ESMP. They will also be responsible for identifying additional
training and competency requirements, as well as training on the rights of local PAPs to
mitigation if adversely affected by project activities, social mitigation procedures to be applied
under the project, and operation of the GRM system.
 All staff will complete a comprehensive project induction. The induction will include a
comprehensive review of environmental and social requirements and standards, safety, and
access protocols, and GRM operation.
