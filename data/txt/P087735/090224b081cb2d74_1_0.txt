                         Implementation Status Overview
                         As of May 30, 2013, the overall disbursement is US$91.2 million representing 67% of the credit amount ( $ 139 million in May 2013 USD). The total net commitment ( disbursement
                         plus undisbursed commitment) is 126.7 million USD ( 91.2% of the credit) . The majority of the civil works contracts have been concluded except for : Um Qasr-Al Zubair road project,
                         Samawa-Nasiriya road project and Al Darraji Bridge construction which are still facing serious delays. The two large TA contracts ( asset management and transport sector master

                         plan) are ongoing but with a delay of few months from the agreed schedule. The PMT will discuss with the asset management consultant a reduced scope of work and a new
                         schedule. The "unallocated" portion ( about 8 million USD) of the credit remains to be allocated to specific contracts.
