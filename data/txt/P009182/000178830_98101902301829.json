Macedonia's\n            long term irrigation development program for the Pelagonija\n            plain, the single largest area of arable land in the\n            Republic. The Project seeks to increase crop production on\n            20,300 ha, to raise productivity and income, and to create\n            employment in an area where unemployment and emigration are\n            among the highest in Yugoslavia. The increased food\n            production on the newly irrigated land would substitute for\n            imports, cater to increasing domestic demand and provide\n            limited export potential. The project would supply bulk\n            water to the community of Bitola and to a thermal electric\n            power facility under construction. Feasibility and\n            preparation studies for three possible future irrigation\n            projects are also included."}, "docdt": "1978-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
