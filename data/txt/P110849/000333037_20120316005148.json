Policy Loan (DPL) Project for Brazil were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was low, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            the Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the Government of Mexico (GoM) was, and\n            continues to be, fully committed to its climate change\n            adaptation and mitigation agenda. This DPL supports\n            Mexico's program, and the country is increasingly\n            recognized as an international leader in this area.\n            Ownership at different levels of government has proven to be\n            a driving force for success. An integrated country strategy,\n            in which climate change programs and policies are addressed\n            throughout with a full range of instruments, creates a\n            virtuous framework for addressing the challenges. Granted,\n            not all clients can support the number and diversity of\n            operations and instruments that have been focused on climate\n            change as that of the Mexico program. But it is the\n            consistency with which the issue reappears in the Mexico\n            partnership program (driven in large part as a reflection of\n            the client's commitment), with a diversity of\n            investment and policy operations not only cross-sectoral\n            (such as this DPL) but sectoral as well, that has led to a\n            highly focused and effective engagement. There are more\n            unknowns than knowns in the policy and science of climate\n            change, so technical assistance and a knowledge intensive\n            engagement are especially important."}, "docdt": "2011-11-20T00:00:00Z"}
