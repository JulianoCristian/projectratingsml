                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall, the execution of the project components and activities has been on track and some significant outputs and outcomes have been achieved since the Project became effective
                         in October 2008. These include the treatment of hill slopes, gullies and acid soils on both communal and individual lands through the application of tested physical and biological
                         measures. Also, implementation of the Project has been reported to have contributed towards improvement in agricultural and livestock productivity and household income levels in
                         some Project areas. Initial delays in the procurement of vehicles, office and field equipment which affected a number of key project activities has now been largely overcome. Major
                         bulk items under ICB and NCB have been procured already, leaving those items that are expected to be procured at woreda and kebele levels using shopping method. Annual
                         targets set for the remaining period of project implementation seem achievable, although capacity limitations in Gambela and Benishangul-Gumuz regions may continue to be a
                         challenge if not vigorously addressed. The project team provided assurances to the mission that additional support will continue to be mobilized and provided to these emerging
                         regions.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         1.      Project Restructuring: The Project will be restructured to better align indicators and development objectives, without changing the overall PDO.
                         2.      Successor SLMP II: A successor Phase-II of the SLMP is planned to start implementation in 2014.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
