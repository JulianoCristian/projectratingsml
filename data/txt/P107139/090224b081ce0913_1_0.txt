                         Implementation Status Overview
                         As the Project ages overall performance continues to improve significantly, and targets are being achieved through implementation of several parts of the Project. Awareness about
                         SLM practices and the need to restore degraded watersheds has greatly increased as has the degree of community ownership and voluntary stakeholder engagement in SLM
                         activities including through mass mobilization to participate in communal work in degraded watersheds rehabilitation and re-greening. The degree of social inclusion for the youth,
                         women and vulnerable groups is also on the increase with some Woredas specifically earmarking these groups for allocation of rehabilitated lands and other forms of project related
                         benefits such as beekeeping & honey production, processing of oil seeds, etc. Above all however, there have been remarkable achievements in physical and biological rehabilitation
                         work being carried out on hillsides and other degraded landscapes such as gullies in all SLMP areas. Overall, a total of 175,510ha of degraded communal, farmlands and
                         homesteads have been treated and managed since the start of the Project with appropriate physical and biological measures. The Project Support Unit (PSU) was optimistic that the
                         end-of-project target of 210,000ha could be achieved, given the high degree of community ownership, awareness and mobilization. There is an increased focus on income generation
                         activities that are crucial for ensuring project sustainability. Also, there has been marked improvement in the rural land certification and administration component with an increased
                         number of second level land certificates issued in the majority of the project areas.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         1. Level II SLMP Restructuring: The Country Director has approved the Level II restructuring of the Project and this has been transmitted officially to the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance
                         & Economic Development (MoFED). The restructuring covered: (i) a reallocation of IDA and GEF grant funds across components and expenditure categories; (ii) a waiver for duties
                         and taxes; and (ii) slight modifications to a few of the indicators.

                         2. Closing of SLMP: The Project will close on September 30, 2013, as planned. No extension is planned. The Project Support Unit (PSU) has assured the Bank Task Team that the

                         remaining Project budget is likely to be fully disbursed by the original closing date.

                         3. Design and Preparation of SLMP II: Design and preparation of a blended operation (SLMP II) with contributions from IDA, GEF and the Norway Ministry of Foreign Affairs
                         (NMOFA) has already started.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
