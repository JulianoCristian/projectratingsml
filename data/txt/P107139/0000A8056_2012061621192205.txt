                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall, the execution of the project components and activities has been on track and some significant outputs and outcomes have been achieved since the Project became effective
                         in October 2008. These include the treatment of hill slopes, gullies and acid soils on both communal and individual lands through the application of tested physical and biological
                         measures. Also, implementation of the Project has been reported to have contributed towards improvement in agricultural and livestock productivity and household income levels in
                         some Project areas. Major bulk items under ICB and NCB have been procured already, leaving those items that are expected to be procured at woreda and kebele levels that are
                         using shopping method.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         1.       Project Restructuring: The Project will be restructured to better align indicators with development objectives, without changing the overall PDO.
                         2. Preparation of SLMP II: It is planned that full design and preparation of an IDA financed SLMP II will start during the third quarter of the new fiscal year (FY13). However,
                         preparation of the Government of Norway support to SLMP will start during the first quarter of FY13.
