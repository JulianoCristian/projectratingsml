the provision of a waiver for the use of grant funds to cover VAT expenses; and (iii) the
revision of selected intermediate indicators including target values in the Results
Framework, and the addition of one intermediate indicator on soil carbon.

unsustainable traditional cultivation techniques practiced by the majority of smallholders. At

two to three percent of agricultural GDP, a significant loss for a country where agriculture
accounts for nearly 50 percent of GDP, 90 percent of export revenues, and the source of
livelihood for more than 85 percent of the country's more than 70 million inhabitants.
2.      At appraisal, land degradation was considered to be a major cause of the country's
low and declining agricultural productivity, persistent food insecurity, and rural poverty. In the
highlands, the landscape is dominated by farming villages in valleys surrounded by steep slopes.
The farming systems are predominantly based on traditional forms of: (i) low-input cereal
production, which provides insufficient ground cover during the period of most erosive rainfall,
and (ii) livestock management mainly based on open access to grazing lands, woodlands and
forest. An estimated 75 percent of Ethiopia’s 35 million cattle graze in the highlands, adding
stress to areas already under high land use pressure. The expansion of grazing reduces
vegetation cover in the hillsides and accelerates gully formation; at the same time, the
widespread use of crop residues for feed further accelerates land degradation and soil nutrient
depletion. The very high dependence on wood and other biomass, including manure for
household energy (95 percent of total energy consumption), together with the expansion of
agriculture into forested areas, contributes to a high rate of deforestation. Forest cover had been
reduced over the past century from 40 percent of the total land area to 2.4% at the time of
appraisal. Improved land use and management were required to address the mutually-
reinforcing negative spiral created by land degradation and climate variability dynamics.
3.      Another factor of the growing land degradation in Ethiopia was land tenure insecurity,
largely related to policy failures of past governments. Tenure insecurity was undermining land
users' incentives to invest in sustainable land management (SLM) practices. The need to address
land degradation and tenure security was considered a primary pillar in a number of key strategic
documents, including (i) the Sustainable Development and Poverty Reduction Program (SDPRP
2000-2005); (ii) the Plan for Accelerated and Sustainable Development to End Poverty
(PASDEP 2006-2010); and (iii) the Federal Rural Administration and Use Proclamation (2005).
4.       In response to these challenges, the Government developed, with support from the
TerrAfrica partnership, the Ethiopia Strategic Investment Framework for SLM. This investment
plan anchored the establishment of the GoE’s new programmatic approach to scaling up SLM.
Called the SLM Program, it provided the platform for convening and coordinating assistance
from GIZ, Canada, WFP, and others. The SLM Program targeted 177 "high potential, food
secure" watersheds (of which the Bank/GEF-financed SLMP-1 operation would target 35
initially, later expanding to 45). Before this programmatic approach was undertaken by the GoE
and partners, efforts to address land degradation were piecemeal and scattered throughout the
country. Despite the inherent upfront costs, adopting a programmatic approach was considered to
be instrumental to convene financial and non-financial support, resulting in greater overall
benefits downstream. SLMP-1 was at this time envisioned to anchor the investment and policy
dialogue for this programmatic approach.

                                                1
5.      Rationale for Bank Assistance: By the time of SLMP-1 preparation, the World Bank
and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) had developed a number of strategies and
instruments relevant to assisting Ethiopia in scaling-up SLM, and had acquired considerable
experience through the support to successful land management initiatives such as the Loess
Plateau Project in China. The Bank's Interim Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY2006-
2007 noted that "land degradation is at the top of the environmental agenda in Ethiopia" because
of the threat it poses to sustainable agricultural growth, infrastructure, and other development
challenges.
6.      SLMP-1 was fully consistent with (i) the World Bank’s Africa Action Plan to make
agriculture more productive and sustainable, and to take advantage of opportunities for NRM to
promote growth and poverty reduction; and (ii) the TerrAfrica partnership, which aims to scale
up investments in SLM throughout Africa.
7.       Operationally, successful interventions to address land degradation and climate resilience
require integrated and cross-sectoral approaches that often involve locally specific combinations
of land use practices, structural and biophysical land management measures, infrastructure,
watershed planning and development, livelihoods enhancements, crop and livestock
management, forest management, and a strong participatory element. The Bank was in a unique
position to catalyze the adoption of such innovative and untested approaches in Ethiopia because
of its strong policy dialogue with the Government, convening power with development partners,
and its engagement across several sectors affected by land use and management (i.e., agriculture,
forest, water, energy). GEF involvement in the proposed project was aimed at focusing attention
and assistance to helping smallholder farmers become more resilient to extreme climatic events,
protecting ecologically sensitive landscapes, and increasing sequestration of carbon in soils and
biomass. This project was expected to complement the public works component of the ongoing
IDA­ financed Productive Safety Net Project, which focused largely on labor-intensive structural
SLM measures in "food insecure areas."
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
8.      The PDO was to reduce land degradation in agricultural landscapes and improve the
agricultural productivity of smallholder farmers. In the legal documents (IDA Credit Agreement
and GEF Grant Agreement) the PDO and GEO added “…in selected watersheds identified in the
Program Implementation Manual”
1.3 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
9.     The GEO was to reduce land degradation, leading to the protection and/or restoration of
ecosystem functions and diversity in agricultural landscapes.
1.4 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
    reasons/justification
10.     The Project was restructured in March 2013 to reallocate funds among categories and to
provide a waiver for the use of grant funds to cover VAT expenses. The PDO and key indicators
remained unchanged. However, the Level 2 restructuring included the revision of selected targets
for certain indicators, namely the percentage increase in growth of agricultural productivity (a
PDO indicator) and the number of land certificates issued (an intermediate indicator).



                                                2
1.5 Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
    reasons/justification
11.    The GEO and key related indicators remained unchanged.
1.6 Main Beneficiaries
12.    The primary target group was an estimated 500,000 beneficiaries, representing rural
households living in 35 large watersheds assisted by the project. These large watersheds, with an
average size of about 8,500 ha, were located in six Regional States of Ethiopia (Amhara,
Oromia, Tigray, SNNP, Beneshangul/Gumuz, and Gambela). In addition, through the capacity
building activities of the project, technical staff at the central (Ministry of Agriculture), regional
(Woreda) and district (Kebele) levels were planned to benefit from training and improved
working conditions.
1.7 Original Components (as approved)
13.    Project objectives were to be achieved through the implementation of three components
(see Annex 2 for additional details).
14.    Component 1: Watershed Management (US$21.70 million): The objective of the
Watershed Management Component was to support scaling up of best SLM practices in
watersheds located in the "high potential," "food secure" areas that were increasingly becoming
vulnerable to land degradation and food insecurity. The design included four sub-components:
(i) Capacity building; (ii) Communal land and gully rehabilitation; (iii) Farmland and homestead
development; and (iv) Community infrastructure.
15.     Component 2: Rural Land Certification and Administration (US$3.43 million):
The objective of this component was to expand the coverage and enhance the government's land
certification program, with the aim of strengthening land tenure security for smallholder
farmers in the project area. Project design included the scaling up of an enhanced land
certification process (known as Stage 2) based o n experiences from two pilot projects financed
by the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA) and the United States Agency for
International Development (USAID).
16.     The project also financed land certification interventions such as cadastral surveying,
parcel­ based land registration, and developing registries for rural land. Such interventions were
expected to facilitate timely processing and issuance of land certificates, with important features
such as geo­referencing and mapping of household and farm plots, and communal lands in all
the participating Woredas.
17.      Component 3: Project Management (US$1.70 million): The component objective
was to assist the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) – called MoARD at appraisal – and the
institutions at Regional, Woreda, and Kebele levels responsible for sustainable land
management to effectively support coordination and implementation of the SLM project and the
broader SLM Program, including procurement, financial management and monitoring and
evaluation (M&E).
18.    These components contributed to the GoE’s broader SLM program that included four
additional components which were not financed by the project: (i) Knowledge Management; (ii)
Improved Framework for SLM; (iii) Strengthening the Implementation Structure for Watershed
Development; and (iv) Support to Agricultural Extension Services for SLM. At appraisal, the
GoE was in the process of negotiating support from German Development Cooperation, through
GIZ, for the implementation of these additional program components. The amount of 11.8
                                                  3
million Euros was secured in 2009, and was focused on three of the six regions supported by the
project (Tigray, Oromia and Amhara).
1.8 Revised Components
19.    Project components remained unchanged throughout the life of the project.
1.9 Other significant changes
20.     Other than the reallocation of funds, revision of indicators, and incorporation of 10
additional watersheds (which met the criteria and stipulations of the legal documents) no other
significant changes took place. These revisions are described in Section 2.2 under
“Restructuring”.
2.   Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
21.    Project preparation was initiated in January 2006, and concluded at the October 2008
appraisal. Effectiveness was declared in March 2009. The preparation process took into account
Ethiopia’s valuable experience in implementing pioneer work in SLM supported by USAID,
World Food Program (through the MERET project), GIZ (formally GTZ), and the TerrAfrica
regional partnership launched in 2006 by the World Bank and many development partners. A
multidisciplinary team contributed the Bank’s knowledge, lessons learned and experience on
NRM projects in Africa and other regions (in particular the successful Loess Plateau project in
China via a south-south event involving the GoE).
22.     Project design faced the challenge of aligning the Bank’s operation with the broader GoE
SLM Program that was being developed in parallel and that was in the process of being
supported by various donors. As a result, the design of the SLMP-1 project included two major
components focused on investments in selected watersheds (Watershed Management, and Rural
Land Certification), supported by a fiduciary-oriented third component (Project Management),
leaving most of the support for policy development, knowledge management, and technical
assistance to other sources of funding which were unconfirmed at the time of appraisal and,
therefore, not included in the project as co-financing or parallel financing. In particular, M&E
functions for the SLM Program, and to SLMP-1, were largely expected to be enabled by GTZ’s
contribution, posing a risk that would later manifest in weak methodical reporting on the widely
recognized SLMP-1 achievements, given the focus of GTZ on a detailed M&E system for
overall program indicators rather than the indicators defined for the project. M&E budget under
SLMP-1 was therefore insufficient for the requirements of the operation.
23.     Technical, operational, and institutional risks were adequately identified during
preparation, and acceptable mitigating measures were proposed in the PAD. However, the
impact of these risks and weaknesses was not fully accounted to determine readiness for
implementation (an essential element for a highly decentralized project), which was subsequently
reflected in the slow implementation progress during first two years of the project.
24.    Regarding quality at entry, one aspect which required considerable attention during
implementation was the project’s Result Framework, both in terms of the PDO-level and
intermediate indicators and expected targets. The combination of (i) certain disconnect between
PDO and components; (ii) an excessive reliance on agricultural productivity increases as a key
measure to determine land degradation achievements; (iii) overly ambitious targets; and (iv) the


                                               4
lack of a timely and appropriate baseline, resulted in recurrent difficulties to assess project
progress and achievement of objectives.
25.     Consistent with good practices for projects with a high level of decentralized
implementation, a Project Implementation Manual (PIM) was developed as a condition of project
effectiveness. The initial PIM was amended in 2011 to include a series of revisions, including
the enhancement of the Land Administration Component, and the inclusion of 10 additional
watersheds. However, the assessment of regional coordinators and field staff suggested that the
PIM was bulky and cumbersome to use, did not provide sufficiently clear guidance on roles and
responsibilities on fiduciary matters, and lacked clarity in the subcomponent on Farmland and
Homestead Development. In addition, following project completion, PSU staff and regional
coordinators highlighted that the PIM did not contribute sufficiently to harmonize technical and
operational procedures, and reporting requirements among the different financing partners of the
SLM program, suggesting that there was an unresolved issue in some stakeholders distinguishing
between the SLM Project and the broader SLM Program.
2.2 Implementation
26.     The project was declared effective in March 2009, and closed 4.5 years later on the
originally established date (September 2013) with no extensions granted and a very high
disbursement rate. The project was considered successful by the GoE, which committed to a
larger follow-on project, SLMP-2, that aims to consolidate the SLM platform and a major
expansion of the number of large watersheds assisted (from 45 to 135).
27.      As noted above, implementation progress was very slow during the first two years of the
project. Low early disbursement is expected for watershed operations, particular those in
complex operating environment and where new approaches need to be introduced, owned by
local actors, and rolled out. The project faced three main challenges at this time: (i) the need for
setting-up and/or training the entire implementation structure at central, regional and local levels;
(ii) the time required for the participatory diagnosis and preparation of watershed development
plans; and (iii) the initial difficulties in applying the Bank’s fiduciary requirements at the
regional and local levels.
28.     Although the project was implemented within the overall conceptual and operational
framework developed during preparation, and achieved highly commendable environmental and
livelihood results in the treated watersheds, several factors influenced implementation. The
project was constrained by inadequate M&E capacity and poor financial management and
procurement capacity at the district (woreda) level. In addition, high staff workload and turnover
at the local level had a negative effect on the critical function of providing technical, operational
and fiduciary support to the beneficiary communities. This was further compounded by the lack
of adequate working conditions (mainly transportation and internet access for communication
and reporting purposes). The impact of these constraints appears to have been more acute in
those regions where GIZ did not provide technical assistance, an indication that some of these
constraints could have been addressed at design or by reallocating resources during
implementation, particularly for TA and M&E.

Mid-Term review
29.     The Bank conducted a mid-term review mission in March 2011, two years after project
effectiveness. Although the MTR was not supported by any independent assessment or specially
developed report, the mission’s general conclusions were that (i) good progress had been made

                                                 5
on objectives for Watershed Management (Component 1) and Project Management (Component
3); (ii) initial delays in procurement of vehicles, office and field equipment which affected key
project activities had been overcome; and (iii) that overall the project was on track to meet its
objectives. However, the MTR Aide Memoire highlighted several factors requiring attention and
action, including (i) the lack of reliable data to measure PDO and GEO progress; (ii) the need to
incorporate the upper catchments of the selected watersheds; (iii) the poor performance of the
Rural Land Certification Component mainly due to the fact that a sound technical basis for
second-level certification had not yet been established; and (iv) the need to either refine,
discontinue or introduce new performance indicators to more accurately track progress toward
intermediate results and project objectives.
Project Restructuring
30.     As a result of the MTR, agreement was reached between the GoE and the Bank to
restructure the project, which would include substantial project design changes, including: (i)
revising the indicators to make them measurable and relevant; (ii) incorporating new activities on
knowledge management; (iii) scaling up and incorporating lessons learned from the CDM-type
Humbo carbon operation; (iv) accommodating additional financing from the Government of
Finland; (v) reallocating IDA and GEF funds; (vi) revising the list of assisted watersheds and
incorporating 10 additional watersheds; and (vii) restructuring the Rural Land Certification
Administration component to support the priorities of the Land Administration and Land Use
Directorate (LALUD) of MoA and reduce the original targets for land certification.
31.     The formal letter requesting restructuring was submitted by GoE on March 8, 2011, a few
days prior to the MTR mission. This letter included proposed changes to indicators and other
elements summarized above. Despite the confirmation and agreements reached during the
mission, the restructuring process within the Bank was affected by prolonged discussions to
reach agreement on the revised indicators and targets, and was only formalized by the
Restructuring Paper dated February 15, 2013. It was communicated to GoE by the Bank on
March 15, 2013. In this letter, the Bank informed the GoE that, due to the time lapsed and the
imminent closing date and the expected approval of SLMP-2, the restructuring only included the
revision of targets for certain indicators, the reallocation of funds among categories, and a waiver
for the use of funds to cover VAT expenses. Available information suggests that the
incorporation of additional watersheds and the restructuring of the Land Administration
component were agreed by the Bank as part of a revision to the PIM.
Risk Status: The project was never declared at risk or at potential risk.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) - Design, Implementation and Utilization
32.     The limited functionality and utilization of the M&E system affected project progress and
achievement of objectives. This was mainly due to the lack of a sound baseline and the
difficulties encountered during project implementation to collect and report on progress at the
local level (low institutional capacity, insufficient technical know-how, persistent staff turnover,
equipment and communication deficiencies, etc.). Despite this, the PSU developed a
comprehensive internal planning process, in which, as part of the budget allocation procedures,
each district and region was required to annually present to MoA an extensive list of targets for
field activities. In terms of utilization, this methodology was relatively effective to report on
project progress by the PSU (and reflected in Annual Reports), but the value of this information
was limited, as new targets were developed each year, and progress was rated usually based on
compliance with these annual targets rather than the global target for each project component, or

                                                 6
the indicators of the Results Framework (see Annex 2 for a complete list of outputs and
intermediate indicators measured).
33.     Regarding the Results Framework, some of the intermediate indicators and targets were
unrealistic and/or difficult to measure, including: (i) increase in the growth of agricultural
productivity over non-intervention areas; (ii) increase in agricultural productivity; and (iii)
number of farmer households receiving land certificates issued with geo-referenced maps.
However, specific outcome-based surveys were conducted, of which two (soil carbon and NDVI)
were instrumental to demonstrate the positive effects of the land management practices promoted
by the project. Site visits provided confirmation of improvements in land cover.
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
a. Environmental Safeguard compliance
34.     SLMP-1 was not considered to have significant adverse environmental impacts and had
been classified as Category B in accordance with the World Bank’s Safeguard Policy (OP 4.01).
Since the specific sites of interventions were not known at the time of project formulation, an
ESMF was prepared to screen sub-projects before they were implemented. The potential
environmental and social impacts were adequately addressed in the ESMF, which was disclosed
to the World Bank’s InfoShop on February 20, 2008.
35.     According to the ISRs, safeguard implementation was rated as satisfactory throughout the
project period. In the Aide Memoire of June 2012, it was indicated that although activities are
screened, no further assessments were conducted with respect to location-specific impacts that
could be associated with construction or rehabilitation of roads, irrigation facilities and spring
development. It was also noted that not all Aide Memoires reported on the implementation of
environmental safeguards by the Project.
36.     The major challenge observed during implementation was weak documentation and
reporting on environmental safeguard implementation, which should have benefited from
independent auditing to ensure compliance and draw lessons to improve future implementation.
Overall, safeguards are rated as moderately satisfactory.
Social Safeguards
37.     The project’s implementation strategy featured a number of important elements that
contributed to improve the empowerment and social capital of the beneficiary communities.
These included strong ownership of through participatory decision-making process and
remunerated involvement of community members in the establishment of most biophysical
measures (afforestation, terraces, bunds, water harvesting, etc.), enhanced security of land tenure
via land certification initiatives, and provision of much needed alternative livelihood
opportunities for many rural poor living in degraded lands.
38.     The social screening of sub-project activities during project implementation and
documented in various implementation support missions confirmed that there was no land
acquisition or resettlement, as all project physical activities were carried out on existing sites and
structures. However, the social checklist in the ESMF could have been used more
systematically, since the project was associated with widening or rehabilitation of drainage or
small irrigation infrastructure, SLM practices and land-use practices (such as community-led
closures and by-laws) to protect grazing land and vegetative cover. Further, although there was
an effort to ensure female participation in the Project through sharing of project related activities

                                                  7
and benefits between men and women, the follow-on SLMP-2 should seek ways to enhance
women’s participation in decision making and leadership. For these reasons, the rating for social
safeguards is satisfactory.
Procurement
39.     Procurement activities under the SLM-1 project were streamlined within the Government
system and were carried out accordingly. At Federal level, pooled procurement of equipment
such as vehicles, motorcycles and other essential equipment to be supplied to the implementing
agencies at sub-national level is carried out. In the Federal Ministry of Agriculture the regional
Bureaus of Agriculture (BoA) “Procurement, Finance and Property Administration Support
Processes (PFPASP)” had full control over the procurement processing and administration. The
role of the PSU was limited to planning, coordinating all the regional implementing agencies of
the project and placing requests to the PFPASP. Procurement decisions were made within the
MoA and BoAs. At Woreda level, the Woreda Finance and Economic Development Offices
carry out the implementation of the procurement activities of the project based on the annual
work plan and purchase requests presented by sectoral offices at Woreda level.
40.    Delays in procurement of field equipment and supplies were a cause for slow
implementation during the initial stages of project implementation, but were gradually resolved
through intense Bank support and guidance, as well as procurement-specific training to
decentralized agencies. Overall, the rating on procurement is satisfactory.
Financial Management
41.    At appraisal, a comprehensive list of FM-related strengths and weaknesses was
developed, based on which both the overall inherent risk and the overall control risk were rated
Substantial before, and Moderate after taking into account the risk mitigating measures.
42.    During implementation, the project maintained a reasonably adequate FM system which
provides a reasonable assurance that the reports being produced can be relied upon to monitor
the project. Generally, the project complied with the financial covenants outlined in the legal
agreements which included submission of quarterly IFRs and annual audits, except some delays.
However, recent IFR and audit report were not submitted by the due date. The financial
management risk ratings were mostly rated Moderate except for some supervision missions,
including the last one, where the risk was rated Substantial. Owing to this risk rating, the project
was supervised by conducting mostly semi-annual field visit.
43.     Throughout the project’s life, FM supervision missions were undertaken as per Bank
policies to ensure that the FM arrangements remained acceptable to the Bank. Based on this, the
overall FM Implementation Status and Results (FM ISR) rating of the project was rated as
Moderately Satisfactory for most of the life of the Project. No major issues related to budgeting,
accounting, staffing, internal controls, audits or flow of funds affected project implementation
significantly. Regarding counterpart contributions, at project closing, counterpart contributions
of only US$2.40 million had been reported. The government considered that the contribution
made in kind has not been valued, recorded and properly reported contribution. At project
closing, the control risk and the overall project risk were rated to be Substantial and the FM ISR
rating of the project was rated as Moderately Satisfactory.
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
44.     Due to the positive results of the project and the support from other partners, MoA has
continued to develop and implement the innovative, integrated and inclusive SLM Program that

                                                 8
supports (i) efforts to address land degradation and climate risks and productivity constraints
through a landscape approach, and (ii) contributes to growth in the agricultural sector in general.
On the basis of SLMP-1’s promising results at all levels (farmers, rural communities, and public
institutions at the central, regional and local levels), GoE requested a new Bank-financed
operation (SLMP-2) aimed at (i) further scaling up and consolidating the pioneering efforts and
achievements of the project, mainly through replicating the project’s assistance to 90 additional
watersheds; (ii) contributing to the consolidation and harmonization of MoA’s multi-donor SLM
program; and (iii) synergizing the project’s achievements in terms of reduced soil degradation
and improved water management by promoting a comprehensive livelihood improvement
strategy anchored on “climate-smart” agricultural practices in beneficiary farmlands, households,
and communities.
45.    Prioritized in the 2013-2016 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) adopted by the Bank’s
Executive Directors on August 29, 2012, SLMP-2 preserves the main pillars of SLMP-1 and will
expand support to 135 large watersheds in six regions, via financing of US$112 million from the
contributions of an IDA credit fully blended with grants from GEF and Norway, which has
emerged as an active new partner.
3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
46.     The objectives of SLMP-1 remain highly relevant to the Bank’s assistance strategy and
within the major pillars of the current CPS, and the objectives of the GEF Land Degradation
Focal Area. Moreover, the implementation of the broader national SLM Program remains a top
priority that is anchored in GoE’s sustainable investment framework (ESIF), which is receiving
increasing technical and financial support from several bilateral and multilateral development
partners and the emerging Climate Resilience Green Economy (CRGE) initiative of the Ministry
of Finance and Economic Development (MOFED) as well as the country’s Growth and
Transformation Plan (GTP). As such, the implementation of SLMP-1 has laid important
groundwork for improved performance of the broader SLM Program, and for the design of the
recently approved scaling-up SLMP-2 operation (P133133) as well as, more broadly, the pursuit
of a more focused program that promotes a landscape approach to delivering rural poverty
reduction, equitable growth, climate resilience, and both local and global environmental public
goods.
47.     At the local level, complementing the decision to improve and expand the scope and
geographic coverage of the SLM Program by MoA, GoE has established a voluntary
mobilization program through which all members of urban and rural communities contribute
labor for soil and water conservation practices such as terraces, stone bunds, and reforestation.
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives and Global Environment Objectives
48.     There is no doubt that resilient landscapes and the multiple benefits from them are now at
the center of Ethiopia’s development agenda, due in no small part to SLMP-1. The project has
been instrumental in demonstrating the importance of a holistic soil and water conservation
approach as an essential prerequisite of sustained productivity and livelihood improvements in
Ethiopia, which in turn are fundamental elements of poverty reduction and equitable growth in
an agrarian economy. The on-the-ground results and lessons provided by the implementation of
SLMP-1 have been invaluable for the enhancement and expansion of GOE’s SLM Program,
including the design of the recently approved SLMP 2. Through training and capacity building at

                                                9
all levels, the project has also made a major contribution to the development of sound public
sector intervention strategies for NRM in rural areas.
49.    Consistent with OPCS Guidelines, the achievements by Objective/Component are broken
down in order to separately assess the two statements which comprise the PDO/GEO in the PAD.
Achievements are described under two Objectives as follows (additional details are provided in
Annex 2):
Objective 1: Provide assistance to smallholder farmers to adopt SLM practices to reverse
land degradation in agricultural landscapes (Substantially achieved)
In addition: Global Environmental Objective: Reduce land degradation leading to
restoration of ecosystem functions and diversity (Substantially achieved)
50.     SLMP-1 has made a substantial contribution to the improvement of NRM in Ethiopia’s
rural areas by supporting community-driven planning and implementation of 45 participatory
Watershed Management Plans which integrated a comprehensive set of soil and water
conservation measures in communal hillsides and individual farmland, implemented by the
communities themselves.
51.     Component 1 (Watershed Management) was the major element of the SLM initiative
that directly resulted in the reduction of land degradation, enhancement of land productivity, and
improvement of livelihoods and the overall biophysical environment. Achievement of objectives
was positively measured by three indicators: changes in vegetation cover; increase in soil carbon;
and area treated with SLM practices.
52.     The total area of the 45 selected watersheds 1 was 450,525 ha, of which the net area
targeted for project interventions was 211,000 ha. By project completion, a total of 209,926 ha,
or 99% of the target, were effectively covered by project interventions. In terms of beneficiaries,
an estimated 84,500 households located in the project area, representing over 400,000 people (or
80% of the target), benefitted from project interventions.
53.     Implementation progress during the initial years was low (13.5% progress by Year 2),
given the justified need to conduct the diagnostic work and prepare the large watershed (and
micro-watershed) plans, as well as providing the necessary training and institutional capacity
building required to engage all relevant stakeholders (central, regional and local institutions, and
communities), many of whom were engaging in new ideas and techniques. A total of 613
community-based micro-watershed management plans were prepared. As a result, over 60% of
field-level interventions were concentrated in the last two years of the project (see Table in
Annex 2).
54.     This implementation lag does not allow for fully determining the overall outcomes at
project closing (mainly due to the long-term nature of the biophysical measures promoted).
However, the information collected from the earlier-implemented watersheds—through progress
reports, beneficiary surveys, field visits and the Borrower Completion Report (BCR)—clearly
suggests that project interventions generated significant positive outcomes, both in terms of the
dramatic improvement in the conservation of natural resources and the consequent enhancement

woredas are 52 as indicated in the map at the end of this document.

of the livelihoods of beneficiary communities. Despite the institutional and operational
difficulties encountered, the areas assisted by the project benefited from a sound intervention
strategy and a coherent participatory planning process, that resulted in the implementation of a
comprehensive set of soil and water management practices (a total of 39 different measures were
applied), in accordance with the Government’s Community-Based Participatory Watershed
Development Guidelines (CBPWDG) developed in 2005.
55.     Following the design of the micro-watershed investment plans, the project supported the
implementation of a set of biophysical measures adapted to the individual features and
constraints of each area. Such measures were mainly aimed at (i) reducing the erosive effects of
rainfall; (ii) rehabilitating or protecting the vegetative cover of highly degraded hillsides (iii)
controlling the expansion of gullies; and (iv) providing complementary basic and productive
infrastructure (feeder roads, potable water, conservation-based water harvesting) and support to
income-generating activities.
56.    The combined effect of these measures has not only reduced land degradation, but has
also contributed to increasing the overall moisture content in the entire landscape, and preventing
seasonal and recurrent downstream water-related damage to farmland and households.
57.     Two specific surveys provide quantitative evidence of the results achieved in terms of
PDO and GEO. In terms of hillside rehabilitation, a study to determine the vegetation cover
(using the NDVI methodology2), showed an increase of 9.1% in the intervention areas over the
period 2009-2013 suggesting that gradual plant regeneration and consequent reduction of land
degradation has occurred as a result of the project. In addition, a study conducted to measure the
change in carbon content of soils in 15 project supported watersheds showed that during the
period 2009-2013, the average carbon content in sampled soils increased from 1.87% to 2.45%
providing an indication of the overall improvement in soil conditions. The positive trends and
correlations in NDVI and soil carbon content values suggest that SLM practices applied on
farmlands and communal areas have positively improved the ecological functions and
agricultural productivity potential throughout the targeted landscapes (i.e., the large watersheds).
58.     Moisture content increases due to improved infiltration allowed for the gradual the
recharge of springs and underground water storage, allowing for improved availability of water
for both human and animal uses, improvement of biodiversity resources, and for the production
of homestead fruits and vegetables. Improved water availability and resilience to water-related
disasters were both major contributors to the overall enhancement of the livelihood perspectives
and quality of life of beneficiary communities. A summary of areas within communal lands
benefitting from various project interventions is provided in Annex 2.
Objective 2: Reduce land degradation to improve agricultural productivity of smallholder
farmers (Partially Achieved)
59.      Identification and construction of community infrastructure consisted of a number of
activities that have been implemented in SLM implementing watersheds and micro-watersheds.
Most of those activities can be categorized under four main headings, namely: expansion of

                                                       11
small scale irrigation (2,719 ha), water point construction (308 new points), community feeder
roads construction and maintenance (1,464 Km), and surface water harvesting systems (2,784).
60.     Although relatively limited in scope, interventions in small-scale community-based
infrastructure such as water harvesting systems, feeder roads and drinking water supply points
have generally improved access to social services, transportation facilities, and community
relations. Besides the development of income generation schemes, construction and assistance
given to maintain community infrastructure, have contributed to build community confidence to
effectively and enthusiastically participate in integrated biophysical measures on individual
farmlands and communal areas.
61.     Complementing the activities conducted at the communal level, the project also provided
support to improved soil and water management at the farm and household level, covering
95,000 ha of farmland and 36,450 households respectively. Although similarly limited in
coverage, in those areas where the integrated package of measures was applied, there are clear
indications of the potentially sustainable outcomes in the overall environmental and productive
development of the communities.
62.     An important element of the SLM strategy followed by the project was to reduce the
negative impact of livestock overgrazing in communal hillside areas. Despite the limited
coverage of these interventions (around 20% of the total project area), the outcomes have been
significantly positive, as the adoption of enclosures, and the complementary support to
alternative and improved livestock feeding systems, has contributed both to the stabilization and
recovery of hillsides (including biodiversity), as well as to the improvement of livestock
productivity. In most areas however, overstocking and carrying capacity limitations seem to
continue to pose severe limitations to achieving a sustainable landscape production system.
63.     Additional income generation activities were later added under the Watershed
Management component, primarily aimed at promoting the establishment of natural resource
related business opportunities by landless youth and women groups. The total number of direct
beneficiaries from this successful initiative reached 16,819 households of which an estimated
40% were female. Of those who were trained, 14,823 beneficiaries (88%) also received financial
and material support.
Component 2 - Land Certification and Administration
64.     The project issued second level certificates 3 to 59,999 households, or about 8.5% of the
original target (and 86% of the revised target after the restructuring). The significantly below
target result is due to several factors, but mainly that the original target 700,000 households was
unrealistic and highly overestimated the level of existing technical knowledge and institutional
capacity for implementation at the federal, regional and local level. The Directorate of Land
Administration was only established one year after the project implementation had begun. In
addition, there was no clarity on the most appropriate cadastral approach and survey
methodology to be adopted, resulting in significant discrepancies among regions and often
delays, higher costs, and lack of accuracy. Also, the focus of the first 3 years of implementation


3
  Ethiopia adopted a two-level certification process: (a) first-level certification, which captured information on rights
but provided very limited spatial information (the names of people with rights on adjacent land and an estimate of
the parcel areas), and (b) second-level certification, which surveyed parcel boundaries and produced cadastral maps.


                                                          12
was on completing first level certification and building the necessary capacity at all institutional
levels. However, during the last two years of implementation, when the mentioned shortcomings
became apparent, the focus was shifted towards activities aimed at second level certification. In
addition to the second-level certificates, the project also supported the titling of 5,079 parcels of
communal lands, an important requirement for the implementation of hillside rehabilitation
measures, and the pre-certification survey of almost 230,000 parcels.
65.      Despite the underperformance in terms of target achievement, the project had a positive
impact in that it put in place the building blocks for improved land tenure security. Specifically,
the project supported rural land certification trials, utilizing different technologies and
methodologies 4 , which led to an agreement on a common, cost-effective approach and
methodology for second level certification, which is in line with international best practices, and
will be applied in the implementation of SLMP 2. Reaching such consensus is a major
achievement towards a sound land administration system which has been shown to be a key for
higher adoption of SLM practices at the farm level. Furthermore, the project: (i) significantly
improved knowledge and strengthened capacity for rural land registration and land
administration more broadly at all levels, particularly through training and knowledge exchange
visits for experts and decision makers; and (ii) increased awareness at regional and local level on
the importance of land administration.
Component 3 - Project Management
66.       This component made indirect but valuable contributions to the achievement of the PDO
and GEO. The PSU provided considerable support to the effective and efficient implementation
of the Watershed Management component by enhancing the technical quality at the regional,
local and community levels. The component has been the major technical ingredient of the
project which facilitated the development of participatory and integrated watershed management
plans at sub-watershed levels in all SLM implementing regions. Activities such as watershed
planning, collecting and compiling sub-watershed plans, delineating critical and sub-watershed
boundaries using GPS and topographic maps were satisfactorily supported through the assistance
of regional coordinators, and the management and staff of the PSU (comprised of a blend of
specialists recruited by both the Bank and KfW/GIZ. The PSU also played a key role in
developing and implementing the project’s comprehensive SLM training and awareness
activities, mainly for regional and local level authorities and staff, and to support the
establishment and operation of the Watershed Committees at the village level.
67.    The M&E system, originally expected to support the project and the broader SLM
program, has not reached satisfactory functionality and its products and inputs have not been
adequately and regularly generated or utilized. The PSU’s Annual Progress Reports are detailed
and provide a good indication of progress against annual targets but were not methodically
prepared due to the problems in decentralized data generation and aggregation. However, the
PSU provided training on web-based services; published manuals and other tools that are now

  Trials were conducted using orthophotos based on aerial photography and satellite imagery in Oromia, SNNP,

provided by the Government of Finland (REILA). Following the trials, field and office production procedures were
developed and agreed both at the federal and regional level.

Guidelines, the EthioCAT book, SLM Newsletters, brochures and posters); and developed the
website for the broader SLM Program.
68.    Project costs and financing: Total original project costs were estimated at US$37.8
million, comprising US$20 million of IDA grant, US$9 million GEF grant funds and GoE
counterpart funds totaling US$8.7 million. Actual total project costs were reduced to US$29.16,
due to undisbursed balances at project closing (US$1.2 million from IDA and US$80,000 from
GEF), as well as a considerable reduction in the amount recorded as counterpart financing
(US$2.7 million, equivalent to 31% of the original commitment). Additional information is
provided in the FM section and in Annexes 1 and 2. In terms of financing by component, the
Table below summarizes the planned allocations and actual disbursements by component.

US$19.3 million.
3.3 Efficiency
69.     Analysis conducted during preparation suggested that the proposed interventions were
economically and financially feasible. The borrower’s completion report and this economic
analysis provide evidence that the project had significant returns. This analysis focused on the
readily quantifiable benefit streams. Where available, project-based data was used, and
supplemented that with market information and literature values, where needed. The results show
that even with the most conservative estimates and only a portion of the benefits quantified, the
project benefits exceed the costs. With more generous prices and discount rate assumptions, the
benefits exceed the costs substantially.
70.     There are at least eight categories of benefits associated with the project, of which half
can be readily quantified and the rest can be analyzed qualitatively. Soil retention provides
benefits both on site in terms of soil quality and off site in terms of reduced erosion; it can be
measured in terms of land savings or erosion prevention. Carbon sequestration in soil can be
estimated from measures provided in the Borrower’s report. Increased vegetation cover also
helps to prevent erosion and improves downstream water quality and is measured as NDVI.
Farmer incomes are another category of direct benefits, measured through yield increases in
agricultural areas immediately downstream of the intervention areas. Benefits from improved
water management include increased soil moisture and reduced variability in terms of
flood/drought conditions.
71.     The cost benefit analysis was conducted for 25 years with a discount rate of 10% (with a
7% rate included for comparison). Modeling results reported in earlier SLMP documentation
estimated erosion prevention at 52 tons per ha per year, applied in an area of 60,000 hectares,
which was the area of intensive project intervention. The soil carbon figure, a 1% incremental
change in soil carbon, is drawn from the borrower’s completion report and valued

    conservatively. NDVI and soil retention figures rely on average prices for land, soil and farmer
    incomes before project interventions.

value of nearly US$30 million using the assumptions indicated above and in the table. Using the
higher range assumptions of impact in a wider area, these benefits double to nearly US$60
million. Using a less conservative discount rate of 7% would bring the benefit estimate in the
high case scenario to over US$75 million. At the low end, the IRR is calculated as 10.4% and the
high end range is 22.6%. Soil retention benefits account for about 33% of the benefits stream,
carbon sequestration about 41%, vegetation cover about 5% and farmer incomes about 20%. Of
course, all these benefits leave out the value of water retention, water quality, biodiversity,
resilience building and risk reduction.
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome and Global Environment Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
73.     Overall, the SLM-1 Project demonstrated satisfactory levels of achievement with respect
to the PDO, GEO, and the performance indicators related to the soil and water management
activities in the targeted watersheds. In addition, the PDO and GEO remain relevant to the
natural resource management practices of MoA, as well as within broader national regional and
local policies and priorities. Through the new lending operation (SLMP-2), and the renewed
support of other development partners, continuity and continued coordination should promote
further mainstreaming of practices and objectives supported the project. Financially, at project
closing (without extension) nearly all funds were disbursed from both financing sources (93%
IDA, and 99% GEF). The project also shows efficiency judged by its positive direct and indirect
economic and environmental benefits and sustainability of objectives through participatory
demand-driven design, cost-sharing with beneficiaries, and contribution to the design of the
SLM-2 project.
74.     Despite this, the project has also experienced several shortcomings (either related to
design or implementation) that affect the overall assessment of outcomes. Main deficiencies
include (i) the high concentration of activities implemented in the last two years of the project,
limiting the measurable outcomes in a significant proportion of the project area; (ii) the
proportionally reduced coverage of interventions related to farmland and homestead
development; (iii) relatively low levels of land certification compared to initial targets (but
substantial compared to the revised target late in project life), and (iv) the inadequacy of the
M&E system, both in terms of baseline, indicators and targets, as well as the major limitations in
the collection and processing of data.
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
   (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
75.     As stipulated in the Result-Based M & E System, the SLM-1 project has been gender
sensitive, and consciously focused on ensuring that women participate in the project and that
benefits accruing from carrying out project related activities are equitably and fairly distributed
between men and women. Although women’s membership in terms of institutional platforms
such as committees, user groups and associations is proportionally lower than the male
participation rate, SLMP-1 has made a significant impact to women through the issuance of first
level land certificates. The certification enabled women to acquire equal rights to landholdings
since land certificates bear rights for both husband and wife. As a result, the share of women in
the Land Registration and Administration component of SLMP-1 has been 41.6%.

                                                16
76.     Components 1 and 2 have created opportunities for female-headed households. In
particular, women’s participation in watershed development appears to be relatively higher than
in other regular local development programs. Their involvement in watershed development has
been significant in the form of labor contribution to physical and biological conservation, raising
seedlings, involvement in trainings, awareness raising, benefiting from income generation
opportunities, appropriate management of livestock, and homestead development.
77.     The introduction of income generating opportunities promoted the establishment and
profitability of natural resource related productive activities, and enhanced farmers’ confidence
on the various conservation measures practiced on individual farmlands and communal grazing
areas. This included assistance for the establishment and operation of user groups (mainly
unemployed youth and females) to engage in protection and utilization of communal cropping
areas resulting from terrace construction. Although the number of beneficiaries was relatively
low, it was nevertheless a successful practice worth replicating.
78.    SLMP-1 also provided livelihood improvement opportunities to youth by offering
advantages, particularly in setting up user-groups and becoming beneficiaries of employment and
gaining skills in the fields such as cadastral surveying, land registration and natural-resource
based income generation.
79.     HIV/AIDS and reproductive health mainstreaming have earned due attention, particularly
at the Woreda, Kebele and community levels. Awareness creation has been incorporated into a
number of training activities conducted at community level. The project also assisted in the
distribution of training and awareness creation materials in SLM watersheds. About 161
Woredas undertook HIV/AIDS mainstreaming in SLM project areas.
   (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
80.     The project was responsible for providing a comprehensive training and capacity building
program that substantially contributed to improving technical knowledge and raising awareness
on the importance and benefits of SLM, both within public institutions at the regional and district
level, as well as in beneficiary communities and farmer organizations. This major effort, led by
the PSU with strong support by the technical assistance provided by GIZ, has been successful in
terms of mainstreaming the environmental implications of applying sound soil and water
management practices as part of the sustainable productive use of resources in small watersheds
landscapes.
81.     Despite this, one of the prevailing institutional challenges faced by the project was the
persistent turnover of staff, particularly at the Woreda level. Frequent transfer/change of focal
persons and Development Agents (DA) affected field work and the quality and timeliness of
implementation reports; and generated technical gaps in almost all regions. In addition to
internal administrative reassignment of staff, self-motivation of focal persons and DAs were
reportedly low in account of low remuneration rates and absence of top-up payments for works
performed in lieu of the SLM project. Despite the project’s attempt to address the bottleneck
through providing incentives, the problem has not been resolved due to lack of harmonization of
remuneration among different decentralized projects and programs (the majority with donor
financing) as well as lack of support by the regional authorities.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
N/A

4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome and Global Environment Outcome
Rating: Moderate
82.     The project, by supporting the initial years of GoE’s flagship SLM Program has made a
major contribution to mainstream soil and water management as a key element of the sustainable
development of rural areas. As a result, community-based land a water management has been
introduced in a substantial portion of the country’s agricultural areas, technical and institutional
capacity has been strengthened and awareness has been raised at government levels and within
the communities. Moreover, GoE’s decision to promote community mobilization for expansion
of SLM interventions most likely will contribute to sustain SLM activities. However, in the
absence of continued technical and financial support by development partners, including the
Bank’s recently approved SLMP-2, the risk of stagnation of the program and potential
deterioration of project interventions would be substantial, given the demands for investments in
O&M of small irrigation infrastructure, terraces, and feeder roads, the need for technical capacity
to develop the Watershed Management Plans in new areas and update existing plans, and the
fact that more work is needed at the farm and household level to achieve the potential
productivity gains and higher income levels resulting from increased water availability and
reduced landscape degradation (mainly livestock management and cropping techniques).
83.     Similarly, a number of structural and operational issues should be addressed by GoE to
reduce the risk to long-term achievement of the project development outcomes, including
structural/policy issues such as population pressure, climate change vulnerability, regional staff
turnover, institutional mainstreaming, and work norm harmonization, as well as operational
issues related to adequate, functional and consolidated M&E, and weak procurement, accounting
and auditing at sub-national levels.
5.    Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
84.    The Bank provided adequate support to the design of the project and the development of
the implementation strategy. Preparation was responsive to Government needs and priorities,
took into consideration the valuable experiences from predecessor initiatives (WFP, USAID,
GIZ), and fully adopted the Community Based Participatory Watershed Management Guidelines
(January 2005) as the key technical and operational basis for the design of watershed-based SLM
interventions. On the other hand, the Bank could have performed a better role regarding the
assessment of implementation readiness (i.e., Preparation of Watershed Management Plans), the
technical rationale for the Land Certification Component, the assessment of technical assistance
requirements and availability, and the development of the indicators and targets for the Results
Framework, as well as the arrangement for monitoring of results.


                                                18
(b) Quality of Supervision (including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
85.     The Bank complied with its fiduciary responsibilities by conducting regular supervision
missions, which were further enhanced by including other development partners supporting the
Government’s broader SLM Program. The partnership work contributed to convening and
aligning financing and knowledge among partners and stakeholders, strengthening the overall
policy and investment dialogue. The supervision team also contributed to the overall Bank’s role
in promoting SLM in the Africa Region, by providing regular reporting and feedback. With the
TTL and fiduciary staff based in the country office, procurement and FM reviews, and meetings
with the PSU were routinely conducted, providing constructive support to MoA and the PSU. In
general, as documented in Aide Memoires and ISRs, the Bank team adequately identified most
issues affecting implementation (M&E deficiencies, lagging land certification progress, staff
turnover etc.), and dedicated considerable supervision resources to providing field support to
MoA and local governments efforts to develop and implement the watershed-level investments.
In some instances however, the intense field work affected the speed of follow-up actions, in
particular on the project’s M&E, environmental audits, and restructuring (additional details on
the restructuring process are provided in Section 2.2).
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
86.    The Bank provided valuable support to GOE prior to and during project preparation and
was effective in promoting the adoption of previously successful experiences within Ethiopia and
other countries. Similarly, the Bank subsequently made considerable efforts to provide much-
needed guidance during supervision, and promote the results of the project within the Africa
Region. Regardless of the commendable and relevant results achieved by the main component of
the project, the overall Bank performance was affected by insufficient attention to key design
elements during preparation, and the frequent delays in addressing implementation constraints
and complying with some important due diligence requirements during supervision.
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
87.     The broader, multi-donor SLM Program is one of the flagship programs of the Ethiopian
Government. As a major part of this program, SLMP-1 received adequate attention and
dedication by the relevant authorities. In addition, the priority given by the Government to SLM
is demonstrated by the number of additional development partners participating in the program.
The creation of the Directorate for Land Administration in 2010, and the strong political support
transmitted by the central authorities from MoA to de regional, district and level are relevant
GoE contributions. Despite this, and largely due to the decentralized nature of the project, GoE
was unable to resolve some of the administrative bottlenecks experienced by the project, such as
the high staff turnover, or to provide the full counterpart contribution agreed at negotiations.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
88.    MoA, through the PSU, has adequately met its responsibilities as the central body of the
National SLM Program Support. With strong support from technical assistance provided by GIZ

                                               19
at the central and in selected regions, the PSU has coordinated, reported, and supervised the
implementation of the project in all SLM implementing regions. It followed relevant
government policies and the guidelines provided in the project’s core documents (the PIM, PAD
and CBPWDG); reviewed and approved annual work plans and budget; worked towards
ensuring the achievement of planned outputs by facilitating conditions adherent to the project
objectives; monitored progress of the project; and, mainly through the decentralized regional
coordinators, provided guidance and advice to local authorities, institutions and beneficiary
communities.
89.    In the context of a complex and decentralized institutional setting, the PSU appears to
have been overloaded as a result of insufficient number of staff to perform certain tasks such as
coordination, M&E, compilation and consolidation of reports, procurement and financial
management. Moreover, institutional requirements linked to the nature of SLM as a flagship
programs, and the relationships with donors and development partners have contributed to heavy
workloads. Unfortunately, despite intense training and capacity building efforts, key elements of
the performance of the PSU have been adversely affected by the problems of quality,
performance and delays created at the regional and local levels.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
90.     Overall client is rated moderately satisfactory, mostly related to public sector procedures
that affected key aspects of project implementation, including budget allocations, delayed
procurement processes, recurrent staff turnovers, and procedural discrepancies between central
and local institutions. However, within MoA’s mandate, the experience of SLMP-1 has been
fully internalized and actions were identified to minimize the impact of these shortcomings
during the implementation of SLMP-2.
6.   Lessons Learned
91.     Establishing and scaling up SLM can be facilitated by putting in place a programmatic
approach that can deliver multiple benefits downstream despite upstream transaction costs
associated with convening and aligning financing, experiences and approaches among partners
and stakeholders. Such joint approaches strengthen the overall policy and investment dialogue
and coordination. For this, analytical support addressing technical and institutional elements
prior to project preparation can play a very significant role.
92.      SLM should be considered as an integral part of rural development strategies that can
deliver livelihood opportunities and improving environmental security. Ethiopia has shown that
efforts to improve land quality and protect natural resources are important components of climate
resilient, low carbon economic growth.
93.     The demand-driven bottom-up approach adopted under SLMP-1 is relevant for natural
resources management and local development in Ethiopia’s rural space. This development
approach, with active community participation in determining priorities and in project
identification, planning, development and implementation has contributed to generate ownership
by both beneficiary communities and local authorities. SLMP-1 outputs are essential to build
community confidence and enhanced community participation.




                                                20
94.     Similarly, it is important to provide enhanced support in technical design and
implementation and O&M of subprojects involving road improvements and small irrigation, as
well as structural and vegetative land management practices.
95.     The need to build sustainable institutions at the local level is equally important since they
are crucial for delivery of service and attainment of project objectives. SLMP-1 showed that
where local level implementation structures were established and sustained through technical
assistance, targeted capacity building and reward and incentive schemes, implementation of
project activities was more effective in terms of quantity and quality.
96.      Implementation of the project was initially constrained by inadequate M&E capacity and
poor financial management and procurement capacity at the Woreda level coupled with a high
staff turnover. Having an effective and comprehensive M&E system in place early in the life of
the project is essential for adequate assessment of project progress and assistance to management
to monitor achievement of objectives and to help harmonize stakeholder and development
partner efforts.
97.    The experience of SLMP-1 highlights the importance of enhanced recruitment
procedures, appropriate incentive mechanism (working conditions, training, etc.) and
harmonization of salaries and benefits among Woreda staff working on different projects.
98.     Provided strong community engagement and commitment are achieved, area closures
have proven effective mechanisms for environmental rehabilitation, climate-resilience and
reclamation of biodiversity. For this, community by-laws play a decisive role in consolidating
the rehabilitation of communal lands.
99.    Regarding environmental safeguards, given that the Bank’s continued support to the SLM
Program will involve the construction of infrastructure, such as small scale irrigation, it is highly
recommended to follow a systematic approach in the implementation of environmental
safeguards. On Social safeguards, there is the need to provide special arrangements to support
underserved and vulnerable groups, including careful planning and management of gender
dimensions.
100. To maximize dissemination (both within Ethiopia and the Africa Region), visibility and
perception of project actions and results, the implementation of SLMP-1 demonstrated the
importance of including, within the structure of the MoA, a knowledge management and
communications team staffed by specialized professionals.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component


Component 1: Watershed Management

Sub-component 1.1: Capacity building

1.      During the five years of implementation, 18 types of activities had been implemented
under this sub-component in the following major categories: a) Establishment of Woreda
Steering Committee (WSC) and Woreda Technical Committee (WTC); b) Awareness raising;
Technical trainings and experience sharing; c) Assisting the undertaking of ESMF; d)
Establishment and mentoring of Rural Financial Groups (RFGs); and e) Supporting Farmer
Training Centers (FTCs).

2.      Among other things, the institutional and technical capacity enhancement realized
through implementing the planned activities has enabled the project Woredas to prepare and
make ready 85 local level land use plans and 613 community-based watershed management
plans at the micro-watershed level. The relevant activities incorporated in most of the plans had
been screened by ESMF tools.

3.     The summary of major activities under the sub-component showed an overall
accomplishment of 94% of the plan to strengthen the institutional and technical capacity for
implementing SLM at regional, Woreda and community levels. Of those activities, remarkable
performance was achieved in the establishment of watershed committees and teams (WTC, WSC
and KWT), and awareness creation and technical trainings (for details see Table 2.1).

Sub-component 1.2: Communal land and gully rehabilitation

4.      Under this sub-component, seven major activities were implemented, including: a)
Treating or rehabilitating communal lands/grazing, gullies and hillsides/with appropriate bio-
physical measures and technologies; b) Construction of terraces (soil bund, stone bund, stone
fenced soil bund, stone faced trench bund, fanya-juu) on communal land; c) Gully treatment; d)
Applying by-laws agreed and approved by the community to govern the management and use of
communal lands including grazing lands at the Community or sub-watersheds level; e) Obtaining
legal acceptance by Justice office to the community-approved bylaws that govern the
management and use of communal lands including grazing lands; f) Follow up and assist
activities on communal land and gullies in sub watersheds; and g) Support start-up technology
production and supply to SLM service providers for multiplication.

5.       Of these activities, the performance of bio-physical measures on grazing lands, gullies
and hillsides was higher, followed by construction of physical measures on degraded hillsides.
Physical treatment on aggressive gullies was lower due to terrain difficulties demanding more
complex technologies and approaches. In addition, shortage of materials for treatment at the
current level of technology and technical capacity has limited the scale of accomplishments in
biological measures on degraded hillsides. Limited awareness of the existing policies, structural
weaknesses in the practical application of by-laws and limited knowledge to protect ecologically
critical habitats such as stream banks and wetlands were barriers in some intervention areas.
                                               23
Sub-component 1.3: Farmland and homestead development

6.      The reports of project regions show that this sub-component consists of about 45
different measures or activities, which remains the largest sub-component under the Watershed
Management Component. The various measures/activities carried out include
        (i) Treating farmland and backyards with appropriate physical measures such as fanya-
             juu, soil-bund, stone bund, stone faced soil bund, Water-way cut-off-drain, trench;
             and biological measures that include planting forage trees and grass on bunds, grass-
             hedge establishment, planting of multipurpose perennial trees, shrubs and grasses;
        (ii) Construction of physical structures on farmland and backyards;
        (iii)Biological measures on farmland ;
        (iv) Promoting high value crops (fruits, vegetables and spices) at homestead/ farmland;
        (v) soil fertility management practices;
        (vi) Conduct pilot productivity enhancement practices and techniques on vertisol and
             acidic soils; and
        (vii) Promoting the adoption of modern beehives.

7.     The summary report of the project regions indicated an overall accomplishment of 66%,
in which promotion of high value crops, productivity enhancement on vertisol and treatment of
farmland and backyards were accomplished in higher percent of achievement. This indicates the
extent to which the implementation of SLM activities had focused on enhancement of land
productivity and production on the larger part of the areas under various agronomic activities.
Farmland and backyard treatment activities supported by the project contributed to improvement
of livelihood systems through ensuring food security for the beneficiaries living in SLM
intervention areas (see table 2.1)

8.     Most of the farmers in all project regions viewed that the various physical treatments
made on farmlands and backyards in the watershed and sub-watershed areas have significantly
minimized and/or stopped soil erosion and land degradation. Undertaking biological measures by
planting various multipurpose trees and grasses like elephant grass, local grass known as “Desho”
and Vetiver have strengthened soil stability on treated lands despite low performance in these
regards. On lands where soil treatment measures have been applied, good crop performance has
been observed and yields reportedly remained higher than before SLM intervention.

   Sub-component 1.4: Community infrastructure

9.     Identification and construction of community infrastructures consisted of a number of
sub-activities that have been implemented in SLM implementing watersheds and micro-
watersheds. Most of those sub-activities are categorized under four main headings, namely:
expansion of small scale irrigation, water point construction, community feeder roads
construction, and surface water systems construction.

10.      Expansion of small scale irrigation is the largest engagement that has been carried out
under the infrastructure sub-component. It involved provision of irrigation infrastructure,
trainings on the management and application of the systems, and support to maintenance of the
facilities provided in areas where such systems have been installed. The following list describes

                                               24
the various elements of community infrastructure that have been identified and constructed
during the five years of SLM implementation.

   a. Assisting expansion of small scale irrigated land involving construction of small scale
      irrigation diversion canals; maintenance of small scale irrigation; construction of
      diversion weir; provision of water lifting technologies (motor pump, treadle pump and
      family drip kits); spring development, small gabion check-dam pond and hand-dug well
      developed for irrigation; assisting drip irrigation practice; and assisting rope pump
      adoption.
   b. Community-agreed potable water points construction i.e. spring development and hand-
      dug wells.
   c. Community feeder roads construction and maintenance i.e. road construction and road
      maintenance; ford construction; bridge/culvert construction; store construction for
      nursery; and specialized training-of-trainers on water harvesting, infrastructural
      development, waterways, cut-off drains, gully and terraces.
   d. Construction of surface water harvesting systems construction such as micro pond , farm
      pond , percolation pit , and percolation pond .

11.     The tables below provide a summarized consolidation of activities supported by
Component 1, as well as basic information of each watershed assisted by the project and a
detailed breakdown of the investments and activities conducted.

            Component 2: Rural Land Certification and Administration

            12.      The objective of this component was to expand the coverage and enhance the
            government’s land certification program, with the aim of strengthening land tenure security for
            smallholder farmers. Accordingly, assistance under this component aimed to rectify the
            weaknesses in level 1 certification process identified in various reviews, emphasizing on the
            need to geo-reference and map individual parcels to avoid or minimize boundary disputes. In
            these regards, SLM was designed to specifically finance training, equipment, and technical
            assistance to upgrade the organizational, technical, and managerial capacity of existing
            institutions and units responsible for land administration at the federal, regional and Woreda
            levels and the judiciary.

            13.     Performance recorded in Land Registration and Administration reaches 83% of the
            regional plans, basically involving outputs such as: completion of first level rural land
            certification; issuance of second level certificates for rural land holding;
            development/preparation of local land use plan; enhancement of institutional capacity for rural
            land registration and administration awareness raising training and experience sharing events on
            land administration for beneficiary communities; and awareness raising training and experience
            sharing events on land administration to DAs and experts (see Table 2.2).

            14.    Achievement in the impact of land registration and administration could be explained by
            the number of farmer households who got land certificates issued with geo-referenced maps
            (59,999 HHs) and by the number of certified farmers who had positive sense of tenure security
            after certification (98% of interviewed farmers responded positively) and by the total
            accomplishment of the Land Registration and Administration component years which reached
            83% of the regional planned targets.

Component 3: Project management

15.     The Project management component contributes to ensuring the adherence of SLM
project to government policy of end users’ full participation in project implementation; strives to
involve the target population in the development of the proposed project and works towards
ensuring that they are fully consulted throughout the project particularly at the planning,
implementation and operation stages.

16.     The overall project management and coordination responsibility was under the MoA
which has been working through the existing institutional mechanisms for the coordination of
SLM programs comprising three major bodies, namely: the National SLM Steering Committee,
National SLM Technical Committee; and National SLM Support Unit. The National SLM
Support Unit or the Project Coordination Unit is located within the MoA and that of the regions
is within BoA of the participating regions. The regional coordination units have been responsible
for the day-to-day management of the SLM program implementation, including preparation of
annual work plans and progress reports, monitoring and supervising overall implementation
progress and evaluation of program impacts, financial administration and procuring goods and
services.

17.     The National SLM Support Unit provided administrative support to respective Steering
Committee and Technical Committees. A full time National Program Coordinator has been
appointed for the NPCU by MoA to oversee project implementation. At the regional level, a
regional SLM focal person/project coordinator has been appointed by the respective regional
BoA. The regional project coordinators were in charge of the overall coordination of the program
in their respective region. At the Woreda level, the Woreda Office of Agricultural carried out the
responsibility of project implementation in close collaboration with the regional focal person and
the SLM Kebeles under the Woreda.

18.     According to the regional reports summary, the level reached in the achievement of
Project Management Component has been 63.4%, which is relatively low. Achievements in staff
training and familiarizing in newly institutionalized policies, strategies and procedures; and
development of participatory and integrated watershed management plans at sub-watershed level
have been above average (86%) compared to the achievements recorded in other outputs of the
component.

Annex 3. Fiduciary Performance

Procurement
1.     Procurement activities under the SLMP project were streamlined within the Government
system and were carried out accordingly. At Federal level, pooled procurement of equipment
such as vehicles, motorcycles and other essential equipment to be supplied to the implementing
agencies at sub-national level is carried out. In the Federal Ministry of Agriculture the regional
Bureaus of Agriculture “Procurement, Finance and Property Administration Support Processes
(PFPASP)” had full control over the procurement processing and administration. The role of the
PSU was limited to planning, coordinating all the regional implementing agencies of the project
and placing requests to the PFPASP. Procurement decisions are made within the MOA and
BOAs. At Woreda level the Woreda Finance and Economic Development Offices carry out the
implementation of the procurement activities of the project based on the annual work plan and
purchase requests presented by the line sectoral offices at Woreda level.

2.     Delays in procurement of field equipment and supplies were a cause for slow
implementation during the initial stages of project implementation, but were gradually resolved
through intense Bank support and guidance, as well as procurement-specific training to
decentralized agencies.

Organization and Staffing:
3.     The project has a couple of procurement officers at Federal level and procurement
coordinators at Regional level. Otherwise it did not have procurement officers at Woreda level.
The procurement activities are by and large carried out by Government procurement staff which
is in most cases not familiar with the procurement process of Bank financed projects. Although
the project coordination office has provided capacity building training to staff at Woreda and
regional level, the high level of staff turnover within the Government structure has undermined
the capacity building efforts of the project.

Controls and Manuals:
4.     The SLM project has a procurement arrangement manual. However, the manual is not
widely distributed to implementing agencies and is not well understood and consulted by
procurement staff of implementing agencies in the procurement process. Moreover, the internal
as well as external procurement control system appears to be weak. Although there are audit
exercises which are carried out by internal as well as external entities, procurement aspects are
not considered in such audit exercises.

5.      Procurement record keeping varies from one implementing agencies to the other. In
general, however, procurement record keeping has been a major area of concern in almost all
implementing agencies of the SLMP-1. The most prominent problem regarding procurement
record keeping include: procurement records are not kept in one place – some files are kept with
the finance officer while the other files are kept with the procurement officer; in most cases one
cannot find complete procurement documentation; procurement files cannot be easily located
during procurement audit and procurement reviews; and procurement documents are not kept



                                               39
safely to avoid loss or unauthorized access to such documents. Procurement record keeping is
thus an area which requires major emphasis going forward.

Procurement Planning
6.      Procurement plans are prepared and obtain approval at Federal and Regional levels.
However, the regional procurement plans are not updated regularly. In most implementing
agencies of the project, particularly at Regional level, procurement plans are not used as
monitoring and management decision making tools. At woreda level most implementing
agencies do not prepare procurement plans. Although efforts have been made to introduce and
distribute simplified procurement plan templates to be used at Woreda level it is only limited
Woredas who have used such simplified forms for the preparation of procurement plans for their
respective Woredas. Lack of clarity on who is responsible for the preparation and follow-up of
procurement plans as well as lack of procurement proficient personnel at Woreda level has
resulted in a situation whereby procurement are carried out without plans at Woreda level under
SLMP.

Procurement Processing:
7.     At Federal and Regional level procurement processing is done at ICB and NCB level and
these are by and large carried out as per agreed procedures and using the Bank’s or national
SBDs.

8.      However, Woredas are normally allowed to carry out procurement activities which
should not exceed the threshold for shopping. Use of Request for Quotation is not practiced by
most of the implementing agencies for procuring goods under shopping method. For most of the
shopping contracts suppliers were invited by either distributing the purchase request or technical
specification to randomly selected suppliers/shops or by posting the purchase requirement on
notice boards. In general implementing agencies at Woreda level do not observe the minimum
level of documentation necessary to carry out shopping to procure goods and services.

9.      Evaluation has been a major area of concern during the implementation of the SLMP.
The bid and evaluation process in some implementing agencies was not in compliance with
agreed procedures. There were cases of use of two envelop system and also the use of merit
point system in the evaluation process.

Contract administration:
10.     In general there was no proper contract administration process applied in all contracts. In
the procurement of goods and services at woreda level in most cases no contracts were used.
Goods and services were delivered after considerable lapse of the delivery time. Yet upfront
payments are made to the least evaluated bidders without signing contract agreement. In the rest
of the contracts the contract agreements did not incorporate important contractual obligations of
both parties. Some payments to suppliers were not supported by written technical inspection
reports. In general contract administration appears to be a very weak link in the procurement
process under the project.




                                                40
Recommendations:
• Going forward there should be substantial improvement on procurement reporting under the
   forthcoming SLM project. In most cases it was impossible to obtain the procurement status
   of the FPCU and the Regions for review and analysis. There should be a system whereby the
   status of procurement is periodically reported by the regions to FPCU and the same is
   submitted to the Bank for its review.
• Regardless of the capacity building efforts and recommendations made to the PCU there does
   not seem to be an improvement in the preparation and utilization of procurement plans to
   guide the procurement process. In the forthcoming project the project should ensure that all
   procurement activities should be carried out with an approved procurement plan and
   procurement plans should be used as monitoring and management decision making tools by
   all implementing agencies of the project.
• Regardless of the capacity building effort made by providing procurement training to
   procurement staff in the Woredas there were some procedural errors in procurement
   processing at Woreda level. The FPCU should devise and put in place mechanisms to ensure
   that all implementing agencies are in compliance with agreed procedures in processing of the
   procurement of goods, works and services.
• Strengthening of the internal control and ensuring that procurement manuals of the project
   are widely disseminated and used by procurement staff of implementing agencies is critical
   to ensure compliance with agreed procedures;
• Going forward the FPCU should ensure that procurement staff at Regional level shall provide
   the necessary support and supervision to Regional procurement staff and the regional
   procurement staff shall in turn provide the necessary support to woreda level procurement
   staff to ensure compliance with agreed procedures and the smooth implementation of the
   project. To this effect the project should provide the necessary logistical support and means
   for mobility.

The objective of this report is to capture significant financial management issues affecting
project implementation and outcomes during the course of its implementation as lessons learnt
for later projects to be implemented in the sector.

12.     The project maintained, throughout the life of the project reasonably adequate FM system
which provides the necessary reasonable assurance that the reports being produced by the system
can be relied upon to monitor the project. Generally, the project complied with the requisite
financial covenants outlined in its legal agreement which included submission of quarterly IFRs
and annual audits except some delays. Recent IFR and audit report were not submitted with in
the due date. In addition counterpart funds were not being contributed in line with the
requirements stated in the PAD. The financial management risk ratings were mostly rated
Moderate but for some supervisions including the last supervision the risk has been rated
Substantial. Owing to this risk rating, the project was supervised by conducting field visit mostly
semi-annually (excluding quarterly IFR reviews, annual audit report reviews and normal
implementation supports). The key significant aspects the project encountered during
implementation from which future projects ought to learn are as follows:


III.      Lessons Learnt

13.       The key lessons learnt in this project from the financial management perspective include:

       • Strengthen the budgeting process: The project did not streamline its budgeting process
       to ensure timely budget preparation process and notification to the regions their final budget.
       Failure to align working budget to government budget (proclaimed vs. actual working
       budget) in timing as well as in the content was also another key lesson learnt. The need to
       improve budget monitoring and budget utilization was also another issue.

       • Staffing: High staff turnover at Woreda level had been observed. The Project had not its
       own accountants at Woredas. Government employees perform on SLMP in addition to other
       duties of the Woreda and there was a tendency, because of work load and non-existent of
       incentives, to neglect the SLMP activities and it was a challenge that affected the project.
       Mobile teams at region level were being implemented at the later stages of the project life in
       an effort to mitigate this risk and this should be strengthened. Federal level interventions to
       supervise and follow up regions and Woredas were not adequate and there needs to be
       strong emphasis on this area as well.

                                                   42
      • Accounting system: The project was using Peachtree accounting software. However, the
      software was not used to its maximum potential including reporting capabilities. Regions
      produce Interim Financial Reports (IFRs) on Excel Spreadsheet by taking data from the
      monthly reports of implementing Woredas and from the output of Peachtree software for the
      Project. This has to be improved to enable quick report generation including IFRs from the
      system. Woredas on the other hand applied manual accounting.

      • Strengthening the internal audit function: Internal audit oversight at all levels was very
      low and lack of internal audit oversight for the majority life of the project was observed.
      Internal audit units were also affected by staff turnover and they were severely affected by
      understaffing. Throughout its life, the project had been subject to a review by MoA’s
      internal audit directorate for the first time for the first half of the EFY 2005 (2012/13). The
      internal audit function should be strengthened as conducting regular internal audits adds
      value to a system in addressing weaknesses on a real time basis and ensuring that risk
      aspects are promptly dealt with when they arise.

      • Internal control issues: The size of advances and regional liquidation of balances
      transferred to regions was a persistent concern that was challenging for the better part of the
      project life. Other main issue was property management and controls around properties for
      which inadequate attention was accorded to.

      • External Audit: Audit reports were relatively on time but qualified opinions were issued
      by the auditors. On the other hand recent audit was unqualified but received after the due
      date. For instance, the current audit that is for the year ended July 7, 2013 has been
      submitted to the Bank on February 14, 2014 which was a delay of about a month from the
      deadline. Management letters raised a number of internal control issues that need attention
      but were usually resolved. The last audit of the project is under review.

IV.      Appraisal

14.     The main strengths identified during the appraisal include the Government’s discipline in
executing budget and compliance with the existing government regulations; a good internal
control system, including regular post audits by the Internal Audit Departments of the
government agencies; Presence of adequately qualified and experienced accounting personnel at
the federal level, and most have been trained in Bank’s Financial Management and Disbursement
Guidelines; experience in managing other IDA projects and presence of internal controls, an
internal audit function, a computerized accounting system, and budgeting arrangements in place;
oversight role of the National and Regional Project Steering Committees to ensuring audit issues
raised in the internal and external audit reports are addressed by the project management. The
main challenge noted were inadequate qualified accountants at regional and Woreda level to
support the project operations. A major challenge facing the project and government as a whole
was retention of skilled staff; staff turnover at the regions and Woreda level due to low pay and
remote location; delay in submission of IFRs and project audits and project audit may take time
to complete as implementing agencies are spread throughout the country. At appraisal, both the


                                                 43
overall inherent risk and the overall control risk were rated Substantial before and Moderate after
taking into account the risk mitigating measures.

    V.   Implementation support missions
15.      Throughout the project’s life, FM supervision missions were undertaken as per Bank
policies 5 to ensure that the FM arrangements remained acceptable to the Bank. The missions on
the overall focused on assessing the status and adequacy of the project’s financial management
arrangements. The objective of the assessments was to determine whether the implementing
entity’s financial management arrangements continue to be adequate with the objective of
ensuring that: (i) the project funds were used only for the intended purposes in an efficient and
economical way; (ii) the preparation of accurate, reliable and timely periodic financial reports;
(iii) the compliance with the legal covenants related to financial management and (iii) safeguard
the entities’ assets.

16.     Based on the overall supervision missions conducted during the life of the project, the
overall FM Implementation Status and Results (FM ISR) rating of the project was rated as
Moderately Satisfactory for the better part of the life of the Project including recent ones. Both
the residual inherent and control risks were rated as Moderate for the most part of the project life.
The overall residual risk was also mostly rated as Moderate. As at the close of the project the
control risk and the overall project risk ware rated to be Substantial and the FM ISR rating of the
project was rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

17.     The FM supervision missions focuses on the areas of budgeting, accounting, fund flow,
internal control, financial reporting and external audit. Based on the implementation support
missions conducted, the following were observed as challenges and strengths of the project on
the key FM aspects (areas) mentioned above.

         a.      Budgeting: Budgeting approval process generally followed government
         procedures and was participatory. However, the project did not aim to stream line its
         budgeting process to ensure timely budget preparation process and notification to the
         regions their final budget. There was also difficulty to align annual working budget to
         government budget (proclaimed vs. actual working budget) in timing as well as in the
         content. Regarding budget monitoring, there were challenges for the better life of the
         Project. Woredas were not conducting proper variance analysis as they were considering
         cash transfers as budget and regions were not providing justification for variances even
         though they monitor on a quarterly basis budget and actual expenditures. Regions rarely
         justify for budget variances. Justifications given by the Federal SLMP Support Unit for
         budget variances, which were usually underutilization, had been the same from quarter to
         quarter all inclining to implementation issues including procurement issues and capacity
         constraints/staff issues (staff turnover, capacity, work load, lack of incentives at Woreda
         level and lack of commitment of Woreda level leadership and technical staff).

                                                     44
b.      Accounting and Staffing: There was generally good accounting arrangement in
place which was adequate to provide the necessary reasonable assurance that the reports
being produced by the system can be relied upon to monitor the project. Federal and
regional implementing units had applied computerized accounting while most of the
Woredas visited were recording and reporting on the project implementation transactions
using manual accounting. The federal and regional level implementing units were using
Peachtree accounting software but it was indicated in the reports that there was room for
further improvement by utilizing the software to its maximum potential including
reporting capabilities. The federal and regional implementing units were producing
Interim Financial Reports (IFRs) on Excel Spreadsheet by taking data from the monthly
reports of lower tier implementing units and from the output of Peachtree software for the
Project. Transactions for the most part of the project life were entered on time and
accounts were up to date. There was also good filing and record keeping mechanisms.
c.      Federal and Regional levels suffered minimum turnover with some at regional
level. March 2012 supervision report indicated that the SNNPR was without its own
accountant for some time. The federal SLMP Support Unit operated with two accountants
for long period of time. Although one additional accountant was hired near the end of the
project closing date, gap was noted in most of the supervisions including the last mission.
There was also problem of following up and supervision of regions/Woredas. At
Woredas however high and frequent staff turnover had been noted. The accountants on
the project were government employees assigned who work on SLMP in addition to their
normal duties of the Woreda and there is a tendency, because of work load and lack of
incentives, to neglect the SLMP activities and this was observed as a major challenge that
affected the project. Though not frequent, capacity building initiatives were undertaken
by the project.
d.      Internal control and internal audit: The overall internal control environment
was relatively strong and this was being adhered with for the most part of the project life.
Project FM manual that documented accounting and internal control and other procedures
was in place and it was adhered with in most cases. One weakness noted in most
supervision missions (for the most life of the project) was lack of regular internal audit
oversight at all the implementation levels visited. The federal SLMP Support Unit only
started to take action at the beginning of the EFY 2005 (2012/13) and the internal audit
directorate of the Federal MoA conducted financial audit for the first half year at the
federal and two selected regions.
e.      Other internal control weaknesses reported through supervision report include
failure to properly prepare that bank reconciliation, and failure to reconcile balance with
federal and regions. Long outstanding balances and difficulties to settle regional
balances were being reported that persistently exist There were also weaknesses in the
area of property management, long outstanding receivable and payables and controls and
follow up thereof, adequacy of the supporting documents, ineligible expenditures related
to tax payments, cash management issues, etc.
f.      Fund flow and disbursement: Generally the funds flow from the Bank to the
Project was fairly the same over the project life. As can be seen below out of the signed
amounts XDR 12.50 million of IDA and USD 9 million of the TF 92320 disbursements
93.40% and 99% respectively were made and there was no cancellation. There are

                                        45
remaining amounts in the Designated accounts need to be refunded back to the Bank.
According to client connection as of Feb 14 2014 there is about USD 487,682.29 to be
refunded back. However, there are WAs for documentation submitted being processed
and will reduce outstanding balance to about USD 327,000. The project reported that it
will refund this balance soon. It is essential that the project refunds the balance to the
Bank as promised. The information on the client connection also shows that there are
overdraw under category 2 for both the IDA and trust fund of XDR 1,343,299.57 USD
1,343,299.57.
g.       Counterpart contributions- It has been indicated in the PAD that the recipient,
that is the government, will contribute USD 8.79million towards the project cost over the
life of the project. The overall counterpart contribution represented about 23% of the
estimated cost of the Project. The Bank followed up on contributions on supervision
missions and it was not mostly in line with what was stated in the PAD. Until the close of
the project that is September 30, 2013, the project was able to report only USD 2.40
million. The contribution made so far was low. The government reported that the
contribution made in kind has not been valued, recorded and properly reported so this
could be one reason for the low counterpart contribution.

h.     UN Advances –As can be seen from client connection, unutilized balance due
from UNOPS amounting USD 76,353.01 (Birr 1,369,345.59) had not been refunded back
to the World Bank. Notifications were made to UNOPS requesting refund of the
remaining resources. UNOPS reported that it will refund the amount by the end of
February 2014. The amounts need to be refunded back to the Bank and the Ministry
should follow up on this to make it happen.
i.    Reporting: In general, the project submitted acceptable quarterly Financial
Monitoring reports (FMRs) or IFRs. The reports are usually submitted on time but there
were few delays noted over the life of the project including the one prepared on
September 30, 2013.
j.     Auditing: The project was to submit audit report of its financial statements within
6 months of the year end. Audit reports were relatively submitted on time and recent
audits were unqualified. The audit reports for the years ended July 7, 2009, 2010, and
2011 were submitted on time but the audit reports for the year ended July 7 2012 and
2013 were submitted with delays (of about up to month). For all these years (from July 7
2009 to July 7 2011), the auditors issued qualified opinion on the financial statements but
the year ended July 7 2012 and 2013 reports were clean (unqualified). Management letter

raised a number of internal control issues that need attention. Some findings had
implications as to eligibility. Internal control weaknesses include property management,
long outstanding receivable and payables, poor documentation issues, tax payment issues;
inter fund balance issues and poor internal control oversight. The project prepared and
submitted action plans to address the findings noted in audit reports. The audit report of
July 7, 2013 is submitted late and is currently under review.

Annex 4. Economic and Financial Analysis
1.      There are at least eight categories of benefits associated with the project, of which half
can be readily quantified and the rest can be analyzed qualitatively. Half of these are readily
quantified; the rest are discussed qualitatively. Soil retention provides benefits both on site in
terms of soil quality and off site in terms of reduced erosion; it can be measured in terms of land
savings or erosion prevention. Carbon sequestration in soil can be estimated from measures
provided in the Borrower’s report. Increased vegetation cover also helps to prevent erosion and
improves downstream water quality and is measured as NDVI. Farmer incomes are another
category of direct benefits, measured through yield increases in agricultural areas immediately
downstream of the intervention areas.
2.      Benefits from improved water management include increased soil moisture and reduced
variability in terms of flood/drought conditions; however these were not readily measured using
the data available. Additional benefits that are not quantified in this analysis include reduced
costs to farmers and the wider society of the costs, risks and uncertainty due to poor/prior/weak
land management regimes, water quality and water quantity originating in the target watersheds,
biodiversity and other environmental services. These categories saw improvement, which
contribute to the overall assessment of positive economic benefits, though these are not
quantified here. With more effort and cost, risk and water quality and quantity issues could be
measured.
3.      This analysis focused on the readily quantifiable benefit streams. Where available,
project-based data was used, and supplemented that with market information and literature
values, where needed. We used conservative assumptions for interest rates and prices, and used
ranges of values to address potential uncertainties. Although we calculated soil retention benefits
using two different methods, only one was used in the economic analysis to avoid potential
double counting; this may have been an excess of caution.
4.     The cost benefit analysis was conducted for 25 years with a discount rate of 10% (with a
7% rate included for comparison). This is a quite conservative discount rate for a public
investment in land management, because it would undervalue the expected long term benefits.
5.      Modeling results reported in earlier SLMP documentation estimated erosion prevention at
52 tons per ha per year. For most variables, data were available for sample areas or watersheds,
not the entire project intervention zone. To maintain the conservative economic approach, and
consider a range of estimates, we applied site specific or sample-based information to 60,000
hectares, which was the area of intensive intervention. For a higher end range, we considered
that an additional 60,000 ha would be affected beneficially in a wider landscape impact zone.
The soil carbon figure, a 1% incremental change in soil carbon, is drawn from the borrower’s
completion report and valued conservatively. NDVI and soil retention figures rely on average
prices for land, soil and farmer incomes before project interventions.
6.      The results are reported in the table below. This shows that even with the most
conservative estimates and only a portion of the benefits quantified, the project benefits exceed
the costs. With more generous prices and discount rate assumptions, the benefits exceed the
costs substantially.
7.     Estimated economic benefits exceed US$3 million per year, which results in a net present
value of nearly US$30 million using the assumptions indicated above and in the table. Using the
higher range assumptions of impact in a wider area, these benefits double to nearly US$60
                                                49
    million. Using a less conservative discount rate of 7% would bring the benefit estimate in the
    high case scenario to over US$75 million. At the low end, the IRR is calculated as 10.4% and the
    high end range is 22.6%. Soil retention benefits account for about 33% of the benefits stream,
    carbon sequestration about 41%, vegetation cover about 5% and farmer incomes about 20%. Of
    course, all these benefits leave out the value of water retention, water quality, biodiversity,
    resilience building and risk reduction. Quantifying more of the benefits would, of course, raise
    the overall value of the project. For this reason, we are confident that even at the low end of the
    quantified range, the project costs were justified by the benefits achieved.

Annex 6. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

1.      The GoE’s Project Completion Report (PCR) describes the SLM Project and broader
SLM Program in terms of entry, funding, components, implementation arrangements, key factors
affecting implementation and outcomes. It identifies challenges faced and lessons learnt in the
process of planning and implementation, and provides recommendations to support the effective
realization of outputs and outcomes planned during SLMP II.

2.      The PCR reviewed seven SLM Program components financed by either the Bank or by
development partners. The components included those financed by the World Bank: (a)
Watershed Management; (b) Land Registration and Administration; and (c) Project
Management; and the those financed by other development partners: (a) Knowledge
Management; (b) Improved Framework Conditions for effective implementation of SLM; (c)
Strengthening of Implementation Structures for Watershed Development; and (d) Agricultural
Extension Service for SLM. Two components were incorporated about two years after the
effectiveness of the Bank-financed SLMP-1 operation.

3.      The major sources of information for the PCR were regional SLM implementation
records, primary field data, Indicator Assessment Report, Annual Progress Reports of the PCU,
Joint Implementation Monitoring Mission (JIMM), Project Appraisal Document (PAD), Project
Implementation Manual (PIM), and Result-Based Monitoring document of the project.

4.       In general, the implementation performance of SLM project and broader Program has
been satisfactory. At the output level, the project has accomplished 76% of planned activities, for
which progress data have been availed and comparison of planned targets and accomplishments
has been possible. In some of the SLM Woredas and watersheds, activities expected under the
watershed management sub-components did not commence uniformly, while the initial quality
and scale of the biophysical measures undertaken were not fully satisfactory as they were during
the last couple of years.

5.      At the outcome level of the Watershed Management component, a total of 110,435 ha of
individual farmlands and 99,492 ha of communal lands have been covered under SLM practices
until September 2013, representing 99% of the original target. In the process, SLM SWC
measures have been applied on 24.4% of the area under individual land holdings and 29.8% of
communal lands. Of the 39 promoted measures, the most frequently applied were: (a) Bunds; (b)
Fanya-juu; (c) Waterway; (d) Cut-off drain; and (e) terrace constructions. Regionally, Tigray has
been described as the region with the highest frequency of landholders applying two or more
different SLM measures, which indicates that farmers in Tigray are more innovative with regard
to SLM than farmers in other regions. Conversely, In Gambella and Benishangul Gumuz regions,
there are some deviations in applying the PIM and CBPWDG. This could be attributed to the late
starting of SLM activities and relative shortage of key staff to fully take hold of all SLM-related
responsibilities.

6.      With respect to the project development and intermediate level indicators, in many of the
visited micro-watersheds, participants of Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) reported short-term
increase of 5-10% for common crops grown on conserved lands. At the outcome level, the
monitoring survey conducted in 15 SLM watersheds to assess the new level of soil carbon that
                                                53
could be resulting from the implementation of adopted technologies, revealed that all watersheds
had attained their targets above the envisaged level. The survey result generally suggested that:
(a) The bio-physical measures applied in SLM watersheds were appropriate; (b) Soil erosion
events have reduced; (c) It has been possible for agricultural productivity and production to
increase; (d) Farmers’ resilience to climatic change has been on the positive side; and (e)
Attainment of PDO is on the right track. In relation to watershed rehabilitation in SLM
intervention areas, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) value of 2% annual
increase reflected gradual regeneration of closed areas, rehabilitation of communal grazing areas
and hillsides; and improved performance of crops grown on individual farmlands.

7.     Factual evidences for the contribution of the Watershed Management component to the
PDO are: (a) Increase in the area under sustainable land management practices in targeted
watersheds by 99%; (b) 5-10% increase in agricultural productivity of dominant crops according
to beneficiaries; (c) Increase in NDVI and the amount of carbon sequestered in soil over
expected outcome; and (d) encouraging proportion (85%) of households that have adopted one or
more sustainable land management practices on their land as a result of SLM project/program
interventions.

8.     Regarding capacity building outputs, 94% of the planned activities was accomplished.
The assessment made in Amhara, Oromia and Tigray regions showed that 43% of Development
Agents (DAs) and 70% of Wereda Experts in these regions use at least one SLM knowledge
products of MoA’s Knowledge Management System (KMS). Of those activities, remarkable
performances were registered in the establishment of watershed committees and teams, and
awareness creation and technical trainings. However, technical capacity building in physical and
biological measures, supplies of farm inputs and conservation tools have remained insufficient in
terms of quantity and quality.

9.      Implementation of communal land treatment reached 60% of the target. In spite of lower
achievement rate, the benefits and signs of development have been satisfactory given the existing
level of technical capacity, terrain difficulties, and the time horizon needed to realize intended
changes. Application of various conservation technologies has contributed not only to reduce soil
erosion but also to increased percolation of water.

10.     Accomplishment in construction of community infrastructure has been only 56% with
better performance in small scale irrigation expansion and community road construction. The
size and magnitude of all infrastructures constructed seemed to be limited in relation to larger
demand for the facilities. However, community feeder roads have opened access to local markets
for farm products and agricultural inputs, access to health and education, and higher participation
in civic affairs.

11.    Performance in income generation activities reached 69%, mainly by assisting farmers to
engage in beehives, goat and sheep raising, poultry and horticulture production, and dairy
products. The number of beneficiary households reached 16,819 of which an estimated 40%
were female and the remaining 60% male. Of those trained, 10,823 received financial and
material support. Introduction of income generating opportunities enhanced farmers’ confidence
on the various conservation measures practiced on individual farmlands and communal grazing

                                                54
areas. SLMP also offered livelihood opportunities to the youth, particularly in setting up user-
groups and becoming beneficiaries of employment and gaining skills in cadastral surveying, land
registration and income generation linked to natural resources. However, assistance for the
establishment and functionality of user groups (unemployed youth, female or others) to engage
in protection and utilization of the assigned common natural resources has not been so high due
to limitation of technical and financial supports and problem of implementing bylaws on the
protection of natural resources.

12.    With regard to Land Registration and Administration, a total of 59,999 households have
received second level certificate. This has been 109% of the target revised by the PCU and only
2.1% of the initial target value. As a result, 98.6% of landholders in the project areas feel more
secure with the land holding certificate, and 71% explained that disputes and/or conflicts on land
use have significantly reduced. There is an increased sense of ownership by farmers and
implementation of soil and water conservation measures on farmland has increased substantially.

13.     Regarding Project Management (PM), achievements in relation to the original target
value averaged 78%. In line with developing participatory watershed development plans at sub-
watershed level, 75% of the target planned during the implementation period had been
accomplished. Activities such as sample watershed planning, collecting and compiling of sub-
watershed plans, delineating critical and sub-watershed boundaries using GPS and topographic
maps were achieved far over the plans as the result of continued technical and financial supports
provided by GIZ. The component enabled systematic use of the ESMF to screen proposed
project interventions before approval. Since 2012, screening of activities using the ESMF has
been an integral part of watershed plans. However, there have been no further assessments done
with respect of locations-specific impacts that could be associated with works related to new
construction or rehabilitation of roads, irrigation facilities, and spring development.

14.     The contribution of PM to PDO and GEO was indirect and could only be perceived in
connection to its contribution to the Watershed Management component of the project.
Currently, SLM Knowledge Management Systems has not been fully systematic and its products
and inputs have not been adequately and regularly distributed. However, web-based service
training was provided, a website was developed, and technical publications, newsletters,
brochures, posters and manuals were produced.

15.     SLMP had considerable impact on women, mainly through the issuance of first level
certificates. The certification enabled women to acquire equal rights in landholdings since land
certificates bear rights for both husband and wife. The percentage share of women in land
certification has been above average (41.6%), while for other activities the participation of
female-headed households and individual female beneficiaries has been 37%.

16.    The functionality of SLM implementation arrangements and structures is in place and the
responsibilities expected at all levels of mandates are generally satisfactory. SLM functions
under existing government structure are dependable and there are promising grounds for the
sustainability of SLM outcomes, results and best practices. Beside this, there is a general
understanding that the Steering Committees and Technical Committees formed at the regional
and Wereda level are, to a certain extent, functional and involved in coordinating and providing

                                               55
support to SLMP implementation. However, some members of the committees hardly perform
their duties as expected and there appears to be a better record of committee meetings at the
Kebele level compared to regional and Woreda committees.

17.    The federal level SLM PCU is overloaded despite the relentless efforts of its staff. The
problems mainly lie in the management of monitoring and reporting flows resulting from delays
and incompleteness at the Woreda and regional levels. The number of staff for M&E and project
coordination was insufficient to address these constraints.

18.      The MoA laid a strong base in the arrangement of SLM partnership beginning from the
very inception of the project. In particular, the collaborative concern of the World Bank to
reshape and design the project and the roles played by other development partners such as
IDA/GEF, EU, GDC/GIZ, KfW, the Government of Norway, Canadian Government and the
Government of Finland reveals the extent to which partnership arrangements have been strong
towards the effectiveness and successful implementation of SLM. The World Bank had an
immense contribution in designing the SLM project. The PAD became the cornerstone for the
preparation and use of SLM PIM and RBM&E documents which are being used for training and
application at all level of implementation. The Bank’s financial contribution accounted for 77%
of the initial fund availed for the project and about 22% of the overall contribution of the
development partners. Its guidelines and arrangements for fiduciary compliances and safeguard
policies had contributed to the prevalence of standard working systems and improvement of
skills in financial management and procurement.
