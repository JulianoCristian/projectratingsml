                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Execution of the project components and activities has been on track and some significant outputs and outcomes have been achieved in the last two years. PY03 targets will largely
                         be achieved, but there could be some delays in the achievement of certain milestones in the so-called emerging regions of Gambela and Benishangul-Gumuz because
                         implementation capacities in these regions are relatively lower. The project is holding discussions with DevelopmenPartners to solicit technical assistance support for these regions to
                         improve human capacity and planning capabilities with the aim of accelerating implementation of project activities.

                         The project complies with all critical legal covenants and is being supported by competent financial management and procurement officers at federal, regional and woreda levels.
                         Interim Financial Reports (IFR)s have been submitted on time and in quality acceptable to the Bank. Annual financial audits have been submitted on time and auditors have had
                         "unqualified" opinions on the audits. Disbursement of project funds has improved significantly to now about 31% of the total GEF & IDA contributions. This is expected to improve
                         further during the second half of the fiscal year when traditionally implementation of project activities peaks. Also, large payments are expected from procurements for equipment
                         such as vehicles, field and office equipment that are expected to arrive before the end of the fiscal year. Overall, safeguard compliance has been satisfactory. Project activities
                         implemented so far seem to have resulted in no significant adverse environmental impacts or social risks. The World Bank has advised the project managers to ensure that the
                         safeguard checklist developed under the Environmental and Social Management Framework is used in vetting and screening project activities before they are carried out so that any
                         environmental and social impacts can be reduced and managed.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         1.        Incorporation of upper catchments and new watersheds into the Project: The last implementation support mission advised that there was need to delineate and incorporate
                         all upper catchments that were initially left out of the selected watershed areas. The project support unit of the client has been advised to develop proposals on how these areas can
                         quickly be covered by the project. Hence, the mission agreed that the project support unit at the federal level will submit a full list of those watersheds that will have to encompass the
                         upper catchments, revise the existing work plans to cover the extended upper catchment sections and submit these revisions to development partners for consideration and
                         endorsement no later than 28th February 2011.

                         2.       Mid-term Review & Project Restructuring: Agreement has been reached to conduct the proposed restructuring of the Project at the Mid-term Review (MTR) that is expected
                         to be undertaken from March 14-20, 2011. The restructuring has become necessary because of the following: (i) the project indicators have to be revised to make them measurable
                         and relevant; (ii) new intervention areas will have to be incorporated; (iii) scale-up and incorporation of the lessons learnt from the CDM-type Humbo Community-assisted
                         Regeneration Project and REDD plus type pilots including carbon financing schemes into the SLMP; (iv) incorporation of the an additional financing of Euro 12.8m from the
                         Government of Finland (GoF); and (v) re-allocation of IDA and GEF grant funds between Components.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
