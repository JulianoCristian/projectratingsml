reduce land\n            degradation in agricultural landscapes and to improve the\n            agricultural productivity of smallholder farmers. There are\n            three components to the project. The first component is the\n            watershed management. It is aimed at supporting scaling up\n            of best management practices in sustainable land management\n            practices and technologies for smallholder farmers in the\n            high potential/food secure areas that are increasingly\n            becoming vulnerable to land degradation and food insecurity.\n            The second component is the rural land certification and\n            administration. The objective of this component is to expand\n            the coverage and enhance the government's land\n            certification project, with the aim of strengthening land\n            tenure security for smallholder farmers. The third component\n            is the project management. The focus of this component is to\n            provide financial and technical assistance to the federal\n            ministry of agriculture and rural development and local\n            government units responsible for sustainable land management\n            to effectively support coordination and implementation of\n            the SLM project."}, "docdt": "2008-03-28T00:00:00Z"}
