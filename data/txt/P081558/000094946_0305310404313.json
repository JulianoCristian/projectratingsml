There will be limited range of environmental\n            impacts occurring during construction (local pollution).\n            Contractual obligations must include clauses regarding\n            environmental protection focusing specifically on site clean\n            up after construction, waste management during construction,\n            and possibly the rehabilitation of land disturbed during\n            construction. Construction activities such as the\n            circulation of heavy machinery and the chopping down of\n            trees by the workforce for fuel can result in the\n            destruction of intact vegetation such as shade or fruit\n            trees, stream bank vegetation, etc. Localized soil and water\n            (if a small stream is nearby) pollution from incorrect\n            storage and handling of diesel fuel and used engine oil may\n            occur. The accumulation of solid wastes due to construction\n            activities and workforce during construction creates health\n            risks and negative aesthetic impacts. Associated mitigating\n            measures include: Wherever possible avoid removal of trees\n            or other intact vegetation by workforce or circulation of\n            heavy machinery. Carefully select storage area for diesel\n            and ensure proper storage and handling of fuels to prevent\n            localized pollution of soils. Used engine oil should be\n            properly stored in drums and returned to the supplier for\n            recycling or should be disposed of in disposal in proper\n            disposal sites. Remove and dispose of solid wastes in\n            suitable sites. Non-hazardous wastes can be disposed of in a\n            locally dug pit and covered with top soil on closure. Where\n            possible use building debris such as broken bricks, broken\n            cement blocks, etc. for back-filling and construction of\n            drains, soak-aways and paved walk ways."}, "docdt": "2003-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
