    satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            Bank performance was moderate satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was highly satisfactory. Lessons learned\n            include: use of pilot activities - the iterative approach of\n            the municipal development component's pilot activities\n            was critical as it allowed sufficient time and resource\n            inputs to develop the capacity of local partners, while fine\n            tuning the methodologies applied to the diverse and rapidly\n            changing local conditions. It also helped to build trust\n            among stakeholders and keep expectations realistic. The\n            guidance provided by a highly qualified local development\n            expert to FAS management was critical to the successful\n            design, implementation, and monitoring of the project's\n            municipal development component pilots. Commitment by local\n            leaders to civic engagement - building working relations of\n            trust and confidence in public officials at the provincial\n            and municipal levels was essential to FAS efforts in\n            promoting effective civic participation in local\n            development. Clear communication of the distinct roles and\n            functions of government and civil society and the way in\n            which they are brought together in a participatory process\n            is essential to bring about recognition and legitimacy of\n            the adopted bottom-up approach of development process.\n            Investment sustainability - community participation through\n            FAS-supported Nucleus Groups were necessary but not\n            sufficient to ensure sustainability of improved\n            infrastructure. FAS III emphasized the importance of\n            operation and maintenance and of linking it with investments\n            by coordinating planning with provincial and municipal\n            authorities as well as to harmonize these with municipal\n            maintenance programs and budgets."}, "docdt": "2010-03-24T00:00:00Z"}
