The FAS II project involves multiple\n            sub-projects, some of which may require land and asset\n            takings. Specific investment decisions are usually made\n            during the life of the project. A resettlement policy\n            framework (RPF) which guides and governs the project as\n            sub-projects are selected for inclusion. An RPF is prepared\n            in situations where specific investment sites and details\n            (i.e. individual sub-projects) are not known. It is a\n            statement of the policy, principles, institutional\n            arrangements and procedures that will be followed for each\n            sub-project involving compensation and/or resettlement. It\n            sets out the elements common to all the sub-projects and\n            allows for the principles and processes to be agreed. The\n            second element involves individual resettlement action plans\n            (RAPs), based on the common policies, principles and\n            arrangements contained in the RPF; the RPF and the RAPs\n            being fully complementary to one another. They are\n            undertaken for each sub-project where displacement will\n            occur, once more specific details of the location and nature\n            of the sub-project is known. When they are required\n            individual RAPs must be prepared and reviewed before they\n            are accepted for inclusion in the overall project."}, "docdt": "2003-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
