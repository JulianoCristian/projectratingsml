       I        PROJECT CONTEXT, DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN

A.      Context at Appraisal
1.    At the time of appraisal, Angola was slowly beginning to recover from the devastating
effects of over 40 years of armed conflict,1 including war-torn society, destroyed or damaged
social, economic, and transport infrastructure, and widespread mistrust in public institutions.2
The country's key institutions were fragile and lacked capacity and legitimacy. Angola ranked
161 out of 173 countries in UNDP's 2002 Human Development Index. More than two-thirds of
the population lived in poverty (below US$2/day), and one-fourth was extremely poor (below
US$0.75/day).3
2.    In order to address the challenges referred to above, the Government of Angola (GoA)
identified key social development priorities: (i) reduce poverty; (ii) enhance coverage and quality
of basic social services; (iii) reduce vulnerability; and (iv) promote social reintegration and
rebuild social capital.4 The Third Social Action Fund (FAS III) was seen as one of GoA's most
important instruments to implement these priorities and fight poverty at the community level,
based on FAS' strong track record.5 Through the implementation of two previous Projects (FAS
I and II), FAS had established a reputation as a dynamic, credible, and effective provider of basic
social and economic services to about 2.4 million people living in poor communities despite
persisting human, administrative, and logistical challenges posed by the post-conflict
environment.6
3.    While FAS I and II focused on providing basic services to poor communities in the nine
coastal provinces, FAS III aimed to expand to Angola's nine less-developed provinces to achieve
more equitable geographic coverage. These more remote and underserved provinces were not
only `unchartered territory' for FAS but they had also received very little social investments in
the past 30 years and were characterized by weak social capital and intergroup relationships.

  The independence war (1961 to 1975) was followed by the civil war (1975 to 2002).
2
  Some 750,000 Angolans (7 percent of the population) died from conflict-related causes, including famine or
disease; over 5 million people were internally displaced and 440,000 became refugees. Among the most vulnerable
social groups were the rural population, female heads of households, children, persons with disabilities and UNITA
ex-combatants.
3
  According to Angola's Development Strategy, 62 percent of the households live below the poverty line of US$
1.70 per day (94 percent in rural areas and 57 percent in urban areas), and 15 percent are in a situation of extreme
poverty (less than US$0.75 per day). Life expectancy is 42 years. About 70 percent of the population is illiterate.
One in four children dies before his/her fifth birthday, making Angola's child mortality rate the second worst in the
world. Cholera is endemic and malaria affects one-third of the population. Only 38 percent of Angolans have access
to safe drinking water (compared with about 55 percent in Sub Saharan Africa) and 44 percent have access to
adequate sanitation services. GDP per capita has grown rapidly, reaching US$1,980 in 2006, but inequality remains
very high, with the Gini coefficient estimated to be 0.62.

  FAS III was designed to support GoA's efforts to: (i) increase the sustainable utilization of basic infrastructure by
building upon FAS's positive track record and name recognition; (ii) mobilize community support to vulnerable
groups aimed at fostering social reintegration; (iii) rebuild social capital in Angola through its demand-driven,
participatory and community-empowering approach; (iv) prepare the grounds for decentralization and promote
accountability and empowerment of local government structures; and (v) enable local governments to play their new
role through a combination of human, organizational, and institutional development activities (PAD, pp. 5-9).
6
  In light of FAS' renowned performance and achievements, FAS III benefited from the financial support of other
development partners, including the EC, Chevron, UNDP, DfiD and UNICEF, among others.

                                                                                                                     1
4.   FAS III was "considered a cornerstone of a selective [Bank] lending program that aimed to
help promote national reconciliation, improve public expenditure management, [and] expand
domestic capacity for service delivery."7 FAS III was aligned with the Bank's Transitional
Support Strategy by: (i) "improving and expanding the sustainable use of essential social and
economic services to war-affected and other vulnerable groups," and (ii) "promoting a
governance system where local government and communities are mutually accountable, and
through the transparent, efficient, and credible use of its resources."8
B.       Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
5.    FAS III's original development objective was "to achieve improved, expanded, and
sustainable utilization of basic social and economic services and to support a governance system
where local government and communities can gradually become mutually accountable."9 Similar
to other Projects prepared at the time, FAS III's PDO in the PAD differs slightly from the PDO
in the Development Credit Agreement (DCA).10 Given that the PDO in the PAD captures the
Project's development objective more accurately both in substance and in the underlying theory
of change, the ICR team adopted the PAD as its basis for analysis.11
6.     The Key Performance Indicators (KPI) for the PDO cited in the PAD12 included: (i)
primary school enrollment increased by x percent, (ii) access to and usage of health services
increased by x percent, (iii) access to and usage of water and sanitation facilities increased by x
percent, (iv) number of vehicles on repaired roads increased by x percent and travel time reduced
by x percent, (v) number of Consultative Forums (CF) created and functioning, (vi) 80 percent of
participating municipalities achieving highest level (8) of performance by the end of the Project
(EoP) and 40 percent by Mid-Term Review (MTR), (viii) number of municipal staff skills,
competencies, and practices improved, (viii) number of communities making use of FAS
supported mechanisms to hold municipalities accountable, and (ix) x percent of beneficiaries
satisfied with services provided by the Project.13

   FAS III's PDO in the DCA was "to assist the Borrower in achieving improved, expanded and sustainable
utilization of basic social and economic services through: (i) the provision or rehabilitation of social and economic
infrastructure at the community level; (ii) capacity development at the level of communities, Implementation
Partners, local governments, and FAS; and (iii) strengthening and improving networks to facilitate collective action
among community members, including vulnerable groups (DCA, Schedule 2, p. 17).
11
   As described in great detail in the PAD, the Project focused on the nexus between community and municipal
development. However, the PDO in the DCA only refers to the one of the Project's key areas of intervention, i.e.
community development; it makes little reference to the Project's intended positive impact on municipal
development and local governance.
12
   While the PAD included Outcome/Impact indicators, the Project Agreement (PA) listed the following Output
indicators and targets values (PA, p. 17): (i) number of social promoters trained (54 by MTR and 110 by EoP); (ii)
number of Subproject Committees trained (210 by MTR and 500 by EoP); (iii) number of education infrastructures
completed (355 by MTR and 710 by EoP); (iv) number of health infrastructures completed (65 by MTR and 130 by
EoP); (v) number of water and sanitation infrastructures completed (700 by MTR and 1250 by EoP); (vi) percentage
of beneficiaries satisfied (90 percent by MTR and 95 percent by EoP); (vii) percentage of highly performing Project
municipalities (50 percent by MTR and 80 percent by EoP).
13
   The KPI in Annex 1 of the PAD (p. 34) includes an additional outcome indicator, i.e., "Revenues of market
vendors increased by x%." The PAD did not include numeric target values for the KPIs. It is worth noting that at the
time of Project design it was common, at least in the case of social funds, for KPIs not to have specific numeric

                                                                                                                   2

8.   FAS III expected to serve specifically targeted communities, municipal administrations,
and civil society organizations in the continuum of rural and peri-urban areas, with a special
focus on vulnerable households (PAD, p. 13).
E.       Original components
9.   The Project consisted of two interlocking and complementary main components: a
Community Development Component (CDC) and a Municipal Development Component
(MDC). The total Project cost at the time of appraisal was US$120 million, of which IDA
pledged to contribute US$55 million, GoA US$8.25 million, the European Commission (EC)
US$50 million, and bilateral agencies US$6.75 million.14
10. Component I: Community Development (CDC) (US$87.5 million). The CDC comprised
two subcomponents:
11. Subcomponent I(a): Subprojects. This subcomponent aimed to "expand and improve
access, management, and sustainable use of basic social and economic infrastructure, improve
governance and build social capital."15 In accordance with a Community-Driven Development
(CDD) approach, this subcomponent intended to build or restore small-scale community-based
social and economic infrastructures damaged or destroyed during the war. These subprojects
were envisaged to be identified, prioritized, co-implemented, and maintained by communities.16
The subcomponent would expand FAS intervention from the nine so-called `old' provinces
where FAS had been present since its inception in 1994 to all of the country's 18 provinces. In
order to foster a meaningful dialogue between communities and local governments and to enable
community members to make informed choices, this subcomponent also included capacity
development efforts.
12. Subcomponent I(b): Conflict Impact and Vulnerability Assessment (CIVA). This
subcomponent aimed to investigate, on a pilot basis, in a total of 10 communities "how the
particularity of the post-conflict context constrains or fosters social capital building" in Angola.17
Depending on the outcome of this assessment, FAS management and IDA were going to jointly
decide whether a subproject window should be made available for pilot interventions in support
of the vulnerable groups identified (PAD, p. 11 and DCA, p. 17).



targets by subproject type, given that subproject investments were demand driven and determined through a
participatory planning process; hence, the number of subprojects and their sectors could not be accurately
predetermined at approval.
14
   The total Project cost at the end of the Project (EoP) was US$132.6 million, including IDA (US$60.2 million),
GoA (US$33.7 million), EC (US$37.7 million), Chevron (US$0.26 million), UNDP (US$0.57 million), and
UNICEF (US$ 0.08 million).
15
   PAD, p. 10.
16
   Subproject investments were expected to include the construction and/or rehabilitation of: (i) basic infrastructure
for health, education, and water and sanitation; and (ii) small-scale productive and communal infrastructures like
public markets, public parks, and sports facilities, as well as (iii) environmental upgrading, such as, solid waste
management, reforestation, etc. (DCA, p. 17).

13. Component II: Municipal Development (MDC) (US$10 million). The MDC aimed to
strengthen the capacity of municipal governments, including municipal administrations and
municipal forums,18 to become gradually proficient and accountable in the provision of public
services and goods to communities. Municipal investment portfolios were to be identified
according to municipal development plans (MDP) jointly prepared by municipal administrations
and civil society representatives.19 Based on a pilot graduation scheme and competitive
eligibility criteria, the MDC would provide eligible municipalities with: (i) funds to co-finance
investments prioritized in the MDP, which would then be operated and maintained by the
respective municipal administration;20 (ii) capacity development support tailored to the
municipal administrations' needs, learning timing and tasks they were required to perform;21 and
(iii) administrative grants to cover the operating costs of the established Forums.22 The ultimate
goal of this graduation scheme was to enable municipalities to gradually take on the role of
public goods and services providers within the context of a municipal development plan and
based on participatory processes (DCA, p. 17).23
F.      Revised components
14.   Components were not revised.
G.      Other significant changes
15. Reallocation of Funds. In October 2006, the Bank granted its no-objection to a reallocation
of IDA Credit as well as the EC Trust Fund24 proceeds to: (i) decrease the number of larger-
scale subprojects in the new provinces in response to beneficiaries' demand for small
subprojects,25 (ii) reflect the cost savings resulting from IDA and FAS management's joint
decision to establish satellite offices instead of, as initially planned, permanent offices in four
new provinces, and (iii) the EC's request that its grant proceeds be used primarily to finance
subprojects and goods.26 The reallocation of funds enabled FAS to better respond to requests for
small-scale infrastructures in the most remote areas where the price of construction materials was
significantly higher than in other parts of the country. In October 2008, a second reallocation of
IDA Credit proceeds was approved in order to provide additional financing for small-scale
subprojects.

   This "learning by doing" process was expected to facilitate a gradual transfer of FAS' know-how to eligible
municipalities, in accordance with the achievement of benchmarks specified in the graduation scheme, in order for
FAS to start assuming the role of a financing and local development agency. With sufficient time and resources
municipalities and Forums were also hoped to develop the ability to establish the necessary mechanisms for
knowledge management and institutional coordination to ensure a more coherent and efficient resource allocation at
the local level (PAD, p. 12).

   The Administration and Co-financing Framework Agreement for this trust fund was signed in 2004 between the
European Community, represented by the Commission of the European Communities (the Commission) and the
International Development Association (IDA). The trust fund will henceforth be referred to as EC Trust Fund (EC
TF).

16. Amendments of IDA Credit DCA and EC TF Agreement. The DCA was amended in
March 2004 to reflect updates on the compliance with the conditions for effectiveness, that is,
the appointment of a financial internal auditor and a technical internal auditor, and the pending
actions on the appointment of a certified accountant and publishing approval of the DCA in its
official gazette.27 In addition, the amendment was needed to: (i) convert a condition of
effectiveness into a dated covenant because Angola required more time to comply with one of
the conditions of effectiveness; and (ii) add an additional legal remedy to the list of remedies
embedded in Section 5.01 of the DCA. The EC TF Agreement was amended in July 2005 to
clearly define eligible expenses under the "Operating Cost" Category.28
17. Extension of Closing Dates. The Project closing date was extended twice: (i) from June 30,
2008 to December 31, 2008 in order to allow GoA to mobilize additional resources required to
complete all subprojects under implementation;29 and (ii) from December 31, 2008 to June 30,
2009 in order to allow the necessary time for IDA and GoA "to assemble outstanding reports
required to allow financing of the withdrawal applications for expenditures submitted by the
GoA after the closing date of the administrative agreement (AA) between IDA and the EC
(December 31, 2007).30

      II        KEY FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES
A.         Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry
Key Elements of Project Design
18. At the outset, FAS III's design benefited greatly from its nine years of accumulated
experience, an established reputation, and lessons learned from the two previous Projects, FAS I
and FAS II. The key lessons incorporated were the need to: (i) support effective policy and
program coordination at the national and provincial levels to ensure consistency,
complementarity, and sustainability of investments financed by FAS; (ii) strengthen the
exchange of knowledge at the national and local levels to promote a participatory local
development processes; (iii) cultivate a transparent, consultative decision-making environment at
the local level for better resource allocation and management; (iv) standardize subproject
documents, technical designs, and unit costs; (v) monitor environmental safeguards; and (vi)
devise an upfront strategy to ensure the maintenance of investments by community groups and
local institutions.
19. The Project's design also complemented other Bank-financed operations in support of
GoA's post-conflict reconstruction and development efforts, such as the Post-Conflict
Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Program and multilateral poverty alleviation programs.31
27
    See March 15, 3004 Amendment Letter from Johannes Zutt to Minister of Planning.
28
   "Operating Costs meant the incremental expenses incurred on account of Project implementation, management
and monitoring, including office supplies, vehicle and equipment operation and maintenance, utilities expenses,
rental expenses, transport, travel, per diem, supervision costs, communication and insurance costs, salaries of locally
contracted employees, but excluding salaries of officials of the Recipient's civil service, and reasonable bank
charges related to the operation of the Special Account" (DCA, page 16).
29
   See December 30, 2008 ISR. The IDA Credit proceeds had been almost fully disbursed by the original closing
date, i.e., June 30, 2008. The reasons for this extension were related to delays in the completion of EC Trust Fund-
financed activities due to a funding shortfall following the unanticipated partial cancellation of the grant proceeds
(see paragraphs 78-80).

Another value-added during Project preparation was FAS III's anticipation of the needed support
to local government structures in preparation for GoA's envisioned decentralization process.32
20. It was advantageous that the TTL at the time of FAS III preparation had also been the TTL
during the implementation of FAS II. The design of FAS III benefitted substantially from this
continuity in the form of a better understanding of the local context and familiarity with the key
stakeholders and partnering institutions.
Assessment of Project Design
21. Project Development Objective (PDO). The Project Development Objective of "achieving
improved, expanded, and sustainable utilization of basic social and economic services and to
support a governance system where local governments and communities can gradually become
mutually accountable" was highly relevant to the country's post-conflict context and reality on
the ground. While the objectives of FAS I and II successfully focused on physical capital
building within an in-conflict context, FAS III's twin objectives adequately captured the rapidly
changing post-conflict context and the country's shift toward a paradigm of participatory
development.
22. Project Components. Despite the difficult circumstances, which severely constrained the
Project preparation team's ability to conduct field visits in the `new' provinces, the activities
under both Project components were on the whole articulated and implemented satisfactorily
throughout the Project's life, largely due to the decentralized implementation arrangements
adopted and the experienced team in place. The two components supported the Project's twin
objectives in a concerted fashion by addressing the shortcomings in the service delivery system
at the community, local government, and policy levels. The main new features of the Project
design per component are as follows:
·    Community Development Component (CDC) ­ Component I:
     Component Ia: Subprojects. As evidenced by the successful implementation of FAS I and
     FAS II, using physical infrastructure as an entry point and means to promote civic
     engagement in service delivery proved to be a promising concept in post-conflict Angola.
     Component Ib: Conflict Impact and Vulnerabiilty Assessment (CIVA). The CIVA
     highlighted FAS' commitment to inclusive decision making and to equitable access to
     services.33 The assumption that it would provide FAS and partners with an in-depth
     understanding of vulnerability and with a practical tool to seize opportunities and address
     constraints to promote social cohesion in Angola's post-conflict context was appropriate.34
·    Municipal Development Component (MDC) - Component II. The MDC approach and
     methods replaced FAS' previous community needs-based criteria, which used to rely on
     subproject cycles, to one that sought strategic objectives and improved results through a
     geographical and poverty-based allocation of resources. In operational terms, the shift from a
     mainly Community-Driven Development­type of allocation modality to one that was
     predicated on the municipal development investment cycle was reasonable.

32
   PAD, p. 9.
33
   PAD, page 47.
34
   This study was particularly relevant as it revealed the context in the nine largely underserved `new' provinces
characterized by dilapidated or destroyed basic services, eroded social capital, and very weak local governance.

                                                                                                                6
·    Capacity Development Framework (CDF). FAS III's overarching CDF was regarded at the
     time of appraisal by OPCS as `cutting-edge,' given that it departed from the prevailing
     thinking of capacity `building' as training toward a comprehensive framework which, for the
     first time in Angola, integrated the human, organizational, and institutional aspects of
     capacity strengthening.35
23. Institutional and Implementation Arrangements. The Project's institutional framework
contained innovative elements that played a key role in its effective execution. First, the Project
was managed by an experienced team responsible for the implementation of FAS since its
inception in 1994.36 Second, provincial committees were established by the Project to ensure
effective sector coordination, compliance with technical standards, availability of
complementary inputs (e.g., teachers and school books, in the case of education subprojects), and
a clear assignment of maintenance responsibilities to ensure the sustainability of subproject
assets financed under FAS III. Third, the decentralized FAS offices in most provinces allowed
for a strong local expert presence, and the timely articulation of Project activities on the
ground.37 Fourth, a prudent strategy was adopted to address the institutional fragility in the
country's post-conflict context through the gradual transfer of FAS' service delivery expertise
and functions to municipal officials and local partners. Finally, the role assigned to FAS as a
liaison between local authorities and civil society entities38 to facilitate dialogue and
institutionalize community engagement in decision making was appropriate.
Adequacy of government's commitment
24. FAS III enjoyed GoA's strong commitment and ownership throughout Project design and
preparation. The Project was prepared with broad participation by all FAS provincial teams,
government officials, experts, and partnering institutions (i.e., EC, UNDP, UNICEF, DfID, Adra,
DW).39 These allowed for effective institutional coordination and a solid foundation as well as
speedy Project preparation, given that it was completed within 10 months.
Assessment of risks
25. At the time of Project design, the main risks identified in the PAD included: (i) FAS being
used as a political tool, particularly prior to the 2008 elections; (ii) insufficient financial and
human resources to maintain the investments; (iii) delays in instituting a legal decentralization
framework; (iv) difficulty establishing a system of mutual accountability and transparency; (v)
limited capacity of municipal administrations and partners to effectively respond to community
demands; and (vi) financial management risk due to decentralized Project implementation.40
Upon reflection, the risk associated with the expansion into "unknown territory" and the risk of

35
   Capacity development activities were designed as cross-cutting/integral parts of both components as opposed to
FAS' previous approach, which entailed a self-standing component focused only on human capacity enhancement.
For details see Annex 11 of the PAD.
36
   FAS' hands-on experience in implementing other Bank-financed operations proved to be invaluable to a
consistently satisfactory management performance.
37
   This proved to be a particularly important design aspect at the time of peace consolidation when differences were
marked among the provinces particularly in regards to their post-conflict reconstruction and community rebuilding
needs.
38
   These include Núcleos Comunitários (community-based subproject committees) and Forums (advisory bodies to
the municipal administrations comprised of civil society representatives).

institutional inertia ­ the time required for key partners and FAS teams to embrace a rather novel
way of doing business ­ were underestimated perhaps because FAS' participatory approach to
basic public service delivery at the local level was unprecedented in Angola at the time (PAD, p.
30).41
B.       Implementation
26. The Project implementation period spanned from June 27, 2003 through June 30, 2009,
including two six-month extensions of its closing date. The major highlights and challenges
faced during implementation are as follows:
Highlights
27. Government's continuous support. GoA maintained its initial high interest and provided
support to the Project throughout its implementation, as reflected in the US$33.7 million in total
counterpart contribution, four times the US$8.25 million agreed at the time of appraisal.
28. Implementation Capacity of FAS. The experienced staff of FAS, the implementing agency,
satisfactorily fulfilled the planning, management, and fiduciary functions of the Project. Unlike
many other social funds that have generally been created as short-term institutions, FAS has been
in existence for 15 years due to their effectiveness and complementarity with other GoA efforts
toward poverty alleviation.42
29. "Brand recognition" of FAS. FAS' continuous presence and solid track record have been
highly regarded across the country and stakeholders. According to the beneficiary assessments
and impact evaluation, beneficiaries living in the Project areas expressed appreciation for its
investments in physical infrastructures.43 FAS has also been regarded as a "Government NGO"
that: (i) operates based on the principles of participation, community organization and
empowerment, and accountability; and (ii) is committed to developing local-level capacity,
creating job opportunities, and transferring skills and knowledge. The "FAS brand" has been
recognized beyond Angolan borders.44 In recognition of FAS' approach to promoting a culture
of participatory governance, FAS methods have also been replicated by development partners,
such as the Municipal Development Program financed by USAID/Chevron, and implemented by
Development Workshop and CARE.
30. Evolving from a `Doer' to Successful `Change Agent' of National Policies. The MDC
pilots exceeded expectations and informed the revision of the 1999 Local Administration Decree
and the incorporation of civil society in decision making in the new Local Administration Law

41
    The identified risks were realistic and the risk mitigation measures adopted were appropriate. Mitigation measures
included: (i) a strong emphasis on capacity development activities to enable the respective stakeholders to
understand and play their assigned roles; (ii) establishment of clear "rules of the game" such as enhanced financial
management procedures to increase transparency and accountability; (iii) a strong focus on vertical and horizontal
coordination, close collaboration and shared responsibilities for investments financing and maintenance; and (iv)
public disclosure of "user friendly" information required for meaningful civic participation.

43
    FAS has been commended on `getting things done' in a timely fashion, that is, a six-month subproject cycle for
building/rehabilitating small-scale infrastructure, even in remote municipalities and when faced with market price
fluctuations.
44
    FAS management was invited, for example, by the Government of Guinea-Bissau to assist in the preparation of its
first CDD-type Project and set up a MIS system modeled after FAS' SIFAS system (Interview with FAS
management on November 4, 2009).

                                                                                                                    8
02/07 approved in 2007. Based on the experience and lessons of MDC pilots, FAS assisted the
Parliamentary Commission for Local Development in assessing the progress made toward
participatory municipal planning and GoA's legal decentralization framework.45 Strong relations
have also been established with the Ministry of Territorial Administration (MAT), responsible
for the decentralization policy in Angola, and its Institute for Local Administration Training
(IFAL).46 In 2006, MAT invited FAS to become a formal member of its decentralization working
group and jointly prepare the curriculum and course to be delivered by IFAL to all municipal
administrators in accordance with the MDC implementation manuals. Finally, all 12 pilot
municipalities have reported their appreciation for their municipal development plans, which
have allowed them to better negotiate their priorities with provincial governments and coordinate
development and financing efforts.47
Challenges
31. The Project faced the following main challenges: (i) initial delays in the expansion to `new'
provinces due to logistical, human resource, and political constraints encountered by FAS in
opening new provincial offices and composing subproject portfolios;48 (ii) increased size and
complexity of subprojects as a result of a shift toward more `integrated' investments (e.g.,
teacher's housing, a health post, and an energy facility in addition to a school building); (iii) high
cost of doing business in most "remote" provinces (e.g., the price of cement in Luanda Norte was
about four times higher than in Luanda;49 and (iv) initial delays in the graduation of the first
MDC pilot municipalities from stage 1 to 2 due to limited capacities and experience at the local
level. These challenges were addressed in a timely, creative, and collaborative way by FAS
management and the IDA task team as further discussed in the implementation section below.
Mid-Term Review (MTR)
32. At the Mid-Term Review,50 a total of US$55.7 million had been disbursed, of which
US$45.4 million from IDA Credit (about 76 percent of the Credit), US$9.3 million from the EC
Trust Fund (about 17 percent of the original Trust Fund amount). The Project completion rates at
MTR were as follows: (i) under the CDC, 697 subprojects completed (44.3 percent of the EOP
target value agreed-upon during MTR) and US$31.5 million (36 percent) of funds disbursed; and
(ii) under the MDC, all nine selected pilot municipalities completed the second stage (out of five)
of the graduation scheme.51

   The planned expansion to all 18 provinces would have required a larger time horizon, especially given that some
of the provinces were not easily accessible and construction materials were not readily available (AM, November 23
­ December 5, 2006, p. 3).
49
   Aide Memoire, November 23-December 5, 2006, p. 3.
50
   The MTR was carried out in two parts: (i) a visit of FAS management to the Bank HQ in January 2006; and (ii) a
visit of the IDA team to Angola in March 2006. The first part of the MTR focused on: (i) fiduciary and safeguard
aspects; (ii) thematic and sectoral advisory meetings with Bank experts; and (iii) the QER. The second part focused
on: (i) implementation and strategic challenges as outlined in a MTR issues paper prepared by the IDA task team
and in the QER report; and (ii) field assessment of the Project design in relation to the PDO (May 12, 2006 BTOR).
51
   The graduation scheme was the planning methodology used by FAS to program the allocation and monitor the use
of the resources provided by FAS III to the pilot municipalities. The scheme comprised five stages, namely: (1)
Process Structuring, (2) Municipal Profiles, (3) Envisioning and Local Development Plan, (4) Municipal Investment
Program Execution, and (5) M&E and start of new cycle.

                                                                                                                 9
33. The main agreements reached during the MTR were:52 (i) no significant changes in the
design of the Project were proposed, given the Project's overall satisfactory implementation
performance to that date; and (ii) the importance of continued close monitoring the Project
activities to ensure the effective application of its approach and methods by all provincial teams
and partners. A detailed timetable was agreed upon to ensure the timely completion of all
subprojects and pilots prior to the Project closing date.53
Quality Enhancement Review (QER)
34. The QER panel's main conclusion was that "FAS staff and Bank team should be
congratulated on the high quality of documentation, clear and focused nature of the operation
and the technical depth of the QER discussion." According to the QER report, FAS has seized
opportunities in Angola to deepen and expand its impact, not only on improving poor
communities' access to services, but also on the institutional framework of the country. FAS III's
focus on bringing local governments closer to communities as well as on strengthening civil
society capacity to engage in decision making was highlighted by the panel as key to having an
institutional effect beyond the immediate subproject cycle activities. "FAS should declare victory
and seek to document as much as possible this best practice experience" (see QER Report in
Annex 5).
35.     The QER panel recommended for FAS management and the Bank's team to: (i) clarify
FAS' overall targeting strategy and reconcile the geographical targeting goals of the CDC `poor
communities' and the MDC `champion municipalities'; (ii) consider expanding the subproject
window to better include vulnerable groups, such as internally displaced persons and
unemployed ex-combatants; (iii) finalize as quickly as possible the planned national expansion;
and (iv) focus on ensuring the analytical basis for impact evaluation and the measurement of key
Project outcomes. Recommendations of the MTR and QER were taken into account by FAS
management as noted in the succeeding Aide Memoires.
C.       Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)
36.    Results Framework. The results framework was designed at a time when the country
began to emerge from a long history of civil war. Nine out of the country's 18 provinces had not
been under GoA control in nearly 30 years and were not readily accessible due to the widespread
destruction of transport infrastructure and landmines. FAS, hence, was expanding into literally
unknown territory. Household surveys were not available due to the lack of national statistical
data collection; existing national data was incomplete and its quality highly questionable. A
household survey, the first of its kind in Angola, was conducted in 2009, and its results will be



52
   The MTR assessment of each component provided the following lessons. In the case of the CDC (Component I),
the need to: (i) systematize the subproject processes and methodologies in order to inform partners; (ii) mainstream
these processes into provincial and municipal administrative practices; and (iii) prepare the ground, through learning
by doing and piloting, for the devolution of service delivery to municipal administrations was emphasized.
Regarding the MDC (Component II), the importance of: (i) continuing to provide FAS management with the
necessary expertise to ensure timely technical support to the provincial teams and partners; (ii) continuing to assess
the overall understanding of concepts and processes at government and community levels; and (iii) tailoring the
concepts and processes as well as technical assistance to the specificities of each province and municipality was
noted.

                                                                                                                  10
available in early 2010.54 Due to these constraints at the time of Project design, no baseline
indicators,55 control or meaningful counterfactual data were available and could, thus, not be
included in the Project's results framework in the PAD.
37.     The Results Framework evolved as part of an iterative process as more information
became available particularly about the `new' provinces, in accordance with the legal Project
Agreement, which stated that indicators were "subject to modification by agreement between the
Borrower and the Association."56 The Project's performance indicators were modified based on
the actual experience of implementing a Project in a rapidly changing post-conflict context.57
38.     Monitoring. While the absence of reliable national data was beyond the Project's control,
the M&E system (SIFAS) adopted by the Project proved to be functional and captured the
implementation of Project activities accurately and in a timely manner. The system recorded
technical, physical, and financial progress per province, investments location, sector, contract,
and amounts allocated and disbursed. The revision and fulfillment of goals established in the
annual working plan (AWP) were adopted upfront by FAS. The system was rated Moderately
Satisfactory (MS) throughout implementation, given its focus mostly on outputs, and
subsequently upgraded to Satisfactory (S) in the last supervision mission given its emphasis on
results. According to the QER report (Annex III, AM, MTR), the Project had a best practice
M&E system--particularly regarding outputs.
39.     Impact Evaluation. In the absence of reliable quantitative baseline, control, and
counterfactual data to evaluate the Project's outcomes, FAS chose a "second best" option for the
collection of qualitative data to measure the impact of the CDC by conducting beneficiary
assessments with smaller samples.58 FAS carried out beneficiary assessments in 2003 and 2006
and commissioned a Project impact evaluation in 2008.59 The survey analyzed child
anthropometrics and assessed health and education outcomes in the Project areas (see paragraph
54). To monitor and assess the impacts of the MDC pilot approach and applied methods and in
accordance with the component's learning-by-doing focus, FAS contracted a specialist who
systematically monitored the implementation of each stage of the graduation scheme and
assessed the related results, impacts, and lessons learned from each pilot municipality. This


54
   In addition, national censuses are expected to be conducted in 2010 and 2011. These data are expected to inform
the correlation between social indicators in FAS-supported communities versus control communities.
55
   Data that had been intended to serve as baseline only became available in 2006, almost mid-way through the
Project's implementation. In addition, no control or counterfactual data was available to indicate to what extent
these 2006 values already included Project effects.
56
   See Project Agreement, p. 17.
57
    It is important to note that subproject investments were determined through a demand-based, participatory
planning process. Hence, the number of subprojects and their sectors could not have been accurately predetermined
at approval. The changes in the targets that occurred during the mid-term review were therefore to be expected. This
flexible approach was supported by the QER panel which recommended adjusting the End of Project (EoP) targets
during the MTR (see p. 13 of the MTR AM, March 6-17, 2006). Nevertheless, the legal documents were not
amended to reflect those modifications throughout the Project life.
58
   FAS III ISRs pointed out the importance of establishing outcome-level baseline indicators, which were considered
"the backbone for a robust M&E system" (i.e., ISR, May 10, 2005); however, they failed to take into consideration
that robust data were not available. During the MTR, FAS III M&E framework was assessed in detail, and a
decision was made to carry out an impact evaluation.
59
   The 2008 impact evaluation consisted of two parts: (i) a `baseline survey;' and (ii) a follow-up survey one year
later. However, the consultancy delivered only the report related to the first survey.

                                                                                                                11
continuous assessment was instrumental in informing FAS management and the Bank team for
action and fine-tuning the MDC activities in a timely fashion throughout implementation.
D.       Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
40.     The Project was assigned a `B' environmental classification. Two safeguard policies were
triggered, namely: Environmental Assessment and Involuntary Resettlement. The respective
safeguard frameworks (ESMF and RPF) were prepared and disclosed in the country and in the
Bank's InfoShop according to Bank policy.
41.     While designated Bank supervision team members monitored the Project's safeguards
compliance on a regular basis, the supervision missions did not include environmental or social
safeguards specialists until 2008 prior to Project closing. The Bank's environmental specialist
assigned to review FAS III's compliance with safeguard policies conducted a rapid field
assessment in districts located in the outskirts of Luanda as well as a desk review of a small
sample of subprojects. Preliminary findings from the field visit and desk review indicated
weaknesses in the application of the safeguard tools by the visited provincial teams. Given the
small size of the sample, it was agreed that FAS would prepare a photographic assessment, if
possible, of all subprojects financed under FAS III. This task was still in progress in December
2009.60
42.     A November 2009 review of more than 20 infrastructures financed by FAS I, II, and III
conducted by the Bank safeguards specialist in Angola's southwestern province of Namibe noted
good siting and infrastructure construction in all instances. However, the review also observed
significant gaps in understanding of the purpose and use of the project's safeguard tools by
project staff.
43.     Based on these findings, FAS management and the task team in charge of the preparation
of FAS III's follow-on operation (namely the Local Development Program) have agreed on a set
of pro-active measures to ensure that the safeguards tools are user-friendly and fully integrated
into the activities of the new program. With the support of environmental and social specialists,
FAS is revisiting its safeguards manuals and is preparing a training program to be delivered to
the provincial teams and partners throughout the implementation of the new program.
Financial Management (FM)
44.    Financial Management. All Financial Management functions were carried out by FAS
including reconciliation of accounts, inventories of Project assets, contracting of external audits
and procurement processing. FAS was staffed with a team of experienced financial management
and accounting specialists who had worked in the two previous Projects. The Project maintained
proper internal controls, including the distribution of fiduciary responsibilities, and provided
adequate oversight throughout implementation. The management of Project funds, including
management of bank accounts, maintenance of supporting documentation for Project
expenditures, and production of interim financial reports, were rated Satisfactory throughout
implementation.61

60
   The photographic catalog compiled to date indicated that the majority of FAS III infrastructure investments were
implemented successfully and did not reflect (on the surface) any of the faulty construction or siting identified in the
subprojects developed on the outskirts of Luanda.
61
   Financial Management was rated Satisfactory throughout implementation, and erroneously downgraded to
Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU) in the final ISR due to the unsatisfactory performance of another Project

                                                                                                                    12
45.    Disbursement. The Project disbursed 99.8 percent of Bank proceeds and 64.4 percent of
the EC Trust Fund (35.5 percent or US$15.86 million of the TF were cancelled). IDA
disbursements followed a regular pattern, with two peaks, one in 2004 and another in 2005 of
Project execution. Disbursement slowed down in 2007 and
2008. Average yearly disbursements amounted US$10.7
million (16.6 percent of the funds).                               Box 1: Testimonies from

incorrectly attributed to FAS in a draft Bank Internal Audit
Report. Thus, despite the final MU rating for Procurement, the
closing Procurement ISR rating for the Project is Satisfactory
(S).
E.       Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
48.    Operation and Maintenance: FAS established operation and maintenance agreements
with respective provincial and municipal authorities as well as with user groups for each
subproject built or rehabilitated under the Project. According to FAS management, about 95
percent of the infrastructure investments funded under FAS III are functioning and being
maintained. After field visits to Project sites in four provinces, the August 2009 ICR mission
concluded that the majority of subprojects were operational.62
49.     Institutionalization of FAS III tested Approaches and Methods. As discussed in paragraph
30, the MDC's participatory approach and methods have been institutionalized in the new Local
Administration Law 02/07. With FAS support, the Parliamentary Commission for Local
Development assessed the progress made toward participatory municipal planning and GoA's
legal decentralization framework. The Ministry of Territorial Administration (MAT), responsible
for decentralization policy in Angola, has adopted FAS III methods through its decentralization

incorrectly attributed to FAS in a draft Bank Internal Audit Report (subsequently revised to correctly reflect that
there were no significant FM issues related to FAS in the final draft Bank Internal Audit Report submitted to the
Africa Region's Vice President). Because the final report was delivered (and this issue clarified) only after the
closing of FAS III, the last ISR had been archived and it was not possible to correct the last FM ratings to reflect the
continuously Satisfactory (S) performance of the Project. Thus, despite the stated MU rating for FM, the closing FM
ISR rating for the Project is Satisfactory (S).
62
   For example, the report of the August 2009 field visits to Benguela and Kwanza Sul states that 97 out of 112
subprojects are operational.

                                                                                                                        13
working group and the revision of the curriculum of the Institute for Local Administration
Training (IFAL). All completed Municipal Development Plans financed by the Project were
negotiated and co-financed by the respective provincial governments. Furthermore,
acknowledging FAS as an effective vehicle for participatory development planning and service
delivery and in light of their limited capacity to provide services in remote areas, the provincial
governments (e.g., Cabinda and Huambo) provided funding for FAS provincial offices aimed to
achieve greater coverage and to reduce intra-provincial disparities in the distribution of
investments.
50.    Follow-on Operation: In 2007, GoA expressed interest in a follow-on operation and
presented an outline to the Bank. In 2009, GoA pledged about US$60 million in counterpart
funding. The Bank is currently assisting the Minister of Planning and FAS in the preparation of
this new operation, the Local Development Program (LDP).63 It expands FAS operational scope
by further-extending basic services into Angola's most remote or underserved municipalities. It
also scales up and institutionalizes the MDC's tested approach and methods. Lastly, as part of
this geographical approach, the LDP broadens the extent of the work done and incorporates
economic and quality dimensions to service delivery.

                         III      ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES
51.    The following assessment of the project's outcomes is based on its intended objectives
and key performance indicators.64

A.     Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation
Rating: Satisfactory
52.     The PDO continues to have high overall relevance considering its quest for delivery of
basic public services to the poor in an inclusive and accountable manner in Angola ­ a priority of
GoA's Economic Growth And Long-Term Development Strategy. The Project design and
implementation also offered Angolan policy makers and experts the opportunity to test
mechanisms for improved provision of basic public services in a rapidly changing context.
GoA's request for a follow-on operation that aims at scaling up the innovative approaches and
mechanisms tested during FAS III shows its commitment to mainstreaming the FAS approach.
The Project's conceptual and technical innovations also inspired the strategies and investments
of other partnering institutions in Angola.




63
   The LDP, which will be managed by FAS, is in line with the country's long-term development vision (Angola
2025) and addresses the following key priorities: (i) the need for redressing both spatial asymmetries and social
disparities in accessing basic public goods, (ii) the importance of promoting a diversified local economy aimed at
improving social welfare, and (iii) the strengthening the capacity of local governments to provide quality services to
the poorest households.
64
   Due to these complex post-conflict circumstances, no meaningful baseline indicators, control, or counterfactual
data were available and could, thus, not be included in the Project's results framework in the PAD. [0]

                                                                                                                  14
Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Rating: Satisfactory
53.    The Project was successful in meeting the overarching PDO of "achieving improved,
expanded, and sustainable utilization of basic social and economic services and to support a
governance system where local government and communities can gradually become mutually
accountable." With respect to the second component, the Project's outcomes went well beyond
the PDO, given its significant overarching institutional impact as discussed in paragraph 67.
54.     FAS III's achievements are substantial, especially in light of the difficult circumstances
under which the Project was implemented: (i) physical infrastructures were in shambles, and
human and social capital eroded; and (ii) the country was run by a public administration that was
more geared toward war efforts than toward providing public services. Service delivery in
general was poor and inefficient, given the very limited institutional capacity, especially at the
local government level, and the lack of skilled staff, procedures, and systems. The Project's main
accomplishments are demonstrated by the following outcomes.
Component I: Community Development Component (CDC)
55.    Component I (a): Subprojects. According to 2008 beneficiary survey, 84 percent of the
respondents expressed a positive perception about the quality, access, and sustainability of
services supported by the Project.65 The CDC thus achieved its intended objectives of
"improved, expanded, and sustainable utilization of basic social and economic services" to the
poor as demonstrated by the following outcomes.
56.   Improved and expanded basic service provision in underserved and war-affected areas.
FAS III financed 1,575 basic social and economic infrastructures in 65 municipalities in all of
Angola's 18 provinces (see Table 1 below).66

59.    Component I (b): Vulnerability and Conflict Impact Assessment (CIVA). The CIVA
has satisfactorily provided operationally relevant information on the nature, scope, and the
impact of vulnerability at the community level. It also outlined concrete recommendations for
addressing the key challenges in tackling poverty and vulnerability in post-conflict Angola.
Through the publication of a first of its kind report and guidelines,71 FAS facilitated a national
dialogue on vulnerability in the context of service provision and local development. This
represents a relevant achievement particularly considering the limited understanding of the
concept. This represents a key achievement in an environment where understanding of the
concepts of vulnerability and collaborative efforts around it have been very limited.72
Component II: Municipal Development Component (MDC)
60.     The impact of the Project's "support of a governance system where local government and
communities can gradually become mutually accountable" was significant. At a time when
human capital and institutional capacity were at its low point, FAS III had a profound and lasting
influence on GoA's decentralization agenda as evidenced by the mainstreaming of FAS'
participatory development planning approach and practices.
61.     Improved sub-national public expenditure coordination and accountability. In an
environment marked by fragmented, poorly coordinated, and low functioning institutions, FAS
III emerged as one of the main agencies capable of convening and engaging local and provincial
governments, communities, civil society organizations, and development partners in a
participatory investment planning process. In an institutional environment characterized by a top-
down governance style and no prior history of consultations with communities about their
priorities, FAS III managed to legitimize the role of participation and community empowerment,
which was a significant milestone in the local governance reform process.73 For the first time,
municipal authorities were able to articulate and then incorporate their investment priorities (as
presented in the Municipal Development Plans) into Provincial Investment Plans.74
62.     Enhanced strategic development planning capacities of local administrations. The Project
strengthened the capacity of 12 municipal administrations in essential areas, including
investment planning and expenditure management, surpassing the end of Project target value of
nine municipalities as recommended at Mid-Term Review.75 The methodology employed paved
the way for GoA's76 requirement for every municipality to prepare and submit its respective
municipal plan as a prerequisite to receiving intergovernmental transfers. On several occasions,
FAS was invited by the Local Administration's Training Institute (IFAL) to deliver training in
municipal planning to municipal administrators. An agreement between FAS and MAT/IFAL,

    FAS III demonstrated that it is possible to put in place participatory investment planning processes without
undermining the hierarchical relationship between provincial and municipal tiers of governments.
75
   Due to its pilot nature as well as the real time it took for FAS to introduce its participatory local governance
mechanisms, the Municipal Development Component's targets were also revised from the original 18 municipalities
to 9 at MTR.

end of Project target was achieved with about 60 percent of the respondents expressing
satisfaction with the participatory process promoted by FAS.77 Beneficiary assessments indicated
that the participatory methods employed, such as the municipal forums, allowed community
members to interact with local government officials and voice their priorities in a structured
manner. The Forums established under FAS III have been institutionalized by the Local
Administration Law 02/07, which is a considerable achievement.

B.      Efficiency
64.     FAS' Management Information System (SIFAS) indicates that FAS has been a least-cost
vehicle for delivering basic infrastructure in Angola due to its clear and transparent fiduciary
procedures.78 The average unit construction costs of FAS-financed infrastructures were
significantly lower compared to those of similar programs executed by the Ministry of Public
Works. For instance, the unit construction cost for schools is nearly 50 percent lower and in the
case of health facilities, 65 percent lower than similar structures built by the respective line
ministries.79 FAS III's average infrastructure construction cost amounted to about one-third of
comparable cost of the provincial government of Luanda, for example, at US$67,356 compared
to US$190,600 (see Annex 3). In addition, the operating and maintenance cost of FAS III-
financed infrastructures tend to be below the equivalent cost of infrastructures managed by most
ministries and provincial governments.

C.     Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory
65.      This rating is based on the consideration that the Project: (i) outcomes were achieved, and
outputs were highly relevant to the reality on the ground and were largely achieved (see section
3.2); (ii) pioneered a local participatory service delivery approach in Angola and provided GoA
with seasoned advisory and technical expertise; (iii) maintained a Satisfactory technical and
fiduciary performance throughout its execution; (iv) enjoyed continued high GoA support, with
its activities fully integrated into the agendas of the Ministry of Planning, Ministry of Territorial
Administration, and other key public entities; (v) demonstrated its potential to be replicated; and
(vi) provided important lessons learned for similar future operations.

   About 78 percent of FAS III resources were spent in infrastructure investments (US$102.9 million), about 5
percent in municipal development (US$6.1 million), and about 12 percent in operational costs (see Annex 1).
79
   The unit costs for providing potable water varied significantly given the different technologies and types of water
sources across the country. On average, water points financed under FAS III are within the cost range of similar
facilities built by non-governmental organizations.

                                                                                                                  18
Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts
(a)      Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
Rating: Satisfactory
66.     FAS is considered by GoA as its main vehicle for rebuilding small-scale infrastructure,
creating employment, and improving local governance.80 The Project assisted the GoA in
addressing poverty reduction and social development issues in Angola by investing in: (i)
improving poor households' access to basic public services, including those living in more
remote provinces; (ii) strengthening sub-national institutional capacities for public services
delivery; (iii) increasing the peoples' voice in decision making; and (iv) generating employment
opportunities for the population in the Project areas.
67.     In regards to employment opportunities, according to SIFAS, a total of 19,375 jobs, both
permanent (11,215) and temporary (8,160) were created by FAS III.81 The communities that
benefited from the services provided have also benefited from both temporary and long-term
employment.82 This is particularly relevant given that Angola's oil-based economy did not
benefit the poor in the form of trickle-down effects and employment generation.
68.  While gender equity continues to be a challenge in Angola, FAS III proactively engaged
women in decision making through measures, such as by establishing quotas - two out of five
members of the community subproject committees had to be women (see Annex 2).
(b)      Institutional Change/Strengthening
69.     Strengthening institutional capacity was a key strategy for ensuring sustainability of the
activities and investments financed under the Project. To this end: (i) all civil works financed
were complemented by specific technical assistance; (ii) a distinct array of capacity development
activities was provided to strengthen human, organizational, and institutional capacities in local
development planning and expenditure management among public, private, and civil society
organizations at both the national and local levels; and (iii) it emphasized knowledge sharing and
access to information as critical elements for meaningful participation.83 Overall, FAS organized
251 trainings and workshops on a range of themes related to local development planning and
expenditure management.84
70.      The following long-term institutional impacts have been noted:


80
   PAD, pp. 5-9.
81
   These figures only include people that became employed as a result of FAS activities; they do not include FAS
staff.
82
   While temporary jobs are mostly related to the construction/rehabilitation of infrastructure, most permanent jobs
are in the public sector linked to the staffing of new or expanded service facilities. Most of the permanent jobs
created under FAS are found in the following areas: (i) education: school directors, administrative staff, teachers,
janitors, and guards; (ii) health: doctors, nurses, administrators, janitors, and guards; and (iii) other services: lawyers,
administrative staff, librarians, and guards.
83
   In addition to workshops and inter-institutional meetings, FAS communicated its implementation progress,
lessons learned, and other relevant information with its beneficiaries and partners through its bi-monthly newsletters,
publications, municipal portals, and website.
84
   A total of 7,200 individuals participated in workshops and trainings, about 40 percent of whom were subproject
beneficiaries, 30 percent were civil society representatives, 25 percent were public sector officials; FAS staff
accounted for about 5 percent of the participants (see Annex 2).

                                                                                                                        19
71.      At the Local Level, municipalities receiving support from FAS are better prepared to
fulfill their newly assigned roles in planning, budgeting, and procurement as well as in
monitoring of service provision.85 The Project assisted the participating municipalities in
mobilizing communities and establishing the municipal forums,86 which provided direct channels
for citizen participation in public management and facilitated empowerment.87 FAS also assisted
in the participatory preparation of Municipal Development Plans and the coordination of
activities with key provincial and municipal entities to ensure coherence, relevance, and
sustainability of the activities financed under FAS III.88 According to the findings of supervision
missions, the results of these FAS III-supported activities have been duly recognized and
endorsed by the participating municipal authorities, key stakeholders, and beneficiary
population. Throughout Project implementation, FAS developed ways to transfer and
disseminate its knowledge through manuals and to deepen capacity among municipal authorities
and officials.89 Furthermore, greater transparency in civil service employment policies was
evidenced in those municipalities where FAS piloted the Municipal Development Component.90
72.     At the National Level, FAS III provided advisory support to key central government
agencies for the review of the country's legal framework for decentralization (Law 02/07) and
for human resources enhancement (IFAL curriculum). Furthermore, the Conflict Impact and
Vulnerability Assessment (CIVA), the Index for Social Services Access (IASS), and the
Municipal Development Plans have provided national government agencies with effective tools
for participatory local development planning and management. The Project also brought together
national institutions, provincial and local governments, and civil society organizations--which
often did not collaborate--and forged a positive dialogue among them on local development
planning and management. This was one of the key factors that contributed to the satisfactory
outcome of Project implementation. The attained inter-institutional technical coordination was
also essential for the sustainability of the Project's results and for future similar initiatives in
Angola.
(c)      Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)
73.    One positive yet unexpected outcome of the Project was the institutionalization of its
municipal development approaches and methods in the country's new legal framework for
decentralization. Another unintended positive outcome was the impact of its participatory
planning and decentralized resource management on the strategies of partnering agencies. For
example, USAID/Chevron funded municipal development programs that were modeled after
FAS III's Municipal Development Component. Lastly, IFAL's adoption of the MDC
methodology was another positive outcome.

   The forums created opportunities for dialogue, civic education, practicing democracy, and representation of those
who were usually excluded from decision-making processes, and served as a demonstration effect of how
accountability mechanisms work in practice (Angola Local Governance Assessment Draft (2008).

   Civil society representatives participated actively in the design and implementation of all activities, including in
the preparation of the municipal profiles and plans.
89
   In addition, with FAS' support, members of the municipal administration in Benguela benefited from training that
enabled them to manage a municipal web portal that gathers socio-economic information about the municipality.
Other municipalities have since requested its replication, which is expected to be addressed under the follow-on
operation.

74.     Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
75.     Two beneficiary surveys were conducted during Project implementation. A 2007 survey
conducted with a sample size of 1,156 households from 156 communities in six provinces
focused on two aspects: (i) community perception of and participation in FAS activities; and (ii)
differences between FAS-supported communities in regard to child anthropometrics, education,
and health.91 A second survey was conducted in 2006 with a sample of 1,181 beneficiaries in two
provinces. The areas of inquiry included: (i) respondent perceptions on the impact of FAS
investments on their quality of life; (ii) general awareness of FAS and its approaches; and (iii)
general knowledge of decentralization and participatory planning.92
Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
76.      Sustainability: A sustainability analysis conducted at the completion of FAS II concluded
that 91 percent of the Project's investment was "fully operating with adequate, staffing, material,
and provision of recurrent cost."93 The probability of FAS III investments being sustained is
therefore rather high. From the outset, the Project's main sustainability strategy had been to
ensure that its activities and investments were embraced by key national and local agents and
institutions involved, and that its approaches, procedures, and activities were institutionalized.
Creating a sense of ownership through the participatory processes, for instance, by engaging
local populations in the preparation of the municipal profiles and development plans, was
another important strategy adopted to promote sustainability--particularly of the pilot activities
financed by the Project.
77.     Using `matching' funds for the provincial governments' co-financing of the MDPs was a
third important element adopted to ensure the relevance of the investments made by the Project
and future handover of their operation and maintenance to local institutions. The sustainability of
the Project investments and activities was further enhanced through the formation of strategic
partnerships with key government agencies, such as the Ministry for Territorial Administration
(MAT) and the Institute for Local Administration Training (IFAL), as well as partner
development agencies which had indicated continued interest in co-financing future FAS-
supported activities. Despite the positive Project outcomes, the long-term sustained
decentralization in Angola hinges upon factors, particularly political stability and the will of
future administrations that are beyond the scope of this operation.
78.     Human, Organizational, and Institutional Development: Strong evidence from the
beneficiary assessments, impact evaluation as well as supervision and ICR missions demonstrate
the extent to which the Project contributed to enhancing human, organizational, and institutional
capacities at the national and local levels through a robust program of capacity development. For
instance, the MAT/IFAL staff is applying their newly acquired knowledge in developing a new
curriculum and course for local officials. Civil society has been organized in structured decision-
making forums in the pilot municipalities. The Project-financed training in strategic planning and
financial management increased the capacity of local officials to effectively manage GoA's inter-
governmental transfers. It is worth mentioning that one of the most experienced FAS provincial

implementation of the current Project and in its previous phases.

           IV.      ASSESSMENT OF BANK AND BORROWER PERFORMANCE

A.    Bank Performance
Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory
79.     FAS III's design was fully aligned with GoA long-term development objectives and built
on the lessons learned from the previous two operations assisted by the Bank in Angola. The
Project pioneered the concept of a participatory local development and provided Angolan
officials, experts, and civil society representatives with new methods and tools for the
implementation of GoA's post-conflict/development initiatives. Furthermore, the Project design
addressed the existing institutional fragility through a carefully designed `graduation' approach.
In retrospective, the Project's expansion strategy would have benefited from a survey providing
more detailed information on the logistical and institutional conditions found in the new
participating provinces.
Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
80.     Supervision missions were conducted, for the most part, twice a year during Project
implementation in close collaboration with FAS staff and partners. The missions included field
visits and engaged specialized technical experts, partnering institutions, public officials,
community members, and civil society representatives. Fiduciary reviews were carried out at
least twice a year, and `no objections' were provided in a timely manner. Despite the continued
high-level technical and fiduciary implementation support provided by the Bank, the overall
quality of Bank supervision was considered Moderately Unsatisfactory, for the following
reasons.
81.     Due to an oversight on the Bank's part and subsequent lack of timely action, the EC Trust
Fund was partially cancelled and Euro 15.86 million of the original Grant of Euro 44.55 million
remained undisbursed (Project files).94 The oversight occurred because the closing dates of the
Financing Agreement signed between the GoA and the Bank (June 30, 2008) differed from those
of the Administrative Agreement (AA) signed between the EC and the Bank (January 31, 2007).
Recognizing this dilemma, the EC granted an extension of the closing date until December 31,
2007. While the Bank's request for a second extension in January 2008 was not granted, the EC
allowed the Bank to honor all contracts signed before December 31, 2007.95 As a consequence,
185 subprojects had to be temporarily suspended. In addition, FAS offices in five `new'
provinces were not staffed,96 and FAS staff salaries were cut by 60 percent for the remainder of

94
   In order to accommodate the retroactive extension of the EC TF's closing date and allow the necessary time for
the EC to authorize withdrawal applications of earlier expenditures, the IDA Credit's closing date was extended
twice, i.e., to June 30, 2009.
95
   Payments for these expenditures were allowed after that date considering that all subprojects were concluded by
December 31, 2009. This allowed the Bank to reimburse FAS III eligible expenditures. For a description of EC-
funded activities and results achieved see Annex 2, part II.

                                                                                                               22
the Project's life.97 This financing shortfall was promptly addressed by the GoA through
increased counterpart funding. In addition, FAS promptly devised an emergency strategy to save
costs by establishing `satellite offices' in support to the five `new' but unstaffed provincial
offices and putting in place a `mentoring' program in which the most experienced provincial
teams assisted the recently established teams.98
82.    In addition, the sudden death of the TTL in March 2008, three months before the original
Project closing date (and when nearly 97 percent of the credit proceeds had already been
disbursed), adversely affected the Bank's quality of supervision during its final implementation
and closing stage.
83.    While regular supervision and implementation support was provided until the end of
2007, and the continuity of the core Project team members resulted in the Satisfactory ratings of
the Project's fiduciary and the technical performance, the issues relating to the extension of the
EC Trust Fund, data collection for the impact evaluation, and not formally amending the legal
documents after the MTR were problematic.99
Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
84.    While the Bank's technical and fiduciary team members provided high quality support
throughout Project design and implementation, the rating for overall Bank performance is
Moderately Satisfactory given the above mentioned shortcomings in Bank management and
supervision.

B.    Borrower Performance
Government Performance
Rating: Highly Satisfactory
85.     The Project's design was fully aligned with GoA's development priorities, and FAS III
enjoyed strong GoA commitment, ownership, and active interest from its design and throughout
its execution stages, as reflected in the US$33.7 million in total counterpart contribution, four
times the US$8.25 million agreed at the time of appraisal. Furthermore, GoA institutionalized
civic participation as part of its Local Administration Law 02.07, through the creation of councils
for civic engagement modeled after the municipal forums introduced by FAS. In addition to
seeking FAS' advisory support in reviewing and shaping the country's legal framework for
decentralization, GoA also considers FAS an important partner in developing the capacity of
municipal administrations in participatory planning nationwide.
Implementing Agency Performance
Rating: Highly Satisfactory



97
   AM November 8-28, 2008 ISM, p. 6.
98
   The decision to establish `satellite offices' was further motivated by the recognition at Mid-Term Review that
there was not sufficient time left to recruit and train new teams in the remaining `new' provinces. This in addition to
the fact that construction cost in these provinces were higher than expected.
99
   Although the rating of the Bank's supervision performance generated discussion among the participants of the
ICR review meetings, the ICR rates the quality of supervision as Moderately Unsatisfactory.

                                                                                                                   23
86.     Project management was carried out by an experienced team at FAS, which processed
more than 8,000 contracts for works, goods, and services in an effective manner. The
employment of a decentralized implementation structure as well as of effective and transparent
administrative and fiduciary methods, the active involvement of local entities and partners, the
gradual transfer of its expertise and functions to local agencies, and the timely assessment,
dissemination, and incorporation of lessons learned throughout Project implementation are all in
line with good practices for Project management. In addition, FAS provided valuable advisory
support to GoA to advance its legal decentralization framework and institutionalize participatory
municipal planning.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Highly Satisfactory
87.     The Project has been rated one of the best performing operations of the Bank's portfolio
in Angola with a Satisfactory technical and fiduciary performance rating throughout its
implementation. The Project consistently enjoyed strong GoA support, and its approaches and
methods have been fully integrated into the agenda of key national government agencies as well
and in the strategies of partner development agencies.

                                    V.     Lessons Learned

The main lessons learned from FAS III include (see LDP PAD):
88.     Use of Pilot Activities ­ The iterative approach of the Municipal Development
Component's pilot activities was critical as it allowed sufficient time and resource inputs to
develop the capacity of local partners, while fine tuning the methodologies applied to the diverse
and rapidly changing local conditions. It also helped to build trust among stakeholders and keep
expectations realistic. The guidance provided by a highly qualified local development expert to
FAS management was critical to the successful design, implementation, and monitoring of the
Project's Municipal Development Component pilots.
89.     Commitment by Local Leaders to Civic Engagement ­ Building working relations of trust
and confidence in public officials at the provincial and municipal levels was essential to FAS
efforts in promoting effective civic participation in local development. Clear communication of
the distinct roles and functions of government and civil society and the way in which they are
brought together in a participatory process is essential to bring about recognition and legitimacy
of the adopted bottom-up approach of development process.
90.    Investment Sustainability ­ Community participation through FAS-supported Nucleus
Groups were necessary but not sufficient to ensure sustainability of improved infrastructure. FAS
III emphasized the importance of operation and maintenance and of linking it with investments
by coordinating planning with provincial and municipal authorities as well as to harmonize these
with municipal maintenance programs and budgets.

                                 Annex 2. Outputs by Component
I.         Outputs of FAS III Activities
According to the Results Framework in the PAD, the outputs of each component were as
follows:
Component I: Community Development Component (CDC):
       ·   (Component Ia) Quality community-prioritized basic infrastructure services provided, in
           use and maintained, in collaboration with MAs;
       ·   (Component Ib) Vulnerable groups, conflict impact and community demand for
           supportive interventions identified; and
Component II: Municipal Development Component (MDC):
       ·   Municipal administrations delivering accountable and sustainable quality services to
           communities along the CDD principles and in accordance with municipal development
           plans (PAD, p. 35).
FAS III's two components were, in general, satisfactorily implemented. The following section
summarizes the results by component and subcomponents.
A.     Component 1 - Community Development (CDC) (estimated US$87.5 million; actual
US$104.98 million). The CDC comprised two subcomponents: (a) Subprojects and (b) Conflict
Impact and Vulnerability Assessment (CIVA).
CDC Overview
Sub-component I (a) Subprojects. This subcomponent aimed to "expand and improve access,
management and sustainable use of basic social and economic infrastructure, improve
governance, and build social capital."100 In accordance with a Community-Driven Development
(CDD) approach, this subcomponent intended to finance small-scale community infrastructures
to be identified, prioritized, co-implemented, and co-maintained by the beneficiary communities.
Subproject investments included: (i) construction and/or rehabilitation of 1,575 basic
infrastructures for health, education, and water and sanitation; (ii) small-scale community and
municipal infrastructure, such as, public markets, public parks and sports facilities, and (iii)
environmental upgrading, for example, solid waste management, reforestation, etc. 101
In order to foster a meaningful dialogue between communities and local governments, and to
enable community members to make more informed choices on their investment priorities, this
subcomponent also provided communities, service providers, and partner agencies with a
capacity development program, which included training, workshops, and activities alike focusing
on themes such as social promotion, community mobilization, operation, and maintenance of
basic services and participatory local development planning.
The subcomponent also expanded FAS coverage from the nine initial provinces (i.e., "old
provinces"), where FAS has invested in the provision of basic infrastructures since its inception
in 1994, including Cabinda, Luanda, Bengo, Huambo, Cunene, Huila, Kuanza Sul, Benguela,
and Namibe, to all of Angola's 18 provinces.

FAS' expansion strategy followed a two-pronged approach:
·       Expansion into `new' FAS provinces. The Project's expansion was gradual, starting in
2004 with the establishment of provincial offices in four provinces (Bie, Malanje, Kwanza Norte,
and Zaire), with a portfolio of about 15 subprojects per province. In 2006, FAS expanded into
the remaining five provinces (Uige, Lunda Sul, Lunda Norte, Kuando Kubango, and Moxico),
with a portfolio of about five subprojects per province. However, due to the lack of resources at
the time they were established, these provincial offices were not staffed and `satellite offices'
were established in support to them. Those offices provided financial support and capacity
strengthening only to community-based type of investments.


·      Expansion within existing `old' provinces. Based on considerable demand from the
population and municipal administrations in the provinces where FAS have had a presence since
1994, FAS prioritized additional municipalities and communities within these so-called `old'
provinces.
The CDC also started to emphasize the importance of investing in `integrated investment
packages" which consisted of a combination of primary social infrastructures (e.g., school
buildings, health posts, and water points) and facilities (e.g., teachers housing, water, and energy
supply­solar panels) to ensure a sustainable operational unit and its optimal access and
utilization within the community. These integrated packages were provided mostly in the nine
`old' provinces.
Sub-component I (b) Conflict Impact and Vulnerability Assessment (CIVA). The CIVA aimed
to assess, on an experimental pilot basis, in a total of 10 communities "how the particularity of
the post-conflict context constrains or fosters social capital building."102 In order to carry out the
CIVA, the subcomponent financed a mapping exercise and a capacity development plan on
vulnerability as well as the preparation of social and economic vulnerability indicators. Proposed
training materials and a toolkit as well as training of trainers tailored to the identified needs of
municipal administrations were envisaged but not completed due to the lack of funding in light
of the cancelation of the third tranche of the EC Trust Fund.
The CIVA participatory assessment provided FAS and partner organizations with critical
information on: (i) the nature and scope of vulnerability at the community level, means for
assisting vulnerable community members, and the extent to which vulnerable population groups
have been able to benefit from infrastructures and services provided by FAS; (ii) the impact of
conflict at the community level and war-affected communities' commitment and capacity to
negotiate different viewpoints and engage in collective action around a common goal; and (iii)
the nature and scope of community demand for targeted support to vulnerable groups and peace-
building efforts.
CDC Achievements
The CDC's overall implementation performance was rated Satisfactory by the Project task team
and the ICR team given its positive impact on households' improved access to basic social and
economic services in 65 municipalities located in all of Angola's 18 provinces through the
construction and rehabilitation of 1,575 infrastructures. Table 1 below shows the breakdown of

In quantitative terms, as indicated in Table 2 below, the CDC surpassed the target recommended
at Mid-Term Review (1,565 subprojects) by 10 subprojects. According to SIFAS, as of August
2009, the total number of subprojects by sector are: (i) education 445 (28.3 percent); (ii) 380 in
water and sanitation (24.1 percent); (iii) 201 in economic and productive activities (12.8
percent); (iv) 188 in health (11.9 percent); and (v) 361 (22.9 percent) in `other' works, such as
bridges, tertiary roads, etc. (22.9 percent).

In qualitative terms, the CDC enabled about 2.3 million Angolans to gain access to basic social

                                                                                                        28
and economic services. According to the 2007 impact evaluation conducted with a sample of
1,156 households from 156 communities in six provinces:103
    · 13.8 percent of interviewed individuals perceived a reduction of health problems;
    · 16.3 percent perceived a reduction of the malaria prevalence;
    · 40.9 percent perceived a reduction of number of days lost to illness; and
    · 18.2 percent stated satisfaction with the school facilities.104
About 98 percent of the respondents also rated the quality of the infrastructures as good or very good,
and an overwhelming proportion of the respondents considered FAS-financed infrastructure either
well or very well managed.105
Beneficiary assessments conducted in 2005 in the provinces of Benguela and Cunene in a sample of
1,181 households, concluded that the main benefits gained by the communities with FAS III
investments were, in order of priority: (i) greater access to education (91.9 percent), (ii) greater
access to health services (57 percent), (iii) greater access to water and sanitation services (30
percent), and (iv) improved economic conditions (15 percent). Additionally, other noted benefits
were the decreased distance to health services (43.9 percent), and the reduced distance to reach
education facilities (40.6 percent).
Measures to ensure sustainable utilization were an integral part of Project implementation. Prior
to financing any new subproject, each FAS provincial team collected written commitments as to
staff needs and recurrent budget allocation from deconcentrated sector ministries and provincial
authorities to ensure that the infrastructures and/or service financed under FAS would be
adequately operated and maintained over time. FAS provincial teams also agreed up-front on
operation and maintenance responsibilities for FAS-financed infrastructures after their handover
to communities, with representatives from beneficiary communities through the nucleos
comunitarios.
In addition to the provision of service delivery infrastructure, the CDC created a total of 19,375
jobs of which 11,215 were permanent and 8,160 temporary (Table 3).

B.      Component II ­ Municipal Development Component (MDC) (estimated US$10
million, actual US$6.2 million) aimed to strengthen the capacity of local governments (including
municipal administrations and municipal forums) to become gradually proficient in the provision
of social and economic services to communities in an accountable manner.
MDC Overview
Municipal administrations, jointly with respective municipal forums, were the loci for
identifying and planning the MDC activities. Twelve pilot municipalities were competitively
selected by FAS to participate in the MDC: one municipality in each of the nine `old' provinces
and one in each of the three best performing provinces.
As one of the requirements, municipal forums were established, comprising representatives from
civil society at large. The forums played a critical role in ensuring that FAS III resources and
activities responded to the demands articulated by the communities in the pilot municipalities.
They were responsible for the joint preparation of the respective municipal profiles, Municipal
Development Plans, and annual budgets as well as for monitoring their implementation by the
municipal administrations.
Through the MDC, a strategic local development planning methodology (aka macro plan or
strategic participatory planning cycle) was developed and tested as an alternative to the
subproject cycle methodology previously adopted by FAS. Strategic planning was carried out as
a deliberative instrument, through which citizens engaged with local authorities in envisioning
their future and in promoting more transparent procedures for the provision of public goods and
services.

                                                                                             30
The methodology used a graduation scheme, which was based on a needs assessment conducted
in each pilot municipality, thus providing on-the-job capacity strengthening and resources for
participating municipal administrations to gradually build-up the expert skills and experience
needed to effectively provide and manage public services and goods.
At the core of this graduation scheme was a "learning by doing" process through which FAS
transferred its array of technical and management methods, public service functions and skills to
the municipal administrations.
The strategic planning cycle comprised five stages, namely: (i) Process Structuring; (ii)
Municipal Profiles; (iii) Envisioning and Local Development Plan; (iv) Municipal Investment
Program Execution; and (v) M&E and start of new cycle. The five stages were characterized as
follows:
·       Stage 1 ­ Process Structure. FAS provincial teams provided facilitation to municipal
authorities and Forum members in the identification and preparation of Municipal Development
Plans. As part of the process, FAS teams provided technical assistance (TA) and financed
selected consultancy services to support municipal authorities and Forum members in the
preparation of a communication strategy and a TA package tailored to the specific needs of the
individual pilot municipalities and Forums.
·       Stage 2 ­ A Municipal Profile was prepared by the municipal authorities and Forum
members with assistance from FAS provincial teams, to map the geographical and
socioeconomic aspects as well as service coverage information in the participating
municipalities. The profiles contained representation of socio-geographic stratification,
indicating relatively poorer and/or underserved areas that were used as the basis for poverty-
targeting MDC investments in the pilot municipalities.
·      Stage 3 ­ Envisioning. Based on the municipal profiles, the municipal authorities and
Forums jointly prepared, with assistance from FAS provincial teams, their respective two year
Municipal Development Plans with an agreed-upon medium-term development vision, along
with strategic measures and targets, and public investments necessary to achieve their vision.
Each municipal administration, with approval from their respective Forum jointly developed its
annual investment plan for FAS co-financing.
·      Stage 4 ­ Municipal Investment Execution. After screening the municipal development
plans, each FAS provincial team, municipal officials, and Forum members recommended
municipal investments to the respective provincial government for review and approval. As part
of the provincial government deliberations, FAS sought the assurance from sector staff and
municipal authorities that they would assume operation and maintenance costs of the prioritized
investments. Only then were civil works and goods financed by FAS.
·       Stage 5 ­ Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning was integrated throughout the planning
cycle. Information gathered through monitoring and evaluation was disseminated to the public as
a means of learning and improving accountability downward to communities.
Guided and supported by a Strategic Planning Coordinator in FAS Executive Management
office, FAS provincial teams thus assisted municipal authorities and Forums in: (i) the
preparation of profiles, development and annual investment plans in a participatory manner; (ii)
the integration of municipal budgets into provincial investment plans; and (iii) the coordination
with decentralized sector authorities at the provincial government level to ensure sufficient

                                                                                              31
budget allocation for operation and maintenance of the infrastructures financed under FAS III.
As expected, the pilot municipalities completed the planning cycle within a range of different
timeframes due to their varying levels of experience and capacity for local development planning
and management. The three provinces with a higher level of capacity (Benguela, Kuanza Sul,
and Namibe) a second municipality was selected; four other provinces had municipalities with
some capacity (Cabinda, Huambo, Huila, and Cunene) and two with lesser capacity (Luanda and
Bengo), respectively. Throughout the MDC implementation, FAS role was tailored to the
capacity of each of the participating municipalities and Forums, ranging from an intensive hands-
on learning-by-doing process to a more advisory support to key functions, such as procurement
of required contractors, disbursement of payments, and monitoring of progress.
Capacity development ­ in essential aspects of participatory development planning, public
expenditure management, and citizens' oversight of investments ­ was at the core of the MDC
process. FAS provincial teams provided hands-on support to municipal administrations and
Forums to enable them to jointly prepare, manage, and monitor Municipal Development Plans
and investment plans.
MDC Achievements
The MDC's overall implementation performance was rated Satisfactory in all ISRs and by the
ICR team as it has effectively established the mechanisms and practices for a participatory
governance system in which local governments are increasingly more accountable to their
constituencies. The MCD target, as recommended at Mid-Term Review, was to institute a
participatory governance system in nine municipalities. By Project closing, 12 competitively
selected pilot municipalities had improved their capacity to plan, manage, provide goods, and
monitor budget execution in an accountable and efficient manner as a result of technical
assistance and financing provided by the Project.
All pilot municipalities attained satisfactory levels of performance, completed the five stages of
the Participatory Investment Cycle, and finalized their respective municipal profiles as well as
municipal development plans (MDP). In addition, all pilot municipalities have improved their
local development planning competencies.
The Project developed an innovative capacity development framework which focused on
simultaneously enhancing individual skills, and organizational as well as institutional
competences. The capacity development efforts within the scope of the MDC focused on the
following four areas:
·       Articulate demands at the community level to facilitate participatory processes for
communities and their associated organizations to clarify and properly articulate their needs, and
the means for translating those needs into effective demand and actions. According to the 2006
beneficiary assessment, ICR interviews and assessments by local development advisors, this
process was instrumental in enhancing the ability of communities to negotiate ­ for the first time
­ their priorities with government interlocutors at public agencies.
·       Enhance service providers' accountability in relation to articulated local priorities by
strengthening the capacity of service providers, NGOs, municipal administrations, local partners,
and line ministries to respond more adequately to their constituencies and to ensure that these
responses meet the demand articulated by communities and the requirements for subproject
sustainability.

                                                                                                 32
·       Establish strategic partnerships to integrate and manage dispersed efforts, thus aligning
collective actions and coordinating practices among community-based, non-governmental, and
governmental organizations working directly and indirectly on service delivery in the pilot
municipalities.
·       Establish dynamic knowledge management mechanisms and platforms to exchange
information and lessons learned between policy makers and their constituencies by documenting
and disseminating acquired operational knowledge, experiences, and impacts as well as
establishing thematic debates on key conceptual and operational issues at community, municipal,
provincial, and central levels (i.e., the Portal of the Municipality of Benguela, and radio
programs in the Municipality of Vianna).
The MDC attained far reaching results in terms of enhanced local governance and improved
accountability in the pilot municipalities, especially considering the challenges it faced. These
included initial delays given that it took more time than expected to introduce a new working
methodology and ensure political commitment and adherence by provincial and sometimes
changing municipal administrations to the MDC approach.
The main achievements of this pilot experience can be categorized into four major areas: (i)
strengthened local administrations' strategic development planning capacities, (ii) strengthened
sub-national public expenditure coordination and accountability, (iii) stronger civil society voice
in decision-making processes, and (iv) enhanced local development policy making.
Strategic Local Development Planning ­ The MDC methodology has been considered
instrumental in enabling municipalities and representatives of civil society, for the first time, to
jointly engage in the decision-making process. In addition, it promoted a long-term and
geographic approach of development as reflected in the Municipal Development Plans.
Moreover, it allowed for improved coordination of provincial and municipal investment plans
and use of resources. As a result, several provincial governments, namely, Huambo, Kuanza Sul,
Cabinda, Namibe, and municipalities have requested that FAS expand this investment planning
approach to neighboring municipalities.
Local Public Expenditure Management and Accountability ­ The July 2008 Local Governance
Assessment report suggests that FAS III pilot municipalities are better prepared to absorb other
investment programs, such as the GoA's intergovernmental transfers (FUGEM), given that
Municipal Development Plans already reflect local priorities and articulated preferences. These
municipalities also seem to be better prepared to manage the process of basic service provision,
and to undertake competitive procurement and accountable contracting for local works and
services as well as monitoring of services provided. Nine pilot municipalities aligned their
planning cycles with the respective provincial governments' annual budgets, which permitted
timely integration of new service delivery units into investment planning, staffing, and recurrent
budgeting.
Strengthening of Civil Society and Public Accountability ­ The July 2008 Local Governance
Assessment report revealed that the municipal forum mechanism promoted by FAS was effective
in strengthening the municipal governance capacity in preparation for decentralization. In
practical terms, it confirmed the positive synergy gained by engaging public sector, civil society,
and private sector representatives jointly in budget formulation and public expenditure oversight.
Most municipal administrators perceived the municipal forum as value added to their
administrations by enriching the deliberations and decisions on local development priorities.

                                                                                                 33
All Forums are still functioning and some meet regularly, as in the case of the Municipal Forum of
Porto Amboin in Kwanza Sul, which has been able to raise additional funds from the private sector to
cover its administrative and community articulated demands, such as a bus service for students. The
Forum has also been active in ensuring employment opportunities for the youth through a partnership
with the Centro de Formação which provides information on existing job vacancies for youth.
Local Development Policy Making ­ The results of the MDC pilots exceeded initial expectations and
informed the revision of the 1999 Local Administration Decree and, as a consequence, promoted the
inclusion of civil society in decision making in the new Local Administration Law 02/07 approved in
2007. Based on the results of the MDC pilots' experience, FAS assisted the Parliamentary
Commission for Local Development in assessing the progress made toward participatory municipal
planning and GoA's legal decentralization framework.106 Strong working relations have also been
established with the Ministry of Territorial Administration (MAT), which is responsible for
decentralization policy in Angola, and its Institute for Local Administration Training (IFAL). In
2006, MAT inducted FAS to become a formal member of its decentralization working committee and
participate in the preparation of a curriculum and a syllabus to be delivered by IFAL to all municipal
administrators in accordance with the MDC implementation manuals. Furthermore, acknowledging
FAS participatory development planning and service delivery mechanisms, the provincial
governments of Cabinda and Huambo adopted FAS III's approach and methods to provide services
to remote areas of difficult access and previously not covered by FAS III.107
C.         Capacity Development Framework (actual US $ 5.1 million).
CDF Overview
Previously, FAS' capacity enhancement efforts focused primarily on individual-level training
activities. As part of the design of FAS III, however, a Capacity Development Framework (CDF)
was devised that embodied a new concept and a cross-cutting tool to address capacity
development challenges and needs at three levels: individual, organizational, and institutional.
The Bank's Operations Policy and Country Services (OPCS) office considered the CDF of FAS
III an innovative concept and commended the Project task team on its development and
application, given that there had not been any similar approaches recorded in Bank operations.
The CDF expanded FAS scope and range of activities to include a combination of capacity needs
assessments, training of trainers, peer-to-peer workshops, on-the-job training, field study visits,
networking, database development and data analysis, and the provision of equipment. Capacity
development also entailed technical assistance to and learning-by-doing training of municipal
staff and citizens involved in the Forums in participatory expenditure management. Capacity
development themes included: strategic planning, municipal profile and budget formulation,
investment programming and financial management, procurement of goods, works and services,
social mobilization, monitoring and evaluation, negotiation, environmental assessment, and
resettlement, among others.
Specifically, it entailed a learning process which focused on four inter-related aspects: (i)
enhancing technical skills and individual competences for managing assets and resources; (ii)
fostering organizational capabilities for collective action and civic engagement in local
development apart from infrastructure construction or rehabilitation; (iii) establishing
information sharing networks and knowledge platforms among key decision making and

collaborative partnerships and relations among municipal administrations, Forums, and other
government levels and sectors.
CDF Achievements
In quantitative terms, FAS carried out 258 capacity development activities of which 123 were
completed under the CDC and 128 under the MDC. During Project implementation, about 7,200
individuals benefited from FAS III capacity development activities, half of whom (3,108)
received formal training. The latter comprised members (1,196), civil society members (865),
public sector officials (836) and FAS staff (211). Table 4 shows the composition of training
beneficiaries, and Table 5 provides information on the capacity development activities by

FAS also produced a series of detailed user-friendly manuals on social promotion, participatory
local development planning, financial management, and environmental management related to
service delivery at the local level. These manuals have recently been adopted by the Minister of
Territorial Administration, and they will be incorporated into the main curricula of the Institute
for Local Administration Training (IFAL).
During the ICR field visits and beneficiary interviews community members mentioned that the
municipal forums had enabled them to participate in local development and interact with local
government officials. Evidence shows that this type of learning fostered and broadened
collective engagement in participatory action and strengthened the link between communities
and their municipal governments.
II. Outputs of FAS III Activities Funded by the EC Trust Fund (No. 053490)
Per the 2004 Administration Agreement signed between the Commission of the European
Communities (EC) and the International Development Association (IDA), it was agreed that IDA
would administer a grant made available by the EC to co-finance the implementation of FAS III.
The total grant amount was EURO 45.0 million, to be paid in three tranches of EURO 22.5
million, EURO 13.5 million, and EURO 9 million (see Administration Agreement, p. 1).
As described in more detail in Section 5 of this ICR, due to an oversight on the Bank's part, the
closing date of the Administration Agreement lapsed on December 31, 2007 while the closing
date of the Bank's Financing Agreement and Project Agreements was July 31, 2008. As a result,
Euro 15.86 million of the total original Grant amount of Euro 44.55 million remained
undisbursed (Project files). As Table 6 below shows, US$37.72 million were disbursed out of the
EC Trust Fund, which amounted to about 28.5 percent of the total disbursements under FAS III.

The objective of the EC Trust Fund was the same as FAS III's overall Project Development
Objective, that is, "to achieve improved, expanded, sustainable utilization of basic social and
economic services and to support a governance system where local government and communities
can gradually become mutually accountable" (Administration Agreement, p. 5 and Project
Appraisal Document (PAD), p. 2).
The Trust Fund was expected to support the implementation of the two main project
components, the Community Development Component (CDC) and the Municipal Development
Component (MDC), as well as institutional development. However, two-thirds of the EC TF
proceeds were to be used to support high priority social and economic infrastructure subprojects
in poor communities, within the framework of FAS III. In order to strengthen the poor's abilities

                                                                                               36
to better plan, budget, and manage their own development processes, the Trust Fund intended to
finance demand-driven community-based investments in education and health infrastructure,
water and sanitation facilities, markets and transport facilities, and construction or rehabilitation
of other social and economic infrastructure (Administration Agreement, p. 5).
In regards to FAS III's Municipal Development Component, the Trust Fund intended to support
the national decentralization process by financing technical assistance to strengthen municipal
administrations as well as by helping to enhance the capacity of FAS and its partners in M&E,
financial management, procurement, and operational capacities.
The Project's outcome/impact indicators were nearly the same108 as the ones contained in the
FAS III PAD, as they included: (i) primary school enrollment increased; (ii) access to and usage
of health services increased; (iii) access to and usage of water and sanitation facilities increased;
(iv) number of Consultative Forums (CF) created and functioning; (v) 80 percent of participating
municipal administrations achieving highest level (8) of performance by the End of Project, 40
percent by Mid-Term Review; (vi) number of municipal staff skills, competencies, and practices
improved; (vii) number of communities making use of FAS-supported mechanisms to hold
municipalities accountable; and (viii) beneficiaries satisfied with services provided by the
Project.
The expected outputs were as follows: (i) subprojects completed; (ii) report and agreed action
plan identifying demand for support to vulnerable groups in 10 communities; (iii) improved
CDD capacity in communities among partners; (iv) municipal administrations graduating
through capacity scheme; and (v) M&E system operational, timely disbursements.
In light of the fact that the EC Trust Fund co-financed activities within the overall FAS III results
framework, the outcome/impact and output indicators are essentially the same as the ones
contained in the FAS III PAD, which are described in great detail in Section 3, Assessment of
Outcomes, in the main text of the ICR as well as in this Annex 2. In addition, in line with the
synergistic co-financing nature of this Trust Fund, it is difficult to attribute the achievements of
activities FAS III (e.g., capacity development for community-driven development or support to
the national decentralization process) to individual funding sources (i.e., GoA counterpart, IDA
credit or EC TF proceeds).
However, given that the EC Trust Fund's main focus was to support community-driven
subprojects, Table 6 below depicts key information related to the use of funds and outputs that
are attributable to the Trust Fund. As Table 7 shows, the EC TF financed a total of 727
subprojects, which is nearly half (46 percent) of all subprojects completed under the Project. Of
these 727, 36 percent were in education, 14 percent in health, 12 percent in water and sanitation,
7 percent in productive/economic opportunities, and 31 percent in the `other' category.
The total EC TF disbursements on the rehabilitation or construction of community-based, small-
scale, and demand-driven service delivery infrastructure amounted to about US$32.9 million, of
which disbursements for education subprojects accounted for 47 percent, health subprojects for
13 percent, water and sanitation subprojects for about 4 percent, productive/economic
subprojects for about 6 percent, and `other' subprojects for about 29 percent (see Table 8 below).

In terms of the EC TF contribution to the Municipal Development Component, the expenditures
cannot be broken down by province, given that they entailed overarching expenditures, such as
capacity development for strategic municipal development planning. Examples of expenditures
include vehicles and IT equipment (goods, services, and equipment), consultancies (development
of training materials, training of trainers, consultancy services for the implementation of
Municipal Forums and study visits).




                                                                                           40
                        Annex 3: Economic and Financial Analysis
A. Financial Analysis of Community Development Investments
The financial analysis of the Project was carried out at the appraisal, following the standard
procedures applicable to investments made in public goods and services. However, an economic
analysis for the Project as whole was not carried out. As in the case of most demand-driven
programs, there are constraints to determining an economic rate of return (ERR) because the
portfolio mix and allocation outcomes are not known ex-ante. Moreover, calculating ERR for
social funds tends to pose problems given the diversity with which communities tend to choose
Projects. Although a minimum social rate of return could in principle be established, a cost-
benefit analysis at the subproject level is generally not calculated for social fund and other
similar CDD programs since these benefits are difficult to qualify or estimate at the micro-level.
Thus, as with the cases for subprojects in FAS I and II, due to difficulties in obtaining
meaningful data especially for estimating accrued benefits ERRs. At the program level, this
annex describes the experience with FAS III as a delivery mechanism, which is based on
information retrieved from SIFAS. At the investment level, the annex describes the economic
and technical analysis of investments carried out by FAS III. The annex also discusses the
economic and financial rationale associated with planned pilot activities in improving basic
services through strengthened accountability and promoting local economic development.
B. Economic Analysis of Infrastructure Investments
In accordance with its Operational Manual, and subject to minimum requirements agreed with
relevant sector agencies, FAS experts applied technical criteria, standard designs, and simple
economic criteria to determine subproject economic viability. This included application of a
comprehensive list of unit costs by type of investment. Ex-ante economic analysis also takes into
consideration recurrent costs and the financial sustainability of investments. For schools and
health posts, attention is paid to facilities having the appropriate staffing and materials prior to
FAS approval; provincial and municipal authorities are required to assume staffing and recurrent
cost commitments in writing. For water and sanitation and roads Projects, operations and
maintenance costs are estimated and willingness by communities to contribute through user fees
or direct participation is assessed. These sustainability measures were checked by desk and field
appraisals carried out by FAS technical staff as part of analyzing proposed investments.
FAS' design also fostered greater allocation efficiency in public expenditure compared to the
sector constrained and hierarchically organized public investment planning processes otherwise
employed in the Angolan and budgeting process. Through the promotion of participatory
decision making at the local level, FAS has empowered communities to allocate scarce resources
across sectors, thereby contributing to ensure that such resources are applied in response to
articulated local priorities. As such, FAS financed investments tend to fill gaps in service
coverage which would otherwise be difficult for the Public Investment Plans (PIP) to address due
to information asymmetries between communities and officials and provincial and central-level
planners.
Based on ex-post evaluations, 70.85 percent of the social and economic infrastructure investment
built from the beginning of FAS I in 1994 was found to be functioning well. During the FAS III
Project, according to the FAS III Baseline Survey (2008) results, over 98 percent of the
beneficiaries perceive that FAS built infrastructure to be good or very good. Over 93 percent
believe the infrastructure is well managed meaning that there is almost no perception of lack of

                                                                                                 41
transparency in management. 45.2 percent of beneficiaries have at least one family member who
participated in FAS meetings and 41.8 percent had at least one family member who participated
in some form or another in the construction of a FAS-financed infrastructure.
With the introduction of multi-year and multi-sectoral spatial development plans at the municipal
level, which begun during FAS III, further improvements were made in allocative efficiency and
the marginal return on local investments. This was attained by linking individual investment
decisions to a comprehensive territorial assessment of service access gaps and differentials
among community-clusters within municipal boundaries. Experience indicates that broad-based
participation foster local ownership, which, combined with other complementary activities that
FAS provided (such as institutional strengthening), enhanced sustainability of investments and
extended the life of the investment's benefits.
C. Economic Analysis of FAS as a Service Delivery Mechanism
Basic Infrastructure Provision
SIFAS indicated that by taking into account all construction and administrative costs and the
quality of the end-products, FAS executed infrastructures are in average lower than similar ones
provided by other government agencies and other organizations. Unit cost for school
construction is as low as 46 percent compared to Ministry of Public Works similar construction.
Unit costs for providing potable water vary significantly given the different technologies and
types of water points. FAS unit costs for health facilities are in average 20 percent lower than
those by the Ministry of Public Works. The following table provides a comparison of average
cost of infrastructure subprojects by sector implemented under FAS III with similar works
commissioned by the GoA/sector ministries. The average cost of similar facilities built with
donor funding in Angola was not available at the time of this assessment.

                              66,607.29                         182,645.75
In addition, SIFAS review of FAS investment programs indicated that:
   ·   FAS generally makes use of higher quality building materials and better construction
       methods, covers a range of geographic areas, and contracts out all of its construction
       work.
   ·   In all sectors, community contributions to FAS III investments are lower than the
       counterpart funding for infrastructures carried out by other agencies.



                                                                                              42
   ·   In comparison to other agencies, FAS has a more positive impact on the private and
       public sector, by setting point of reference, such as prices and transparency in the adopted
       procedures.
The data indicate that FAS has led the least cost approach for delivering basic infrastructure and
social equipment in Angola during period where conflict, poor logistics and high input costs
have been formidable hurdle to an efficient delivery in most of the countryside localities.
Average construction unit costs of FAS financed infrastructures are significantly lower compared
to similar programs executed by the Ministry of Public Works. For instance, school construction
unit cost is 46 percent lower than similar constructions by the Ministry. Unit costs for providing
potable water vary significantly given the different technologies and types of water sources at the
sites. On average, however, FAS provision falls within the cost range of non-governmental
organizations. Health facilities are also in a similar situation where FAS unit costs tends to be
about 20 percent lower compared to similar facilities executed by the Ministry of Public Works.
As to operating costs, during the course of FAS I, II, and III implementation, administrative, and
overhead costs have substantially decreased as a result of economies of scale and improved
management and planning. In 1998, operating costs were 25.7 percent of the overall budget, and
reduced to 8.3 percent in December 2008.

The analysis indicate that the Project has made a significant contribution in improving Angola's
poor households access to basic public goods and services, generated significant employment
opportunities--both permanent and temporary jobs--and assisted the GoA in collaborating with
civil society, NGOs, and the private sector in the delivery of a range of public infrastructures and
services. Given a favorable period of growth of the national economy, GoA was able to increase
its counterpart contribution to Project and, thus, overcome significant funding difficulties arising
from the suspension of the EC TF. The methodology and models of community participation
developed under the Project provide significant tools for the future expansion of basic service
provision to poor households in Angola. Management of FAS III has also adopted a set of
measures to ensure that public goods and services, including the new infrastructures, are
sustainable over time. This was attained by empowering local administrations working closely
with provincial authorities and the selected Project communities.

                              Quality Enhancement Review
                                      Panel Report
Introduction
At the request of the Angola Third Social Action Fund (FASIII) project team, the Social
Funds/Quality group at the anchor organized a Quality Enhancement Review (QER) on January
24, 2006 to facilitate collegial brainstorming on strategic and technical elements of design and
implementation aimed at strengthening the quality of supervision. In particular this review will
feed into the forthcoming Mid-Term Review.
The QER panel consisted of Maryam Salim (Chair, Sr. Human Development Specialist,
EASHD); Sandor Sipos, (Sector Manager, HDNSP), Jacomina De Regt (Lead Specialist,
AFTSD); Yasser El-Gammel (Sr. Operations Officer, MNSHD); Julie Van Domelen (SF
consultant, via audio connection in Colorado) and Andre Herzog (consultant, SDV). Non-panel
members included Samantha De Silva (Sr. Social Protection Specialist, HDNSP); Rodrigo
Serrano (Local Development Specialist, HDNSP); and Randa El-Rashidi (Operations Officer,
HDNSP).
The Panel met with Wim Alberts (Task Team Leader/Sr. Social Protection Specialist, AFTH1);
Mirey Ovadiya (Sr. Operations Officer, AFC03); Stefania Abakerli (Social Development
Specialist, LCSEO); Daniel Owen (Coordinator, CDD Development, SDV) from the task team,
as well as Victor Hugo (Executive Director); Henda Ducados (Deputy Director); Manuel Esteves
(Provincial Director) and Augosto Neto Sakongo (Provincial Director) from the FASIII
government team.
The issue paper prepared by the task team requested the QER Panel address the following issues:
Design Aspects
·   Appropriateness of design with respect to: (i) Program management; (ii) Implementation
    arrangements; (iii) Linkages and coordination with sector ministries and donors; (iv)
    Community mobilization/sensitization; (v) IEC; (vi) O&M mechanisms and sustainability;
    (vi) M&E; (vii) interface/division of labor between the social fund and the local
    administrations; and (viii) Knowledge Management in order to achieve the stated
    development objectives.
Community Development
·   Given the poverty/vulnerability profile of Angola and low administrative capacity in both
    public sector and civil society, should FAS expand its menu, which is now primarily oriented
    toward building social and economic infrastructure, and include other targeted interventions?
    If yes, what kind of programs and institutional arrangements would be relevant and suitable?
·   What can be learned from other social funds in terms of poverty targeting and inclusion of
    the vulnerable groups? What types of examples are available on supports for OVCs, youth at
    risk and female headed households?
·   Should the project move toward community direct financing? If yes, what should be the
    institutional arrangement? Should the institutional arrangements involve local government

                                                                                              46
    and use the institutional arrangements established by the Community Development
    Component (CDC)?
·   What are the elements of success for doing direct financing? Given the specific
    circumstances of Angola, should there be certain criteria applied in the selection of
    communities eligible for direct financing?
Municipal Development
·   What should be the FAS strategy to address MAT (Ministry of Territorial Administration)
    willingness to expand the FAS local development planning model to other municipalities?
    How can FAS learn from experiences of other SFs in scaling up their pilot municipal
    development activities?
·   How can FAS learn from successful experiences of SFs which have facilitated grant transfers
    to local administrations in an incipient decentralization process?
·   How can FAS learn from SF experiences that have proven to catalyze and improve social
    accountability in a highly centralized political environment?
·   What are some good practices/suggested mechanisms to improve participation/civic
    engagement in an incipient decentralization process? How can a SF better engage civil
    society to advocate for their preferences and hold the government accountable?
During the meeting, the task team and government team asked the Panel to focus on the
following in particular: (i) CDD vs. municipal planning ­ how to balance between the two; (ii)
geographical expansion ­ how to move forward given existing constraints; (iii) expansion of
menu; and (iv) addressing implementation constraints.
General Program Implementation
The FAS staff and Bank team should be congratulated on the high quality of documentation,
clear and focused nature of the operation, and the technical depth of the QER discussion (a
member of the Panel would have appreciated receiving some of the Portuguese documents as
well, but understand that they could not count on panel members speaking Portuguese). Clearly
the FAS has seized opportunities in Angola to deepen and expand its impact, not only in terms of
direct benefits to poor communities, but also to the institutional fabric of the country. Many of
the areas they are entering into, bringing local governments closer to the people and
strengthening communities' abilities to engage in improving governance, no doubt will have an
institutional effect beyond the immediate subproject cycle activities. FAS should declare victory
and seek to document as much as possible this best practice experience.
Decentralization and Municipal Development Component
The panel discussed with the FAS team the challenge of municipal strengthening given the timid
decentralization progress in Angola, as well as the need to make coherent CDD planning versus
municipal planning. The panel acknowledged that the constraints that FAS faced in getting the
pilot municipalities to the final stage really represent not an inability to meet project goals but
perhaps overly ambitious goals. Furthermore the Panel noted that municipal development is a
longer term process that involves building institutions, systems and getting local players
(including government, civil society organizations, and communities) to fully understand these


                                                                                                47
systems. Planning and expectations of this component need to be consistent with the nature of
this process.
The international experience with similar processes in social funds is that municipal performance
is uneven and progress depends greatly on the level of initial understanding of participatory
processes and the pace of the decentralization processes (political, fiscal and technical). As we
have learned, social funds are not well placed to 'drive' decentralization in a country. At best,
they can be a complimentary instrument once a sound decentralization framework has been put
in place and where there is strong government ownership of reforms.
The panel warned FAS that they would have to negotiate between trying to push decentralization
beyond where the national framework is, or get sidelined as decentralization takes hold and be
seen as in competition with municipal governments.
The panel congratulates FAS on successfully managing this process thus far. It is important for
the FAS to document the process as the implementation progresses since a methodology is being
developed during this process. The establishments of the forums, the way different players are
reacting and forming their expectation are all lessons that need to be documented. If some
standardization can be introduced to some stages/parts of the municipal strengthening process,
this should be focused on to facilitate replication in the future. The FAS also needs to develop
assessment tools to be able to realize the level of achievement of goals of this component. There
are other experiences in this area in the World Bank that the FAS can learn from.
FAS has become a key stakeholder in designing the decentralization process in Angola and needs
to retain this engagement. Specifically, the municipal planning process being piloted in 41
municipalities should be made compatible with the FAS experience and procedures. In looking
ten years down the road, if the experience in Angola is similar to other countries, pressure will
come from municipalities. This does not mean that FAS will phase out, however. Even in the
most highly decentralized and high income countries, like the US, there are a plethora of national
programs that transfer funds through local governments or directly to community groups/NGOs
for a host of social and economic objectives.
Community Direct Financing
The FAS should consider deepening the responsibility of communities within the subproject
cycle. Lessons of experience from around the world show that there could be significant benefits
to this, including (a) a savings of 25-40 percent on average subproject costs; (b) a stronger
impact on local social capital formation, which is all the more important in a post-conflict setting
like Angola; (c) creation of local economic multipliers in poor communities, including a greater
propensity to use local contractors and hire local labor; (d) better chance of meeting FAS's
objective of strengthening communities from the bottom up and enabling citizens to better
interface with local government and to hold public officials accountable; and (e) increases
technical and administrative skills in poor communities, including the confidence to approach
banks, bureaucrats, elected officials, etc.
The FAS team expressed some questions on what conditions or settings work better for putting
in place direct community financing for instance. Experience shows it has worked well in every
setting where it has been tried, from middle income countries (like Argentina and Brazil) to the
poorest countries (like Lao PDR, Malawi), including post-conflict settings (e.g., Sierra Leone,
Afghanistan, East Timor). The most difficult obstacles are the administrative and organizational

                                                                                                 48
challenges to a social fund to change the way it operates. FAS may want to experiment on a
pilot basis, for example in certain rural areas.
Some key elements for successful implementation of direct financing:
   1. Extensive training of communities;
   2. Putting social accountability mechanisms, such as community score cards, into the
      normal subproject cycle;
   3. Working closely with procurement advisors to ensure they do not hinder the community
      procurement process (for example, if they insist on three quotes for every purchase, in
      every instance, you will face major difficulties in moving forward in the more remote
      areas. Insist on direct purchase possibility below a certain amount to get around this
      obstacle and make sure that the communities have access to reasonable unit costs so they
      can control/bargain greed/corruption by monopoly suppliers);
   4. Be sure to check what is needed for communities to open up a bank account. In
      Mozambique they needed three signatures and a deposit but at same time were told they
      needed a bank account to make the first disbursement for the subproject (chicken and egg
      problem). By contrast, in the DRC where there are no local banks for bank accounts they
      were able to get agreement in the CDD project (MAP) to use the coffres of the local
      diocese and the money was transported to the diocese (check with John Elder to see how
      this is operating). There are precedents to get around the bank account problem; examples
      exist in other regions as well.
   5. You may want to gradually move to community direct management as bank account
      problems are solved and training has been completed. You could also tell the community
      they are invited to submit one proposal which FAS would manage and a much smaller
      one which they would manage. If they did well, their next project they would be allowed
      to manage, so you have incentives to do well and to learn by doing.
Poverty Targeting
Time did not permit a detailed discussion about poverty targeting, but since the FAS team had
flagged that as an issues in the MTR issues paper, the panel wanted to provide a few suggestions.
The overall targeting strategy of FAS is not clear. On the one hand, the evolving post-conflict
means that there will be more and more opportunities for FAS to reach national coverage as
areas become more accessible. These areas are also the poorest and most remote, so expanding
geographically will likely improve FAS's ability to reach poor communities. On the other hand,
the municipal development component appears to focus on developing some best practice
examples of municipalities that are able to take on more and more of the project cycle
responsibilities. This puts the emphasis on the better off municipalities. These conflicting
geographical targeting goals will need to be reconciled. This depends on the importance FAS
puts on orienting resources to poor communities. The PAD for FAS III does not make much
reference to targeting, though it does mention an objective of reaching poor communities. The
aide memoires state that FAS is in the process of developing a map of social service coverage of
social services (IASS) as well as a map of vulnerability. It is not clear to what extent these maps
will be used to orient resources.
A reasonable targeting strategy for the FAS team to consider might include:


                                                                                                49
   a) Setting a clear objective of developing operations in all of the poorest provinces, as a
      priority for future expansion. Since it is in the poorest provinces and municipalities
      where FAS will remain most relevant in the longer term, this would help solidify FAS's
      niche in terms of helping reach national objectives to increase access to services and meet
      MDGs (and not just strengthen municipalities to transfer responsibilities to them).
   b) To provide predicable resource flows, FAS should, if it does not do this already, set a
      notional annual target for financing per province that participates in its program. This
      should be progressively tilted on a per capita basis toward the poorest provinces so that
      FAS can stake a claim to being a pro-poor program.
   c) In terms of making sure that FAS investments tend to benefit poor households within
      communities, the menu of eligible investments should be reviewed. International
      evidence strongly suggests that some types of investments, like sewerage, tend to be
      enjoyed primarily by better-off households, and some, like latrines, tend to be used
      mainly by the poor.
   d) Build a focus on participation of the poor into the subproject cycle. The CIVA points
      out that the poorest and most vulnerable households tend to participate less in community
      development activities. Moreover, some recent research based on data in Ecuador show
      that in settings of higher income inequality (relevant to the Angola context), subprojects
      that overwhelmingly benefit the poor tend not to be chosen in the identification of
      community priorities. There are many ways that social funds have attempted to create
      more inclusive processes. In the community needs assessment/participatory planning
      process, issues of vulnerability and needs of vulnerable groups can be made specific
      topics of community discussions. Several social funds require a minimum percentage of
      the community be present when subproject ideas are generated and discussed. Many
      social funds require that a certain number or percentage of women. In Senegal, the
      planning process identifies vulnerable groups (elderly, female-headed households etc.) in
      the village are requires that there be representation of these groups in the community
      committees. Other social funds provide bonuses to communities that present projects
      benefiting vulnerable or poorest groups. The beneficiary assessments are an excellent tool
      to get feedback on the extent to which the poorest households participate in the processes
      and enjoy the benefits of social fund investments.
Vulnerability and Vulnerable Groups
On related topic, the team asked the panel if FAS should expand its menu to better include
vulnerable groups. Per the CIVA, one the biggest vulnerable groups in Angola are internally
displaced persons and the unemployed ex-combatants, not only because of the potential to spark
future conflicts, but also ­ per the CIVA ­ due to the social isolation of internally displaced who
have often lost their links to family and social networks to help with their survival.
In terms of addressing vulnerable groups there are several options:
   a) The FAS could open a separate vulnerability window. Social funds like the Honduras
      FHIS have set up such special programs to help fund efforts mainly of established NGOs
      and that assist youth, street children etc. The Thailand Social Investment Fund supported
      CBOs in providing grants to the elderly, AIDS orphans, etc. Given the current mission of
      FAS, this may overcomplicate the project design. In terms of social services ­ like

                                                                                                50
       addressing street children or orphans, needs of these groups rarely come up in community
       needs discussions; and, they often require the intervention of skilled intermediary
       organizations, most often NGOs.
   b) The FAS could open up the menu ­ basically operating with just a negative list ­ and see
      what happens. This will require expanding FAS technical capacity to appraise a more
      diverse set of subproject proposals. Experience from other countries suggests that there
      will be some diversification, with certain communities identifying interesting
      interventions (community radio in rural areas, training of community health workers to
      improve services, etc.) that extend beyond the typical infrastructure. But in all cases,
      basic infrastructure continues to be the core demand from communities.
   c) FAS could establish an incentive framework to encourage communities to include
      vulnerable groups in their investment priorities (Samantha's examples from Afghanistan
      and Sri Lanka).
   d) or build it as an issue in community planning and project cycles (see discussion under
      poverty targeting section).
   e) partner with organizations such as the Ministry of Social Affairs or the demobilization
      and reintegration project to identify joint-ventures like FAS building infrastructure
      (shelters for instance) administered by Social Affairs or identifying unemployed ex-
      combatants as workers for FAS infrastructure projects.
In any case, given Angola's need for basic infrastructure (i.e., safe water access to only 38
percent of the population, degraded urban infrastructure, post-conflict zones that require massive
reconstruction efforts), the FAS should anticipate that basic infrastructure (education, water
health etc.) will continue to represent community priorities for the foreseeable future. In this
situation, the best path may be to open up to a negative menu (i.e., do not exclude non-
infrastructure investments), mainstream the issue into the community planning process and look
for some strategic partnerships with the Ministry of Social Affairs or key NGOs, rather than
creating a separate window at this stage.
Issue of FAS expansion ­ go deep or wide?
The FAS needs to move as quickly as possible to full national coverage. The FAS team
explained the current uneven coverage where some communities/provinces have not had any
experience in CDD-type approaches. In terms of expanding to new provinces, even if for
remoteness or other factors certain regions are only accessible six months a year, those regions
are going to be the poorer areas and so should have FAS priority. FAS may need to look at
varying the institutional model for expansion, since it may be that not all provinces can have a
separate office.
At the same time FAS III pilots municipal planning experience where municipalities are more
capable, cohesive and more receptive. In deciding on expansion paths (deep versus wide), in fact
FAS will be obliged to progress in both directions. FAS will need to use the next two to three
years (to project closing) to do two things (a) consolidate issues of municipal capacity building
and be present in evolving national discussion and mechanisms, and (b) set the intention to have
national scope in FAS IV, first at community level. On the municipal front, FAS should be less
concerned with the number of municipalities that get to the final stage given timid and evolving
decentralization process. It is more important that FAS engage in the design of the

                                                                                               51
decentralization process in order (a) to bringing the lessons of experience so that it is not just a
theoretical discussion, (b) to ensure participatory mechanisms are mainstreamed ­ so that there is
not a FAS planning process that is different from a national planning process, and (c) to avoid
being `sidelined' and thus viewed as irrelevant to the decentralization process or antithetical to it.
That being said, the panel was of the opinion that the FAS should not add new municipalities to
its MD component but rather focus on building on the nine provinces experience and
documenting the process and outcomes.
On the expansion of the current "menu options" the panel had the following comments:
   ·   As already noted above, the current portfolio is consistent with the situation in Angola
       and is similar to other Social Funds operating in similar environments.
   ·   The portfolio also reflects the demand coming from the field which is an important
       feature of SFs operations.
   ·   It is important that the FAS standardize its process as much as possible in sectors which
       receive a large percentage of the funding (i.e., education and water).
   ·   Given the experience so far, the development stage in which Angola is in, and the
       competing demands on the FAS capacity the panel is of the opinion that a large increase
       in the "menu options" is not advisable. The FAS should continue to focus on its core
       areas and the basic needs of the poor population.
   ·   That does not, however, prevent the FAS from piloting activities in new sectors. These
       pilots however need to be on a limited scale, in a relatively favorable environment, and
       most importantly, need to have a clear objective.
Monitoring and Evaluation
At the MTR, it will be important to confirm that all monitoring and evaluation of FAS is
functioning and able to provide adequate project reporting, furnish required indicators of project
output and outcome and develop insights into the design of a FAS IV. From the team, it appears
that monitoring is on track and that FAS has a best practice MIS system. Specific evaluations
are carried out periodically ­ Beneficiary assessments, review of the municipal program, etc.
FAS appears to have done well in integrating GIS information as well. One panel member
suggested that GIS has the potential to really assist all of us working in Social Fund/CDD type
operations to move decentralized decision making forward and that we have not yet realized the
full potential of this tool. FAS has all its project data geo-referenced, and hopefully there are
geo-reference data on the stock-taking of service availability, the mines and de-mining, the
poverty data. FAS seems to have geo-referenced all information in the nine pilot municipalities.
This is the opportunity to build a full pilot to showcase the power of this technical tool. In
Mozambique for example, all the staff in the secretariat of the National AIDS Council have GIS
software on their desktops; the information of the next census will also be geo-referenced in
down-loadable form, and they already have the capacity to do quite a bit of analysis on the
epidemic and their local response mechanisms with the information they have. Building a
platform inside the country for coordination of geo-referencing all data is something FAS should
not have to champion alone. Colleagues from PREM as well as sectoral colleagues should all be
interested in this. It could potentially be built into the next emergency credit phase.



                                                                                                   52
While the monitoring system may be best practice, it was less clear what the analytical basis for
impact evaluation and the measurement of key project outcomes, particularly in the area of
expanded access to and utilization of services and changes in household welfare (health and
education status, income etc.) and to measure the relative poverty level of beneficiary
households. From other documents (e.g., TSS) it appears that there is limited national
statistics/surveys, for example the TSS states that the latest household survey was published in
2001. If this is still the case, it will limit the ability to do a full impact evaluation since you will
not have the national dataset to create counterfactuals. To do a proper impact evaluation, you
need a with and without, and a before and after. It is not necessary to do the full `Cadillac' of
impact evaluations ­ a randomized experimental design. Sufficient rigor can be introduced using
quasi-experimental designs. However, the experience is that this takes a great deal of time and
technical expertise to set up. If FAS wants to have data that can feed into the preparation of the
next operation, they need to start already in defining terms of reference, identifying survey
possibilities and consultants with the technical capacity to carry out the econometric analysis.
Since it is not clear where the FAS stands in terms of putting in place the means to measure
impacts, the Panel recommends that:
   a) FAS should consult HDNSP's Impact Evaluation Toolkit for Social Funds and set up a
      video conference with the impact evaluation specialists within the Bank to discuss
      options and approaches;
   b) Per the last aide memoire, the existence of baseline indicators of the communities in
      which FAS operates should be confirmed in terms of the robustness in how they are
      calculated;
   c) Ideally, the community and household surveys are integrated both into a national
      household survey (hence critical to identify when and if a national survey is planned) and
      to any qualitative Beneficiary Assessments planned;
   d) Before project end, another sustainability survey (2002 is too old) should be carried out,
      which could be done as part of the impact evaluation;
   e) Given the importance of social capital in a post-conflict setting, this should be a separate
      theme of the impact evaluation; and
   f) The Bank team should staff next mission with impact evaluation specialist.
Some General Comments
Mid-Term Review. The focus of the MTR is not so much reviewing progress and adjusting the
objectives and outcomes and modalities to ensure a better implementation for the rest of the
project implementation period, but more an opportunity for thinking about the future of FAS ­
specifically FASIV. This MTR is about political positioning, as much within the country
program inside the World Bank, as within the government for the future of the CDD approach in
decentralization and future of FAS as an agency within such a devolving and evolving scene (see
developments of the Senegal and Madagascar Social Funds; both countries are moving toward
having a Local Development fund in their normal budget make-up kind of integration of
community plans into a local development plan at the LG level). FAS is uniquely placed to
influence whether or not this integration of the CDD approach into the normal business of
government will take place.


                                                                                                     53
So, this MTR should be planned with two stages: first, with the appropriate technical people,
where all the technical implementation issues are discussed (e.g., menu expansion; geographical
expansion; role of facilitators in subproject choice, etc.) but above all a second stage should be
planned as a political/policy influencing event, where you declare huge victory (loads of positive
achievements) and project the future.
Name change. FAS is a brand name known throughout most parts of Angola and identified with
excellence. It would be a shame to change the name to anything else and lose name recognition!

                          Annex 6. Beneficiary Survey Results
                                    Abstract from:
                            The FAS III Baseline Survey by
     Jean-Louis Arcand, Eric Dkimeu, Marie-Charlotte Buisson, Aude-Sophie Rodella
                                  February 14, 2008
        "This report, based on the 2007 FAS III baseline surveys, highlights a number of findings
concerning: (i) beneficiary assessment of and participation in FAS activities and infrastructure
and (ii) the impact on child anthropometrics, health and education associated with treatment by
the FAS. The following results stand out: first, knowledge concerning the FAS is widespread
among respondents in areas in which the program intervenes, and poor in areas in which it does
not; in the latter areas, households that can be characterized as being poor appear to be those
most aware of the program's existence.
Second, the assessment by beneficiaries of the quality of FAS funded infrastructure per se, and
its management, displays great heterogeneity among different classes of households, as well as
between communities with different characteristics. In general, households that are poor in
monetary terms appear to be very satisfied with FAS infrastructure, larger households less so,
while educational attainment appears to have almost no incidence on perceptions. One's area of
economic activity is a key factor, with households benefitting directly from FAS projects, such
as those operating in the health sector being relatively favorable, whereas those perhaps
perceiving a crowding out effect (such as those in the NGO sector) being relatively more critical.
Peer effects, in terms of the impact of membership in various groups and associations, appear to
be an important determinant of perceptions, while households that include a soba are
overwhelmingly negative in their assessment.
        Third, participation in FAS meetings is strongly associated with households that are used
to engaging in community activities, as shown by their participation in groups that display these
qualities. Moreover, as with participation in FAS meetings, being part of the núcleo comunitário
is associated with membership in groups that are engaged in social (as opposed to purely
economic or rent-seeking) activities, with elite capture concerns appearing not to be an issue.
Participation in the construction of FAS projects is the purview of relatively younger households,
with little education and who are relatively poor in monetary terms. Social exclusion, meaning
here not being solicited by one's own community to participate in the construction of FAS
infrastructure projects, is the lot of households that are relatively large, that are headed by a
widow or a widower, that are in the lower monetary income bracket, that are involved in petty
commerce, that have a member who belongs to a funeral insurance or religious group and not to
a political group, and who do not count a soba among their members.1
        Fourth, treatment by the FAS appears to be associated with a strong positive effect on
MUAC height z scores, effectively compensating for almost all of the shortfall in nutritional
status encountered in the sample.
       Fifth, treatment by the FAS appears to be associated with a reduction in malaria
prevalence of 16.3 percent, and with an increase of 13.8 percent in the likelihood of a respondent
encountering no health problems.



                                                                                                55
       Sixth, treatment by the FAS appears to be associated with an extremely large 40.9
reduction in the number of days lost to illness.
        Seventh, while treatment by the FAS is not associated with any statistically significant
impact on the ability to keep schoolchildren in school, on literacy rates, or on educational
attainment, it is associated with a small fall in the number of school days lost, and with a
reduction of 18.2 percent in the likelihood of respondents identifying poor school buildings as
constituting a problem.


Executive Summary of 2006 Participatory Beneficiary Assessment
(Excerpt from the 2006 Participatory Beneficiary Assessment ­ Translated from Portuguese)
The Social Action Fund (FAS) is a government agency established in October 1994, with legal
personality and administrative and financial autonomy, aimed at combating poverty through
financing basic social infrastructures.109 Since its inception, FAS has financed the construction
and/or renovation of 2.300 social infrastructures in the fields of education, health, water and
sanitation, economic and production support infrastructures. Currently, FAS is implementing its
third phase, with the financial support of the Government of Angola, the World Bank (loan),
besides grants from the EU, other bilateral agencies and the private sector. Thus, in order to
guide its future community development line of action, it ordered a mid-term beneficiary
participatory assessment of phase three, FAS III. The sample of this assessment was undertaken
in Benguela and Cunene Provinces, covering a total of 38 Projects.
This report outlines the outcomes of the said assessment, the objectives of which were: i) collect
perceptions and opinions on the outcomes of the third FAS loan, and ii) monitor information
directly related to the new objectives and components of FAS III.
The perceptions and opinions of the Project beneficiaries were collected using a combination of
quantitative (survey administration) and qualitative (focal group discussions and individual
interviews of key interviewees) methods. A total of 1181 beneficiaries were interviewed of the
1251 planned; and 43 individual interviews and 19 group discussions were conducted.
An analysis of this data reveals that:
FAS is widely known and the perceptions of the beneficiaries on the agency converge in the
recognition of its positive impact on the enhancement of the conditions of life through the
improvement of access to education, health, water and sanitation services and improvement of
economic conditions.
In spite of the widespread knowledge of FAS, few beneficiaries are aware of the procedures used
to identify Projects, although they are considered as easy, accessible and transparent by
beneficiaries that know them.
There is a lot of active participation in Projects financed by FAS, but community members
generally feel less involved than members of the community nuclei, municipal fora and partners,
who have low participation in decision-making processes in some municipalities.

109
   Africa Legal clarified in their written comments of December 2, 2009 that: "The Social Action Fund (FAS) is a
government agency that enjoys legal personality, and is under the control and jurisdiction of the Angolan Ministry
of Planning. It was created through the approval of Angolan Decree Number 44/94, on October 28, 2004."

                                                                                                               56
FAS totally or partially meets the expectations of the community, translating to a high level of
satisfaction with the Projects financed. However, the beneficiaries are more satisfied with the
quality and access to infrastructures than with management, maintenance and participation of the
municipal administrations.
There is basic knowledge on decentralization, good governance, and strategic planning, but this
knowledge is not yet widespread.
Members of municipal fora believe in the success of the Municipal Development Component,
but do not yet understand their role in the forum.
Participation and acquaintanceship between the civil society and municipal administrations are
good and have contributed to improving relations between them.

Executive Summary of 2003 Participatory Beneficiary Assessment
(this survey was conducted during the preparation of FAS III)
This report outlines the outcomes of the Participatory Beneficiary Assessment (PBA) of 68
subprojects implemented during the second phase of the Social Action Fund (FAS), designated
FAS II, undertaken by a team of ADRA consultants and FAS assistants, in August 2003. The
subprojects assessed are located in different places in Benguela (22), Cabinda (24) and Huíla
(22) Provinces, corresponding to 25.9 percent of projects considered as assessable, as their
impact could be analyzed. During FAS Phase II 344 subprojects were assessed in the three
provinces, of a total of 886 by mid-2003.
The assessment was undertaken in three different stages:
  I.     Consultation of documents and preparation of field work;
 II.     Training of the FAS team on Qualitative and Quantitative Research techniques;
III.     Data collection; and
IV.      Data processing and analysis and writing of final report.
The data collection was based on quantitative and qualitative research techniques used among
the beneficiaries, Mainstreaming Agencies, Administrations, and line supervisory bodies. The
quantitative data were processed using specific computer software, while the quantitative data
were processed using speech analysis and information density techniques.
The perception of the communities, Mainstreaming Agencies, Administrations, and other
stakeholders on FAS mechanisms and procedures was assessed. It was possible to perceive that
FAS is an institution that is fundamentally known for the quality and usefulness of the
infrastructures that it finances, and this understanding is greater and more expressive among men
and the leadership in general. FAS is assessed positively by the different stakeholders, with
which it has good levels of relations and an image of reference, opening for new prospects and
citizenship, substantially different from that of other government institutions. The FAS
procedures are accepted by partners, though not necessarily understood; as a result, the
Mainstreaming Agencies question the procedures, in part. This aspect raises the need to review
the Operations Manual and other FAS normative documents in order to make them simpler and
more understandable. The beneficiaries agree with the contributions required of them for the

                                                                                                              57
implementation of the subprojects, but the manner in which they are accounted for is not
sufficiently clear. Men and leaders contribute more with organizational aspects, ideas and
decisions, while the physical work is left for the women and the poor and the less powerful.
Furthermore, the role of FAS after the "handover" of the subprojects is not well defined. There is
need to ascertain whether it is truly possible to "handover" something that the communities
already consider as their own, according to some, or something that does not belong to them, as
others think. Although some decisions have already been made in this respect, it is suggested that
infrastructure that are easier to manage, such as water and sanitation, should be effectively
handed over to the communities, who should be made responsible for their management, as well
as to the line supervisory bodies. Thus, during Phase III, FAS should assume a role of facilitating
and promoting organizational strengthening actions targeted at Community Nuclei and
Administrations, as well as evaluation and monitoring of the implemented subprojects.
Notwithstanding the shortfalls come across, FAS intervention led to the increase of the social
capital in the communities understudied. Participation of beneficiaries in decision making is still
limited to a small group of people in the communities, namely the leaders and members of
Community Nuclei. To a certain extent, this explains why the FAS teams continue to be the
major actors at all phases of intervention, from promotion of the subprojects up to the "hand
over" of the infrastructure. However, this can also be explained by the weaknesses of the teams
and references from the past, which made the communities not to be accountable and to resign to
fatalism and to conform. The intensity and the level of participation of the communities and
other stakeholders reduces at the "post-handover" stage, when the entities responsible, depending
on the type of subproject, have difficulties to manage and maintain the infrastructure, due to their
poor organizational capacity and lack of financial resources. The best managed subprojects are
those that are taken on by the Mainstreaming Agencies linked to religious bodies. In other
situations, the communities participate in the management in partnership with line supervisory
bodies, but always in a subordinate position, save in one school or market or the other, which
have attained near co-management. In the water subprojects there is self-management being
undertaken by the communities, although rudimentary.
The current FAS monitoring and evaluation system neither allows for an effective follow up of
the work done nor does it meet the concerns of FAS II, in spite of the capacity building effort
undertaken. The non-existence of an organic relationship with provincial governments gives a
certain level of autonomy to the FAS teams, but also creates some sort of lack of coordination in
the implementation of actions and lack of harnessing of synergies that bring about more adequate
local development strategies. Learning from other international experiences and periodic
exchange visits with institutions that are carrying out the same type of work would help to create
conditions for the appropriation of the Community-Driven Development (CDD) approach, as
provided for in phase III.
Of the 1172 subprojects envisaged in FAS II, 886 (76 percent) were implemented, of which 86
percent were social infrastructure. The type of subproject depended on the established plan and
continues, sometimes, to be subject to the interests of the line supervisory body. But this is
understandable, given their need to be integrated into the network of services to the population.
The level of satisfaction with the results is high, both of the beneficiaries and other partners. The
projects bring relevant benefits to the population through the establishment of services in the
communities ­ in spite of their poor quality ­ at short distances from the residences. The
increased number of health posts has had the impact of a reduction in the occurrence of diseases;

                                                                                                  58
increased school levels contributes to the reduction of number of children outside the school
system and to the enhancement of the quality of education; water and sanitation infrastructure
have considerable impact on women and the enhancement of conditions of hygiene. However,
the choice of technology used is questionable, as it is expensive and difficult to maintain and
reproduce, and its appearance is a shocking contrast with the poor environment of the
communities. FAS actions also have impact on the dynamics of the communities, especially due
to the establishment of Community Nuclei, which represent the communities before FAS and the
Administrations and serve as a communication channel. Some of them are able to manage some
facilities, mainly where the line supervisory bodies do not take over, such as in the subprojects of
water and sanitation and the economic and productive ones, and when they gain more experience
with the implementation of new subprojects. However, their operations are poorly run, due to
insufficient community involvement work, lack of systematic follow up by FAS after the
"handover" and due to the short duration of the subprojects. Only 13 Mainstreaming Agencies
related with thee subprojects during phase II in the provinces understudied. The greatest impact
of FAS on them, as well as on the Administrations and supervisory bodies is the penchant for the
adoption of participatory approaches and practices of dialogue and conciliation with the
communities.
The impact of FAS on gender relations is not yet significant, although its concern is recognized
with the selection of water and sanitation subprojects (45 percent) that have to do with the
conditions of life of women. The environmental impact is non-existence, as there is no
significant change to the natural state of the areas, either positively or negatively.
Of the 68 subprojects assessed, only seven were either not functional or functioning irregularly,
usually due to lack of fulfillment of government institutions with the established agreements
(lack of staff and medicines, problems with water supply). The state of most infrastructures
ranges from "good" to "satisfactory". When the communities take over ownership of the
infrastructures, they accept their responsibility to maintain and manage them, although in
practice this only happens with the water and sanitation and economic and productive ones. In
the others, the supervisory bodies and Administrations have the responsibility, all with a lot of
human and financial resources difficulties. Only the Mainstreaming Agencies affiliated to
religious bodies are able to ensure an acceptable management level. The payment for services or
voluntary contribution for the raising of funds could bring about some level of financial stability.
However, it is questionable whether people that are so poor should pay, while others do not,
given the interest of the State to facilitate access of the population to services.
Notwithstanding the above, FAS intervention should be governed by procedures, norms, and
general rules. The work practices and characteristics of provincial teams have produced results
according to the local specificities. Thus, the results achieved in each of the provinces assessed
have specific characteristics and profiles that should be taken into account for redesigning the
work, should the same probably occur in other provinces where FAS is operating. Thus, it is of
prime importance to put in place measures and strategies that help to guide and resolve these
types of shortcomings.
The main conclusion of this assessment, in general terms, is that from the point of view and
opinion of the beneficiaries and other stakeholders, FAS is or continues to be a relevant and
innovative Project under the current context of Angola and is contributing to the idea that it is
possible for the government to combat poverty and help the population to resolve their problems.
Despite the challenges, the impact on the life of the communities and institutions is notable.

                                                                                                 59
Furthermore, FAS gathered valuable experience from phase I, which should be considered as a
process and which translates to the competence and dynamism of its teams. Apart from physical
capital, FAS is gradually contributing to the consolidation of social capital, which could be
important for collective action, taking into account the establishment of local authority in Angola
and the process of citizenship building and autonomy at the levels of the communities. FAS has
attached important relevance to the path of "modernization" (expressed by access to services)
and participation (in spite of the shortcomings and difficulties). However, for a more balanced
intervention, there is need to face other challenges such as that of identity (which leads to greater
cultural entrenchment) and social change (stakeholders assuming new roles, especially women).
The BPA led to the learning of lessons and identification of weak points based on which the
following summarized recommendations are made:
   1. Improve the internal technical capacities of FAS to improve on its field work;
   2. Implement actions aimed at strengthening the organizational and institutional capacities
      of partners;
   3. Carry out actions that could contribute to the sustainability of the subprojects;
   4. Change some FAS mechanisms and procedures.

                     Annex 7: Social Vulnerability Guide Angola (Introduction)
          (Excerpt from the Social Vulnerability Guide Angola ­ Translated from Portuguese)
The Social Action Fund (FAS) is an autonomous institution, under the supervision of the
Ministry of Planning, established by the Government of Angola in October 1994 through
Council of Ministers decree 44/94110. Since then it has performed the role of acting as one of the
major instruments in the fight against poverty and support to social inclusion.
The third phase of FAS commenced in March 2003 with operations cutting across most
provinces of the Republic of Angola. The main objective of this phase is to contribute to the
alleviation of poverty levels through the combination and promotion of two important
development components:
      ·   Community development as a tool for social emancipation and participation, including
          specific action targeted at the most vulnerable groups;
      ·   Municipal development, a tool targeted at challenges involving the strengthening of a
          decentralized policy action.
The idea of combining these two components aims at benefiting and strengthening the
communities, integrating them into administrative municipal nuclei; linking them with public
institutions operating at different territorial levels. These links are of utmost importance,
especially against the background of the end of the war phase in Angola, in 2002, not only
because they strengthen the political and social structure of territorial micro-relations and their
horizontal relations, but also because they have become important locus for the consolidation of
actions taken at the national level. It is understood that these will be the challenges of this new
phase of institutional relations strengthening that is being established in Angola.
During the preparation of FAS III, the subcomponent of "vulnerable social groups" was
appropriately identified as an object of special interest. Understanding the aspects of social
vulnerability of Angola became a priority for investigation at this stage, for the promotion of
FAS actions in the present and in the future.
Initially, in March 2005, FAS, together with DfID (British Department for International
Development) conducted an initial vulnerability assessment focused on the impact of war
conflicts.
This effort produced, apart from a concise document (CIVA ­ Conflict Impact and Vulnerability
Assessment), a final report with the methodology and outcomes of the sampling survey
conducted and a document of recommendations to FAS. The main recommendations of this
report pointed to the need to: i) engage vulnerable social groups in decision-making processes,
aimed at facilitating access to the supply of services; ii) contextualize and define social
vulnerability by poverty situations apart from the measurement adopted with the establishment of
arbitrary poverty lines57; and iii) include aspects that capture the poor social cohesion with a
focus on: a) inequalities; b) social exclusion; c) conflicts and violence ­ these latter were
identified in the reintegration, rehabilitation and peace building programs.

110
   Africa Legal clarified in their written comments of December 2, 2009 that: "The Social Action Fund (FAS) is a
government agency that enjoys legal personality, and is under the control and jurisdiction of the Angolan Ministry
of Planning. It was created through the approval of Angolan Decree Number 44/94, on October 28, 2004."

                                                                                                               61
Thus, within the context of the challenge posed and presented in the Angola Social Vulnerability
Guide ­ GVS, the issue is not only limited to capturing aspects on the vulnerability of social
groups by factors related to political conflicts. It is also not the objective of this work to measure
vulnerability through information capturing insufficient income, but rather to understand and
map factors affecting and perpetuating the vulnerability of individuals and social groups, which
condemn them to poverty and exclusion. The knowledge of these factors will provide a series of
information that will lead to the establishment of the GVS as a tool for the identification and
fight against social vulnerability in Angola.
It is noteworthy that the contextualization of the analysis and mapping of the causes of
vulnerability in Angola raised in this document does not only take into account the previous
recommendations, but also makes some others. Thus, it is able to expand, group and combine
factors for mainstreaming in a series of situations of identified adversities.
This document is a conclusive object of a phase of works and was systematized as a result of the
various stages: field research, empirical research, contextualization according to the most current
trends of thought on the topic of vulnerability and methodologies that are proposed for the
systematization of actions that combat vulnerability. It was thus drafted to cover the following
stages:
   ·   Understanding of a series of diverse qualitative and quantitative information produced on
       Angolan reality by the government and promotion agencies;
   ·   Contact, in loco, with vulnerable population groups through interviews, workshops and
       guided tours;

   ·   Mapping of interventions target at vulnerability through the observation of the action of
       different institutions working in Angola;
   ·   Critical reading and methodological understanding of the different mainstreaming
       proposals.
This effort was guided by methodological rigor and sticking to the bases of available information
during the entire period of 2006, aimed at delineating the social vulnerability matrix of Angola.
The current idea, during the entire period of the works, was to research and collect the scare
though valuable, existing information and produce a proposed work.
The profiles of the 18 provinces are presented in the first part of the work, reproducing
movements and demographic portraits of life cycles, socio-economic differences and inequalities
in institutional structure. Such information was extracted from the MICS II 2001 (UNICEF/INE)
sample research of the National Institute of Statistics of Angola ­ INE/DPA, and from reports
and consultation of MINFIN information databases, the latter of which are based on the series of
questions contained in the Instrument I questionnaire, specifically drafted for this work. Also
during the first stage, different documents were consulted, including: the report on the Program
for the Improvement and Increase of Basic Social Services to the Population for the two-year
period of 2005-2006 and the Poverty Strategy Paper of 2005, both of MINPLAN; as well as
information databases of the Public Investment Program, of MINPLAN as well.



                                                                                                   62
In the second part of the GVS, the social vulnerability combat instrument is presented with
special focus on the determining factors that make this process an action that requires partnership
between sectors and programs, as already made evident by the multidimensional aspects of
vulnerability presented in the previous chapters. It is noteworthy that this part of the GVS is
reflected in the proposal adopted by FAS, when it made choices that strengthen and streamline
the micro and macro territorial relations, without which mainstreaming actions in Angola cannot
be planned. The role given to local institutions and social participation is highlighted through an
action design process. This culminates in a methodological vulnerability combat proposal that
results from the partnership between various institutions, but which should be especially
understood and coordinated at the action level.
It would be a mistake not to note that this document should be taken as an initial effort, without
forgetting that a social vulnerability matrix is subject to the temporal plasticity of the social and
political dynamics of any country and requires constant observation of the reality. With great
satisfaction and the certainty of constituting another step in the development process of Angola,
this GVS is presented in the hope that this instrument will contribute to guiding, like a compass,
the path of public policies and the challenges involved in the reduction of social risks.

             Implementation Memorandum Report Prepared by FAS III Project Team
1)          Background
The Social Action Fund emerged within the framework of the Government of Angola Economic
and Social Program 1994 (PES/94), under its chapter on "Other Global Policies" aimed at long
term structural poverty eradication.
On 28 August 1994, under the Council of Ministers Decree 44/99, the Social Action Fund (FAS)
was established as an autonomous government agency, a legal entity with financial and
administrative autonomy, with its own assets and procedures, enabling it to act speedily,
efficiently and effectively.
FAS is provided with the means for simple and transparent control for the utilization of resources
placed under its management in order to promote social alleviation and fight against poverty,
fostering the involvement of the population in the reconstruction and economic and social
development process of the country, through the financing of small projects.
2)          Objectives of FAS III
FAS executed the first two phases, from 1994 to 2000 and from 2001 to 2003, respectively. The
third phase of the project entered into force in March 2004, aimed to achieve improved and
expanded use of basic social and economic services as well as to support a system of governance
where the local government and community are jointly accountable.
Specific Objectives
     (i)       Foster the utilization of basic social and economic services in a more sustainable,
               broader and enhanced manner;
     (ii)      Increase human and social capital at the community and municipal levels, developing
               the capacity of local agents to promote development; and
     (iii)     Support the establishment of a system of governance where municipal council
               authorities and communities gradually become mutually and reciprocally
               accountable.
The Impact Indicators include:
·    Increased primary school enrollment, number of families with access to and utilizing health
     services, water points, and adequate sanitation systems;
·    Increased number of vehicles plying repaired roads and reduction of travel time; amount of
     tax and fees collected from market traders;
·    Number of municipal administrations and respective fora that reach the final graduation stage
     of Component 2;
·    Number of communities that make recourse to the mechanisms instituted by FAS III to
     represent their interests before the municipal administrations and hold it accountable for its
     activities; and




                                                                                                65
·     Number of beneficiary communities that are satisfied with established services and
      infrastructure, the municipal management process and with their representativeness at the
      municipal forum.
The target of FAS III was composed of a collective group of beneficiaries, service providers, and
partners, namely: communities and their organizations (community nucleus); municipal
administrations; appointed officials and their teams; network of intermediary organizations: local
NGOs, training institutes, private sector, churches, individual trainers and consultants, central
and provincial governments, and the public sector in general.
3)       FAS as an instrument for strengthening local governance
The government design framework for local development in Angola has improved in recent
years, representing a change of context that is favorable to FAS in terms of support to the
implementation of its agenda of strengthening local governance.
Specifically, the government, through the Ministry of Territorial Administration (MAT),
identified the need to strengthen the capacities of municipal administrations, with special focus
on administrative deconcentration and decentralization aimed at increasing levels of civil society
and citizen participation in governance.
FAS III, in addition to service provision, organizational and participation issues, sought to
develop strategies within the scope of strengthening local governance, thus making partnership
with MAT a priority, supporting it in the
provision of training on municipal           The Forum is a non-formal organ that

component.
                                                being of its inhabitants.
Like other partners, FAS fostered the
creation of local participation structures. The municipal fora, as microcosm of what the
Municipal Auscultation and Conciliation Council, instituted by the government under Decree
No. 02/07.
4)       FAS Approach and Characteristics
FAS is responsible for managing the funds made available to it from World Bank loans, the
National Budget, and various multilateral, bilateral, and private sector donors. Thirteen
provincial offices111 are responsible for the contracting and implementation of subproject
activities, while the FAS Coordination Unit in Luanda coordinates and supervises program
liaising with international partners and donor agencies.
Through its Community-Driven Development Component, FAS focuses its action on
community-driven demand, targeting its activities at social investment. Explicitly, FAS activities
follow the stages spelt out in the project cycle, for which the major aim is to follow up with
community members in the process of identifying, programming, executing and monitoring of
the subprojects.

The Municipal Development Component emerged at the beginning of FAS III with the general
objective of strengthening the capacity of municipal administrations selected using previously
established criteria to improve performance of legally assigned duties related to the local
development process.112
In order to achieve the stipulated provisions and acquire the necessary capacity to implement the
activities of the Component, a Municipal Development Strategic Planning tool was used in five
stages. This tool aims to promote collective and consensual decision making, prioritize
initiatives, implement, monitor, and assess actions based on the analysis of internal and external
factors capable of facilitating or hindering the development of an organization or territory.
5)         Outcomes (projects and disbursements)
During its implementation period, the program financed 1,578 subprojects, of the 1,568
subprojects envisaged, 29.9 percent (445) in the educational sector, 12.6 percent (188) in health,
25.5 percent (380) in water and sanitation, and 13.5 percent (201) economic, productive, and
environmental.
The financing of the subprojects led to the creation of 19,375 jobs, 57.8 percent (11,215) of
which are permanent and 42.1 percent (8,160) temporary, attaining a total of 6.625.742
beneficiaries.
The capacity development strategy provided training to a total of 3,108 people, among which
26.8 percent (836) in the public sector, 27.8 percent (865) the civil society, 38.4 percent (1,196)
community partners, 6.7 percent (211) from FAS teams, of which 10 percent were women.
The disbursement level attained the amount of USD122,996.55, of which USD60,141,419.62
from the IDA loan and USD33,648,512 from the EU grant. The contribution of the Government
of Angola was USD26,297,882.37. Notable among the financial contribution of other donors is
that of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) with USD566,094.91, UNICEF with
USD81,364.24, and the oil company, Chevron, with USD261,464.00.
5.2        Coverage, target and equity
The Project expansion activity was done according to the availability of funds as stipulated in the
Project Assessment Document (PAD) that spells out all the targets by available finance portfolio.
It was possible to achieve the targets set in the PAD, as the benefit of a higher financial portfolio
made it possible to work in seven provinces, namely Malange, Kwanza-Norte, Uíge, Lunda
Norte, Lunda Sul, Moxico, and Kwando Kubango. This is considered national coverage. The
involvement of the provincial governments from the outset was an element of success for the
quick integration of the Project as well as the proper implementation of the Project.
The lessons learned from FAS I and II led the Project management team to introduce a new
methodological instrument, the Social Services Access Indicators (IASS), during the priority
identification and definition phases. It aimed at improving equity in terms of the choice of area
and the sector of intervention.
The introduction of the IASS enabled, on the one hand, support to the identification of critical
areas and sectors in terms of access to basic social services and, on the other hand, qualitative
improvement of the information needed for taking decisions on investments to be made. It is

noteworthy that the use of the IASS, as a diagnostic tool, shed more light on the mapping of
poverty among the communities.
5.3      Capacity Development
While FAS gained experience in the previous phases in capacity consolidation at the different
phases of the project cycles and on the promotion of organization of community members
through the establishment of accountability mechanisms and delivery structures for the poor, it
was discovered that there was still room to fine-tune and implement a skills development and
local development framework under FAS initiatives. The lessons showed the importance of the
creation of a "suitable environment" as an essential element for ensuring efficient participation
and sustainability of subprojects beyond the subproject cycle.
Within the context of FAS III, skills development feature as a cross-cutting framework, as it
builds blocks for local participation and development. To this effect, the strategy of FAS III is to
improve and institutionalize the individual, organizational skills, competences, and abilities at
the community and government levels, establishing evidence to support the ongoing
decentralization process.

Other outcomes achieved:
Besides this, FAS maintained a strategy of constant interaction with the community nuclei and
their leaderships, from the perspective of on-the-job training. However, it is important to
underscore that gender equality in the participation of both sexes in the training sessions
continues to be a great challenge, as female participation represented only 10 percent of the total
number of participants. This implies that future mobilization work should be focused on the
increased participation of women.
The component produced various interesting outcomes, as well as impacts at the level of social
and political capital:
         3,108 people trained on 20 topics;
         Three study visits embarked on to Brazil and three to Portugal, with 30 percent
         participation comprising people from public institutions and municipal participation
         structures;
         Three exchange visits embarked on in Benguela, Porto Amboim, and Bibala
         Municipalities;
         Eleven editions, 7,500 copies each, of Jornal Amigo produced; 5 issues of Caderno
         Amigo, 1,000 copies each;
         Six training manuals produced on the Municipal Development Component; one on
         Community Development Component and two on Vulnerability subcomponent.
         Constructed the intranet structure of the selected municipalities (Kilambi Kiaxi and
         Benguela), as well as a FAS institutional intranet.
Finally, it was concluded that the actions carried out under the capacity development strategy led
to obtaining the results (albeit interim), creating bases and sustained capacities (especially the
training of local partners, which enabled the conduct of research for data collection), and drafting
of job profiles and municipal development plans (which became important points of reference
for decision making at the level of the municipality).
5.4      Monitoring and Evaluation
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) emerged during FAS II and was improved on in FAS III to
respond to the increasing challenges of the current phase and to overcome the limitations
encountered during the implementation of activities.
In FAS III, the component continued with its objectives of storing and systematically evaluating
data on the impact of the activities on projects, as well as creating capacities in the teams to
analyze and collect quantitative data.
It could be said that the M&E process was marked by the implementation of the following key
activities:
         Dissemination of the outcomes of the 4th Beneficiary Participatory Evaluation at the
         provincial and national levels through reflection workshops, 2005;
         Conduct of a consultancy to enhance the indicators to be used for monitoring and
         evaluation as well as for the Information System (SIFAS), 2005;


                                                                                                 69
         Conduct of a reflection meeting with some teams on monitoring and evaluation concepts
         and indicators (PMA ­ Participatory Monitoring and Evaluation, 2006);
         Implementation of Information Sites;
         Beneficiary Participatory Evaluation, 2006;
         Conduct of the first phase of the Beneficiary Impact Assessment, 2007;
         Conduct of the second phase of the Beneficiary Impact Assessment, 2007;
         Conduct of evaluations at the end of each Municipal Development Component in the 12
         municipalities.
5.4.1    Outcomes achieved in the M&E component
During the implementation of the activities, the following outcomes were achieved:
         Greater follow up and monitoring of projects during implementation of the activities and
         after their delivery, with more involvement of the communities and partners.
         Better structuring of the project portfolio and greater involvement of partners in the
         project cycle.
         At the level of the provinces, the teams have a better understanding of the use of
         indicators.
In spite of the efforts made, there are many challenges by FAS teams:
     ·   Prompt a posteriori conduct of evaluations after projects are delivered with greater
         community involvement; and
     ·   Systematization of the experience of implementing the M&E process in the different
         components.
5.4.2    Social Services Access Indicators (IASS)
The lessons learned with the implementation
                                                    The introduction of the IASS enabled:

of communities based on the values calculated
and their index, thus allowing for better
balance in terms of choice of area and sector of intervention.
6)       Factors of success and failure
Considering that the objective of this document is to report on the activities carried out and to
serve as an instrument for reflection, the major aspects that had positive or negative impact on
the success and sustainability of the project are listed as follows:



                                                                                              70
6.1.1. Factors of success
a) Under the Community Development Component
   ·   The credibility of the project, as well as its 14 years of experience, facilitated its
       penetration into the remote areas of the country and expansion of its activities into new
       provinces;
   ·   The training actions offered to partners during the program consolidated the human
       capital among the communities as well as facilitated increased credibility of FAS among
       them;
   ·   The transfer of tools to partners through training sessions facilitated the strengthening of
       the social capital of the communities, which could be observed through their engagement
       in the project cycle; and
   ·   The expansion of the activity to other more remote provinces (Uige, Lunda Norte, Lunda
       Sul, Moxico, and Kwando Kubango) enabled greater access to target grassroots
       community social infrastructure, as well as the broadening of the basic services.
b) Under the Municipal Development Component
   ·   The favorable situation of decentralization enabled FAS to contribute to the agenda of
       development and strengthening of local governance in the country;
   ·   The work strategy adopted facilitated the dissemination of the Planning Strategy as a
       methodological tool in various municipalities, as training content and practice of
       participatory municipal management;
   ·   The municipal development profiles and plans drafted with the methodological support of
       FAS served as the basis for the implementation of projects with government resources;
   ·   The speedy use of procedures fostered their correct usage by the partners; and
   ·   The publication of a series of methodological guidance manuals on "Municipal
       Development Strategic Planning," from the FAS experience.
6.1.2. Factors of failure
a) Under the Community Development Component
   ·   The subproject targets as stipulated in the Project Assessment Document (PAD) were not
       achieved due to the lack of funding from EU grants;
   ·   The poor engagement of municipal administrations of the new provinces ((Uige, Lunda
       Norte, Lunda Sul, Moxico, and Kwando Kubango) is due to lack of FAS teams on the
       ground;
   ·   The maintenance of the subprojects could have been strengthened through greater sharing
       of an accountability framework by the municipal administrations and other partners; and
   ·   The gender imbalance at the level of the project cycle was mainly due to cultural issues
       as well as the need for FAS to invest in a gender strategy.




                                                                                                71
b) Under the Municipal Development Component
     ·   Low involvement by some local leadership, especially at the provincial level;
     ·   The inability of provincial teams and partners to systematize and disseminate
         implementation experiences;
     ·   Inability to consolidate the introduction of data collection and analysis into the daily
         activity of the municipal administrations; and
     ·   Capacity strengthening was more based on the local civil society sector, as it was more
         receptive and aware of the benefits of its participation in this type of capacity
         strengthening programs.
7)       Lessons Learned
As a result of the experience acquired during the implementation of FAS III, lessons were
learned, which, if taken into consideration in the design of the future FAS IV could be useful for
the enhancement of approaches of similar projects.
a) Engagement and strengthening of local governance
The engagement of the local government at various levels, from the beginning of the process, is
fundamental for its consolidation and success. Investment in training actions should focus on
staff of municipal administrations in general and not only on the leadership, thus avoiding
hindrances in the transfer of skills due to change of leadership.
b) Expansion of the project to new provinces
The success of the expansion of the project activities to new provinces largely depends on the
receptiveness and involvement of provincial governments and the existence of a local team
capable of carrying out the planned objective.
c) Change in community demand
Adaptation demand response to the local peculiarities and diversity is the best solution to enable
us to move closer toward the solution to the real problems of the communities,
d) Limited response capacity of domestic market
The project should be adapted to the imperfections of the local market with a view to better
directing its response capacity.
e) Interaction of the three capitals
The Project strategy of focusing on the development of the four capitals (physical, human, social,
and political) is one of the key elements of its success.
