agricultural extension program and\n            unsatisfactory for the food production program. Both\n            projects suffered a number of shortcomings, from design\n            through implementation. The project period was set too short\n            to implement complex institution-building projects and\n            phasing of substantial construction programs was\n            unrealistic. Little attention was paid to the availability\n            of suitably qualified technical staff and lines of command\n            were not clearly delineated. Administrative and budgetary\n            problems were not properly identified, the availability of\n            relevant technology was ill-assessed, and farmers did not\n            participate in the identification and prioritizing of their\n            perceived problems and needs. Several key lessons can be\n            learned from these projects. First, during the initial years\n            of an extension project, little more can be achieved than\n            the establishment of an administrative framework. Second, a\n            single line of command has to be maintained and management\n            performance monitored in systems operation. Third, a\n            bottom-up approach to extension and research is essential.\n            Fourth, staff have to be provided with adequate incentives\n            to ensure motivation and staff continuity. Lastly, staff\n            recruitment procedures and training require adequate\n            standards to ensure staff quality."}, "docdt": "1991-10-16T00:00:00Z"}
