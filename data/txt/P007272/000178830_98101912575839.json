Works on the Northern Road: Reconstruction would\n            comprise seven sections totalling about 150 km of the 249 km\n            Northern Road. These sections represent the most urgent\n            works, and comprise notably a critical section close to\n            Port-au-Prince, the portion of the road that traverses the\n            agricultural Plain of the Artibonite, as well as the\n            northern section of the road (Plaisance-Cap Haitien). The\n            project also includes the reconstruction of a major bridge\n            over the Estere River, in the Artibonite Valley, which\n            partially collapsed in 1973. The remaining sections of the\n            road will be serviceable year round for another few years\n            provided adequate maintenance is performed. (b) Technical\n            Assistance: In order to achieve the above-mentioned\n            objectives, technical assistance would be provided under the\n            proposed project in the three general areas of transport\n            planning, advisory services for the reorganization of TPTC,\n            and local civil works contractors."}, "docdt": "1974-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
