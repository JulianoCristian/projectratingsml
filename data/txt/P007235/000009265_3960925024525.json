It encountered\n            serious problems throughout: the construction schedule was\n            over-optimistic; the wood gassification plant never supplied\n            more than 20 percent of the sawmill's requirements; the\n            sawmill suffered from poor design and layout and was\n            frequently out of action; and management was weak. The\n            project has not established a port facility nor a wood-fired\n            power facility capable of meeting demand. It has also not\n            undertaken research into forest management methods.\n            Production and exports have fallen far short of\n            expectations. On the positive side, it has provided access\n            to an otherwise inaccessible area, established a town, and\n            provided permanent employment. The most successful component\n            has been log harvesting; this has been well managed and a\n            long-term plan is in place. The sustainability of the\n            project is unlikely. The Government of Guyana now recognizes\n            that the successful management of Demerara Woods Ltd. is\n            beyond its capacity and hopes to dispose of the company\n            early in 1991. The Bank has shown a highly level of\n            commitment to the project throughout, but mistakes made\n            early on in the project cycle severely undermined its\n            viability. The Borrower's commitment has also been\n            strong throughout and considerable dexterity was shown to\n            prevent project collapse at an early stage. However,\n            problems of recruiting and retaining a high caliber staff\n            seriously inhibited the Borrower's ability to manage\n            the project. The five principle lessons learned are: (a)\n            large-scale innovative technology should never be\n            incorporated into projects; (b) in sawmilling projects,\n            detailed attention must be paid to mill design and technical\n            specifications; (c) unless a clear precedent exists, it\n            should be assumed that state-owned sawmilling enterprises\n            are unlikely to succeed; (d) great care must be taken to\n            ensure adequate human resources are available, and it cannot\n            be assumed that project support training will solve this\n            problem; and (e) where a project is cofinanced by several\n            agencies, one agency must adopt a lead role."}, "docdt": "1991-05-30T00:00:00Z"}
