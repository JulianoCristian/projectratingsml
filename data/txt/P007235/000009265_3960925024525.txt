UPPER DEMERARA FORESTRY PROJECTS
(Loan 1623-GUA/Credit 1555-GIUA)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Upper Demerara
Forestry Project in Guyana, for which Loan 1623-GUA and Credit 1555-GUA in
the amounts of US$10 million and SDRs 8.7 million were approved on October
1978 and August 1984 respectively.  The Loan was closed in January 1985,
the Credit in September 1987.  The Loan was disbursed in April 1985, the
Credit in May 1987.
The PCR was jointly prepared by the Agriculture Operations
Division of the Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office (Preface,
Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III) and the Borrower (Part II).
Preparation of this PCR was started during the Bank's final
supervision mission of the project in May 1987, and is baeed, inter alia,
on information gathered at the Georgetown offices of the European Economic
Community, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Bank of Guyana and
Demerara Woods Ltd., on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Loan, Guarantee,
and Project Agreements, supervision reports, correspondence between the
Bank and the Borrower, and internal Bank memoranda.

PROJECT CONPLETION REPORT
GUYANA
UPPER DEtERARA FORESTRY PROJECT
(LOAN 1623-GUA/CREDIT 1555-GUA)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Obiectives
1.   The Upper Demerara Forestry Project was the first forestry project to be
financed by the World Bank in Guyana. The project, a logging and sawmilling
operation, aimed at increasing the exports of sawnwood products, promoting the
use of lesser-known species on international markets, improving the supply of
lumber for domestic construction, developing the largely uninhabited hinterland
of the country and providing employment. To manage the project an independent
state-owned company, Demerara Woods Ltd. (DWL), was created.
2.    At appraisal, project costs over 4 years (1978-81) were estimated at
US$30.5 million, US$22.7 million of which was to consist of foreign exchange.
The Bank (IBRD) loan was to total US$10.0 million, sufficient to cover 33 percent
of total costs and 44 percent of foreign exchange costs. The project was to be
cofinanced by the European Development Fund (EDF) (US$7.0 million), the European
Investment Bank (EEB) (US$5.0 million), and the Government of Guyana (GOG)
(US$5.0 million).   In 1985, due to cost overruns, the Bank (IDA) provided
supplementary credit of US$8.8 million. Additional funds were also provided by
the EDF, IDB and GOG. By the time the mill become operational in 1986, costs had
risen to US$46.2 million, and eventually reached US$52.5 million. In August
1986, all Bank disbursements to GOG were suspended, leaving an undisbursed
balance to the project of USS3.8 million.
Implementation Experience
3.    The project encountered serious problems throughout.  The construction
schedule proved to be over-optimistic. Tendering and bidding were to take six
months, but, in the event, they took two years, and cost overruns resulted. To
reduce costs, parts of the project were scaled down and the mill redesigned. The
construction of the mill was also slower than anticipated--instead of being
completed in 1980 it was not completed until 1984.
4.    To power the sawmill, a US$10.0 million, 4.8 megawatt wood gassification
plant (EEC funded) was installed. Not orly was the plant too big (the total
power requirement at the project area is about 1.3 megawatts) it was also
innovative and was largest of its kind in the world. It was a continuous source
oi problems and never supplied more than 20 percent of the sawmill's power
requirements. Sawmill design (EEC funded) and layout were also poor, the balance
of machines was inadequate, items of essential equipment (e.g., gantry crane)
were omitted, the underground waste disposal system clogged-up and flooded during



- iv -
heavy rains and, having a single hydraulic system, the entire mill was often put
out of action because of relatively minor faults with the hydraulics.
5.    Management of the project was al.so weak, mainly because of the difficulties
of obtaining skilled personnel in Guyana. The situation was exacerbated by the
difficult living conditions at project site (Mabura) which is over 150 km. from
the nearest major settlement (Linden) and has very limited social facilities
(shops, schools, entertainment). Because of this, management was split between
Nabura and Georgetown and this served to weaken an alrsady weak structure.
Results
6.    The project has achieved limited success only. On the positive side it has
provided access to an otherwise inaccessible area, it has established a log
harvesting operation in the area together with a sawmill complex, it has
established a town for 1,500 people and has provided permanent employment for
over 400 persons per year. However it has not est6bl4shed a port facility, it
has not established a wood-fired power facility capabl. of meeting the needs of
the project area, it has not undertaken research into the most appropriate
methods for forest management and production and exports have fallen far short
of expectations.   The most succeseful component of the project has been log
harvesting; this has been well managed and a long-term harvesting plan is in
place, it has been continually producing sawlogs, piles, poles and posts and is
largely responsible for what small income the project has realized. The sawmill,
for reasons outlined earlier, has never achieved move than 37 percent of its
theoretical installed capacity (41,000 m3 per annum) and has rarely attained more
than 25 percent of export targets.   However, even without breakdowns it is
probable that it would not have met its targets--mainly because the mill as
designed could not easily produce the type of lumber (2" x 4", 9" and 3" x 12")
required by the market.
Sustainabilltv
7.    During 1990 DWL's debt-equity ratio had reached 300:1 and the company/
project appeared to be heading for collapse.   On the other hand most large
private sawmills in Guyana have continued to produce during the last decade and
many have prospered despite the difficult country economic situation, and despite
not having had access to the rich forest resources similar to those available to
the project. With better mill design, a convenxtional power plant and better
management (private ownership) the project could have been very successful.
8.    The GOG now recognizes that the successful management of DWL is beyond its
capacity and, under its program of divestment, hopes to dispose of the company
early in 1991.
Findinfts and Lessons Learned
9.    The principal lessons to be learned from the project are:
(a)   large-scale innovative technology should never be incorporated into
projects;
(b)   in sawmilling projects detailed attention needs to be paid to mill
design and technical specifications of equipment and machinery;



(c) unless a clear precedent exises, it should be assum6d that state-
owned sawmilling enterprises are unlikely to succesdS
(d)   great *are needs to be taken to ensure that adequate human resources
are available to %mplement a project (in Guyana a lack of human
resources was apparent at time of appraisal), and whero serious
problems exist it cannot be assumed that project support training
vill necessarily solve the problem (the trained personnel simply
move on elsewhere);
(e)   wher, a project is to be cofinanced by several agencies, one agency,
preferably with a resident representative, must adopt a lead role
from time of preparation to ensure that the whole package is sound.

2. Background
2.1       Eonr.nc Overview.  During the period 1980-90 Guyana's economy has
been in a state of s .ady decline. Between 1981-83 ODP showed a cumulative decline
of 21% after which it has rarely shown significant posidve growth; in 1988, for example,
growth was down by 4.1% compared to 1987. During the same year the production of
its pnrncipal commodities, sugar, rice, bauxite and timber declined by 24%o, 12%o, 6% and
35% respectively.
2.2      As a result of weak economic performance, investment as a percentage of
GDP has declined steadily since 1981; it stood at 21% in 1985 compared to 33% in 1981.



-2-
The deciine resulted from a worsening fiscal situation, a lack of foreign exchange and a
drop in external project-related public and private inflows. Private investment has been
stagnant since 1981. As a result of foreign exchange shortages, productive activity in
Guyana is substantially below capacity. The country's econoniic ills have been worsened
by emigration which has been taking place at the rate of 1% per annum in recent years
and this has reduced the population from around 800,000 in 1990 to around 600,000 in
1991
2.3      Sector Deveiopment Objectives (at tirm.e of appraisal, 1978). Despite the fact
that forests covered 83% of Guyana's territory the forestry sector contributed less than
1% to GDP and the country was a net importer of forest products (US$5.6
million/annum). Exports were declining and employment in the sector was stagnating.
The Government of Guyana's (GOG) development objective in the sector at that time
was to increase production of sawn timber both for domestic production and for export.
This it was to do by investing some US$39 million over 3 years in public sector forestry
enterprises. Development of the private sector was to be encouraged through finance
provided through the Guyana Agricultural Development Bank.
2.4      Polia Conlext. In view of the insignificant part played by the forestry sector
in economic development, the GOG's policy with regard to forestry was to promote the
use of lesser known species both at home and abroad, stimulate the development of the
public and private sector wood using enterprises, increase exports and strengthen the
capacity of those government institutions responsible for forestry.
2.5      Linkages Between Project. Sector and Macro Eolicy Objective .
Conceptually, the project strongly complemented the GOG's sector objectives. It also
supported the GOG'S macro policy objectives to increase exports, diversify the economy,
develop the uninhabited hinterland of the country, intensify state involvement in the
industrial sector, and provide employment.
3.  The Project
OrigiD
3.1      The Upper Demerara forestry Project originated in mid-1971 when the GOG,
following a forest inventory carried out earlier that year by FAO/UNDP, asked the Bank
to exs'mine the feasibility of a forestry project in the Upper Demerara area (Map 1). An
FAO/CP identification mission visited the country in late 1971 and proposed a logging
and sawmiUing operation with a sawnwood output of about 41,000 m3, much of which
was to consist of lesser known spe-ies. By the end of 1972 the Bank had reviewed the
FAO/CP proposal, and a marketing study had been carried out by CIM A. At the same
time the GO  initiated construction of the 130 km access road to the p -. ject area (Map
1). In 1973 the GOG contacted a well-established Canadian forestry products company,
(McMillan Bloedel Ltd.,) to ascertain its interest in a joint venture operation. The
Company and GOG carried out a joint feasibility study on the project (which was
doubled in size) but after lengthy negotiations no agreement was reached and McMillan
Bloedel eventually withdrew.



-3-
3.2      Project proposals were scaled back to theii original size in late 1976 with niill
production during the early years being concentrated on marketable species; lesser
known species were to be introduced gradually in response to market demand. The
project, which had a period of 4 years, was appraised in September 1978 and the loan
became effective in May 1979.
4. Project Objectives and Description
A1         rQect Objectives.  Project objectives were to increase exports of easily
marketable wood products, promote the use of lesser known species on intemational
markets, improve the suipply of lumber for domestic construction, particularly housing,
develop the, hinterland and provide employment. About 80% of output was intended for
export with the remainder being absorbed by the domestic market. The mill's output was
intended to consist of 95% primary (marketable) and 5% lesser known species, with the
proportion of the latter increasing in step with the GOG's efforts to market them.
4.2      Proiect Components. The project had 6 major components, namely (a)
vehicles and equipment to log 93,500 m3 of roundwood per year; (b) a sawmill,
including repair shops and transport fleet, with an annual double shift output capacity
of 41,000 m3 of lumber; (c) power facilities, with an installed capacity of 6,000 kW
-ased on waste wood fuel; (d) a town for about 1,500 people, including 500 employees
and their families; (e) port facilities with 13 km of access road; and (f) a research
programme to develop an appropriate forest management system for the type of forest
to be harvested. The project also provided for consultancy services in engineering,
construction, supervision, and mill management.
4.3      The project was to be implemented and operated by an independent
government-owned company, Demerara Woods Co. Ltd., (DWL) which was to be
established for that purpose.
S. Project Costs ar.d Financing
5.1      Project costs were estimated at US$30.5 million (G$77.8 million), the fareign
exchange component having been estimated at US$22.7, or 74% of total costs.
5.2      World Bank (IBRD) financing was to total US$10 million sufficient to
finance 33% of total project costs and 440% of all foreign exchange costs (US$22.7
million). The project was to be co-financed by the European Development Fund (EDF)
(US$7.0 million), the European Investment Bank (EIB) (US$3.5 million), the IIB
(US$5.0 million), and the GOG (US$5.0 million). The Bank's contribution was to
finance logging equipment, the township, the port facility, research, consultants, and
interest during construction; the IDB's contribution was to finance the sawmill; the
EDFs contribution was to finance the power plant and consultants, and the EIB and
GOG's contributions were intended mainly to co-finance the township and port facility.



- 4-
6. Project Design and Organisation
6.1       The concept was clear and straightforward in that it intended to mobilize
badly needed financial resources through the exploitation of untapped forest resources
with proven markets - the extent of which had been carefully assessed prior to
implementation. It was clearly understood by all parties, and with over 75 sawmills in
the country, the project concept was in no way innovative.
6.2       The scope, scale, and timing of tE.e project were appropriate, and the roles
and responsibilities of institutions responsible for the project were clearly defined and
understood. However project scheduling was extremely optimistic (para 7.2) and the
project suffered from both technical and administrative shortcomings - these are
discussed below.
6.3       To manage the project, a state-owned company (DWL) was created. At the
time of appraisal there was no clear precedent to suggest that a state-owned company
could successfully operate a large sawmilling enterprise successfully in Guyana. In fact
the reverse was the case; the only other large state-owned sawmill (Guyana Timbers)
was struggling to survive. A further mistake was having management split between the
project site and Georgetown. All management, with perhaps the exception of the
marketing director who needed to be in Georgetown to communicate with shippers and
buyers, should have been situated at the project site, (though this might have been
difficult in practice because of the harsh living conditions in If ibura - section 6.6).
6.4      The project, as originally conceived, provided for a steam power plant (EEC-
funded). However, during tender evaluation this was dropped in favour of a wood
gassification plant, the justification being that the wood gassification process was more
efficient, that there was insufficient water at the site to operate a steanr. plant, an. that
the water avaiiable was too acidic. The gassification plant which ccost US$10 m was
never successfully commissioned because of technical problems, and has ':;en a serious
liability. Failure to commission the plant delayed mill start-up by two years, and since
start-up (1986) the gassifier has never supplied more than 20% of the mill's annual
power requirements. Most power has been supplied by two standby diesel generators,
the operating cost of which has been high.
6.5       Mill design, as prepared by the original consultants (EEC-funded) was also
very poor. The balance of machines was inadequate in that the band headsaw could not
keep the gangsaw fully supplied with lumber. A cross transfer system between the mill's
two production lines was not included, there was no overhead gantry crane in the mill
to manoeuvre logs, the entire mill was served by a single hydraulic system which, when
out of order, crippled the whole mill, and the underground waste (sawdust and slabs)
disposal system flooded during heavy rains.
6.6      The siting of the wrill also created problems. In theory, locating *he mill and
township in the forest (Mabura) appeared to make economic sense; but in practice the
difficulties of living in such a remote area with poor amenities (shops, schools,
entertainment) proved considerable and the project had difficulties in retaining
experienced staff. Furthermore the site was apt to flood during heavy rains.



7. Project Implementation
7.1      The project was plagued with problems from its early stages. The 2/2 year
construction schedule (tendering, bidding, construction and start-up) proved to be over
ambitious. In fact tenders were not opened until 2 years after appraisal when it was
found that cost overruns (due to inflation and cost under-estimates) on major
components ranged from 56% for the power plant to 100% for the sawmill (Part III,
Table 5). Consequently certain components were either scaled down (town, port facility
and power plant) or dropped entirely (research component) and a lengthy re-tendering
process commenced.
7.2      Construction of the mill was also slow and by 1983 works were 45% behind
schedule. Slow progress was due to the need to redesign the sawmill and infrastructure
(to effect cost savings). This in turn posed problems for the contractor (van Kessel) who
was obliged to increase unit costs to maintain profit margins. The contractor eventually
withdrew and initiated legal proceedings against DWL (still pending) who had to
undertake the work themselves. The mill was eventually completed in 1984, three years
behind schedule. However, because of a dispute between the manufacturer of the wood
gassifier (Imbert) and DWL, Imbert refused to send a team to conunission the gassifier
and DWNL decided to do it themselves. Damage resulted (tar formation) and the plant
was put out of actior.
7.3      Despite having reduced the scale of the project, cost over-runs were
unavoidable and, in 1985, the Bank (IDA) provided supplementary credit of US$8.8 m
(Credit 1555) to bring the project into full production. Additional funds were also
provided by the IDB, EDF, and GOG, bringing project costs to US$46.2 m. Total
project costs eventually reached US$52.6 m.
7.4      In 1985, utilising part of the supplementary credit (1555) DWL purchased two
425 kW diesel generators to power the sawmill. Production commenced in 1986, five
years behind schedule. In August 1986 all Bank disbursements to Guyana were
suspended (due to GOG's failure to meet debt repayments) leaving an undisbursed
balance to the project under Credit 1555 of around US$3.8 m. (Having recently made
arrangements to clear its debts the Bank is now considering whether to recommence
disbursements to the project).
7.5      Throughout its operations the project has encountered serious problems.
Despite the provision of technical assistance from the EEC all attempts to successfully
commission the wood gassifier (the design of which ;s now suspect) have failed and this,
together with poor mill design and frequent breakdowns, have severely limited mill
output. However, even without these problems, it is doubtful whether the mill, as
designed, could ever have achieved more than 70% of its rated capacity. Additional
problems were caused by weak management, a general shortage of foreign exchange to
purchase spare parts and a shortage of trained, experienced personnel.



-6-
8. Project Results
8.1       The project has achieved limited success only. On the positive side it has
provided access to an otherwise inaccessible area, it has established a log harvesting
operation in the area together with a sawmill complex, it has established a town for 1,500
people and has provided permanent employment for over 400 persons per year.
However it has not established a port facility, it has not established a wood-fired power
facility capable of meeting the needs of the project area, it has not undertaken research
into the most appropriate methods for forest management ar,d production and exports
(see para 83) have fallen far short of expectations.
82        The most successful component of the project has been log harvesting; this
has been well managed and a long term harvesting plan is in place, it has been
continually producing sawlogs, piles, poles and posts and is largely responsible for what
small income the project has realised.
83        The sawmill, for reasons outlined earlier, has never achieved more than 37%
of its theoretical installed capacity (41,000 m3 per annum) and has rarely attained more
than 25% of export targets. However, even without breakdowns it is probable that it
would not have met its targets - mainly because the mill as designed could not easily
produce the type of lumber (2" x 4", 9" x 9"and 3" x 12") required by the market.
Targeted mill output and actual output together with exports are shown below.

8.4      Tbe project's financial rate of return is negative (see Part 3 and Table 6) and
it has sustained considerable financial and economic losses. To illustrate the point, if the
GOG was to divest itself of DWL. the company would need to be sold for US$80 m to
generate a financial rate of return of 14% (Staff Appraisal Report). If disposed of for
US$40 m the rate of return would be barely positive. The only bid received to date has
been for US$3 million. Cumulative net losses for the project total US$140 m.
9. Project Sustainability
9.1      During 1990 DWL's debt-equity ratio had reached 300:1 and the
company/project appeared to be heading for collapse. On the other hand most large
private sawmills in Guyana have continued to produce during the last decade and many
have prospered despite the difficult country economic situation, and despite not having
had access to the rich forest resources similar to those available to the project. With
better mill design, a conventional power plant and better management (private
ownership) the project could have been very successful.
9.2      The GOG now recognizes that the successful management of DWL is beyond
its capacity and, under its programme of divestment, hopes to dispose of the company
early in 1991.
10. Bank Performance
10.1     The Bank has shown a high level of commitment to the project throughout
but mistakes made early on in the project cycle severely undermined its viabili.{.
10.2     The Bank should not have concurred with the proposal to install a large
innovative power plant. The plant was the largest of its kind in the world, and the
technology new to Guyana. Its incorporation in the project was a serious mistake.
10.3     Not enough care was taken to review the work of the sawmill designers (EEC
funded). They produced a design which proved to be seriously lacking. The siting of the
mill at Mabura should also have been given closer examination.
10.4     There being no clear precedent for the profitable operation of a large state-
owned sawmilling operation in Guyana, the Bank should have questioned the justification
for further state involvement in the sector. It should have been clear that a state-owned
company had a slim chance of successfully implementing such a large sawmlli&g
operation.



- 8 -
105      No criticism can be levelled at the quality of supervision; the project was
intensely supervised during the early stages (2 missions a year up to 1986) and the major
problems were clearly identified early on in the project. However, such was the gravity
of the problems (gassifier, mill layout, management) that Bank assistance was unable to
reverse the downward trend.
10.6     The principal lessons to be learnt from the project are:
(i)      large-scale innovative technology should never be incorporated
into projects;
(it)     in sawmilling prc ects detailed attention needs to be paid to mill
design and technical specifications of equipment and machinery;
(iii)     unless a clear precedent exists, it should be assumed that state-
owned sawmilling enterprises are unlikely to succeed;
(iv)      great care needs to be taken to ensure that adequate human
resources are available to implement a project (in Guyana a lack
of human resources was apparent at time of appraisal), and
where serious problems exist it cannot be assumed that project
support training will necessarily solve the problem; (the trained
personnel simply move on elsewhere);
(v)     where a project is to be co-financed by several agencies, one
agency, preferably with a resident representative, must adopt a
lead role from time of preparation to ensure that the whole
package is sound.
11. Borrower Performance
11.1     The borrower's commitment to the project has been strong throughout and
considerably dexterity was shown to ensure that the project did not collapse at an early
stage. However, problems of recruiting and retaining high calibre staff seriously inhibited
the borrower's ability to properly manage the project. Staff turnover was high and there
were considerable weaknesses in such areas as accounting and financial control.
Deficiencies in stores procedures and inventory control were also serious. These
problems were due to a general countrywide shortage of skills, low salaries and difficult
living conditions at Mabura. The latter problem not only made it difficult to recruit staff
but also necessitated locating the company head office in Georgetown, thus splitting and
weakening management. Added to this, shortages of foreign exchange in Guyana made
it difficult to obtain spare parts.
12. Project Relationships
12.1     Despite the problems encountered by the project, and despite the fact that
Bank disbursements to Guyana were suspended in 1986, working relationships between
the borrower and the Bank have remained good throughout.



-9-
13. Consulting Services
13.1     The performance of most consultants was good but the performance of Agrar
und Hydrotechnik (AHT) was lacking. In 1981 they took over responsibility for project
accounting, but a year later no system was in place - apparently because of a rapid turn-
over of staff - and weak accounting continued to be a problem throughout the project.
AHT was also responsible for project management in the early stages, but due to their
poor performance their contract was terminated in 1983. They were also responsible for
the design of both sawmill and gassifier plant, both of which were poor. Tne competence
of the manufacturers of the gassifier plant (Imbert) - the design of which is suspect - is
also questionable. The problems encountered with the civil enginee:s (K van Kessel)
responsible for mill construction were due mainly to the fact that mill design was
changed and this adversely affected their profit margins. They had little choice but to
withdraw.
14. Environmental Impact
14.1     The enviromnental impact of the project was to have been monitored under
the research component, but this was dropped in year 2 of the project due to cost over-
runs. Because the project has produced very little wood the environmental impact on
the area has been slight. Logging has been selective and there has been no uncontrolled
settlement. In 1987 however, DWL's best year, logging eficiency improved and the
damaging effect on the forest, though very localised, is evident. Had the project achieved
its production targets the environmental consequences would have been serious. The
construction of the road into the area, however, has led to some fire damage along this
road south of the Wismar - Rockstone junction (north of the project area).
14.2     With the prospects of divestment to foreign investors, intensification of
logging activities poses a serious environmental threat to the area and the GOG will
need to review the terms of the timber sales agreement (TSA) to ensure that the
necessary environmental safeguards are in place. At present there is no regulatory
activity in the area to ensure that the provisions of the TSA are being adhered to, and
this will also need to be addressed. A small research area (900 ha) was established in
1987 under the Dutch-funded Tropenbos project and this should, during the next 10
years, provide valuable information on management of the forests in the area.
15. Project Documentation
15.1     The legal agreements relating to Loan 1623-GUA and Credit 1555-GUA
were adequate; strengthening these legal agreements would not have averted the
problems encountered during project implementation.
15.2     Subsequent developments (cost overruns, delays in implementation, failure
of the powerplant, shortage of foreign exchange for the purchase of spare parts, etc.,)
meant that the management of the project was exclusively preoccupied with day-to-day
responses to continual crises, rather than with a longer term programme to achieve
project objectives. The Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) was therefore of limited relevance
to those responsible for project implementation. This was not, for the most part, due to



- 10 -
deficiencies in the SAR. However, lack of precision on technical aspects of project
design (in particular on sawmill layout and wood gassifier) at the appraisal stage must
be held partly responsible for the problems that were later to bedevil these components.
15.3     In the early years of the project DWL's accounting procedures were
absolutely deficient and no formal data base was generated. It was a condition of
disbursement of the supplementary credit that accounting procedures and financial
control be tightened. From 1985 accounting was adequate, although project data in
general remained deficient. Thus, although audited accounts permit calculation of total
project costs, the mission was unable to obtain any information on project costs according
to the expenditure categories envisaged by the World Bank and the other financing
agencies.

The constant 1989 $G figures for 1987, 1988 and 1989 have been recomputed
in the foregoing presentation using index numbers implicit in Table 6C as
presented in Part III of the PCR. These index numbers are:
1987     281.69
1988     201.61
1989     100.00

B.    No comment can be made on the values of the actual or implied index
numbers used in the table as this is beyond DWL's scope. It suffices to
note that the attribution of the source of table's data to DWL is not
entirely appropriate.
Demerara Woods Limited is essentially in agreement with Part 1 of the
Project Completion Report. The report in several instances, suggests that
the state ownership status is an intrinsic factor in the lack of success
of the project. However, there is nothing in the narrative of Part 1 on
which such a 'onclusion can be seen to be based.  The major design faults
poor mill siting and uesign experimental energy source od the project
could easily have stymied the efforts of even a private sector company.
Admittedly certain Governmental actions and policies in relation to
Demerara Woods Limited eg. public sec.tor wages guidelines and regulatory
framework, could possibly have contributed to the company's lack of
success. But what ought to be questioned is the nature of Government
policy in relation to a state-run saw milling enterprise rather than the
intrinsic feasibility of a state-run sawmilling enterprise.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is arguable that a private sector
company may not have placed the great trust placed by the Government, in
the Consultants employed in the engineering design of the project.
An update should be given in relation to exchange rates and the status of
disbursements, the Van Kessel controversy and the divestment of Demerara
Woods Limiteds
i)  the exchange rates at what is termed the 'Cambio' is now almost
G$130s US$1.00.   Care must  therefore be  taken  in converting
cumulative net losses of the project from Guyana dollars into US
dollars as done in section 8.4 of Part 1 of the PCR.
ii)  Bank disbursements to the project resumed in mid 1990, and DIWL's
debts to civil engineers Van Kessel have been fully paid off.
iii)  On 16th February 1991, an agreement wan signed under which the
assets and undertakings of Demerara Woods Limited will, within
ninety (90) days thereafter, be sold to another company.
C.    Demerara Woods Limited concurs that 'The Bank has shown a high level of
commitment to the project throughout'. A great deal of understanding and
appreciation of the problems experienced in the project has been
demonstrated by the Bank, along with a willingness to do whatever possible
and plausible to assist in overcoming these problems.
As regards Borrower performance, as alluded to before, the extent of trust
and good faith shown by Government while in itself praiseworthy, has led
to the acceptance of recommendations which ultimately did not work in
favor of the project. Instances of this are the acceptance of a sawmill
design consultant inexperienced in mill design, acceptance .-f the project
and sawmill design and acceptance of the novel concept of wood gasificat-
ion as the sole source of energy for the project.



- 15 -
The use of a forest expert as Project Hanager during the engineering
design and construction stage was probably ill-judged on the part of both
the borrower and lenders.  In future projects care should be takeuA to
assess their essential component, and subsequently to apply the relevant
skills to the specific aspects of the project.
Certain covenants were set out in the loan and project agreements and were
conditions which Government had to comply with for the free ftuctioning of
the company on a commercial basis.  Hore attention could have been given
to the operating climate of the company, given the government controls and
regulations governing public corporations.   Such regulations have in
several cases, curtailed the 'normal' commercial operation of DWL as
compared to its competitors in the industry. It may be useful to study
the operating climate of state enterprises in future and assess counter
productive regulations; loan/project agreements should then carry
covenants to ensure a relaxation of these regulations so as to bring the
operations of the company more in line with normal commercial practice.
D.    The relationship between the Bank and the Borrower has been a most cordial
one throughout the evolution and esecution of the project.
E.    The performance of the co-financiers has been satisfactory, except that
the level of bureaucracy has at times been frustrating. Notably there has
been some reluctance observed to accept comments form the Borrower or DIL,
critical of certain aspects of the project.   For the future a more
receptive attitude on the part of lenders, to comments, criticisms and
contributions form the borrowers and executing agencies could be
beneficial at all stages especially the selection of contractors and
consultants.

j/ The Revised Conn Estimates were prepafed in 1984 as a basis for supplementary credit 1SSS.GUA. Reason
for the major est escaations on all components (except Port Facilities which wete severely cut back
and Fores Management Research which was ultimately dropped) are discussed in Part 1.
1  As discused in Part 1, (Project Documentation), project data were never, even after improvement of
accountcy, recorded or presented in such a form as to permit any distinction to be made neither
between project cos according to the categories established at appraisal, nor between local costs and
foreipn coss
3/ Financal cot, the only category in which direct comparison between estimated and actu; costs is
posible, crepond mainly to interest chargs during construction. Ihe esaltion in these cost
Is duo to the delays in implementation.
J/ It sbould be stesed that the figure of USS32.6 million represents an approximation of ptject costs
gen the defectie accounting in the project's early yas

B. Economic Impact
Appraisal Estimate        Actual
Economic Rate of Return            16%                 Negative
(ERR)
Underlying Assumptions
1.   At appraisal the economic life of the project was assumed, for purposes of
calculating rates of return, to be 25 years. The mission has calculated the
ERR over a 10 year period. The magnitude of losses hitherto is such that even
a dramatic improvement in project performance over the next 15 years would fail
to generate a positive rate of return.
2.   A shadow exchange rate of US$1 = G$3 was adopted at appraisal as against the
1978 official rate of US$1 = G$2.55. This shadow exchange rate proved over-
optimistic. For several years of the investment period the US dollar sold on
the parallel market at up to 5 times the official exchange rate. Given the pre-
ponderance of foreign costs in total project costs and the relatively insignif-
icant foreign exchange earnings element, it has not been considered necessary to
convert financial prices into economic prices since the only result would be to
generate an ERR that would be, as it were, even more negative.
3.   It was assumed at appraisal that domestic inflation over the investment period
would average 9% per annum. In the event domestic inflation over the investment
period averaged 18%.
4.   It was assumed that the ERR would be superior to the financial rate of return in
view of the foreign exchange premium and the anticipation that 80% of production
would be exported. The reverse occurred.

Comment. The decision to drop this study due to cost overruns was ill-conceived, given
that the savings incurred thereby were relatively insignificant. No long-term strategy for
forest management in white sand areas yet exists, nor has any reliable understanding
been gained as to the ecological impact of timber extraction in such areas. Little
attention was paid at appraisal to the ecological impact of a successful project. It might,
paradoxically, be argued that the financial and economic failure of the project constitutes
an environmental benefit.

COMMENTS FROM EUROPEAN INVESTMENT BANK
TELEX dated 4/4/1991
Attention Mr. Graham Donaldson, Division Chief
Agriculture, Infrastructure and Human Resources
Operations Evaluation Department
Subject:  Guyana
Upper Demerara Forestry Project
(Loan 1623-GUA/Credit 1555-GUA)
Many thanks for your letter dated 15 March 1991 which included the draft
Project Completion Report for the captioned project.
The Bank did not undertake a Project Completion Mission for this particular
project and we are therefore not in a position to provide a detailed
opinion on its completion.
We were however informed on the serious problems that the project
encountered during its completion. As far as we can judge, we feel that
your draft PCR gives a good and fair assessment of the developments.
Best regards,
J.R. Loasby / J-PH de Jong
European Investment Bank

COMMEN'S FROM INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
FAX DATED 5/2/91
TO: Mr. Graham Donaldson, Chief
Agriculture, Infrastructure and Human Resources
Operations Evaluation Department
FROM: Marc J. Dourojeanni, Chief ENV
Inter-American Development Bank
SUBJECT: Upper Demerara Forestry Projects (Loan 1623-GUA/Credit 1555-GUA)
Informal observations prepared by the industries staff of the IDB
responsible of the technical follow up of the Upper Demerara Forest
Industry Projects:
We have reviewed the document mentioned above and we agree with the World
Bank that the investment project had a poor design and very weak
management.
The power plant manufactured by Imbert never operated satisfactorily and
its design is questionable.  Also the mill was very sophisticated for a
project located in an area lacking adequate infrastructure and trained
personnel to operate it.
The consulting firm Agrar und Hidrotechnik (ART), that was responsible for
the mill and power plant designs and sta t-up of the operations never
succeeded to manage the project prope'rly.
We also agree with the World Bank that large-scale innovative technology
should be avoided in this kind of projects and that state-owned savmilling
enterprises are unlikely to succeed.  It is not clear how the cumulative
net losses of the project estimated at US$140 million was calculated.
We would like to receive the final report of the project execution when it
is available.
