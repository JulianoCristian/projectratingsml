The project would increase export earnings of\n            forestry products from the current level of US$3.9 million\n            to about US$11 million by 1982. The project would establish\n            logging operations over an area of 152,000 ha and process\n            the wood in a sawmill with an annual output capacity of 17.4\n            million bd ft of sawn timber. The project consists of\n            logging roads and equipment, a sawmill including repair\n            shops and transport fleet, a waste wood power plant with a\n            capacity of 6,000 kw, port facilities including a 13 km\n            access road to the port, and a township for about 1,500\n            people. The design engineering and supervision of\n            construction of the project would be carried out by a\n            consulting firm which would also manage the sawmill complex\n            during the first three years of its operation. The project\n            includes a study for management of forest resources. It also\n            provides for training of both operative hands and management personnel."}, "docdt": "1978-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
