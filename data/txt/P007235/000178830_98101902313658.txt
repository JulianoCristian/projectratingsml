UPPER DEMERARA FORESTRY PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                   Cuyana
Beneficiary:                Demerara Woods Limited (DWL)
Amount:                      US$10 million
Terms:                       20 years, including 5 years of grace, at an interest
of 7.9% per annum.
Relending Terms:             20 years, including 5 years of grace, at an interest
of 10% per annum.
Project Description:        The principal objective of the project would be
to increase export earnings of the forestry
sector and provide required supply of lumber
for domestic consumption. The project would
increase export earnings of forestry products
from the current level of US$3.9 million to
about US$11 million by 1982. The project
would establish logging operations over an
area of 152,000 ha (375,600 acres) and
process the wood in a sawmill with an annual
output capacity of 41,100 m3 of sawn timber
(17.4 million bd ft). The project consists of
logging roads and equipment, a sawmill including
repair shops and transport fleet, a waste wood
power plant with a capacity of 6,000 kw, port
facilities including a 13 km access road to
the port, and a township for about 1,500 people.
The design engineering and supervision of con-
struction of the project would be carried out by
a consulting firm which would also manage the
sawmill complex during the first three years of
its operation. The project includes a study for
management of forest resources. It also provides
for training of both operative hands and manage-
ment personnel. Under the marketing arrangements
envisaged in the project, training in export
marketing would be provided to the staff of the
Guyana Timber Export Boad (GTEB). While the
project faces no special risks, lack of trained
personnel would be a constraint in project imple-
mentation. To overcome this problem, the Ministry

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO GUYANA
FOR THE UPPER DEMERARA FORESTRY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Guyana for the equivalent of IJS$10 million to help finance the Upper
Demerara Forestry Project. The loan would have a term of 20 years, including
five years of grace, with interest at 7.9% per annum. The proceeds of the
loan would be relent to Demerara Woods Limited (DWL) for 20 years with five
years of grace, at an interest rate of 10% per annum. Co-financing arrange-
ments for the project are about to be concluded with the European Development
Fund (EDF) for US$7 million and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) for
US$5 million.  In addition, the European Investment Bank (EIB) is expected to
provide a loan of US$4 million to the Government of Guyana towards partial
financing of the latter's equity investment in DWL.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
Introduction
2.        The Bank's most recent economic report (Economic Memorandum on
Guyana, Report No. 2081-GUA, dated June 13, 1978) was distributed to the
Executive Directors on June 19, 1978 (SecM 78-517). This President's Report
incorporates the findings of a mission which visited Guyana in July 1978.
Annex I contains the basic country data.
3.        Guyana's economy is mainly based on the export of sugar, rice
and bauxite. The economic activity and population are concentrated along a
narrow coastal strip where sugar and rice are grown. With the exception of
bauxite mining, the vast hinterland remains undeveloped. The more advanced
mining sector has assumed increasing importance in the economy; both the sugar
and rice industries are relatively efficient. Economic development has been
retarded, however, by a difficult physical environment, a limited resource
base, and sharp fluctuations in output and in income stemming from the vulner-
ability of the economy to exogenous factors such as weather and fluctuations in
international prices and demand. As a consequence, income, while fairly
evenly distributed, is among the lowest (US$560 per capita in 1977) of any
country in the Western Hemisphere. Real growth of the economy in recent years
has been highly variable, but on average little more than the increase in
population. Agricultural growth has been slow and export performance uneven.
It has not been possible to reduce the persistent high level of unemployment
which reached over 15% in 1977.
4.        Since independence in 1966, the development strategy of Guyana has
been to increase the participation of the public sector in the economic activity
of the country and to promote producer, consumer, and marketing cooperatives.
The Government has expanded state enterprises, created new state-owned
financial institutions, and nationalized the country's bauxite/alumina and



- 2 -
sugar industries. The growing role of the public sector is reflected in the
increase of its share of gross domestic capital formation from 40% in 1968
to over 80% in 1977. The Government attaches high priority to an equitable
distribution of income and to the provision of food, housing, health care and
education to the population.
5.        In recent years, the country's economy has been adversely affected
by a number of changes in external economic conditions. A serious balance-of-
payments situation developed in 1973 when adverse weather conditions and a
depressed aluminum market led to diminished export receipts. This led the
Government to borrow heavily from the Eurodollar market. The same year,
public sector savings deteriorated sharply as a result of a large wage increase
to Government employees. The quadrupling of oil prices at the end of the year
delivered the final blow, leaving the economy severely weakened at the begin-
ning of 1974 with critical balance-of-payments and budgetary management
problems. However, the boom in sugar prices later that year, an improvement
in weather conditions, and the strengthening of the world aluminum market
unexpectedly brightened the economic picture. As a result, average annual
export receipts in 1974 and 1975 were more than double the level in 1973, more
than compensating for the steep rise in the import bill. Real GDP grew by an
annual average of 7% in these two years. Between 1972 and 1975, payments for
merchandise imports more than doubled. Fuel imports rose from 9% to about 17%
of merchandise imports while consumer imports fell as a percentage by almost a
half during the same period. Moreover, the introduction of a progressive tax
on sugar exports, with rates which rose with increasing world prices of sugar,
permitted the Government to utilize the windfall to finance a major expansion
in public sector investment in 1975 and to accumulate almost US$70 million in
foreign exchange reserves. As a consequence, in 1976, despite the decline of
sugar prices to more normal levels and despite significant production short-
falls in bauxite and rice resulting from poor weather, the authorities had
sufficient resources available to maintain high import levels and to continue
expanding the ambitious investment program begun in 1975. By the end of 1976,
however, Guyana's gross foreign exchange reserves had been almost completely
depleted.
6.        With the end of the sugar boom, Guyana belatedly confronted the
full impact of the 1973 petroleum price increase. The necessary adjustment
has been made particularly difficult by the fact that the temporary flood of
sugar earnings led to a greatly expanded level of public sector investment and
a resultingly high import bill, neither of which has it been possible to
sustain. This was accompanied by a sizeable expansion of Central Government
current expenditures in 1976 which reflected Government's increasing commitment
to a social welfare program which included universal free education, socialized
medicine and subsidization of essential consumer goods and public services.
The increased expenditures, coupled with the drop in sugar revenues and
continuing consumer subsidies, led to a deterioration in gross public sector
savings in 1976 to about 0.2% of GDP. Gross national savings as a result fell
to 6.6% of GDP, while investment reached the high level of almost 40% of GDP
in 1976. This jump in investment, from 33% of GDP in 1975, was because of a
trebling of Central Government capital expenditures with the main increases
being in agriculture and infrastructure. One consequence of this was a



- 3 -
current account balance-of-payments deficit of over 30% of GDP. In absolute
terms, the deficit exceeded US$135 million and gross international reserves
fell from about US$100 million to US$27 million in 1976.
Recent Economic Developments
7.        While Guyana's balance-of-payments improved somewhat in 1977 as a
result of trade and travel restrictions introduced by the Government, the
country continued to lose foreign exchange reserves and began to accrue
arrears on current account. Export receipts declined from their already
low 1976 level. Sugar exports were especially hard-hit by low world prices,
a poor spring sugar crop in 1977, the loss of an important bilateral contract,
and the devastating impact of a 4-1/2 month long sugar strike. Rice exports
also dropped in the first part of the year as a consequence of the bad weather
and the resulting low production levels in 1976; despite record production
levels in 1977, exports for the year as a whole did not show any increase
over 1976 because of a late autumn harvest. As a result, notwithstanding a
15% rise in bauxite and alumina receipts, total export receipts in 1977 fell
to 7% below the 1976 level. The Government's attempts to contain imports
last year through expenditure cutbacks and trade and travel restrictions
were successful in reducing imports. Nevertheless, the current account
deficit was still about US$95 million in 1977 or some 22% of GDP. The
terms of trade continued adverse to Guyana. Dwindling net capital inflows,
affected by sharply reduced foreign exchange disbursements for the public
sector investment program, were inadequate to fill the gap. Increased short-
term deposits at the Central Bank from Venezuela and Brazil only partially
compensated for the dwindling net capital inflows. As a result, net foreign
exchange reserves became highly negative and the country had accumulated about
US$40 million in commercial arrears by the end of the year.
8.        As a consequence of the import cutback, investment reductions,
modest growth in bauxite/alumina output, and the reduction in sugar produc-
tion consequent to the strike, real GDP declined by approximately 6% in
1977. At the same time, retail prices increased by about 11% because of the
imposition of further import restrictions and the once and for all impact of
the removal of some consumer subsidies.
9.        During 1977 the Government reduced public sector capital expendi-
tures by 40%. Essentially, the Government continued high-priority ongoing
projects to which external financing was attached and postponed the comple-
tion of other projects. Central Government financing of public corporation
investment was virtually eliminated, and only those corporations which gene-
rated their own internal and external financing proceeded with capital
spending.
10.       Unfortunately, the Government's cutbacks in capital expenditures
were accompanied by further deterioration in public sector savings, mainly
because of the reduction in sugar revenues, losses in the operations of
several public enterprises, and the impact of the substantial minimum wage
increase on the Central Government wage bill. This wage award, which nominally
doubled the minimum wage in the public sector over a three year period, was
designed to restore real wages to 1973 levels. As a consequence, and despite



-4-
cutbacks in non-wage Central Government current expenditures, public sector
savings turned negative in 1977 and it became apparent that the economy would
be unable to generate sufficient resources to sustain the pay award.
Consequently, Guyana depended entirely on gross external inflows, domestic
borrowing, and money creation to finance public sector investment in 1977.
Although gross external inflows declined from 1976, they were still equivalent
to over half of public investment expenditures. The accumulation of arrears
in foreign payments resulted temporarily in increased liquidity in the banking
system, which the public sector used to help finance its budgetary deficit.
This, of course, is not a sustainable method of financing public investment.
Economic Developments in 1978
11.       Economic developments through mid-1978 have shown that most of the
problems present in 1977 still exist. The external position has continued to
be critical despite improved exports of sugar, rice and bauxite. An overall
increase in export earnings has permitted a reduction in the level of arrears
but has been insufficient to alleviate the overall shortage of foreign exchange.
There have been increasing shortages of intermediate goods, spare parts and
essential consumer goods. Such shortages have resulted in large amounts of
machinery becoming inoperable which, in particular, delayed the planting
of the second rice crop and reduced the provision of essential public trans-
portation services. Shortages of cement and other building materials have
constrained the construction industry and slowed the implementation of invest-
ment projects. Fertilizer and pesticides have also been in short supply,
affecting agricultural yields. In April there was a breakdown in electricity
generation which blacked out Georgetown and affected its water supply. Power
has now been restored but rationing is still in effect. The power shortages
have interrupted production and generally retarded economic activity.
The Government's Response to the Crisis
12.       In 1978 the Government faced its worst economic crisis since
independence. In February it established the State Planning Commission to
better oversee and coordinate the operations of the public sector. In March,
the Government produced a budget covering for the first time both the Central
Government and the rest of the public sector. It addressed the crisis with a
wide ranging program devoted to raising public sector revenues, tightening
public expenditure policies through control procedures and achieving a higher
degree of efficiency in the pubLic sector. These measures included increases
in excise and import duties as well as motor vehicle license fees and sizeable
increases in the prices of essential consumer goods (such as rice and cooking
oil) and other public services. The effect of these measures will be to reduce
the Central Government deficit, increase public sector savings and cut consump-
tion.
13.       In July 1978 the IMF Board approved an agreement negotiated with the
Government of Guyana which included a one-year Stand-by Arrangement and access
to IMF compensatory financing. This agreement became effective August 15 and
made it possible for Guyana to obtain SDR 15 million from the IMF over a
12-month period; of this amount SDR 8.75 million in compensatory financing was
made available immediately. In addition, ceilings on net domestic assets,



credit to the public sector, external payment arrears and external borrowing
have been agreed upon with the IMF. The Government has also agreed to rescind
by October 31, 1978, the current prohibition on transfers abroad by foreign-
based companies of funds representing depreciation allowances. The Stand-by
Agreement is expected to make possible the refinancing and rollover of several
sizeable Eurodollar loans incurred by public sector enterprises in recent
years and to be a bridge to provide Guyana access to the Fund's Extended
Facility, to be negotiated in 1979.
14.       In August 1978 the Government adopted a further comprehensive set
of policies--mainly in the fiscal and credit fields--to restrain domestic
demand and mobilize domestic resources. These included:
a)   a 10% sales tax;
b)   an increase in contributions to and extension of
the coverage of the National Insurance Scheme;
c)   doubling the domestic price of sugar; and
d)   almost doubling interest rates to stimulate private
savings.
The introduction of these measures permitted Guyana to comply with the condi-
tions of effectiveness of the IMF Standby. Consequently, in mid-August Guyana
drew down SDR 2 million, the equivalent of US$2.5 million from the IMF.
The Development Plan
15.       In addition to the stabilization measures described above, the
Government proposes to re-establish the basis for sustained economic growth.
In line with this, it has defined the following key development objectives:
(i) to expand export-oriented activities which can reactivate the economy,
lead to a substantial improvement in the balance of payments and provide jobs
for the unemployed, including the new entrants to the labor force; (ii) to
raise the level of gross national savings from about 5.5% of GDP in 1977 to
about 18% of GDP by 1980 and 20% of GDP thereafter, mainly through public
sector savings efforts; (iii) to reduce the external debt service ratio
through an expansion of exports, reduced reliance on financial credits, and
greater use of more concessionary financing; and (iv) to step up the implemen-
tation of the public sector investment program, including training programs to
increase the pool of skilled manpower required by the expanded investment
effort.
16.       Since publication and presentation in the Budget Speech, of its
Third Development Plan for the period 1978-81, the Government has revised the
investment program for the period 1978-80 in the light of the expected



availability of financing. This revised investment program has been reviewed
by Bank staff and found to be appropriate in both level and composition, given
the current economic situation, prospective financial resources and the
development priorities of the Government. The projects in the revised program
are essentially only those which are ongoing or for which external financing
is likely to be available. The development strategy envisages exports becoming
the main engine of growth with major emphasis being placed on sugar, rice,
bauxite and forestry exports. Consequently, the projects included in the
program aim at not only increasing the volume of production for export, but
also at developing related infrastructure to promote more efficient transport
and handling of exports. Besides this, the program places particular emphasis
on improving the quality of the export products and provides for training in
export marketing. The program also includes import-substitution projects in
consumer goods and food items. While aiming at substantial production
increases, the projects in the investment program are unlikely to significantly
reduce the level of unemployment which is estimated at over 15%.
17.       Approximately 80% of total public sector capital expenditures are
allocated to the export-oriented productive sectors and related infrastructure.
Agriculture (including forestry and fishery) accounts for over 40% of the
investment program. The major portion of this investment would be in three
irrigation projects for rice production (Mahaica-Mahaicony-Abary (MMA), Black
Bush and Tapakuma), financed by the IDB, the Bank and other external lenders.
These projects would start yielding returns by 1980-81 and more than double
the volume of rice output for exports by the mid-80s. Included in the program
is a Second Rice Modernization Project, which is under consideration for
financing by the USAID, and which aims at minimizing post-harvest losses and
improving the processing and marketing systems in order to increase rice
output for exports. The volume of rice exports by 1980 is forecast at 163,000
tons, compared with 65,600 tons in 1977. By 1985, the investments in projects
for rice production and processing would generate output sufficient to achieve
exports of 362,000 tons. Other agricultural projects emphasize production of
vegetables, fruits and meat both for local consumption and for export. Both
the regional corn-soya project financed by the Caribbean Development Bank and
the Guyana Marketing Corporation project expected to be financed by the IDB
would further increase export earnings originating in the agricultural sector.
The program also includes major projects for the extraction of tropical
hardwoods (the Upper Demerara Forestry Project proposed for Bank financing and
the Forestry Equipment Credit financed by CIDA) and shrimp harvesting and
processing. The extraction and processing of high-value tropical hardwoods
would be substantially increased by the Upper Demerara Forestry Project which
is expected to come on line in 1981. As a result, exports of timber are
expected to rise from 13,400 cubic meters in 1977 to about 58,000 cubic meters
in 1985. Investments in the fisheries sector are aimed at increasing the
capacity of the fish port in Georgetown and improve fish processing facilities.
These investments are expected to increase exports of shrimp, besides making
available the by-catch for sale domestically to help meet the protein needs of
the population.
18.       Projects iD the manufacturing and mining sector account for about
one-fourth of the plan outlay. These include expansion of mining and process-
ing facilities for calcined bauxite and completion of a glass factory, a rum



- 7 -
distillery and a cotton textile mill. The new investments in the bauxite
industry, together with ongoing expansion programs, would increase the produc-
tion capacity for calcined bauxite by about 60%. Efficiency in bauxite oper-
ations would be enhanced by the installation of an electrostatic precipitator
to recover bauxite dust for processing into calcined bauxite. The glass
factory, which would utilize Guyana's silica-concentrate sands, would initially
help reduce import of glass containers and sheet glass and, at a later stage,
develop product lines for export within the CARICOM region. The rum distillery
would help increase utilization of sugar molasses and add significantly to
the export earnings of this industry. The cotton textile mill being built
with grant assistance from the People's Republic of China would produce
fabrics for the domestic market.
19.       Infrastructure projects in communications, power and transport
included in the program are essential to support the production-oriented
investment program and have been allocated about one-fifth of the total program.
The major investments in this sector would be to rehabilitate the critical
thermal-power plant in Georgetown and to construct road systems to support
development of forestry and agriculture. Similarly, investments have been
planned to develop bulk handling facilities at shipping points for export of
rice, rum, shrimp and lumber.
20.       Among the projects included in the "social" sector, which is
allocated about 20% of the total program, education and training account
for the bulk of the capital expenditures. A substantial proportion of the
amount allocated to education would be utilized to complete the IBRD/IDA-
financed Second Education Project (Loan 1106-GUA/Credit 544-GUA) which was
approved in 1975. The remainder of the investments included in the program
are relatively small and geographically widely dispersed; hence, they are not
readily susceptible to external financing.
21.       The success of the development program in attaining its goals will
depend upon the ability of the public sector to physically execute the program.
Guyana, in the past two years, has experienced great difficulty in implement-
ing development projects on a timely basis. This has been attributable mainly
to the shortages of imported building materials, the lack of local currency
for counterpart financing and the shortage of project managers and skilled
workers. The proposed program loan should help to alleviate the first two
constraints. The shortage of suitable manpower remains a serious problem,
although in the longer term this is being addressed by the Bank's ongoing
Second Education Project and technical training programs financed by various
bilateral and multilateral agencies. Guyana's efforts to achieve the objec-
tives of its development program in the medium term depends to a large extent
on its ability to execute the three major irrigation projects (namely the
Tapakuma, MMA and Black Bush projects) and the proposed forestry project which
are being financed by the Bank, IDB and other external financing agencies. In
order to ensure that technical expertise is available for completing these
projects on a timely basis, the external agencies have provided financing for
consultancy services and training of Guyanese staff both in project management
and export marketing.

22.       The investment program envisages public sector capital expenditures
(including capital transfers) of about G$280 million (22% of GDP) in 1978. In
1979 they are planned to increase to G$330 million, 23% of GDP, as a number of
large multilaterally financed development projects get under way. In 1980 the
planned level is G$355 million, 22% of GDP. Gross fixed investment in the
economy as a whole is projected to average 24% of GDP in 1978-80; this is
expected to lead to real GDP growth averaging 4% per annum over the period.
To finance this level of investment gross national savings will be required
to increase substantially from the 5.5% of GDP achieved in 1977 to 15% in
1978 and 18% in 1980. In 1978 the cuts in consumption resulting from increased
prices of essential goods and the lack of availability of imported products
together with the increased rates of interest on bank deposits are expected to
increase private sector savings from 7% to 11% of GDP An improved public
sector savings performance should lead to attainment of the higher targets in
1979 and 1980 (see paragraph 22).
Financing the Investment Program
23.       Assuming the approval of the proposed program loan/credit, there
is a viable public sector financing plan for 1978. It is estimated that, on
the basis of the measures recently taken, the Central Government will reduce
its current deficit to G$36 million from the G$63 million in 1977. Gross
public sector savings are expected to reach G$50 million (4% of GDP) but will
still only cover 18% of public sector capital expenditures. A major problem
has been created by the threefold increase in external amortization payments
to G$192 million (15% of GDP) although it is anticipated that Bauxite Industry
Development Corporation (BIDCO) will be able to refinance half of these
obligations reducing the net obligation to G$95 million. On the assumption
that such refinancing is achieved, the program will be financed by domestic
borrowing of the public sector from the banking system of G$57 million,
disbursements of G$154 million from project loans, G$39 million from committed
Caribbean Development Facility 1/ assistance (including the proposed program
loan/credit), G$39 million from commodity and other official assistance and
G$10 million from capital revenues.
24.       The public sector faces a difficult task in mobilizing adequate
resources to finance its investment program in 1979-80. The Government's
financing plan, however, appears to be viable and its successful implementa-
tion would ensure the creditworthiness of Guyana. The plan includes the prompt
introduction of additional measures to increase public sector savings to a level
covering 50% of the public sector investment program by 1980. The overall
1/   The Caribbean Development Facility was established during the first
meeting of the Caribbean Group for Cooperation in Economic Development,
held at Bank Headquarters, June 19-24, 1978. It is a transitional
emergency financing facility to cover local costs and cost overruns
of development projects in Caribbean countries, including Guyana. It
is planned to be phased out over a maximum of five years. The
facility is expected to provide over US$100 million during FY79 with
the major contributors being the US, UK, Venezuela, Canada and the
OPEC Special Fund.



- 9 -
financing position will continue to be aggravated by high external amortization
payments which are expected to average over 8% of GDP in 1979 and 1980. The
financing plan assumes judicious control of the level of net domestic credit
and that BIDCO and GUYSUCO (the public sector corporations involved in bauxite
and sugar) will be able to raise additional funds on the Eurodollar market.
Despite the improved performance of public sector savings, emergency assistance
from sources such as the Caribbean Development Facility (CDF), amounting to
approximately US$13 million per year, will still be required for 1979-80.

Balance-of-Payments Outlook
25.       In balance-of-payments management Guyana must undertake several
tasks in addition to the basic objective of maintaining imports at a level
sufficient to support an at least modest rate of economic growth. These
include (1) progressive reduction of the current account deficit to a level
sustainable over a longer run with normally expected amounts and kinds of
capital inflows, (2) the elimination of commercial arrears as rapidly as
possible, (3) a rebuilding of depleted reserve levels, (4) fulfillment of
debt service obligations, and (5) improvement in the structure of external
debt.



- 10 -
26.       The urgent need to reduce the current account deficit in 1978
requires holding imports to little above the 1977 level in nominal terms;
in real terms they are expected to be 5% below the level of 1977 and 23%
below that of 1976. Thus total imports as a percent of GDP are projected to
drop from 91% in 1976 to about 70% in the 1978-80 period with the major
cutbacks expected to be in imports of non-essential consumer goods. This
should be sufficient to support GDP growth rates averaging about 4.0%. This
high import coefficient reflects both the small size (GDP of US$440 million in
1977) and the high degree of specialization of the economy (sugar, bauxite/
alumina and rice account for 68% of total value added in primary and secondary
activities).

27.       Merchandise export receipts in 1978 are projected to increase to
US$325 million, about 25% over the poor showing in 1977, and be equal to 65% of
GDP. Sugar exports are expected to increse to 331,400 tons this year, benefit-
ing from about 47,000 tons of mature cane, which was left uncut in the wake of
the strike last year, and which was harvested at the beginning of 1978. Despite
guaranteed exports of 167,000 tons per year and preferential prices from the
EEC countries, price prospects are less favorable for the rest of the export
crop, as the new International Sugar Agreement has had no immediate impact
upon the low world sugar prices. Rice exports are expected to be 114,100 tons
in 1978 after the record 1977 harvest. The CARICOM market is expected to
absorb 82,000 tons at the prevailing premium prices and the world market
should be able to absorb the balance. Bauxite receipts should increase by
over 12% primarily because of increased volumes of dried bauxite, alumina and
alumina hydrate.



- 11 -
28.       The prospects for exports continue to be reasonably favorable for
1979 and 1980 despite the relatively low prices expected. In 1979 the volume
of sugar exports is expected to decline slightly by about 6% below the 1978
levels when, as noted above, a substantial amount of uncut cane helped boost
the export volume. In 1980, the volume of sugar exports is expected to
increase slightly as a result of planned increases in planting area. Rice
export volumes are expected to increase to about 145,900 tons in 1979 and
163,000 tons in 1980 as a result of rising output from new acreage under double
cropping and propagation of improved seed varieties. Bauxite export volumes
should continue to expand as the ongoing investments begin to yield and pro-
duction is increased to meet commitments under long-term contracts for calcined
bauxite. The medium-term price prospects for all three major export commodi-
ties are fair. Beyond 1980 prospects for increased export volumes as well as
improved prices are promising for Guyana's exports. Investments included in
the investment program will already be contributing to increased export
volumes in 1980. Government authorities indicate that they expect Guyana will
be able to achieve by 1985 the export targets indicated in Table 2. By 1985
sugar acreage will be increased to fully utilize the existing refining capacity
of 400,000 tons while exports are expected to reach 369,000 tons. The volume
of rice exports is expected to increase at an average rate of 17% per annum
beyond 1980. Bauxite volumes are expected to continue to expand as previous
investments come to maturity in 1981. By then, the production capacity of
calcined bauxite would be 1,190,000 tons, permitting a substantial expansion
of the volume of exports. Alumina exports are expected to increase by about
3.5% per annum. Expansion of lumber processing capacity should come on line
in 1981 when these exports are expected to reach three and a half times the
1980 levels. Other non-traditional exports, while small in absolute amounts,
are also expected to grow at a fast pace.
29.       For achieving both the 1980 and 1985 targets referred to above,
the most strategic factor will be the timely execution of the substantial
number of export-oriented projects included in the public investment program
(see paras. 16-21 above). In addition, it will be necessary to maintain
the type of policies recently adopted (see paras. 12 and 14 above) to achieve
over the long run an appropriate price structure, in order to ensure the
financial viability of the state enterprises operating in these fields.
Furthermore, it will be necessary to provide incentives to private producers
and cooperatives to step up production for the export trade. The Government
has already instituted some trade promotion measures for increasing exports.
Recently, new markets have been found for bauxite in Japan and the USSR.
Export opportunities for rice in the European markets are being pursued and
some quantities of rice have been shipped to these markets. In order to
promote lumber exports and train personnel in export marketing, necessary
arrangements are being negotiated with an established timber company in
Europe. The Government is fully committed to pursue its export-oriented
strategy; the Bank staff has assessed the program and believes that it is
feasible.
30.       Given the expected export volumes and the modest improvement in
the terms of trade in the 1978-80 period, it does not seem possible for Guyana
to meet import requirements and to reduce its current account balance of
payments deficit by more than a small amount each year. Thus the projected



- 12 -
current account deficit for 1980 represents 6% of GDP compared to a planned 8%
in 1978 (but over 20% in 1977 and over 30% in 1976). The adjustment process
in Guyana, including reducing the current account deficit to a level sustain-
able in the longer run, is likely to extend into 1982 rather than be completed
by 1980.
31.       The projected current account deficit for 1978-80 totals US$117
million or about 7% of GDP for the period. The net inflow from long-term
public sector loans, however, is expected to be US$193 million or about 11.4%
of GDP. The proposed program loan will be equal to approximately 16% of net
external borrowing of the public sector in 1978 and 5% for the three year
period.

32.       The required gross disbursements of public loans are, because of
heavy debt repaymentc, substantially higher than the net inflow. Scheduled
debt repayments amount to US$175 million in 1978-80 (10.3% of GDP for the
period). Thus the gross disbursements of public sector medium and long-term



- 13 -
loans must total US$369 million (21.7% of GDP for the period) if the objec-
tives mentioned in paragraph 23 are to be fulfilled. These disbursements,
by necessity will have to include non-project forms of finance. The more
creditworthy public sector cooperations (BIDCO and GUYSUCO) are expected to
undertake gross external borrowings of about US$48 million in 1978 and
US$27 million per year in 1979 and 1980 which will approximately offset the
total of their own repayments of financial credits, payments on nationalization
loans and Central Government repayments of financial credits. Other resources
totalling US$84 million over the three-year period 1978-80 are expected to be
mobilized through commodity assistance, emergency assistance (such as that
through the Caribbean Development Facility) and other miscellaneous official
assistance.
33.       The financing program would permit reasonable progress toward the
objectives mentioned above. Essential import levels could be maintained,
arrears could be eliminated by 1980 and existing debt service obligations
would be fulfilled. While the current account balance-of-payments deficit
would still be above what seems to be a sustainable level, and the processes
of rebuilding international reserves and restructuring external debt would be
far from complete, substantial progress would have been made. (The need to
eliminate arrears delays progress in rebuilding reserves and restructuring
public debt, but more rapid progress is expected to be possible in the latter
respects after 1980.) Particularly cautious economic and financial management
will continue to be essential in 1981 and 1982 in order to complete the
adjustment process.
34.       The servicing of public external debt obligations has become an
increasing burden on Guyana in recent years with declining export receipts
(because of falling sugar prices) and increased amortization liabilities, in
particular from nationalization loans and borrowings in commercial markets.
The public debt service ratio increased from under 5% in 1975 to 14% in 1977.
In 1978 it is expected to increase further to a gross level of 27% (equivalent
to 16% after netting out the expected refinancing of a BIDCO Eurodollar loan)
but is projected to drop back to 18% in 1979 and 16% in 1980. Provided that
the authorities take prompt action to institute the previously indicated
measures to cope with the severe financial difficulties confronting them, and
that official assistance is made available in the required magnitudes, and
at least in part on concessionary terms, the prospects for achieving viability
in the external account appears to be reasonably satisfactory. If these
conditions are fulfilled as anticipated, Guyana can be considered creditworthy
for Bank lending. Nevertheless, the situation will at best constitute an
extremely "tight fit" and, in the absence of a major unexpected improvement in
the terms of trade, it is unlikely that dependence on special non-project
assistance from official sources can be totally eliminated before 1982. The
balance-of-payments constraint on Guyana's growth is such that, should the
external capital inflow fall significantly below the projected level, the
country would have no choice but to reduce its growth rate below the presently
projected 4% per annum annual average.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN GUYANA
35.       The first Bank loan to the country was made in 1961 to the then
British Guiana for agricultural credit and that loan has been repaid in full.
Since independence in 1966, Guyana has received, net of cancellations,
US$40.8 million in loans from the Bank and US$13.5 million in credits from
IDA for eight development projects. In addition, an IDA credit of US$10 mil-
lion equivalent was approved recently for the Black Bush Irrigation Project.
Reflecting the development needs of the economy, past lending to Guyana has
been for physical and social infrastructure. 39% of Bank lending has been
for sea defenses, highways and power. Two education projects designed
to improve secondary education and strengthen agricultural and vocational
skills account for 33% of Bank lending to the country while assistance to
agriculture and livestock development account for the remaining 28%. Annex II
contains a summary of Bank loans and IDA credits as of August 31, 1978, with
notes of the status of ongoing projects. There has been no IFC operation in
Guyana. Recently, a refrigerator project has been proposed for IFC financing.
36.       In general, while the execution of Bank Group projects has been
satisfactory, the pace of project implementation has been slow. Shortage
of skilled technicians, institutional weaknesses, lack of a central office
to coordinate and monitor project implementation, and lack of enough resources
to meet local costs account for delays in project implementation. Since all
the ongoing projects (except for the Second Education Project) were appraised
before the substantial rise in world inflation in 1973-74, these projects
have been faced with substantial cost overruns to be met by Guyana. The
Bank Group has been assisting the Government in obtaining financing from
external sources to meet the needs of some of these projects. As a result
of these efforts, a financing package to meet the cost overruns of the Bank-
financed Tapakuma irrigation project is being worked out with the UK Overseas
Development Ministry (ODM), the OPEC Special Fund (OPEC-SF), the Canadian
International Development Agency (CIDA) and the Caribbean Development Bank
(CDB).
37.       Earlier Bank Group operations in Guyana have been mostly aimed at
strengthening both the physical and social infrastructure and the institu-
tional setup in the Government. The two Sea Defence projects (Ln. 559 and
Ln. 765) were designed to protect the coastal agricultural lands and the
country's administrative and population centers from tidal inundation.
The Highway Project (Cr. 301), while supporting agricultural operations,
included technical assistance to the Ministry of Works in preparing a
national transport development strategy. Acting as the executing agency
of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Bank organized
a transport sector study and helped in setting up the Central Transport
Planning Unit. The Power project (Ln. 875), cofinanced by CIDA and ODM,
was designed to increase modestly the thermal generation capacity and
integrate the national power system through frequency conversion and
interconnection. Also it contained provision for training and institu-
tional improvement. As in the case of the transport sector, the Bank,
acting as the execut;ng agency of the UNDP, organized a survey of
Guyana's hydropower potential.

38.       With a view to developing a relevant educational system and
reducing manpower constraints, the Bank Group has assisted Guyana with two
Education projects (Cr. 139 and Ln. 583 for the First Education project and
Cr. 544 and Ln. 1106 for the Second Education Project). These projects include
multilateral secondary schools, community high schools and teacher training
facilities, and emphasize agricultural education and rural training. The
Second Education project includes the development of curricula for technical
institutes, fellowships for technical teachers and a study to assess the
effectiveness of vocational and technical education and training system in
meeting Guyana's needs. This study would help identify priorities for long-
term investment in education and training.
39.       Apart from the recently approved credit for the Black Bush irriga-
tion project, the Bank Group has financed two directly productive projects,
namely, the Livestock Project (Cr. 221) and the Tapakuma Irrigation Project
(Ln. 1016). These projects seek to utilize Guyana's land resources so
that the country can fulfill its role as the food supplier to the CARICOM
while developing efficient livestock and rice production systems. The
Livestock project has helped to reduce imports of meat and dairy products
and is expected to lay the basis for an export-oriented livestock industry.
The investment already made in the agricultural development program in the
Tapakuma Irrigation Project has enhanced yields in rice, thus contributing
to increased export earnings. In order to assess the potential in agricul-
ture, a sector review was completed in 1977 under the Bank/FAO Cooperative
Program. Together with the ongoing Tapakuma Irrigation Project and the
IDB-financed MMA Irrigation Project, the Black Bush Irrigation Project
would help utilize the country's agricultural potential and increase both
export earnings and rural household incomes.
40.       It is proposed that the Bank Group's lending strategy continue to
emphasize increased production for exports, while continuing support for
essential infrastructural projects. The proposed forestry project in central
Guyana has been designed to increase significantly the export earnings of the
forestry sector by 1982. This project, as well as the irrigation projects,
which are devoted to export-oriented production, require complementary invest-
ments in training and institutional improvements. Assistance in these areas
is being arranged under programs financed by other bilateral and multilateral
agencies. The Bank Group has also arranged cofinancing for these projects
from other external aid agencies. In the proposed forestry project, cofinan-
cing is being arranged from the EDF, EIB and IDB.
41.       Among the infrastructural projects, the two areas which require
early attention are water supply and sewerage for Georgetown and elec-
tricity generation. While a feasibility study financed by the USAID has
been completed for the water supply and sewerage disposal project, it will
be necessary to carry out a feasibility study for power development. As
the ability of the economy to execute development projects improves, it
is expected that follow-up projects in agriculture and forestry will be
developed for Bank Group assistance in later years. For this purpose,
provision has been made by USAID in its financing of the Black Bush
irrigation project to conduct a feasibility study for development of lands
adjoining the Black Bush polder.



- 16 -
42.       The Bank has maintained a continuing dialogue with the Government
on its economic policies and development priorities. The policy measures
for economic recovery, as well as the new production-oriented investment
program adopted by the Government, are designed to correct imbalances in
the economy. In support of the policy measures and with a view to easing
critical shortages in investment resources, the Bank has helped organize
a subgroup of donors to coordinate aid to Guyana under the auspices of the
Caribbean Group for Cooperation in Economic Development. At the inaugural
meeting of the subgroup in June 1978, pledges amounting to US$19.2 million
were indicated by bilateral and multilateral agencies mainly for balance-
of-payments support. This amount includes the program loan and credit of
US$10 million which has been submitted to the Executive Directors.
43.       Bank Group financing accounts for about 8% of total external debt
outstanding and disbursed and about 4% of debt service. It is estimated that
by 1980 the Bank Group's share of total external debt outstanding and disbursed
would increase to 11% and total debt service to 5%.
PART III - FORESTRY SECTOR AND PROJECT AREA
44.       The total forest area of Guyana has been estimated at about
18.2 million ha (45 million ac), covering 83% of the land. Exploitable
timber in the forests is abundant. 3Roughly one-half of the forest area
consists of forests with 25 to 35 m /ha of exploitable timber. The country
has a considerable resource of fine timbers, one of which, the greenheart
(Ocotea Rodiaei), is in great demand internationally for marine construc-
tion.
45.       Despite considerable wood resources, the forestry sector contributes
less than 1% of GDP and 2% of total exports. Export earnings from forestry
in 1976 amounted to US$3.8 million or 1.3% of total export earnings. While
the volume of exports has increased at 11% per annum for the past decade,
the volume of sawn timber exports has declined at an average rate of 7%
per annum. The trade balance in forest products has remained negative,
mainly on account of paper imports. Employment in the forestry sector has
remained around 14,000 through the present decade, representing 7% of the
country's labor force.
46.       The forestry sector is under the Ministry of Energy and Natural
Resources (MENR), with a Forestry Department headed by the Conservator of
Forests. Lack of adequate personnel is felt at all levels in this sector.
Efforts are under way to relieve this constraint under technical assistance
programs financed by CIDA and the UNDP in cooperation with the Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO). In addition, the Government of New Zealand
is financing a technical assistance project for wood preservation.



- 17 -
47.       The export marketing of timber is the responsibility of the Guyana
Timber Export Board (GTEB) which was created in 1971. In addition to the
export marketing of all forest products, GTEB is responsible for collecting
export taxes and providing services to exporters. At present, GTEB's major
constraint in marketing abroad is its inability to obtain from the existing
industry timely deliveries of quality timber in the amounts required.
48.       The Government's policy in the forestry sector is designed to
increase public sector participation in forestry development and restructuring
the tenure relating to forest concessions. These concessions, which in the
past conferred exclusive rights for exploitation of wood within a confined
area of state forests, have been recently replaced by a timber sales agree-
ment which confers the right to cut a specified group of wood species within
an area, in accordance with a logging and utilization plan agreed between the
Forestry Department and the timber concern. While the various details of the
new timber sales agreement are being worked out, the timber concerns have
been given one-year permits to continue their operations.
49.       The principle building material for housing in Guyana is tropical
hardwood. Availability of sawn wood in the domestic market has been erratic
in the past. In an effort to stimulate production of treated wood for the
domestic market, the Government introduced a system of differential pricing
in 1976. However, the prices fixed were too low to stimulate additional
production and relieve the scarcity of timber in the local market.
50.       Government estimates that the average annual output of sawn wood
between 1968 and 1975 was 70,750 m3 (30 million bd ft). Production by the
five largest saw mills, four of which are in the private sector, accounted
for 75% of this output. The public sector enterprise, Guyana Timbers Ltd.
(GTL), ceased production in 1976 due to a major fire. In order to rehabili-
tate GTL, financing from CIDA and commercial sources has been arranged recently.
Although the number of saw mills increased from 65 to 75 and the installed
capacity was raised to 140,000 m3 (59.4 million bd ft) between 1970 and 1976,
there has been no significant increase in output. This indicates low utiliza-
tion of installed capacity and diminishing efficiency in operations. Because
of the variation in wood quality, inefficient production methods and worn
out machinery, the Guyanese sawmilling industry is low yielding by interna-
tional standards. Apart from sawmilling, there have been several attempts in
Guyana to develop other aspects of the forest industry, including seasoning
and preservation, prefabricated housing, and small-scale production of furni-
ture for local use. In addition, there have been attempts to increase produc-
tion of other minor products such as balata, mangrove bark, fuel wood and
charcoal.
51.       The current development plan for the period of 1978-81 provides for
investment of G$100 million (US$39 million) in the forestry sector. 80% of
these investments will be in public sector enterprises and institutions.
The most important investment to be carried out during this period will be
the project proposed herein. In addition, funds have been allocated for
production of prefabricated housing, rehabilitation of GTL and assistance in



- 18 -
administration, training and research in the forestry sector. Private sector
enterprise would receive financing for sawmilling and logging equipment,
mainly to replace obsolete equipment. CIDA is assisting these efforts with
a loan of G$17.2 million (US$6.8 million). CIDA's assistance also provides
for technical assistance and training.
Project Area
52.       The concession area in which the project forests are located is
situated in the Upper Demerara-Essequibo basin and comprises some 222,000 ha
(540,440 acres). The area is above the main rapids in the Demerara and
Essequibo Rivers.  The forests in this area are the richest in Guyana, have
never been exploited, and contain the largest stand of greenheart in the
world. In addition, they are well stocked with other valuable species that
have been exported by Guyana for the last 15 years or so. These forests
were inventoried by FAO/UNDP and the Guyana Forest Department (GFD) between
1969 and J970 and were estimated to contain a gross volume of3about 22.4
million m of some 63 identified species, an average of 147 m ha (2,100
cu ft/acre). There is enough wood available to keep the proposed mill
supplied for over 46 years based on the use of 12 species of known
merchantable acceptance, even without using any of the 51 remaining species,
some of which are likely to become marketable in the future. The proposed
project would utilize the abundant resources in this region for establishing a
modern timber extraction and processing complex.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
53.       The proposed project was first identified by or FAO/UNDP study
in 1971. Subsequently, additional studies were done in 1974-75 in connection
with a larger sawmill complex which was under consideration by Guyana in
partnership with Messrs. McMillan Bloedel and Company of Canada. These
discussions were suspended in 1975 and as a result the Bank and Guyana com-
pleted preparation of the project proposed herein in December 1976. The
project was appraised in October/November 1977. A supplementary project
data sheet is contained in Annex III. A report entitled "Staff Appraisal
Report - Guyana Upper Demerara Forestry Project (No. 1935-GUA," dated
September 26, 1978) is being distributed separately. The loan was negotiated
in Washington, DC between August 30 and September 1, 1978, with a delegation
headed by Mr. Winston Murray, Deputy Secretary to the Treasury.
Project Objectives
54.       The objectives of the project are to:
(a) increase the country's foreign exchange earnings by
rapidly expanding exports of wood products;



- 19 -
(b) diversify the exportable species of timber by gradually
introducting in the world market the lesser known species;
(c) increase supply of lumber to meet the needs of the domestic
economy; and
(d) penetrate the uninhabited hinterland for future growth
and development.
Project Despcription
55.       The proposed project seeks to attain the objectives stated above by
establishing an integrated operation for wood extraction and processing in
Central Guyana (see map). The potential for timber operations in this area
will be developed in stages. The proposed project constitutes the first
phase of such development. The main components included in the project are:
(a) Logging and transport equipment for logging of 93,500 m3
of roundwood per year in an area initially of 152,000 ha.
(375,400 acres);
(b) a sawmill with an output capacity of 41,100 m3 (17.4 million
bd. ft) of lumber per year and repair shops and transport fleet;
(c) a 6,000 kw power plant based on waste wood fuel;
(d) a township for 1,500 people, including families of 500
employees associated with project activities;
(e) port facilities including 110 m (350') wharf, storage
sheds and loading equipment, and an access road of 13 km
(8 miles); and
(f) consultant services for design engineering, construction
supervision and management of the project and for carrying
out a forest management research program.
ProiJect Implementation
56.       The proposed project would be executed and operated by a newly
created State-owned enterprise known as the Demerara Woods Limited (DWL).
This company was registered in July 1978, with a share capital of G$20 million
(US$7.8 million). The Board of Directors of DWL is chaired by a representa-
tive of the MENR and includes representatives of the Ministries of Finance and
Economic Development. Other members of the Board are yet to be appointed. It
is expected that the Project Director and a representative of the GTEB would
be appointed as Directors of DWL.
57.       The engineering design of the project prepared by a consulting
firm (Messrs. Agrar-und-Hydeotechnik GMBH of Germany) and financed by EDF
is well advanced and is expected to be completed by November 1978. The



- 20 -
consultants who were employed by MENR in consultation with the Bank and
EDF would be retained by DWL to supervise the construction and manage the
operations of DWL during the first three years. The consultants would
provide key management personnel. DWL would employ local personnel for other
managerial positions. These would include a Project Officer, a Secretary and
an Accountant. The Project Director, who would be provided by the consultants,
and the locally recruited managerial staff would be appointed in consultation
with the Bank not later than December 31, 1978 (Section 3.03 of draft Project
Agreement). The signing of contracts for the employment of engineering and
management consultants is a condition of effectiveness of the Bank loan
(Section 5.01(c) of the draft Loan Agreement). On-the-job training would be
provided by the consultants to DWL personnel to facilitate the transfer
of management to local staff gradually over a three-year period. In addition,
a project unit headed by the Permanent Secretary of MENR and composed of the
Project Officer, Secretary, and a representative each of its Ministries of
Economic Development and Works, has been established to coordinate the various
activities relating to project implementation. Subsequently, when the manage-
ment consultancy team assumes its duties, the project unit would provide the
local support to the consultants and act as a liaison between the consultants,
DWL and MENR until one year after the sawmill commences operations (Section
3.04 of draft Loan Agreement).
58.       In order to provide trained personnel as the project becomes oper-
ational, a Steering Committee would be set up by the MENR before January 31,
1979, to establish and implement programs to train as many logging and saw-
milling personnel as possible under training schemes financed by FAO and
CIDA (Section 3.05 of draft Loan Agreement). In addition, on-the-job
training of key personnel would be provided by the project consultants and
possibly by Messrs. Hinrich Feldmeyer and Company, who are providing technical
support to the project consultants. DWL has been granted the exclusive cutting
rights in the project area for 25 years under a timber sales agreement with
the Government. The agreement is renewable. The sawmilling complex would
become operational by early 1981 and is expected to reach full capacity by
early 1982.
59.       Development of the project would maximize the utilization of local
resources. The various buildings and facilities in the township, sawmill and
port would utilize local timber. The power plant would be based on waste wood
fuel.
60.       Supplies to the domestic market would be handled directly by DWL
while export items would be handled by the GTEB. Under a contractual arrange-
ment between DWL and GTEB, an agreed product mix would be maintained during
the first six years of operations of DWL, except for minor changes which are
required for technical or marketing reasons (Section 3.07(b) of draft Project
Agreement).



- 21 -
61.      DWL would participate in the research and development program now
underway in Guyana to investigate forest development options, review the
future forestry development potential, examine the institutional capability
of GFD and to carry out a sociological study of the population in the project
area. GFD would carry out these studies on DWL's behalf and 12 manmonths of
consultant services would be provided under the loan. DWL would also provide
vehicles and equipment to carry out the study in the project area.
62.      Monitoring of the project would be an integral part of the
responsibility of the management consultants. DWL would prepare a project
completion report not later than six months after the proposed investments
have been made and submit the report to both the MENR and the Bank.
Cost Estimates and Financing Plan
63.       The total project cost (net of local duties and taxes, but including
interest during construction) is estimated at US$30.5 million, of which
US$22.7 million (or 75%) would be in foreign exchange. Physical contingencies
are estimated at about 11% of baseline costs. Price contingencies, which
amount to 14% of baseline costs, have been calculated on the basis of price
increases of 8% in 1978, 7.5% in 1979, and 7% thereafter for civil works and
7% in 1978, 6.5% in 1979 and 6% thereafter for equipment and other investments.
64.       Apart from the proposed Bank loan of US$10 million, the project
would receive financing of US$7 million from the EDF, US$4 million from the
EIB, and US$5 million from the IDB.  Participation of EDF and IDB in the
project would be thorugh parallel financing. The loan from the EIB would
finance in part the Government's equity investment in DWL.  The Government
would contribute US$4.5 million towards the remainder of the project costs.
Following is a summary of project costs and financing plan:

65.        The proposed loan from the Bank would be for a term of 20 years,
including five years grace, with interest at 7.9%. The IDB loan is expected
to be concessional, with a term of 40 years, including 10 years' grace and
interest at 1% for the first ten years and 2% thereafter. The EDF assistance
of US$7 million equivalent is expected to take the form of a grant of US$1.0
million and a loan of US$6.0 million for 40 years, including 10 years' grace
and interest at 1% per annum. The EIB's loan of US$4 million to the Government
for partially financing the Government's equity holding in DWL is expected to
have a standard term of 20 years, including five years' grace and interest at
2% per annum. The Government would be the borrower and the proceeds of the
loans of the Bank, IDB and EDF would be relent to DWL under subsidiary loan
agreements between the Government and DWL. The signing of the financing
agreements with the EDF and IDB and the execution of a subsidiary loan agree-
ment between the Government and the DWL are among conditions of effectiveness
of the Bank loan (Section 5.01 of draft Loan Agreement).
66.        The total equity of the company would be US$9.5 million, and would
include the financing provided by the EIB's loan (US$4 million), the EDF grant
(US$1 million), and the Government's contribution (US$4.5 million). The
debt-equity ratio of DWL would not be increased above 70:30 during the life
of the project without the Bank's concurrence. DWL would not incur any debt
other than the borrowing for financing the project, unless its net revenues
for the fiscal year preceding the incurring of the debt were at least 1.5
times the debt service requirements (Section 4.03 of draft Project Agreement).
67.        The rate of inflation in Guyana has been generally modest except
for the years immediately following the increase in fuel prices. After
registering an increase of 20% in 1974, the rate of inflation dropped to
about 5% in 1975, 9% in 1976 and 11% in 1977. It is expected that the infla-
tion rate in the next three years would average around 9%. There has been no
investment by commercial banks in development projects such as the one proposed
herein. Consequently, there is no point of reference for determining the
long-term lending rate operating in the economy. In the proposed project
investment will be made in the undeveloped hinterland of Guyana and substan-
tial outlays are required for developing the necessary infrastructure.
Consequently, the Bank loan would be relent to DWL for a term of 20 years,
with five years of grace, at an interest rate of 10% per annum and DWL would
bear the foreign exchange risk. The proceeds of the IDB loan are expected to
be passed on to the company for 20 years, with five years of grace, at an
interest rate of 7.5% per annum. The proceeds of the EDF loan would be onlent
by the Government to the DWL for a term of 15 years, including five years of
grace, with interest at 6% per annum; however, during the construction period
of the first two years, interest payable by DWL would be at 1% per annum.
Marketing
68.        The pro'ect is expected to increase annual productioi of lumber
by about 41,000 m by 1982. Of ihis production, 80% (33,000 m ) would be for
exports, and the balance 8,000 m would contribute 10% of the estimated
total domestic consumaption by that year, particularly by the housing sector
and these sales would be handled directly by DWL.  The project would channel



- 23 -
its exports through the GTEB under a marketing agreement approved by the Bank
and to be executed before January 1, 1981, which would establish the product
mix, production schedules, loading terms and specifications, and handling
fees and charges, prices and payments. GTEB already has marketing arrangements
with 18 countries and difficulties in the past were mainly created by an un-
reliable production capability which did not allow long-term contracts and
permanent relations with the clients. Arrangements for marketing the output
of the project and training of GTEB marketing staff will be greatly enhanced
by an agreement now being negotiated between the GTEB and an internationally
recognized firm, experienced in tropical timber processing and marketing, in
return for rights to market some of Guyana's timber products in a selected
number of markets. The Government has agreed to make satisfactory arrangements
for training GTEB staff in export marketing by December 31, 1980 (Section 3.02
of draft Loan Agreement).
Procurement
69.       Procurement of all imported logging equipment, building materials
and ship loading equipment, as well as all vehicles (about US$5.2 million,
excluding contingencies) in orders exceeding US$100,000 would be by interna-
tional competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines. Orders valued
at less than US$100,000 and not exceeding an aggregate value of US$1 million
under the loan would be procured after competitive bidding based on local
advertising in accordance with local procedures acceptable to the Bank.
In view of the unlikelihood of interest among international bidders to bid for
some of the smaller civil works contracts involved in this remote project area,
the Bank would consider the use of force account or, wherever appropriate,
local competitive bidding. Sawmilling equipment and machinery financed by
IDB, and power plant equipment and machinery financed by EDF, would be procured
under the procurement procedures of the respective institutions. Selecton of
consultants for engineering design was carried out by MENR and, in order to
ensure continuity of the consulting services, the same firm of consultants,
who were chosen with the Bank's concurrence, would be retained for construc-
tion, supervision and project management by DWL. The consultant services to
be financed by the Bank Group would amount to 20 man years, at the rate of
about US$100,000 per man-year, including overheads.
Disbursement
70.       The loan would disburse funds over a period of about four years, as
follows: (a) 100% of foreign exchange expenditures for equipment and vehicles,
including logging, workshop and forest research equipment) up to an amount of
US$2.1 million equivalent; (b) 100% of foreign exchange expenditures for
consultant services for supervision of construction, management and forest
management research, up to an amount of US$2.4 million equivalent; (c) 35% of
total expenditures for civil works, including buildings, housing, wharf and
yard, road construction and infrastructure, up to US$3.2 million equivalent;
and (d) interest and other charges on the Bank loan, up to an amount of US$1.5
million equivalent, as these become due; and (e) unallocated funds for a total
of US$800,000 equivalent. All disbursement claims from the proposed loan would
be supported by standard documentation, except in the case of civil works carried



- 24 -
out by force account where statement of expenditures would be required. The
borrower would retain all substantiating documents in respect of the civil
works expenditures done by force account and make available these documents to
the Bank for review whenever required.
Accounting and Auditing
71.       DWL would set up and maintain records and accounts of the project.
These accounts would be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable
to the Bank and the auditor's report would be forwarded to the Bank within
four months of the end of each fiscal year.
Project Benefits
72.       The project is intended to strengthen Guyana's balance of payments
position by utilizing the country's abundant forestry resources. The impact
of the project on Guyana's export earnings would be felt by 1981, when export
sales of the project output would generate about US$2 million. From 1982
onwards when the project would be fully developed, export earnings from the
project would amount to more than US$7 million per annum, nearly trebling the
amount of foreign exchange earned by Guyana's forestry sector.
73.       The proposed project constitutes the first phase of development of
forestry in the project area. In planning and designing this project, pro-
vision has been made for a second phase of development which would require
relatively small investments in infrastructure development. By establishing
a township for about 1,500 people, the project would provide a nucleus for
penetration of the hinterland. While the sawmill complex would directly
employ 500 people, it is expected that additional jobs would be created in
service industries to cater to the needs of the township and the industrial
complex. By expanding the market for lesser known timber species, the
project would help broaden the foreign exchange earning potential of the
forestry sector as a whole. Besides modernizing the timber production
operations, the project would also strengthen the capabilities of GTEB.
74.       The operation of the sawmilling complex would be financially
viable based on the assumption that 95% of the project's output would
constitute well-known species of timber and that 80% of project output
would be destined for the export markets. The financial return on capital
employed in the project would be 14%.
75.       On the basis of the quantified benefits directly attributable to
the project and assuming export prices of timber as projected by the Bank,
and a shadow exchange rate of G$3 is equal to US$1 (as against the official
rate of G$2.55 equals US$1), the economic rate of return of the project
would be 16%. Sensitivity tests show a reduction of the economic rate of
return to 14%, assuming an increase in initial investment cost by 15% or
a reduction in sale price by 10%. The use of the current exchange rate of
G$2.55 per US$1.00 would reduce the economic rate of return to 15%. Sensitivity
tests to production levels indicate that the project is not economically viable
if the capacity utilization falls below 75%.

Project Risks
76.       The existence of vast forest resources in the project area, the
employment of a competent management team during the first crucial years
of operation, the reliance on an international firm for marketing and a price
level which is expected to be favorable in the foreseeable future are all
factors which tend to minimize risks for the proposed project. The lack of
qualified local personnel and skilled labor is a problem but it is being dealt
with by including arrangements for training in the proposed management contract
and by assurances that Government would make use of all training facilities at
its disposal to prepare the necessary staff for the efficient operation of the
project during and after the period of service of the management consultants.
Environmental Impact
77.       The environmental impact of industrial logging in the project area
is not expected to affect the overall ecological balance of the surrounding
region adversely. Some minor modifications in forest microclimate are
inevitable and the possible effects on natural regeneration will be examined
in the silvicultural management research program proposed under the project.
Reforestation of the area logged by the project has not been considered at
the present time because only an average 19% of the total timber volume in
the project area would be extracted, an acceptable way to utilize tropical
rain forests with extremely vulnerable soils, particularly white and brown
sands areas such as the found in the region. The proposed forest management
research program would investigate the advisability of replantings as one of
the alternative silvicultural treatments required to keep the forests
productive.
78.       The scarce Amerindian population in the region is estimated at less
than 50 people, although no precise data exist. They are located in the
southern part of the project area, where logging operatons would not commence
for 15 or more years and they have already been exposed to alien cultures.
The timber sales agreement prohibits any activity other than those described
under the project within the project concession area; however, the proposed
forest management research program would include a component to determine the
actual number of the indigenous population and the expected cultural and
economic impact of the project, if any, on them and would identify any
remedial action necessary.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
79.       The draft Loan Agreement between Guyana and the Bank, the draft
Project Agreement between the Bank and DWL, and the report of the Committee
provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement of
the Bank are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.



- 26 -
80.       The execution of the Project Agreement on behalf of DWL and the
subsidiary loan agreement between Guyana and DWL, the signing of contracts for
the employment of the engineering and management consultants as well as the
signing of the IDB Loan Agreement, the EDF Loan Agreement and the EDF Grant
Agreement would be conditions of effectiveness for the proposed loan (Section
5.01 of the draft Loan Agreement).
81.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
82.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   Projects in Execution 1/
Cr. No. 221   Livestock Project; US$2.2 Million Credit of November 27, 1970
Effective Date: April 15, 1971
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
Progress in executing the project has been slow due to the absence
of appropriate institutions to promote livestock development among farmers who
are unaccustomed to utilizing debt financing for on-farm investment. Wide-
spread cattle rustling and farmers'/ranchers' uncertainty about the financial
attractiveness of the investment package offered have also affected project
performance significantly and only about 50% of the IDA credit funds have
been disbursed so far. Arrangements have been worked out between the Associa-
tion and Guyana to accelerate the granting of long-term leases and to include
lending for dairy farming under the project and the Closing Date of the
project has been extended to December 1978. Since prospects for disbursing
credit to the private sector are dim, IDA has approved financing of additional
Government ranches and a large Government dairy farm, as well as a dairy
settlement scheme, comprising about 27 dairy settlers.
Cr. No. 301   Highway Project:  US$4.4 Million Credit of April 26, 1972
Effective Date: November 15, 1972
Closing Date: June 30, 1979
Start of construction was delayed until July 1973. In view of the
contractor's unsatisfactory performance, the Government, with the Association's
approval, has been executing the works on "force account." However, progress
has been slow and only about 65% of the work has been completed to date. Lack
of cement and construction materials in recent months as well as mechancial
problems afflicting the truck fleet have caused delays in project implementa-
tion in recent months. The Ministry of Works is in the process of remedying
this situation.
Ln. No. 875   Power Project:  US$6.0 Million Loan of January 12, 1973
Effective Date: May 8. 1973
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
This project for which cofinancing has been provided by UK-ODM, CIDA
and the Bank has encountered delays in implementation and cost overrun of about
36%. Difficult relations between project consultants and the Borrower resulted
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

in delays in project engineering and implementation and the engineering cost
of the project increased by 98%. The Bank reallocated its loan to meet the
increased engineering costs and the ODM and CIDA contributed a larger share
of the equipment and construction costs. Completion of the project is now
expected in June 1979. Because of inadequate tariff levels, GEC made no
contribution to its 1976 construction program and its rate of return was
negative; however, new tariff structure and levels granted by the Government
effective January 1977 has resulted in about 46% overall increase in the
company's revenues in 1977, allowing GEC to earn a 10% rate of return.
Attrition of qualified personnel of GEC and inadequate availability of local
funds continue to affect project implementation.
Ln. No. 1016 Tapakuma Irrigation Project; US$12.9 Million Loan of June 25, 1974
Effective Date: May 27, 1975
Closing Date: June 30, 1980
The project continues to be about 18 months behind schedule due to a
delay in contracting consultant services for final design and supervision of
construction and agricultural development. Surveys, planning and design have
continued to progress. A civil works contract for the Tapakuma and Somerset-Berks
irrigation and drainage works and roads has been signed and construction started
in January 1978. Preparation of final designs are underway for the Johanna
Cecilia and Supenaam extension areas. Cost of civil works for the project has
increased about 130% over the appraisal estimate. In view of the financial
circumstances of Guyana, efforts are underway to secure additional external
assistance to meet the cost overrun and co-financing of US$4.0 million and
US$5.7 million equivalent have been approved by the OPEC Special Fund and ODM
respectively. The agricultural development phase of the project is progressing
and applied research and seed production programs are proceeding well. The
applied research and extension services provided by the project contributed to
yields which were the highest in the country. A program for extension training
is helping to resolve the scarcity of local agricultural staff, as well as
serve as a model for extension activities throughout the country. Availability
of scarce technical staff in the agronomic and civil engineering fields, however,
will constitute a growing constraint as project implementation proceeds.
Ln. No. 1106 Second Education Proiect; US$8.0 Million Loan and US$4.0 Million
Cr. No. 544   Credit of May 9, 1975;
Effective Date: July 8, 1975
Closing Date: June 30, 1980
The project encountered major delays in appointing consulting archi-
tects, engineers and quantity surveyors. Construction has started on the
Caribbean Animal Technician Training Center, and the institution is expected to
be ready for occupancy in September 1978. Construction contracts for all other
project institutions are expected to be signed during 1978, and it is now esti-
mated that the project should be completed about two years later than originally
scheduled. The major problem causing delays in design and construction of
project institutions is the ineffective administration of the civil works compon-
ent by the Project Uiuit. Preparation of master furniture and equipment lists is
proceeding satisfactorily. Curricula and syllabi for the community schools have

been completed and those of the new secondary Teachers' Training College are
nearing completion. Specialists' services have been secured in the areas of
Rural Training, Agricultural In-service Training and Communication and Social
Studies. There is a delay in the implementation of the fellowship program
and only five fellowships have been granted up to now.
