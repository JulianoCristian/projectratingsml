In\n            consideration to the passage of controversial legislation,\n            regarding the powers of the National Judicial Council,\n            namely, that the statute in question had restricted the\n            National Judicial Council's powers in disciplinary\n            matters, consequently, the achievement of a critical project\n            objective was unlikely, as stated in the Policy Letter, the\n            Bank granted an effectiveness extension on March 16, 1998.\n            However, potential instability risks had been identified\n            during project preparation, since effective Judiciary needs\n            to ensure impartiality, and credibility of judicial\n            decisions. Lessons mainly address the timing for project\n            preparation, i.e., the \"emergency period\" of the\n            Peruvian Judiciary, an issue which weakened institutions,\n            depriving same of any autonomy, or judicial participation in\n            the reform process.
