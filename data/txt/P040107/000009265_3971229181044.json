Component One modernizes\n            judicial administration and improves judicial performance in\n            selected districts. Its first sub-component strengthens\n            district offices and gives judges economic autonomy, designs\n            a preferential fee scheme for low-income groups, and\n            supports a public information campaign. Its second\n            sub-component improves the quality, predictability, and\n            timeliness of judicial decisionmaking; implements pilot\n            programs in selected districts; forms forums discussing\n            specific judgments; develops incentives; expands court\n            libraries; implements pilot-tested court organization and\n            case processing procedures; holds workshops; studies\n            quantitative and qualitative indicators measuring\n            performance; implements judicial information systems and\n            statistics; and remodels physical facilities.  Component two\n            establishes a judicial career system and improves judicial\n            ethics and accountability. Its sub-components strengthen\n            judicial selection and evaluation; develop judicial\n            institutions and implement training programs; and strengthen\n            the disciplinary system of the office supervising\n            magistrates. Component three implements training programs\n            for popularly elected lay judges and community authorities,\n            refines laws and regulations; promotes alternative dispute\n            resolution; and develops the Public Defender."}, "docdt": "1997-10-27T00:00:00Z"}
