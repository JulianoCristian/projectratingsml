Report (ICR) for the Second Gas Development Project (SGDP)\n            in Bangladesh. The objectives of the SGDP, as stated in the\n            Staff Appraisal Report, were to: (a) expand gas supplies in\n            line with expected incremental gas demand over the medium\n            term; (b) produce the country's first significant\n            quantities of condensate from the Kailashtila and Beani\n            Bazar gas fields; (c) initiate an appraisal program for the\n            country's main gas fields; and (d) strengthen the\n            management and operational capability of Petrobangla and its\n            operating companies. Despite a three-and-a half year\n            implementation the project achieved its main objectives of\n            gas production and gas field appraisal. There are several\n            key lessons to be learned from the project. The primary\n            causes of difficulty and delay during project implementation\n            were directly related to delayed procurement actions by the\n            Borrower. Future projects should be designed commensurate\n            with the management capacity of the implementing agency, and\n            specifically mandate advance procurement decisions. By\n            negotiations, all preparatory and design work should be\n            completed for the first two years, and should be ready for\n            tendering and award by effectiveness. Staff trained in\n            procurement should be on board in the implementing agency\n            prior to appraisal of a proposed project. Project\n            Implementation Units are useful entities to coordinate\n            implementation activities of a project, especially one as\n            complex as the SGDP. However, care must be taken not to\n            imbed disincentives to completion. Another lesson learned\n            relates to co-financing. A final lesson is it may be\n            preferable for IDA to finance smaller and less complex\n            projects in a desired sequential order to achieve greater\n            success in meeting development objectives. This would ensure\n            that the absorptive capacity of the Borrower is not\n            over-burdened, and that future investments are based on\n            assumptions that are both realistic and achievable."}, "docdt": "1997-01-22T00:00:00Z"}
