The following lessons are drawn from the\n            experience of these two projects: 1) in designing\n            institutional development (ID) project components, the\n            incentives for those directly concerned by proposed changes\n            should be well aligned with the project objectives. In\n            particular, the staffing and remuneration implications of\n            major institutional reorganizations (such as the creation of\n            GTCL), need to be well understood, and explicitly addressed,\n            if reorganizations are to be successfully implemented; 2)\n            building a strong gas industry of international standard,\n            requires a major ID effort: better management, greatly\n            increased training, better remuneration, and more autonomy;\n            3) the Bank should take a less dogmatic approach to sector\n            reforms, and practice greater sensitivity to local,\n            socio-political constraints, if it is to achieve\n            collaborative dialog, and succeed in obtaining the Borrower\n            'buy-in' to its proposals; and, 4) when the Bank\n            finds it difficult to justify its support for a particular\n            sector, due to policy differences, it should - strategically\n            - weigh the benefits of maintaining a flexible form of\n            engagement against the consequences of full withdrawal.\n            Repeated sharp changes in the Bank's involvement could\n            be damaging to its credibility, and could constrain its\n            ability to seek policy reforms."}, "docdt": "2004-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
