Development\n            Project's objectives are to support Petrobangla's\n            efforts to: (i) expand gas supplies in line with incremental\n            demand expected over the medium term and produce the\n            country's first significant quantities of condensate\n            available from the gas fields of Kailashtila and Beani\n            Bazar; (ii) initiate an appraisal program of the main gas\n            fields to provide a preliminary basis for their long-term\n            development; and (iii) strengthen its management capability,\n            particularly in the areas of field management and production\n            planning. The project will consist of: (a) a gas field\n            appraisal and development component that will comprise the\n            drilling of nine wells, the workover of two existing wells,\n            and a reservoir study for each producing field; (b) a gas\n            infrastructure component to bring the gas fields of\n            Kailashtila, Beani Bazar, and Rashidpur into production,\n            involving the construction of an approximately 117-mile long\n            gas pipeline with the necessary gas and condensate treatment\n            facilities; and (c) pilot CNG applications; and (d) training\n            and technical assistance."}, "docdt": "1985-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
