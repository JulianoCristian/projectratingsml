Credit\n            Project extends the process of structural reforms begun in\n            1985. It would support the Government's strategy to\n            promote private investment and exports, to improve the\n            efficiency of public sector resource mobilization and\n            allocation, and to alleviate poverty. The ultimate objective\n            is sustained growth, with equity, over the medium term.\n            While significant progress has been made towards financial\n            stabilization, public resource management improvement and\n            economic liberalization, Senegal is still faced with\n            important structural issues that need to be resolved.\n            Resolution of such issues is a prerequisite for the needed\n            supply response. The program's key areas are: (a)\n            private sector incentives; (b) public sector resource\n            management; and (c) minimization of the social costs of\n            adjustment. The project will be supported by the ongoing\n            technical assistance (TA) provided for civil service reform\n            and industrial restructuring and by the TA component of the\n            public enterprises reform. In addition, the Government is\n            formulating, with IDA support, a series of SECALs, notably\n            in banking, agriculture and transport sectors."}, "docdt": "1990-01-17T00:00:00Z"}
