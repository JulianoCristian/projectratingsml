Excellency:
Please refer to the Loan Agreement dated June 8,1994 entered into between the 
Republic of Paraguay (the Borrower) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and

In response to the Minister of Agriculture and Livestock’s request of January 
20,1998 to, inter alia: (a) extend the deadline to complete the carrying out of Part F 
of the Project until December 31,1998; (b) reallocate part of the proceeds of the Loan 
from Category (3)(a) to Category (3)(b) to continue providing technical assistance to 
the Pilot Administrative and Executing Unit under Part F.2 of the Project, as such 
categories are set forth in the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the Loan 
Agreement; and (c) create a new disbursement category by reallocating the proceeds of 
the Loan allocated to Category (6) to such new category to finance the incremental 
operating costs under Part F of the Project, as such category is set forth in the 
table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement, we are pleased to advise you 
that the Bank agrees to amend the Loan Agreement as follows:
1.
Section 3.01 (g) is hereby amended to read: “(g)  Without limitation to the 
provisions of Section 3.01(a) (i) (E) of this Agreement, the Borrower shall not later 
than December 31, 1998 or such later date as the Bank shall establish, complete the 
carrying out of Part F of the Project.”.
2.
The table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement is modified to read 
as set forth in the Attachment to this letter.
3.
Paragraph 1(a) of Schedule 8 is hereby amended to read as follows:
“(a)
the term ‘eligible Categories’ means Categories (3)(b), (7) and 
(8) 
set forth in the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to this 
Agreement in 
respect of Part F of the Project;”.
This Amendment Letter shall be executed in two counterparts each of which shall 
be an original.  Upon receipt by the Bank of one fully executed original of this 
Amendment Letter, these amendments will be effective as of March 5, 1997.  Please
