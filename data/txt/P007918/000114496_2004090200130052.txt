Amendment to the Loan Agreement
Excellency:
Please refer to the Loan Agreement dated June 8, 1994 entered into between the 
Republic of Paraguay (the Borrower) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development (the Bank), as amended.
In response to the Borrower’s March 27, 1998 request to waive the 
prequalification threshold set forth in Part A.2 of Section I of Schedule 4 to the 
Loan Agreement, the Bank hereby agrees instead to increase the prequalification 
threshold from the equivalent of $1,000,000 or more per contract to the equivalent of 
$10,000,000 or more per contract and amend the Loan Agreement as follows:
 “2.
Bidders for works estimated to cost the equivalent of $10,000,000 
or more per 
contract shall be prequalified as provided in paragraph 2.10 of the 
Guidelines.”.
This Amendment Letter shall be executed in two counterparts each of which shall 
be an original.  Upon receipt by the Bank of one fully executed original of this 
Amendment Letter, this amendment will be effective as of the date first above written.  
Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing amendment by signing and dating the two 
counterparts of this Amendment Letter.
