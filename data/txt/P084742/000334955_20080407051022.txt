Project development objective Re$ PAD II.B., Technical Annex 3

The project development objective i s to enhance adaptation to climate change in agriculture and
irrigation water management practices through awareness-raising, institutional and capacity
strengthening, and demonstration activities inthe 3H Basin. This would help mainstream climate
change adaptation measures, techniques, and activities into the national Comprehensive
Agricultural Development (CAD) Program which is China's largest national investment program
inirrigatedagriculture.
The mainproject development impact indicators would be: (a) increased climate change
adaptation awareness o f farmers, Water User Association (WUA) and ProfessionalAssociations
(FA)members, technical staff, andofficials (percentage o fpeople); (b) relevant climate change
adaptation measures implementedinselected demonstration areas (number o fhectares) andby
participatory stakeholders (number o fhouseholds); and (c) documents issued by
SOCAD/POCADs/COCADs integratingadaptation policies, measures and activities (through

policy briefs, government reports, implementation and/or replication plans).

                    I. STRATEGICCONTEXTANDRATIONALE

A. Country and sector issues
1.      The North China Plain or Huang-Huai-Hai River Basin (3-H Basin) is particularly
vulnerable to the impact o f climate change. Overall, China i s in the bottom 25 percent o f
countries in terms o f water availability per capita. Within China, 3 H Basin has only about one-
third o fthe China average andabout halfthe per capitawater availability specifiedbythe United
Nations as the standard for maintaining socio-economic and environmental development. At the
same time, the 3H Basin i s China's prime agricultural area and breadbasket, producing some 50
percent o f national grain output and accounting for about 35 percent o f national industrial output.
The basin also has a population o f 425 millionpeople. Water demand inthe region, already high,
i s growing rapidly. However, available water resources generally are already fully allocated and
often overexploited. Moreover, in several locations, increasing water quality degradation
exacerbates water shortage problems. The projected climate changes could further decrease
water stream flows and groundwater recharge in the Basin, while concurrently increasing
irrigation water demand and withdrawals due to higher temperatures and consequent higher crop
evapo-transpiration (ET).
2.      It has been shown recently that the stagnation o f grain production for a number o f
consecutive years in the 3 H Basin area i s linked to climate variability. China's irrigation-based
agriculture inthis region will be further negatively affected by climate change, and remedial and
adaptation measures need to be taken to ameliorate these effects. Action i s needed quickly
because it takes time for such measures to have a significant impact.
3.      Adaptation involves making adjustments in the management o f productive activities,
assets and natural resources (inthis case, agriculture and water) inresponse to actual or expected
climatic changes and their effects or impacts. The goal is to reduce the vulnerability o f
communities, regions and activities to climate change. Especially important with regard to
adaptation are: (a) the assessment o f climate change impacts and vulnerabilities; and (b) the
development and evaluation o f climate change response and adaptation options.
4.      These issues and their relationship to climate change are only recently becoming clear
and their seriousness understood. In fact, past and current interventions generally have not
addressed climate change and how to adapt to it. This is the case, for example, with the
country's National Comprehensive Agricultural Development Program (CAD) and the Bank-
supported Irrigated Agriculture Intensification I11Project (IAIL3) which i s part of the C A D
Program. The objectives and components o f IAIL3 are important but do not consider climate
change factors, their likely impacts and how to prevent or reduce their negative impacts.
However, climate change adaptation has recently become an important national priority inChina
and IAIL3 needs to be strengthened to include objective assessments o f measures and priorities
for adaptation to climate change and to address gaps inthe original design o f IAIL3. Indeed, the
main objectives o f IAIL3 are to increase water and agriculture productivity inlow- and medium-
yield farm land areas, raise farmers' incomes and promote sustainable participatory rural water
resources management and agro-ecological environmental management in the 3-H Basin. The
main components o f IAIL3, especially on water-saving irrigation, drainage, agro-ecological
environmental protection and management are likely focuses o f any future adaptation to climate
change strategy.     However, IAIL3 components were not designed with climate change as an



                                                  1

impact factor, which means that there may be a number o f vulnerabilities due to increasing
climate variability and change that need to be addressed.
5.      IAIL3 i s unusually well suited to the purpose o f introducing and demonstrating climate
change adaptation measures. The project covers the primary food production region in China,
the 3 H Basin. This basin i s particularly vulnerable to the impacts o f climate change and
according to some recent research has already begun to feel the effects o f climate change.
IAIL3's largest components are water saving irrigation and water saving agriculture, which are
among the most likely areas to be affected adversely by climate change. Morevover, as part of
the national C A D program, IAIL3 offers a potential path for mainstreaming adaptation measures
into a major national program. IAIL3 i s implemented by the State Office for Comprehensive
Agricultural Development (SOCAD) in the Ministry o f Finance (MOF) which, because o f its
position, has significant influence with all provinces and close working arrangements with
central agencies concerned with adaptation to climate change, including the ministries o f Water
Resources and Agriculture and the State Forest Administration. Finally, M I L 3 i s based on a
flexible "program approach" design which facilitates the incorporation o f measures to
demonstrate climate change adaptation and to fill adaptation gaps duringproject implementation,
since such measures were not included inthe original project. The proposed GEF/SCCF (Special
Climate Change Fund) financed project has been designed as a gap-filling and programmatic
operation that would focus on the 3 H region with possible expansion to other regions as
appropriate, based on initial experience with the project.
6.      China ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)
and the Kyoto Protocol inJanuary 1993 and August 2002, respectively. Itjoined the Convention
on Biological Diversity and the United Nations Convention on Drought and Desertification.
Therefore, China i s eligible for SCCF administered by the Global Environment Facility (GEF).
More recently, China has also developed a strong policy and strategic framework to support
climate change adaptation, setting out several national environment and sustainable development
policies, strategies and programs, and identifying adaptation to climate change as a national
priority. These policies and programs relate directly to China's Initial National Communication
on Climate Change, the National Strategy for Climate Change, the New Environmental
Protection Standards, the CAD, and the ongoing IAIL3 Project.


B. Rationale for Bank involvement
7.      The proposedproject is consistent with the Bank's assistance to China inthe rural sector,
focused on reducing the inequality between urban and rural areas and on facilitating the shifts
from subsistence to commercial agriculture and from quantity to quality and value o fproduction.
The proposed project is also consistent with the Bank's recent China Water Resources
Assistance Strategy, which confirmed that better water resources management was central to
sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction. The project i s highly innovative and can
help establish a model which is very relevant to GoC's priority o fusingthe Bankto help develop
and explore adaptation measures to address agricultural and associated natural resource
management vulnerabilities to climate change. Adaptation concepts and measures developed
under this project will thus further enhance the relevance, quality and sustainability o f the
investments and work that the Bank i s supporting in rural China. In addition, the proposed
project will contribute to the successful implementation o f the Bank's "China Country



                                                2

Partnership Strategy (2006-20 10)'' which focuses on economic integration, poverty reduction
andsustainable development.
8.      Agriculture and rural development are central to China's strategy to accelerate economic
growth and poverty reduction. However, China has little experience dealing with adaptation to
climate change in agriculture and water resource management. With its global perspective, GEF
(in partnership with the Bank) is the leading body in this new field and is well positioned to
provide knowledge and institutional experience gained from its programs worldwide.
9.      Implementation o f the proposed project will require close coordination and integration
with IAIL3 and therefore the Bank's direct involvement will be required. Moreover, as the
executing agency for the proposed project, the Bank has the capacity to mobilize worldwide
expertise on a wide range o f aspects related to project management, agriculture, water resources
management and climate change adaptation to assist in both project preparation and
implementation. Inaddition, results and lessons from other Bank-executed, related activities can
be utilized under this project. Finally, the Bank already has supported large investments in
agriculture, irrigation and rural development in China; this provides strong incentives for the
Bank to support effective adaptation measures which can help make China's agriculture and
irrigation more resilient against climate change and variability.
10.     In addition, the Bank is the Implementing Agency of the ChindGEF Integrated
Management o f Haihe River Basin Water Resource and Water Environment project that focuses
on reforming water administration institutions and related capacity-building. The project
includes the concept of E T management in order to increase water-use efficiency, mitigate water
resource shortages and improve the ecological environment. The Haihe project also includes
Hebei Province but project areas o f the two projects do not overlap and the Haihe project does
not include adaptation to climate change. However, the proposed GEF/SCCF adaptation project
team has coordinated with Haihe project team during the project preparation, and these two
projects would further coordinate and complement each other duringimplementation.


C. Higher level objectives to which the project contributes
11.     The higher level objectives to which the proposed GEF/SCCF project contributes are: (a)
to strengthen the resilience o f agricultural development to climate change in North China; and
(b) to help mainstream climate change adaptation in irrigation and rural water resource
management.
12.     The project is consistent with the goals o f the Bank's assistance to China in the rural
sector, which i s focused on reducing inequality between urban and rural areas and on facilitating
the shift from subsistence to commercial agriculture and from quantity to quality of production.
The successfil implementation o f this project will contribute to the approved "China Country
Partnership Strategy (2006-20 1O)",     which focuses on economic integration, poverty and
sustainable development inChina.

A. Lendinginstrument
13.     The proposed project would be partially blended with the ongoing IAIL3 project
(P084742). Its cost totals US$55.5 million to be funded by: (a) a GEF/SCCF grant (from the
Special Climate Change Fund) o f US$5 million; and (b) US$ 50.5 million financed under the
ongoing IAIL3 including US$30.5 million from government (SOCAD) and US$20 million from
the IBRD loan.


B. Projectdevelopmentobjectiveandkeyindicators
14.    The project development objective i s to enhance adaptation to climate change in
agriculture and irrigation water management practices through awareness-raising, institutional
and capacity strengthening and demonstration activities in the 3 H Basin. This would assist in
mainstreaming climate change adaptation measures, techniques and activities into the national
Comprehensive Agricultural Development (CAD) Program which i s China's largest national
investmentprogram inimgated agriculture.
15.    The main project development impact indicators would be: (a) increased climate change
adaptation awareness o f farmers, Water User Association (WUA) and Farmer Professional
Associations (FA) members, technical staff and officials (percentage o f people); (b) relevant
climate change adaptation measures implemented in selected demonstration areas (number o f
hectares) and by participatory stakeholders (number o f households); and (c) documents issuedby
SOCAD/POCADs/COCADs integrating adaptation policies, measures and activities (through
policy briefs, government reports, implementation and/or replication plans).


C. Projectcomponents
16.     The project objectives would be achieved through the implementation o f three
components inthe six project provinces: Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Ningxia.
Implementation o f these components would lead to the integration o f climate change adaptation
measures, techniques and activities into the national C A D program. Based on a preliminary gap
analysis o f IAIL3 from a climate change adaptation perspective, these components can be
described as follows:
17.     Component 1: Identification and Prioritization of Adaptation Options (US$OSO
millon from GEF/SCCF). Adaptation involves making adjustments in economic, social or
ecological systems in response to actual or expected climatic changes and their effects or
impacts. The goal o f adaptation i s to reduce the vulnerability o f individuals, communities,
regions or activities to climatic change and variability. Understanding adaptation is important for
two reasons: (a) adaptation will reduce the final impacts o f climate change and thus i s important
for mitigating vulnerability; and (b) what specifically should be done in different places over
different time periods to facilitate adaptation needs to be determined. Preliminary work on this
component was started during project preparation under the Project Preparation Grant (PPG).
Under the proposed project, this work would continue in order to: (a) finalize conclusions and
recommendations from the PPG work; and (b) undertake additional work on impact assessment,


                                                 4

gap analysis and selection and prioritization o f measures to expand adaptation to C A D
investment areas, The work would integrate climatological, hydrological, and economic analyses
through the related models and studies. The analyses would capture climate change impact and
adaptations for both irrigated agricultural development (climate change sensitivity at the local
levels) and irrigation water resources management (at the river basin level). The study outcomes
would be reviewed and disseminated by SOCAD and the six project provinces in accordance
with their specific circumstances andpolicies. Specific activities underthis component include:
        (a)      Impact assessment of climate change in 3-HBasin andproject area, including: (i)
        stocktaking o f previous studies; (ii)testing and adapting o f existing hydrology and
        agricultural production models to be dynamic and responsive to climate and resulting
        changing land cover-land use (including cropping patterns); (iii)assessing of the
        sensitivity o f 3-H Basin agriculture to climate andwater availability; and (iv) conducting
        farm households analyses inthe project area and elsewhere inthe 3 H Basin to determine
        climate sensitivity, water demand, adaptation response and the effectiveness o f
        household- and community-level adaptation options in the face o f projected climate
        change.     The work would integrate all the relevant climatological, hydrological and
        economic aspects; capture climate change impact and adaptations inboth agriculture and
        irrigation (climate sensitivity); and in water resources management (at the river basin
        level). The use o f these state-of-the-art modeling techniques to integrate climate,
        hydrology and agricultural economics over key spatial and time scales i s an important
        and essential innovation in the approaches that will be adopted under the proposed
        project;
        (b)       Gap analysis and study on adaptation measures. Adaptation measures for climate
        change were not included in the design o f IAIL3 and a gap analysis was conducted for
        IAIL3 during preparation o f the GEF/SCCF project. Preliminary key gaps in the design
        o f M I L 3 were identified with regard to climate change and adaptation to climate change
        in relation to knowledge and public awareness, design of irrigation and drainage
        facilities,  agricultural practices, farmer participation and economic cooperative
        organizations, water and soil conservation and biogas activities. During GEF/SCCF
        project implementation, the gap analysis would be expanded to cover more IAIL3 and
        C A D program areas inthe six project provinces. This analysis would identifythe needed
        adaptation measures and help integrate those measures more broadly into IAIL3 and the
        C A D program. SOCAD and the six POCADs would organize national, provincial and
        local scientists and experts to carry out any such additional gap analysis work at the
        national, provincial and local levels as needed; and
        (c)      Prioritization and selection of adaptation measures and demonstration areas.
        Based on preliminary results from project preparation work, activities under this sub-
        component would include: (i)identification and selection o f demonstration areas for
        adaptation, giving priority to areas with both high vulnerability and high likelihood o f
        making significant impacts; (ii)use o f scientific and technical analysis to develop
        potential adaptation options in terms o f content, implementation, costs and impacts o f
        various climate change scenarios on surface and groundwater and on flood and drought
        predictions and risks, in order to identify and select the most cost-effective adaptation
        measures for each project province; and (iii)   consultations with farmers and discussions




                                                   5

       with provincial and county experts to help incorporate empirical experiences into
       adaptation measures duringproject implementation.
18.    Component 2: Demonstration and Implementation of Adaptation Measures (US$48.43
million comprising US$2.25millionfrom GEF/SCCF and US$46.18million co-financed from
IAIL3). This component aims to introduce, demonstrate, and implement specific climate change
adaptation measures in selected demonstration areas; and to integrate appropriate adaptation
measures into the implementation o f IAIL3 to help reduce vulnerability to climate change inthe
3 H Basin. The adaptation measures would focus mainly on agricultural production andpractices
and on irrigation water management anduse, taking into account expected temperature increases
due to climate change. Adaptation measures would be carried out in conjunction with the
ongoing IAIL3 project and would be expanded to cover as much o f the IAIL3 project area as
possible. The two sub-components would be as follows:
       (a)      Demonstration of Climate Change Adaptation Measures (US$2.25 million from
       GEFBCCF).        Based on the gap analysis o f IAIL3 and preliminary conclusions o f
       scientific studies under Component 1, initially identified demonstration adaptation
       measures for each specific demonstration area would be introduced and demonstrated in
       each related sub-region o f the 3-H Basin (focusing on agricultural production and
       irrigation water management and utilization). The selected specific new activities (in
       addition to those included in IAIL3) include the following: (i)water resources
       management measures based on each sub-region 's conditions, including the development
       o f catchments (natural and artificial ponds) to enhance rainfall storage capacity and
       reduce water logging threats, well-based irrigation with reinforced prevention and
       resistance to drought and advanced field "real" water-saving irrigation technologies and
       works; (ii)adaptation-oriented farming practices, including adjustment o f farming
       patterns to reduce water consumption (proportion o f wheat-rice, wheat-rape seed and
       other crops would be adjusted based on the climate change tendency), and combining
       drainage with irrigation to avoid soil deterioration; (iii)
                                                                 water-savings-oriented farming
       technologies, including development o f drought resistant varieties, "seeded in water"
       practices, membrane and biological water conservation to deal with water scarcity, and
       land and eco-system rehabilitation and amelioration; and (iv) supporting through SCCF
       sub-grant financing, the development and expansion o f Farmers Associations and Water
       Users Associations for carrying out water-saving management and agricultural adaptation
       measures. The identified innovative adaptation activities would be implemented and
       tested in selected demonstration areas, and then supported, expanded and promoted
       where appropriate in all IAIL3 project areas, as described in (b). The specific additional
        activities andmeasures supported under the project are detailed inAnnex 4.
        (b)     Integration of Adaptation Measures into IAIL3 Project Implementation Activities
        (US$46.18 million from IAIL3 comprising US$18.47 million IBRD loan and US$27.71
       million counterpartfunding). The proposed component would focus on IAIL3 activities
       that are at risk from climate change. Based on the gap analysis o f IAIL3, scientific and
       modeling analysis under Component 1 and lessons from demonstration sites, this sub-
        component would review and refine the original IAIL3 technical design to help "climate
       proof' IAIL3 project activities. M I L 3 activities related to climate change adaptation
       would be modified and expanded as appropriate, including in particular: (i)   engineering
       water-saving    measures, including various water-saving irrigation and drainage


                                               6

        technologies and facilities; (ii)agronomic water-saving measures, including land
        leveling, deep plowing, minimum tillage, balanced fertilizer use, use o f crop residues,
        introduction o f adaptive varieties and high quality seeds, adaptive on-farm forestry belts
        (to be financed by sub-grants), etc.; and (iii)
                                                      water-saving management measures such as
        volumetric water charges and high quality WUAs/FAs (also financed through sub-
        grants). IAIL3 activities would be enhanced to respond to actual or expected short-term
        climate variability and long-term climate change and their effects ineach specific region.
        All identified IAIL3 activities related to adaptation measures would be supported and
        expanded where appropriate (see the detailed activities inAnnex 4).
19.     Component 3: Mainstreaming Adaptation into National CAD Program and
Institutional Strengthening (US$6.58 million, including US$2.25 million from GEF/SCCF
and US$4.32 million eo-financed from IAZL3). The component would aim to integrate and
mainstream climate change adaptation into the ongoing national C A D program. Key activities
would be a series o f capacity building,technical assistance, knowledge sharing, public awareness
activities and preparation o f a "National Climate Change Adaptation Plan" for C A D by SOCAD,
with the close cooperation o f Chinese Academy o f Sciences (CAS), the NDRC and M O F
national climate change adaptation offices. Sub-components and activities would include the
following:
        (a)     Research and development of adaptation policies (US$112,400from GEF/SCCF),
        including     development o f the national CAD climate change adaptation policy and
        replication and implementation plans;
        (b)     Institutional strengthening and capacity building on climate change adaptation
        (US$5.25 million, US$1,43 million from GEF/SCCF and US$3.82 million eo-financed
        from IAIL3), including training, workshops, technical assistance, study tours and
        information dissemination;
        (c)     Results-based monitoring and evaluation (M&E) (US$221,400from GEF/SCCF),
        including establishment o f a data, metadata, knowledge framework and implementation
        o f a results-based M&E system and a management information system (MIS) focusing on
        adaptation measures. Adaptation M&E would be linked to and coordinated with (and
        may be added on to) the ongoing comprehensive M&E system o f IAIL3 and will be
        designed to assess the effectiveness o f adaptation implementation mechanisms and
        measures; and
        (d)      Project   management (US$990,000,         US$490,000 from       GEF/SCCF and
         US$500,000 eo-financed from IAIL3 ) including support for project implementation
        management and dealing with project and implementation related issues such as
        procurement, financial management, the project Management Information System (MIS)
         and other incremental costs. In particular, the development o f mechanisms to promote
         and support cooperative work on adaptation between MOF, NDRC and SOCAD would
        be supported.
20.      Overall, the project logical framework that has been followed for the general design o f
the project, and the identification and sequencing o f project components can be summarized in
the diagram below:

D. Lessonslearnedandreflectedinthe projectdesign
21.     Although China i s still exploring specific climate change adaptation measures and
methodologies, lessons from experience have shown that there i s a wide range o f possible
adaptations with the potential to reduce adverse climatic change impacts. Many o f these
adaptations -especially in agriculture and water applications - represent improved resource
management and many have benefits in dealing with current climatic hazards as well as with
future climatic risks.
22.     Duringproject preparation, Chinese stakeholders, including scientists and farmers under
the leadership o f SOCAD and based on scientific information and empirical experiences, agreed
on two categories o f adaptation measures: (a) modification o f current practices to adapt to
changed climate trends inorder to avoid natural disadvantages or disasters; and (b) opportunistic
search for practices favored by global warming which will also better benefit humans and the
ecological environment. With this pro-active adaptation approach, adaptation measures would
embrace a much broader scope and thus adaptation could support and accelerate the process of
transition from traditional development into sustainable development.
23.     Adaptation measures could include: (a) using advanced water-saving irrigation
technologies and management to improve both technical and economic water-use efficiency; (b)
changing cropping patterns and practices including timing o f farm operations and mulching to
conserve soil moisture; (c) developing and using drought and flood-tolerant crop varieties; (d)
broader utilization o f biogas digesters, taking advantage o f rising temperature, faster growth o f
micro-organisms, more rapid fermentation and increased biomass production; and (e) increased
use o f greenhouses to allow farmers to utilize the favorable factors o f climate warming to
advance crop cultivation, save water and improve the capacity o f farmers inproduction o f cash
crops. The modeling framework and information system established under Component 1would
be utilized to evaluate adaptation tradeoffs throughout the region.
24.     It is important to highlight that current knowledge o f adaptation and adaptive capacity is
generally insufficient for rigorous evaluation o f planned adaptation options, measures and



                                                  8

policies. A key need i s to enhance the process o f consultation and decision-making on
adaptation, conditions that stimulate or constrain adaptation and the role o f non-climatic factors.
In addition, existing methods for evaluation adaptation options have limitations. For example,
economic benefits and costs are important criteria but are not always sufficient to determine the
appropriateness o f adaptation measures. Social andinstitutional criteria are also very important.
25.     The proposed project would also coordinate with the GEF-supported Hai Basin
Integrated Water and Environmental Management Project which was designed before the role o f
climate change adaptation was recognized but which includes a number o f activities which are
closely relatedto adaptation.


E. Alternativesconsideredandreasonsfor rejection
26.     The proposed GEF/SCCF project has been designed to be blended with IAIL3. An
independent "stand alone" and smaller operation using the GEF/SCCF grant for adaptation to
climate change only would have been inappropriate because the contemplated adaptation
activities are numerous and their testing clearly calls for a wider area o f implementation and a
longer time period. Inaddition, IAIL3 has included in its design a certain number o f activities
that can be characterized as good adaptation measures to cope with climate change. Moreover, a
stand-alone project would present much less opportunity for mainstreaming o f climate change
policy and adaptation measures directly into a Bank-financed project and the national C A D
program.
27.     The partial blending o f the proposedproject with IAIL3would be based on a gap-filling
analysis utilizing a programmatic approach adopted under IAIL3. This would lead to
identification o f specific priority climate change issues that need to be addressed under the
project. The proposed blending as proposed under the project would infact help: (a) identifythe
adaptation gaps inIAIL3 and expand and deepen responses as needed; (b) provide an adaptation
framework for comprehensive and cross-sectoral interventions; (c) support farmer participation,
institutional capacity building and public awareness on climate change and adaptation; (d) create
a favorable environment for more highly integrated agriculture and water management and for
replication o f good practices; and (e) avoid practices which run counter to climate change
adaptation needs.

A. Partnershiparrangements
28.      The partners for the GEF/SCCF project are the government, the concerned provincial and
local governments, the farmers and the World Bank. To establish climate change adaptation
priorities, needs and constraints, direct engagement with stakeholders i s essential. The major
direct intended beneficiaries o f the project are farmers and local communities in the
demonstration sites and the counties where these sites are located. Farmers, the private sector
andgovernments at other levels could also benefit from the project once it is replicated.




                                                9

29.    It is fimdamental to gather the most useful stakeholder input and this requires careful
planning and an inclusive stakeholder dialogue process. This process should: (a) include a wide
range o fnecessary viewpoints; and (b) enable the project to respondto adaptationpriorities.
30.    The stakeholder participation process will be interactive, with the initial project team
consulting with a small group o f stakeholders, to inform them on the initial development o f
project objectives, and then the full project team engaging a broad group o f stakeholders
throughout the project. A documentation log will be kept to retain institutional memory o f key
views, recommendations and agreed decisions by the stakeholders. It is important to note that
participation will apply to each o f the project components during both the design and
implementationstages.
31.    The major stakeholders o f the project are:
       (a)     National government departments, including Ministry of Finance (MOF),
       National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), Ministry o f Water Resources
       (MWR),Ministry ofAgriculture (MOA), State Environmental ProtectionAdministration
       (SEPA) and State Forestry Administration (SFA);
       (b)     National andregional research institutions and universities;
       (c)     Local governments and government staff, especially Finance Bureaus, Planning
       Commissions, Water Resource Bureaus (WRBs),             Irrigation Districts (IDS),Water
       Management Stations (WMSs), Agriculture Bureaus (ABS)andForestry Bureaus (FBs);
       (d)     The private sector including local input suppliers, traderdmerchants and
       dragonhead enterprises;
       (e)     Civil society and organizations, including Water User Associations (WAS),
       Farmer Associations (FAs) andFarmer Cooperatives; and
       (f)     Farmers and local communities.


B. Institutionalandimplementationarrangements
32.    The GEF/SCCF project will share project management and institutional arrangements for
implementation with IAIL3. The project would have a four-year implementation period up to
December 31,201 1. The project closing date will therefore be June 30,2012.
33.    Project Management and institutional responsibilities.              Effective institutional
management arrangements for the GEF/SCCF project are crucial to its success, especially in
view o fthe needto ensure an adequate breadth o fparticipationinimplementingthis new type o f
project and the objective o f integrating climate change adaptation into the national C A D
Program. As the implementing agency for the GEF/SCCF project, SOCAD will be responsible
for management, monitoring and supervision o f project implementation, ensuring that agreed
requirements and conditions are met and liaising with the Bank on behalf o f the six project
provinces. As under IAIL3, MWR, MOA, SFA, SEPA and other agencies as needed, will
provide technical support to ensure the project i s implementedsmoothly and according to plans.
It is particularly important that NDRC and its lower-level offices participate in design and
preparation for implementation and provide implementation support; NDRC i s the lead agency
for climate change issues in China and this i s the first project on climate change adaptation.



                                                10

Local C A D offices and IAIL3 PMOs will be responsible for project implementation at the field
level, under the direction and coordination o f the concerned POCADs and the leadership and
guidance o f SOCAD. Management arrangements for the GEF/SCCF project would be integrated
with IAIL3, and the following organizational and institutional arrangements for management o f
the GEF/SCCF project inconjunctionwith IAIL3 have been agreed and established.
       (a)      Project Leading Groups (PLGs). PLGs for the proposedproject, from the central
       level down to provincial and county government levels, will be the same as for IAIL3,
       but will be strengthened with special experts and scientists concerned with climate
       change and adaptation. The central PLG would be chaired by the MOF vice-minister
       responsible for the project and would include, as needed, members from MOF, NDRC,
       MWR, MOA, SFB, SEPA and other concerned agencies and experts. The provincial
       PLGs would be chaired by the provincial vice-governor responsible for agriculture with
       members from the provincial Finance Bureau, Provincial Planning Commission, WRB,
       AB, FRB, EPA and other agencies and institutes as appropriate. It is important that the
       PPCs as representatives o f NDRC participate in the PLGs and provide support to the
       project; and that the representatives from the All China Women's Federation also
       participate where possible.     The major responsibilities o f the PLGs are to provide
        coordination, policy-level support and policy guidance.      City and county PLGs will
        follow the same model o f the provincial PLG and have similar organizational format,
        composition and responsibilities.

        (b)     Central Project Management Office (CPMO). The national level or Central
        PMO (CPMO) inSOCAD for IAIL3 would be the CPMO for the GEF/SCCF project, but
        with responsibilities added which are specific to the GEF/SCCF project, and would be
        chaired by the Director o f SOCAD. Under the leadership o f the PLG, the CPMO would
        be responsible for handling day-to-day management o f the project at the national level,
        overall project coordination, project financial management, funding mobilization and
        allocations, ensuring overall project progress and quality, overall project supervision,
        monitoring and evaluation and reporting on project implementation and supervision.
        Particularly, the CPMO will be responsible for the project monitoring and evaluation
        system (M&E System), guidelines and procedures, providing oversight and technical and
        policy guidance to lower levels, specifying tasks and responsibilities for overall project
        implementation, making implementation recommendations and providing guidance to
        improve the project and its impact duringimplementation as appropriate.
        (c)     Provincial PMOs (PPMOs).       PPMOs for the IAIL3 project will be responsible
        for implementation o f the GEF/SCCF project in the respective province, similar to the
        national level, with specific responsibilities and unit(s) added as needed. Special units
        for the GEF/SCCF project have been established within the existing PPMOs in Hebei,
        Henan, Shandong, Anhui, Jiangsu and Ningxia with terms o f reference, staffing and other
        resources acceptable to the Bank. PPMOs will be responsible, inter alia, for day-to-day
        implementation management, direction, monitoring and supervision o f implementation,
        ensuring coordination between different departments involved in implementation,
        provision o f adequate and timely flow o f funds to lower levels, coordinating funding
        from the various sources, management and disbursement o f the GEF/SCCF grant funds,
        provision o f specialized technical assistance support to lower levels, operation o f M&E
        systems, various types o f procurement, arranging for project research, information



                                                 11

       dissemination, workshops and other related activities. GEF/SCCF units in the PPMOs
       would include senior-level, expert staff from WRB, AB, and FRB.
       (d)    Local Level Project Management Offices (PMOs).              Similarly, local level
       (municipality and/or county) PMOs at lower levels for IAIL3 will be responsible for
       implementation o f the GEF/SCCF project, but will have specific responsibilities and units
       added as needed. Membership o f PMOs will follow the same pattern as for PPMOs.
       These local-level PMOs will be responsible for routine day-to-day operation and
       implementation o f the project, including local project planning, field implementation,
       field supervision, inspection, field M&E data and statistics collection and preliminary
       analysis, local procurement, reimbursements, local project management activities and
       coordination among local line bureaus involved inthe project. Institutional arrangements
       for management o f the GEF/SCCF project have been established in the concerned
       MunicipaVPrefecture and County C A D Offices (MOCADs and COCADs).               M O C A D
       PMOs would in particular be responsible for overseeing project design, execution and
       supervision in the field, as well as overall local coordination and financing. COCAD
       PMOs would be responsible for project implementation in the field and arranging local
       fundingand labor contributions.
       (e)    Mobile Expert Teams (METs). METS have been established under IAIL3 by
       SOCAD and the POCADs.            For the GEF/SCCF project, these METs would be
       strengthened and expanded with suitable experts to provide guidance on climate change
       andadaptation to staff and farmers inthe field duringimplementation. The METs should
       include experienced leading scientist and experts on climate change, meteorology and
       environment, as well as the experts on water resources, agriculture and forestry for
       IAIL3. The METs would coordinate internally to ensure that the GEF/SCCF climate
       change work i s fully integrated with IAIL3 work and that the messages delivered to the
       field are consistent.   National-level experts, in particular, should be utilized where
       appropriate.  The functions o f the METs would include provision o f expert advisory
       services for implementation o f the project aimed especially at the farmers; provision o f
       technical   consultation   services  to    the PPMOs     and    lower-level PMOs for
       preparationhpdating o f the PIPS and implementation of the project; contribution o f
       suggestions to the PMOs to help facilitate smooth project implementation and
       recommendations to correct problems which arise during implementation; and assistance
       inproject supervision, monitoring, inspection andmid-term and completionreviews.
34.    FinancingArrangements and FinancialManagement. Financing will be provided by
a combination o f GEF/SCCF grant funds and IAIL3 project funding, including both the Bank
loan and counterpart funds. GEF/SCCF funds will be used mainly to develop adaptation
measures for IAIL3 and introduce them into IAIL3 implementation, as well as for promoting,
expanding and/or enhancing the innovative aspects o f IAIL3 related to climate change adaptation
(such as WUA and FA development, precision land leveling, ET management, and groundwater
management) and for activities to promote mainstreaming o f climate change adaptation in the
C A D program. The small amount o f GEF/SCCF funding will therefore help guide a large
amount o f IAIL3 funding into climate change adaptation. Financial management (FM) under the
GEFISCCF project would be based on the IAIL3 FM system and its computerized MIS. A
separate FM system and MIS would be developed to cover the GEF/SCCF project.                The
GEF/SCCF project M I S would produce separate progress and financial monitoring reports for



                                                12

the GEF/SCCF project, and the use o f funds would be reported separately from IAIL3. SOCAD
will be responsible for unified FM o f the GEF/SCCF grant funds. Use o f funds will follow
requirements o f the GEF/SCCF grant, IAIL3 and the C A D program for fimd use and
management. GEF/SCCF grant funds would be used to reimburse qualified expenditures for the
GEF/SCCF project following standard Bank procedures. Disbursements from the grant would
be based on withdrawal applications prepared at the level at which the expenditures were
incurred and submitted to the Bank through SOCAD. As with IAIL3, withdrawal applications
would be prepared through the project MIS, with the same certification requirements including
for W A S and FAs.        Conversion o f the GEF/SCCF grant funds to Chinese Yuan during
disbursements would follow standard Bankprocedures.
35.    Inorder to facilitate project disbursement, it was agreed that as inIAIL3, a "sub-grant"
category will be established for some small value project activities, including establishment o f
WUA andFA, water wells, biogas, green houses and tree planting. These activities are expected
to be conducted by the communities themselves. The sub-grants will be given to the F N W A
and project participant household farmers to finance the cost o f goods, works and services
required for carrying out all such activities. The local COCADs will provide the Sub-grant from
SCCF grant using financial and management procedures already established under IAIL3.
However, in order to ease disbursement monitoring and review process, the output-based
disbursement (OBD) procedure will be used for some o f the project activities to be financed
under these sub-grants (including water wells, biogas and green houses). The requirements
specified in paragraph 15 in Annex 7, regarding OBD, should be followed and the only
exception i s that the unit cost i s not applicable for activities which are not using the OBD.
36.    Accounting system. PMOs at various levels will maintain separateproject accounts set
up for the GEF/SCCF project and will have experienced full-time accountants available to
manage the GEF/SCCF accounts and funds. Accounting standards, principles, internal financial
controls, financial reporting and auditing methods inconformity with IAIL3 project management
would be established. Field PMOs will maintain accounts and records o f expenditure for the
project in the project MIS. These accounts will be submittedto upper levels usingthe M I S and
the CPMO will submit to the Bank an annual settlement o fproject expenditures and funds based
on these accounts andrecords.
37.     Audits. The Audit Services Center (ASC) o f CNAO has been identified as auditors for
the project and annual audit reports will be issued by ASC accordingly. The annual audit reports
and project financial statements will be submitted to the Bank within six months after the end o f
each calendar year.


C. Monitoringandevaluationof outcomes/results
38.     Management Information System (MIS).                  The project MIS will be the basis for
physical and financial progress monitoring and reporting and will be coordinated and integrated
with the IAIL3 MIS. As indicated above, the project MIS would be integrated with the IAIL3
computerized MIS, which would be expanded to cover the GEF/SCCF project. As with IAIL3,
the project MIS will produce progress and financial monitoring tables, procurement monitoring
tables, disbursement monitoring tables and WithdrawaVdisbursement requests, based mainly on
procurement data entered into the system by the county PMO staff,            The MIS data would then



                                                     13

be sent to PMOs at higher levels electronically, consolidated at provincial and central levels and
provided to World Bank inthe semi-annual periodic reports for supervision reviews.
39.     Monitoring and Evaluation System (MES).             The project would establish a MES
System for monitoring project outputs and evaluating and analyzing project outcomes. The
system for the GEF/SCCF project would include key indicators specifically identified for the
GEF/SCCF project (see Annex 3 for details on key indicators for the project). The MES would
be able to produce separate MES reports for M I L 3 and the GEF/SCCF project, and consolidated
reports for the two projects. SOCAD, POCADs and COCADs would be responsible at their
various levels for maintaining the project MES, ensuring its accuracy and quality and
undertaking analysis as needed for evaluation o f project outputs and outcomes; POCADS in
particular would be responsible to monitor and supervise the operation o f the MES and ensure
that MES data entered by lower levels i s high quality and accurate. MES results would be
provided as required inperiodic reports, which would include the agreed key outcome and output
indicators incoordination with financial and physical progress reporting through the MIS. These
reports would be kept up-to-date and provided as needed for project supervision by the Bank
(progress reports are discussed inAnnex 4).
40.     As the GEF/SCCF project is the first o f its kind in China, high quality and timely
monitoring and evaluation o f implementation and outcomes will be important to identify and
resolve problems and to evaluate the outcomes and impacts o f the project. Evaluation will be
especially important because the project i s based partly on "learning by doing" and one o f the
major project objectives i s to mainstream climate change adaptation. The tasks are the collection
and analysis o f data (on project implementation progress and quality and its social and
environmental impacts) inassociation with the project M I S andMES.
41.     Progress Reporting. Progress reporting to the Bank using the MIS and MES would be
provided by SOCAD and POCADs twice a year, by February 15 and August 15. SOCAD and
POCADs would carry out internal semi-annual supervision reviews and reviews by experts; and
submit their supervision reports to the Bank (in English) before Bank supervision reviews.
SOCAD and POCADs would provide input for project management and also Bank supervision
reviews.
42.     Institutional Responsibilities. PMOs at the field (and higher levels as appropriate)
would be responsible for the collection and evaluation o f data collected for monitoring and
evaluation indicators. PMOs would be responsible for entering data in the MIS (mainly for
procurement and certification o f W A Sand FAs) and MES; and producing the required reports.
The PMOs would designate specific units and/or staff to be responsible for these functions. MIS
and MES responsibilities o f the CPMO and PPMOs would include: (a) the formulation o f
uniform monitoring and evaluation standards and the key indicator system, and supervision o f
the implementation and operation o f the project MIS and MES; (b) training, guidance,
supervision and inspection o f lower-level MIS and MES institutions and personnel; (c) carrying
out field inspections, consolidation o f data, studies on important issues and report writing; and
(d) provision o fMIS and MES data andreports to CPMO which will submit reports to the Bank.

D. Sustainability and Replicability
43.       The addition o f the GEF/SCCF project to the ongoing IAIL3, will further enhance IAIL3
sustainability in the face o f climate change. The GEF/SCCF project i s designed to demonstrate
climate change adaptation implementation and integrate adaptation into the ongoing irrigation
improvement, water management and rural development programs. The project will provide an                                   .
interactive and analytical methodology to assess current irrigation practices and cropping
patterns in the light o f expected climate change and will test a comprehensive and integrated
adaptation methodology and approach in demonstration areas. Project methods and lessons will
be replicated in the existing C A D program and also in China's new rural development models.
The project will strengthen the ability o f local communities to control their own resources and
other factors that determine their livelihoods, such as through W A Sand FAs. All o f these
characteristics will promote boththe sustainability andreplicability o fthe project.


E. Criticalrisksand possible controversial aspects
44.       The project faces a moderate overall risk. A project risk assessment has been carried out
to identify the operation-specific risks and mitigation measures o f the project.                                   The most
important risk for the project is the delay inimplementing the activities, which would reduce the
opportunity for climate change adaptation in IAIL3 and consequently reduce its impacts.
Provisions for retroactive funding under the project have been included to minimize the impact
o f delay. As for climate variation and change, activities under the project would reduce the
associated risks. For example, public adaptations via "disaster loss mitigation" may include non-
structural risk management initiatives (such as improved warning and preparedness systems,
risk-averse land-use planning, crop loss insurance, more resilient water storage, irrigation and
supply systems). Hardware or structural risk mitigation measures may include the revision of
irrigation and drainage facility standards and measures to reduce non-beneficial evapo-
transpiration. With the gap analysis and scientific approaches under the project and wide
participation indecision-making processes, risks would further minimized. The following table

                               IV.      APPRAISAL SUMMARY


A. Economicandfinancialanalyses
49.     Securing food production for a growing population while also maintaining the
sustainability o f natural resources, such as land and water, has long been a great challenge for
China. With the likely occurrence o f climate change, addressing such a challenge may become
even more difficult. Climate change i s already reported to affect to some extent the pattern o f
water resource availability, rainfall and temperature in some areas and thus may impact
agricultural production invarious locations o f the country. This i s especially critical for the 3 H
Basin, which is China's breadbasket. To address the likely impacts o f climate change, fanners
will need to modify their production practices in response to changes in water availability,
rainfall pattern andtemperature. The set o f possible modifications that farmers may undertake i s
called adaptation. The ability o f farmers to adapt is based on many factors, including existing
technologies, input and output process, human capital and knowledge, infrastructure and support
services by the government.
50.     The agronomic and economic assessment o f the proposed project was based on
comparison o f simulations using two types o f models: bio-physical crop models for wheat and
maize, two o f the major crops in the 3 H Basin; and a Ricardian model that observes present
climate across regions and statistically quantifies impacts o f climate change on net income per
hectare at the farm level. Although there are certain caveats and limitations with this approach,
the analysis suggests that: (a) without adaptation, the agricultural sector, especially for maize in
the 3 H Basin, will face significant economic losses under the various climate change scenarios
tested; and (b) with adaptation, farmers can compensate for climate change and increase net farm
income, especially under irrigation.
51.     Overall, the comparison o f the bio-physical crop simulations models show that
substantial yield reductions would occur as a result o f climate change without adaptation


                                                 18

(`without project' case), while the Ricardian models indicate that with adaptation net farm
income can generally increase slightly (`with project' case).      Although it is not possible to
compare the outcomes o f the two model systems quantitatively, these results provide a strong
qualitative justification for the proposed project. These results assume that the farmers have the
knowledge, guidance and support needed to facilitate adaptation and this is a major purpose o f
the proposed project. In addition, the Ricardian analysis did not consider water availability,
which i s an implicit assumption that water i s non-limiting. Given that water supplies are very
limited inthe 3H Basin, this provides a justification for the project's strong focus on improving
"real water saving" as a means for climate adaptation.
52. Two key adaptation measures were indicatedby the analysis: (a) changing cropping patterns
    by moving from one set o f crops to another which is more adapted to the climate as it
    changes; and (b) moving from rainfed to irrigated agriculture based "real" water saving (with
    the assumption that sufficient water resources will be available). The analysis suggests that
    the combination o f irrigation and cropping pattern change would be critical adaptation
    measure for the 3 H Basin. The analysis also suggests that further work on analysis o f water
    availability and adaptation to climate change would be needed to help identify further critical
    adaptation measures, guide support and policy for adaptation in the future, monitor and
    respond to climate change and its impact on agriculture, and address adaptation needs as
    climate change progresses.


B. Technical
53. The project technical study completed by the Chinese Academy o f Science (CAS) analyzed
    climate change in the 3H basin, historically and over the coming decades. Two approaches
    were used. The first was to analyze trends in climate over the past decades, and the second
    was to assess the best projections from computer modeling o f future climates. Temperatures
    have increased over the past 50 years, particularly in the 199Os, when temperatures rose by
     1' to 1.5'C over the long-term average. The observed trends are consistent with climate
    modeling, which suggests that temperatures inChina will rise by 1.5' to 3'C by 2030 and by
     4' to 6'C by 2100. Precipitation inthe 3 H region has decreased since the 1950s by 140mm,
     at a rate o f 2.92mdyr. Climate modeling projects changes in precipitation o f +5 percent or
     less by 2050 with 10 to 15 percent increase by the end o f the century. This small increase
     would be counterbalanced by increased evaporation as the result o fhigher temperatures.
 54. Using state-of-the-art water balance models, the project investigated the net impact o f
     increasing temperatures and precipitation by modeling changes in water availability. These
     showed that projected water resource availability, as indicated by estimated run-off, i s likely
     to decrease significantly in the future.  Modeling runs using scenarios consistent with the
     most likely climate projections showed that run-off might fall by 4 to 6 percent and that
     available soil moisture for crops would also decline significantly.
 55. The impact on crops i s a complex outcome o f many factors, but the most important are: (a)
     higher temperatures, allowing a longer and often earlier-starting growing season; and (b)
     higher water use due to higher temperatures and increased growth rate and water-use
     efficiency as a direct response to the higher concentration o f COz in the atmosphere (the
     "COz fertilization effect").    The net impact on crops depends on the complex balance
     between these and other factors, including management actions (e.g., changing planting


                                                 19

    dates, varieties or irrigation methods). The 3-H Basin crop production models show that the
    impacts on crop yield will usually be negative, unless they are counterbalanced by
   management activity. Marginal increases intemperature have very different effects with and
   without the COz enrichment effect; COz enrichment plays a positive role in crop yield, which
    either turns the original negative effect to moderate positive effect or mitigates the negative
    effect.
56. Up to 70 percent o f the irrigation water inthe region comes from ground-water. Changes in
    the recharge rate for ground-water under changing climate conditions are poorly understood
    and were not included in the original CAS study. However, a new effort to improve
    modeling capacity in this area was initiated during preparation. A statistical based model,
    RTFN, was used to evaluate the potential change in the depth o f the water table under
    different climate scenarios. A key assumption o f the model is that water consumption i s the
    same as in the historical records, and irrigation withdrawals were not included inthe model.
    The model showed that variations o f water table depths are generally consistent with the
    variations o f precipitation surplus as temperature increases. This model would need to be
    modified to examine scenarios o f irrigation withdrawals.
57. The CAS study has identified a number o f 3 H region wide preliminary adaptation options
    based on experience in dealing with climate variability and experience elsewhere.
    Essentially, they focus on greater water capture, more efficient water use through crop
    species and variety selection, and improved management practices. Based on these, specific
    adaptation measures are put forward for different sub-regions, as follows:
        (a)     Piedmont plain (short o f surface water for agriculture):              (i)reinforce
        replenishment o f ground water by flood management; (ii)       develop advanced field real
        water-saving irrigation technologies and facilities; (iii)
                                                                 adjust agriculture farming-patterns
        to reduce water consumption; and (iv) explore alternative water resources, such as waste
        water.
        (b)     Alluvial plain sub-region (relatively less rainfall and poor-quality shallow ground
        water): (i)  develop technologies and facilities for collecting rainfall by using natural
        ponds and artificial ponds to promote recharge; and (ii)    reduce proportion o f agriculture
        andincreaseproportion o fforestry, livestock and fisheries.
        (c)     Huang-Huai plain sub-region         (relatively   more precipitation, with less
        groundwater utilization): (i)develop alternative water resources, such as treated waste
        water; (ii) develop technologies and facilities for both drainage and irrigation purposes;
        (iii) irrigationbasedonwells, soastoreinforcecapacitiestodealwithdroughtand
             plan
        flood disasters; and (iv) adjust proportions o f farming areas for wheat-rice, wheat-rape
        seed and other crops.
        (d)     Yellow River irrigation area sub-region (replenish local water resources): (i)
        enhance efficiency o f utilization o f Yellow River and local water; and (ii) same
                                                                                        follow
        strategies as Alluvial Plain andHuang-Hai sub-regions.

C. Fiduciary
58. The GEF/SCCF project followed procedures similar to IAIL3 and will use the IAIL3
    financial management system, which i s operating satisfactorily. Therefore, a full financial
   management assessment o f the project financial management system was not required.
   However, a detailed review o f financial management under IAIL3 covering related financial
   documents, audit reports, discussions with SOCAD and a review o f financial management
   plans for the proposed project have been undertaken. The proposed project will have inplace
    an adequate project financial management system that can provide, with reasonable
    assurance, accurate and timely information on the financial status o f the project inthe agreed
    reporting format as required by the Bank and accurate accounting for the grant funds used.
    Similarly, a full procurement assessment was not required.       Procurement capabilities o f
    SOCAD and the COCADs have been adequate under IAIL3 and are expected to be adequate
    for the proposed project which will use the existing IAIL3procurement system and staff.


D. Social
59. Preparation o f the proposed project has paid close attention to Bank policy, social objectives
    and appropriate means to achieve those objectives.      The social development goal in the
    project context i s to support the empowerment o f local farmers through their involvement in
    design and implementation o f project activities and adaptation measures.            Extensive
    consultations were conducted with farmers on the possible components to ascertain their
    views and priorities. A questionnaire survey o f 5,070 farm households under IAIL3 showed
   that project area farmers looked forward to the on-farm work and improved irrigation
    efficiency and would participate with their labor inputs. A number o f consultations during
    the preparation o f the proposed project also showed that farmers would welcome adaptation
    measures that would eventually help them reduce risks o f climate disasters. To help
    strengthen the farmers' own capability to deal flexibly with climate change, support for
    expansion o f WUAs and FAs as the farmers' own organizations has been included in the
    GEF/SCCF Project (as well as IAIL3)to enable the farmers themselves to participate in and
    (where appropriate) control decision-making on local irrigation management and agricultural
    production. Each o f the IAIL3 provinces under the GEF/SCCF project prepared WUA and
    FA development plans conducive to agricultural adaptation to climate changes as part o f
   project component design. In doing so, care was also taken to ensure the participation o f
    women farmers in W A Sand FAs, particularly as managers o f household land and water
   when males migrate for work.         Moreover, the project also paid particular attention to
    vulnerable groups inthe official poverty counties (about one-third o f the IAIL3project areas)
    to promote inclusive institutions that increase the poor farmers' participation and benefit
    from both IAIL3 and the proposed GEF/SCCF project.
60. Because the GEF/SCCF program will be conducted not only in the regular five MIL3
    provinces but also in Tongxi county in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, an EMDP was
    prepared for the Hui ethnic minority communities in the project area in Ningxia, in



                                                21

     combination with the IAIL3-related WUA pilot program in the same project area. Based on
     consultations with local ethnic minority groups duringthe project information dissemination
     campaign and social assessment process, the EMDP analyzed the local Hui people's needs
     and aspirations related to the project activities and set forth measures to help ensure equal
     opportunities for Hui ethnic groups to participate in project design and implementation.
     Although the GEF/SCCF program in Ningxia covers only 10 villages in one township, 6 o f
     the ten villages have Hui populations which account for 47 percent o f the total project
     beneficiaries there. The EMDP i s intended to ensure that these people participate in the
     GEF/SCCF program voluntarily and benefit equally from it and also help ensure that project
     design inNingxia i s inconformity with the required social safeguards under OP4.10.


E. Environment
61. Partially blended with IAIL3, which is focused on improvement and upgrading o f existing
     farm irrigation facilities with limited new construction and no major civil works, the
     proposed project i s an environmental project. In line with its development objectives, the
     proposed project will introduce new concepts o f risk management, new standards for
     irrigation management and infrastructure, and the use o f natural resilience (land, water, and
     forests) to moderate the impact o f extreme weather conditions and climate change. Overall,
     environmental and social impacts o f project activities are expected to be positive.                                  In
     addition, the proposed project will primarily provide technical assistance, capacity building
     andother software support for climate change adaptation. The project has been classified as
     a Category C project.

62. EnvironmentalAssessment: There are no major adverse environmental impacts expected
     as a result o f this project (as described in Section E above). The project is designed to be
     positive from an environmental point o f view, particularly by protecting vulnerable
     ecosystems from the impact o f climate change.                     Some expected direct positive impacts

   include: (a) reduced uncertainty o f impacts from climate change and formulation o f adequate
    adaptation measures; (b) mitigation of impacts from unsustainable agricultural practices and
    development and implementation o f sustainable alternatives; (c) reduced vulnerability o f
    agro-systems, and planning and management o f irrigation water supplies; and (d) increased
   public awareness buildingon adaptation needs and increased social and institutional capacity
    to manage the ecosystems. An Environmental Assessment will be performed as part o f the
   preparation of adaptation measures.
63. Involuntary Resettlement: The proposed project will not undertake activities that will
    require taking o f land and neither land acquisition nor involuntary relocation is expected
    duringproject implementation. Any potential impacts resulting from the proposed testing of
    adaptation measures at demonstration sites would be dealt in accordance with the
    Resettlement PolicyFramework prepared for the ongoing IAIL3.
64. Indigenous Peoples: The proposed GEF/SCCF project demonstrations sites are all within
    the original IAIL3 project areas, except for Tongxin county inNingxia Province, which has
    been added to the M I L 3 project area as a Participating Province for WUA development and
    in which there are Hui minority communities. For the five recently added Participating
    Provinces/regions under IAIL3, Ethnic Minority Development Plans (EMDPs) have been
    prepared for WUA pilot areas for the three provinces -- Ninxia, Yunnan and Inner Mongol --
    where ethnic minorities reside. Seven ethnic minorities including Hui ethnic groups reside in
    about 61 WUA pilot sites in those three provinces/regions. Because Tongxin county under
    the GEF/SCCF project is located inthe IAIL3 project area inNinxia, those Hui communities
    related to GEF/SCCF program will also be covered by the EMDP prepared for Ninxia. The
    EMDP will help ensure that Hui communities have equitable opportunity to participate in
    and benefit from the GEF/SCCF program, and also ensure they have cultural and location-
    specific compatibility under boththe IAIL3 and GEF/SCCF projects.


G. PolicyExceptionsandReadiness
65. The project is fully consistent with Bank policies and does not require any exceptions.
    Project staff has been mobilized at all levels and trained inBank procurement, disbursement
    procedures and financial management requirements. They are also experienced in IAIL3
    implementationprocedures. The project meets the readiness criteria.

                    Annex 1: CountryandSector or ProgramBackground
    CHINA: MainstreamingClimateChangeAdaptation inIrrigatedAgricultureProject

Key agricultureandwater issues inthe NorthChinaPlain
1.      Overall, China ranks at the bottom 25 percent o f countries inwater availability per capita.
Within China, the North China Plain or Huang-Huai-Hai Basin (3H Basin) has only about one-
third o f the China average and about half the per capita water availability as specified in the
UnitedNations standard for maintaining socio-economic and environmental development. At the
same time, the 3 H Basin is China's prime agricultural area and breadbasket producing some 50
percent o f national grain output and accounting for about 35 percent o fnational industrial output.
The basin also has a population o f 425 million people, which, if it were not in China, would be
the third largest country in the world. Water demand in the region, already high, is growing.
Available water resources generally are fully allocated and often overexploited, and groundwater
levels are falling over wide areas, sometimes by as much as one meter per year. Moreover, in
many locations, increasingwater quality degradation exacerbates water shortage problems.
2.      It has been shown recently that stagnated grain production for a number of consecutive
years in the 3 H Basin area i s linked to climate variability. Frequent natural disasters, such as
droughts, floods, storms and insects in this region, are a major factor contributing to rural
poverty and constraining rural development. The projected climate changes could further
decrease water stream flows and groundwater recharges inthe Basin, while they would increase
irrigation water demand and withdrawals due to higher temperatures and consequent higher crop
evapo-transpiration (ET) and soil evaporation. Given the current global warming trend, China's
irrigation-based agriculture in this basin will be hrther negatively affected by climate change
and remedial measures need to be taken to ameliorate these effects. Action is needed quickly
because it takes time for such remedial measures to have a significant impact.
The importanceof addressingclimatechange issues
3.      As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report (IPCC's Third Assessment
Report, 2001) stated, "Approximately 1.7 billion people, or one third o f the world's population,
presently live in countries that are water-stressed, including China. The projectedclimate change
could further decrease the stream flow and groundwater recharge inmany o f these water-stressed
countries."   Climate change "may        substantially affect irrigation withdrawals. ... Higher
temperatures, hence higher crop evapotranspiration demand, mean that the general tendency
would be towards an increase inirrigation water demands." More recently, estimates o f sea level
rise suggest that coastal regions 1-5 m above sea level are likely to suffer inundation duringhigh
tides and storm events and there is also a danger o f sea water infiltrating and salinizing depleted
groundwater aquifers.
4.      Adaptation to climate change involves making adjustments in the management o f
productive assets and natural resources (in this case, agriculture and water) in response to actual
or expected climatic changes and their effects or impacts. The goal o f adaptation is to reduce the
vulnerability o f communities, regions, or activities to climatic change and variability. Adaptation
i s important in the climate change issue in two ways: (1) regarding assessment o f impacts and
vulnerabilities; and (2) regarding development and evaluation o fresponse options.




                                                 24

5.      Climate change problems are only recently becoming clear and their seriousness
understood. In fact, past and current interventions generally have not addressed climate change
andhow to adapt to it. This is the case for example with the country's National Comprehensive
Agricultural Development (CAD) Program and the Bank-supported Irrigated Agriculture
Intensification I11Project (IAIL3). The latter was approved inOctober 2005. Its total cost is $463
million, including a World Bank loan o f $200 million with the remainder financed by the State,
provincial and local governments and farmers. It supports sustainable development o f modem
irrigated agriculture in 107 counties in five provinces within the 3 H Basin (i.e., Anhui, Henan,
Hebei, Jiangsu and Shandong) through four integrated components: (a) Water-saving Irrigation
and Drainage; (b) Agricultural Modernization and Organization Development; (c) Agro-
ecological Environmental Protection and Management; and (d) Institutional Strengthening and
Project Management Support.


The Importanceof FactoringAdaptationto ClimateChange
6.      Though both the GOC and WB through IAIL3 focused on sustainability, however,
adaptation was little known at the time where the C A D and IAIL3 were prepared. The proposed
GEFISCCF project would be a partially blended project with IAIL3. Based on a preliminary gap
analysis, it i s designed to fill critical climate change adaptation gaps in the design o f IAIL3. In
addition to improving sustainability o f IAIL3 investments, the proposed GEF/SCCF project
would integrate climate change adaptation concepts and measures directly into IAIL3
implementation and subsequently into the national C A D program itself. The broader objective of
this project would be to help strengthen the resilience o f China's agricultural sector by
integrating adaptation to climate change into the design and implementation o f water
management, agricultural andrural development programs.
7.      A quick examination could easily identifymal-adaptationpractices which remain largely
unaddressedunder current Chinese and WB interventions inthe 3 Hbasin:
        (a)      Cropping Patterns and Irripation Modalities. Currently, in North China Plain,
        most o f agriculture productions are from winter wheat, corn, and cotton. Serious
        problems arise from application o f such a cropping pattern and accompanying irrigation
        modalities. The climate in the area i s dominated by monsoon, with rainfall and high
        temperatures occurring simultaneously in the warmest months: July and August. Rainfall
        is rare and river runoff very low during April and May while this i s the season where
        winter wheat needs water most for its growth. Though against natural rainfall, this type o f
        water-consumed crops is still dominant in the 3 H basin and therefore, winter wheat i s
        vulnerable to and often damaged by drought in spring and early summer. Withdrawing
        groundwater to irrigate wheat has increasingly reduced groundwater levels. Over the past
        20 years, government and farmers spent great amounts o f financial and humanresources
        to fight against heavy drought during spring to ensure acceptable yields but wheat
        production is still declining and they continue to lose enormous human resources,
        financial investments, precious water resources, as well as other eco-system related
        services. There is no surprise that in 3 H Basin, the groundwater level was normally 2-5
        meters deep 30 years ago and i s 30-50 meters deep now. It i s not unusual for the
        groundwater level to bebelow 80-100 meters insome places.




                                                   25

       (b)     Unsystematic design and actions to cope with climate change. In order to deal
      with severe water shortage inTianjin Metropolitan, also in3H Basin, water from Yellow
       River is transferred to Tianjin through canals. The problem i s that clear water is
       transferred but huge amounts o f sand from Yellow River water i s left inYangu County o f
       Shandong Province. An area o f 6,700 hectares has become man-made bare sandy land
       from original rich agricultural land and with sandy thickness o f 1-5 meters, and i s
       expanding in a speed o f 100 hectares per year. Without systematic and urgent follow-up,
       besides its severe negative impacts locally, this bare sandy landmay become a long-term
       threat to the provinces o f eastern China given the fact that the strong wind o f winter
       monsoonmay blow the sand over this most important agricultural area o f the country.


Government GeneralPoliciesandProgramson Climate Change
8.     China ratified the UnitedNations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)
and the Kyoto Protocol inJanuary 1993 and August 2002, respectively. Itjoined the Convention
on Biological Diversity (CBD) in January 1993, and the United Nations Convention on Drought
and Desertification (UNCDD) in October 1994. Therefore, China is eligible for Special Climate
Change Fund(SCCF) administered by the Global Environment Facility.
9.     Recently, China also developed a strong policy and strategic framework to support
climate change adaptation. China has set out several national environment and sustainable
development policies, strategies and programs, all o f which now identify adaptation to climate
change as a national priority. The main thrusts o fthese programs can be summarized as follows:
       (a)     Initial National Communication on Climate Change. China's Initial National
       Communication on Climate Change submitted to the Secretariat o f the UN Framework
       Convention on Climate Change in October 2004 aims to enable China to fulfill its
       commitments under the UNFCCC. Chapter three o f this communication, entitled
       "Impacts o f Climate Change and Adaptation" states inparticular that: (i) has been a
                                                                                  there
       continuous drought in the North China Plain since the 1980s, while flooding disasters
       have happened more frequently in southern China; (ii)     these natural disasters have been
       more pronounced during and after the 1990s; (iii)   climate warming would speed up plant
       growth and shorten the crop-growing period, so would affect the accumulation o f dry
       biomass and grain yield; and (iv) China has started to take relevant adaptation measures.
       These include promulgating 13 related laws and regulations, constructing water
       conservation projects, planning water diversion from the South to the North, adjusting the
       agricultural cropping patterns and systems, and cultivating and spreading the new
       drought-resistant varieties.
       (b)     National Strategy for Climate Change. China's National Strategy for Climate
       Change has just been published with the leadership of the National Development and
       Reform Commission (NDRC) and the active participation o f the Ministry o f Finance
       (MOF) and will be issued for implementation soon. The strategy emphasizes the urgent
       need for adaptation and indicates preliminary adaptation measures. The strategy identifies
       agriculture andwater as China's national priorities for climate change adaptation.
       (c)     New Environmental Protection Standards. As part o f its 11th Five-Year
       Development Plan (2006-201 0) (FYP), China adopted new environmental protection



                                                26

        standards, which were approved in February 2006. According to the FYP, the State will
        enact and amend over 1,000 environmental standards. It also will draft and enact specific
        industry discharge standards for different sectors. The FYP provides a favorable policy
        framework to adopt and incorporate climate change adaptation measures inthe national
        development agenda, The FYP strongly encourages and supports sustainable agriculture
        and rural development, water-saving agriculture, modification o f cropping patterns and
        conservation farming.
        (d)     Ongoing National CAD Program and the IAIL3 Project. The National C A D
        program i s China's largest agricultural program. C A D carries out "New Countryside"
        rural development tasks in a unified, comprehensive way. C A D therefore has the
        potential to play a key role in implementing the shift in focus for China's rural
        development over the next five years.
10.     China has the necessary policy frameworks to implement adaptation measures.
Adaptation can also be replicated in China and can even become a driving force for China to
adopt sustainable development models in its rural areas while China's social-economic
development has so far depended, to a large extent, on over-exploitation o f natural resources.
Climate change can be a wake up call and adaptation may provide opportunities for China to
adopt more sustainable development models through their pilot adaptation implementation inthe
3Harea.


Lessons learned and activities of other partners
11.     Although China i s still exploring specific climate change adaptation measures and
methodologies, lessons from experience have shown that there are a wide range o f possible
adaptations with the potential to reduce adverse climatic change impacts. Many o f these
adaptations-especially    in agriculture and water applications-represent      improved resource
management and many have benefits in dealing with current climatic hazards as well as with
future climatic risks. For example, adaptation strategies could include (i) advanced water-
                                                                            using
saving irrigation technologies and management to improve water-use efficiency and protect
against soil erosion; (ii)
                         changing farming cropping patterns and practices including timing farm
operations andmulching to conserve soil water; (iii)  developing and using droughtlflood-tolerant
crop varieties; and (iv) being opportunistic based on climatic trends and find practices which are
favored by global warming and which will also better benefit humans and ecological
environment. From this pro-active adaptation mindset, adaptation measures could embrace a
much broader scope and thus the adaptation could accelerate the process o f transition from
traditional development into sustainable development.
12.     However, it i s important to highlight that current knowledge o f adaptation and adaptive
capacity is generally insufficient for rigorous evaluation o f plannedadaptation options, measures
and policies. Key needs include the processes of adaptation decision-making, conditions that
stimulate or constrain adaptation and the role o f non-climatic factors. In addition, existing
evaluations o f adaptation options have limitations. For example, economic benefits and costs are
important criteria but are not always sufficient to adequately determine the appropriateness o f
adaptation measures. Social andinstitutional criteria are also very important.




                                                 27

The Role of GEF
13.    During the last decade, the GEF support to China covered all its focal areas but
adaptation to climate change. It would bring tangible global benefits and mitigate the economic
andsocial impact o fclimate change ifChina could adopt andimplement the environmentally and
economically sound approach o f climate change adaptation to its rapid development. This i s
particularly important in the context o f improving water resource management and irrigation,
which i s an essential aspect o f climate change adaptation as well as China's hture economic
development.
14.    The proposed GEF/SCCF adaptation project will provide an opportunity for China to
bring new perspectives to and build on results from other existing GEF-supported projects in
China as a number o f them are directly relevant to climate change adaptation, in particular the
ongoing GEF Hai Basin Integrated Water and Environment Management Project. The Hai Basin
Project is supporting an integrated approach to water resources management and pollution
control at the river basin level inthe Hai Basin, which itself i s part o f the much larger 3 H Basin.
Meanwhile, at the field level, the IAIL3 project includes provisions for support o f similar vital
water management and irrigation innovations. The proposed project would aim to help
mainstreamthe Hai Basininnovations inwater resource management, and apply them over much
wider areas inthe context o f a large-scale project (IAIL3).
15.     In light of these factors and as indicated above, the proposed GEF/SCCF project is
designed to be partially blended with IAIL3, which includes components that deal directly with
many o f the topics above, such as water-saving and improved crop patterns. The blendingwill be
done through a gap-filling analysis utilizing the programmatic approach adopted under L4IL3.
This methodwill be followed with the objective o f identifyingpriority climate change issues that
need to be addressed. The proposed project would also coordinate with the ongoing GEF-
supported Hai Basin Integrated Water and Environmental Management Project which was
designed before the role of climate change adaptation was recognized. There is no overlapping
betweenthe two projects.

   CHINA: MainstreamingClimateChangeAdaptation inIrrigatedAgricultureProject


I. IntroductionandSummary
1.      The project development objective is to enhance adaptation to climate change in
agricultural practices and irrigation water management through awareness raising, demonstration
activities in the 3 H Basin, and institutional and policy strengthening.       This would help
mainstream climate change adaptation measures, techniques and activities into the national
Comprehensive Agricultural Development (CAD) Program which i s China's largest national
investment program inirrigated agriculture.
2.      The main project development impact indicators would be: (a) increased climate change
adaptation awareness o f farmers, Water User Association (WUA) and Farmer Organizations
(FO) members, technical staff and officials on the need to enhance understanding o f climate
change and adaptation in agriculture and irrigation (percentage o f people); (b) relevant climate
change adaptation measures implemented in selected demonstration areas (number o f hectares)
and by participatory stakeholders (number o f households) to enhance climate change adaptation
in agricultural practices and irrigation water management; and (c) documents issued by
SOCAD/POCAD/COCADs integrating climate change adaptation and policies, measures and
activities needed to support climate change adaptation in agriculture and irrigation management
(through policy briefs, government reports, implementation and/or adaptation replication plans).
3.      Key components o f IAIL3 are related to and sensitive to climate change. However,
adaptation measures for climate change were not included in IAIL3 project design because the
need for climate change adaptation has been widely recognized only recently. The proposed
project would identify gaps in the IAIL3 project design with regard to needed adaptation
measures and would help integrate adaptation measures into IAIL3 components. The proposed
GEF/SCCF project has been designed to be partially blended with IAIL3 and the $463 million
total cost o f the latter, an estimated $50.5 million would be partially blended with and used as
co-financing for the proposed project activities. This represents the portion o f IAIL3 which
would be directly modified for climate change adaptation purposes under the proposed project,
although it i s plannedthat adaptation should expand to as much o f IAIL3 as possible.
4.      The project objectives would be achieved through the implementation in the six project
provinces (Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Ningxia) o f the following project
components: (1) Identificatioflrioritization o f Adaptation Options; (2) Demonstration and
Implementation o f Adaptation Measures; and (3) Mainstreaming Adaptation into the national
C A D Program and Institutional Strengthening. The mainproject activities are detailed as below.


11. Projectcomponents
5.      Inline with the above objectives, andbased on apreliminarygap analysis ofIAIL3 from
a climate change adaptation perspective, the proposed GEF/SCCF project would include the
following components:


                                                 34

6.      Component 1:Identification and Prioritization of Adaptation Options (US$0.50million
from GEF/SCCF).         Understanding adaptation to climate change i s important for two reasons:
(a) adaptation will reduce the impacts o f climate change and thus understanding the need for
adaptation is important for measuring vulnerability; and (b) it is important to understand what
specifically should be done indifferent places over different time periods to facilitate adaptation.
Preliminary work on this component was started during preparation under the PPG. Under the
project, that work would continue inorder to: (a)finalize conclusions and recommendations from
the PPG work; (b)undertake additional work on impact assessment, gap analysis and selection
and prioritization o f measures to expand adaptation into IAIL3 and C A D investment areas; and
(c)integrate climatological, hydrological and economic models to analyze the comprehensive
impact o f climate change and adaptation measures for agricultural and irrigation at the local
levels and rural water resources management at the river basin level. The study outcomes would
be reviewed and disseminated by the six project provinces and ten counties in accordance with
their specific circumstances. Specific activities include 3 subcomponents:
        (a)     Impact Assessment of Climate Change in 3H Basin and Project Area. The
        activities under this subcomponent include: (i)stocktaking o f previous studies on
        assessment o f vulnerability to climate change and potential adaptation options, including
        local knowledge and practice; (ii)adapting state-of-the art simulation models and
        observations to assess climate change impacts on local hydrology (including surface and
        groundwater) and on agriculture. Inclusion o f cropping patterns and agricultural yields
        will be addressed by coupling the hydrology model(s) to agriculture models; (iii)
        conducting a farm household analysis study in the project area and the 3 H Basin to
        determine climate sensitivity, water demand and adaptation responses. This farm
        household analysis study will compare farm behavior and outcomes across different
        climate zones. The study would examine changes in yields and water use, quantify
        climate sensitivity, estimate the agricultural demand for water and its sensitivity to
        climate and determine potential adaptations by Chinese farmers; and (iv) estimate the
        sensitivity o f 3 H Basin agriculture to climate and water availability. The use o f these
        state-of-the-art modeling techniques to integrate climate, hydrology and agricultural
        economics over key spatial and time scales is an important and essential innovation inthe
        approach beingadopted under the proposed project.
        (b)      Gap analysis and study on adaptation measures. Adaptation measures for
        climate change were not included in the design o f IAIL3, and a gap analysis was
        conducted for IAIL3 during preparation o f the GEF/SCCF project. Preliminary key gaps
        in the design of IAIL3 were identifiedwith regard to knowledge and public awareness
        about adaptation to climate change, design o f irrigation and drainage works, agricultural
        practices, farmer participation and economic cooperative organizations, water and soil
        conservation andbiogas activities. Under the GEF/SCCF project, the gap analysis would
        be expanded to cover more IAIL3 areas and C A D program areas in the six project
        provinces.    This analysis would identify the needed adaptation measures and help
        integrate those measures into IAIL3 and the C A D program.          SOCAD and the six
        POCADs would organize national, provincial and local scientists and experts for the gap
        analysis in order to integrate adaptation into M I L 3 and the C A D program, maximize
        adaptation benefits, and improve the design o f C A D investment programs at the national
        andprovincial levels.

       (c)     Prioritization and Selection of Adaptation Measures and Demonstration Areas.
       Based on preliminary results during preparation, activities under this sub-component
       would include: (i)   identification and selection o f expansion areas for adaptation, giving
       priority to areas with both high vulnerability and high likelihood o f making significant
       impacts; (ii) use o f scientific technical analysis to develop potential adaptation options (in
       terms o f content, implementation, costs and impacts), and to estimate the impacts o f
       various climate change scenarios (on surface and groundwater and on flood and drought
       predictions and risks), in order to identify and select the most cost-effective adaptation
       measures for each project province; and (iii)     consultations with farmers and discussions
       with provincial and county experts to incorporate empirical experiences into adaptation
       measures duringproject implementation.
7.      Component 2: Demonstration and Implementation                   of  Adaptation Measures
(US$48.43 million comprising US$2.25million from GEF/SCCF and US$46.18 million co-
financed from IAIL3). The objectives o f this component are to introduce, demonstrate, and
implement specific climate change adaptation measures in selected demonstration areas; and to
integrate appropriate adaptation measures into the implementation o f the IAIL3 project to help
reduce vulnerability to climate change in the 3 H Basin. The adaptation measures would focus
mainly on agricultural production and practices and on rural water management and would take
into account expected temperature increases and variations in precipitation due to climate
change. Demonstrationmeasures would be implemented inconjunction with the ongoing IAIL3
project and would be expandedto cover as much o f the IAIL3 project area as possible. The two
subcomponents would be as follows:
        (a)    Demonstration of Climate ChangeAdaptation Measures (US$2.25millionfrom
        GEF/SCCF). Based on the gap analysis o f IAIL3 under Component 1, the proposed
        project would identifyspecific climate change adaptation measures and techniques which
        would be demonstrated at selected project sites. These new adaptation measures would
        aim to: (i) explore and develop alternative or additional water resources; (ii)promote
        adaptive farming practices, technologies and institutions (including participatory FAs);
        (iii)
            promote adaptive and water saving irrigation and drainage design, technologies and
        management (including participatory management by farmer WAS); and (iv) pilot
        small-scale biogas facilities. The specific new activities and measures include:
                (i) Rainfallcollectionworksandwaterharvesting(307demonstrationsites).
                Construction o f field rainfall collection and water harvesting works to increase
                storage andretention o f surface runoff andrainfall and mitigate rainfall deficits or
               insufficient irrigation water resources, especially in dry seasons, and to help
                compensate for increasingly unbalanced natural rainfall between seasons expected
                as a result o f climate change;
                (ii) Adaptive agricultural technologies (36 demonstration sites).           Through
               promotion and demonstration o f measures like "dry seeding" technologies,
               precision irrigation, minimum tillage practices, precision land leveling, land
                shaping, accurate nitrogen fertilizer use and other adaptive agricultural
               technologies and practices, the capacity o f farmers inthe project areas to adapt to
                climate change would be improved;




                                                  36

(iii) Adaptive cropvarieties (438,900 kgofseeds). Newcropvarieties with
increased resistance to drought,         water logging resistance and extreme
temperatures would be introduced, such as: Ningxia alfalfa; Tongxin dates and
potatoes; heat resistant rice and wheat from Anhui; stripe disease and heat
resistant rice from Jiangsu; and drought resistant wheat, corn and vegetables from
Henan.
(iv)    Biogas digester demonstrations (2,570 digesters and ancillary facilities)
will be financed through SCCF sub-grants. Technical assistance and pilot small-
scale biogas digesters and facilities will be provided to farmers inthe project area
to produce and use clean-burning biogas. This would utilize higher temperatures,
faster growth o f microorganisms, longer fermentation time and increased biomass
production under climate change to reduce the need for burning wood and coal
and the by-product biogas slurry would be used to increase the organic matter
content o f soil;
(v)     Greenhouse     development      (237,200    m2    o f greenhouse    space).
Greenhouses would enable farmers in the project area to fblly use favorable
factors brought by climate warming to advance crop cultivation and the capacity
o f farmers to overcome unfavorable conditions;
(vi)    Establishing enhanced, high quality W A S and FAs (17 additional
WAs/FAs). W A Sand FAs have proven very effective farmer participatory
organizations under IAIL3. In addition to increasing the number o f W A Sand
FAs, the proposed project would, through the provision o f SCCF sub-grants,
develop, promote and demonstrate enhancements which would improve their use
for climate change adaptation, demonstration and training and would also
strengthen their sustainability inthe face o f climate change;
(vii)   Afforestation (676 hectares). Tree species specially adapted to climate
change would be selected and introduced for field windbreaks. This would help
reduce wind velocity and evaporation, increase moisture in the air, improve the
"micro climate" o f farm fields and help mitigate the impact o f higher
temperatures;
(viii) ET monitoring and management.            Remote sensing data together with
hydrological and meteorological observation data and ground truth observations
would be used to monitor and manage crop ET in the project areas. Based on
calibrated remote sensing ET estimates, the impacts o f climate change and water
saving measures on agricultural production and crop water use would estimated;
these would provide the basis for managing ET for optimal water use and
irrigation inselected project area sites; and

(ix)    Groundwater management. A number o f areas in the northern 3 H Basin
suffer from severe groundwater overdraft, especially in Hebei.       In conjunction
with ET management (above), the project will also assist development of
comprehensive Groundwater Management Plans for all water-short counties
under the project inHebei (19 o fthe 22 IAIL3 project counties inHebei).

       (b)     Integration of Adaptation Measures into IAIL3 Project Implementation
       Activities (US$46.18 million from IAIL3 comprising US$18.47 million IBRD loan and
       US$27.71 million counterpart funding).       The proposed project would focus on IAIL3
       activities that are at risk from climate change. Based on the gap analysis o f IAIL3,
       scientific analysis and modeling under Component 1, and lessons from demonstration
       sites, this sub-component would review and refine the original IAIL3 technical design to
       help "climate proof' IAIL3 project activities. IAIL3 activities related to climate change
       adaptation would be modified and expanded as appropriate, including in particular: (i)
       engineering water-saving measures, including various water-saving irrigation and
       drainage technologies and facilities; (ii)agronomic water-saving measures, including
       land leveling, deep plowing, minimum tillage, balanced fertilizer use, use o f crop
       residues, introduction o f adaptive varieties and high quality seeds, adaptive on-farm
       forestry belts to be financed by SCCF sub-grants,etc.; and (iii) water-saving management
       measures such volumetric water charges and as high quality WUAdFAs also financed
       through sub-grants. IAIL3 activities in the GEF/SCCF project area which would be
       enhanced to strengthen climate change adaptation include:
                       Adaptive irrigation canals and drainage systems (13,001,600 m3);
                       Small field water storage (691 units);

                       Crop residue shredding (18,783.2 hectares);
                       Water Users Associations (strengthening 134 existing and planned WUAs
                       to disseminate adaptation practices andtraining);
                       Introduction o f quality seed for adaptive and resilient varieties (1,554,300
                       kg);
                       Integrated Pest Management demonstration and extension (1,800
                       hectares);
                       Greenhouses (1,000,000 m2);
                       Farmers Associations (strengthening 31 existing and planned FAs to
                       disseminate adaptation practices and training);
                       Adaptive farmland shelter belts (3,958.3 hectares); and
                       Bio-energy for rural areas (1,230 biogas digesters and facilities).

Scope of Project Area, Selection Criteria and Selection of Pilot Demonstration Areas
9.      IAIL3, implemented by SOCAD o f MOF, involves the major grain producing area o f
China, the 3H Basin, which at present has rather weak capacity to adapt to climate change. The
major contents o f IAIL3 involve irrigation and agriculture, which at the field level are prone to
the negative impacts o f climate change. However, IAIL3 is designed for flexible implementation
under its "program approach" and can be modified during implementation to incorporate
adaptive measures and overcome deficiencies inadaptation. Meanwhile, considering that the 3 H
Basin i s ecologically vulnerable region and also subject to the negative impacts o f climate
change, climate change adaptation under the GEF/SCCF project i s badly needed and should be
integrated with IAIL3 and implemented in the 3 H Basin (as a demonstration for the national
C A D program). The project area for the GEF/SCCF project will comprise the M I L 3 provinces
o f Hebei, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, and Henaninthe 3 H Basin and the Autonomous Region o f
Ningxia inthe aridnorthwest.
10.     Demonstration sites under the GEF/SCCF project would be identified mainly within the
3 H Basin. Special demonstration sites under IAIL3 outside the 3 H Basin (e.g, in Ningxia) may
also be selected to illustrate adaptation under other specific climatic conditions for adaptation.
The criteria for site selection are that: (i) climate conditions are identical or similar across
                                             local
the region; (ii)agricultural irrigation and cropping patterns are typical o f the region; (iii)  the
ecological environment i s rather fragile; (iv) local leaders have strong enthusiasm for the project;
and (v) local areas have reasonably complete and accessible hydrological, meteorological and
agricultural data.
11.     In accordance with these selection criteria, the six project provinces (Hebei, Henan,
Jiangsu, Anhui, Shangdong, and Ninxia) have selected 10 countries as demonstration sites in
these provinces. The sites are all included under IAIL3 and represent different types o f climate,
irrigation, and landconditions. The sites are located and briefly described inthe following table:

   CHINA: MainstreamingClimateChangeAdaptationinIrrigatedAgriculture Project

1.      The total cost o f the project i s estimated at US$55.5 million equivalent, including
physical and price contingencies o f about US$2.64 million. The direct foreign exchange cost i s
estimated at about US$0.27 million equivalent. The base cost totals US$52.86 million, o f which
US$0.47 million (about 1percent) i s for identification and prioritization o f adaptation options;
US$45.96 million (about 87 percent) is for demonstration and implementation o f adaptation
measures; US$6.42 million (about 12 percent) is for mainstreaming adaptation into National
C A D program and institutional strengthening.

2.      The project baseline cost is expressed in September 2007 prices and includes local taxes
and duties computed at about US$3.10 million equivalent. The unit costs and estimated annual
quantities are based on typical designs with a uniform physical and technical standard for each
province. Cost estimates for civil works are derived from costs o f works recently completed
under MIL3 and similar recent works in each province. Cost estimated for goods are based on
recent quotations from manufacturers and suppliers or prices o f similar goods that were recently
purchased under MIL3 and similar program. Consultants' services costs are based on the
experience inthe country with recent consulting contracts for similar tasks.

3.      Physical contingencies are about 5 percent for all civil works and goods, 3 percent for all
consultants' services in ongoing MIL3 project. For the GEF/SCCF grant, physical contingencies
are 4 percent for all expenditure categories, including civil works, goods, consultants' services,
studies, training and workshops, sub-grants for WUA establishment and incremental operation
costs. For price contingencies, the Bank's standard local and foreign inflation rates were applied
over the project's implementationperiod. For costs expressed inU S dollars, the expected annual
price increases are estimated at 0.4, 0.8, 0.7 and 0.6 percent for the period 2008-2011. For costs
expressed inYuan, the annual rates are 1.9, 3.0,2.8 and2.5 percent for the period 2008-2011.

                            Annex 6: ImplementationArrangements
   CHINA: MainstreamingClimateChangeAdaptation inIrrigatedAgricultureProject

1.     Institutionalarrangements for project implementation. As the implementing agency
for the GEF/SCCF project, SOCAD will be responsible for management, monitoring and
supervision o fproject implementation, ensuring that agreed requirements and conditions are met,
and liaising with the World Bank on behalf o f the six Project Provinces. As under IAIL3, the
Ministry o f Water Resources (MWR), Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), State Forestry
Administration (SFA), State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) and their local
lower level offices and other agencies as needed will provide technical support for GEF/SCCF
project implementation to ensure that project is implemented smoothly according to agreed
schedule and plans. It is also important that the National Development and Reform Commission
(NDRC) and its lower level offices support the project and provide implementation support, as
NDRC i s the lead agency for climate change issues in China and this i s the first infrastructure
investment project on climate change adaptation. Local offices for Comprehensive Agricultural
Development (CAD) offices and IAIL3 PMOSat various levels will be responsible for project
implementation at the field level, under the direction and coordination o f the concerned
Provincial Offices o f C A D (POCADs), and the leadership and guidance o f SOCAD.
Management arrangements for the GEF/SCCF project would be integrated with IAIL3, and the
following organizational and institutional arrangements for management o f the GEF/SCCF
project inconjunction with IAIL3 have been agreed and established.
2.      ProjectLeadingGroups(PLGs). PLGs for theproposedproject, from the central level
down to provincial and county government levels, will be the same as for IAIL3, but will be
strengthened with special experts and scientists concerned with climate change and adaptation.
The central PLG would be chaired by the MOF Vice-Minister responsible for the project and
would include as needed members from MOF, NDRC, MWR, MOA, SFB, SEPA and other
concerned agencies and experts. The provincial PLGs would be chaired by the provincial Vice-
Governor responsible for agriculture with members from the provincial Finance Bureau,
Provincial Planning Commission, WRB, AB, FRB, EPA and other agencies and institutes as
appropriate. It i s important that the PPCs as representatives o fNDRC participate inthe PLGs and
provide support to the project, and those representatives from the All China Women's Federation
also participate where possible.        The major responsibilities o f the PLGs are to provide
coordination, policy-level support and policy guidance. City and county PLGs will follow the
same model of the provincial PLG and having similar organizational format, composition and
responsibilities.
3.      Central Project Management Office (CPMO). The national level or Central PMO
(CPMO) in SOCAD for IAIL3 would be the CPMO for the GEF/SCCF project, but with
responsibilities added which are specific to the GEF/SCCF project, and would be chaired by the
Director o f SOCAD. Under the leadership o f the PLG, the CPMO would be responsible for
handlingday-to-day management o fthe project at the national level, overall project coordination
between agencies involved, project financial management according to Bank requirements,
annual funding mobilization and allocations, ensuring overall project progress and quality
according to agreed plans, overall project supervision including regular supervisionmissions and
technical support for Bank supervision missions, monitoring and carrying out o f procurement
according to Bank requirements, monitoring and evaluation and the overall operation and



                                                  47

performance o f the M I S and MES, revision o f the project PIP as needed, and reporting regularly
to the Bank on project implementation and supervision.         In particular, the CPMO will be
responsible ensuring that the project monitoring and evaluation system (M&E System) will
provide useful analytical results for guiding future climate change adaptation, providing
guidelines and procedures, providing oversight and technical and policy guidance to lower
levels, specifying tasks and responsibilities for overall project implementation, and making
implementation recommendations and providing guidance to improve the project and its impact
duringimplementationas appropriate.
4.     Provincial PMOS(PPMOs). PPMOs for the IAIL3 project will be responsible for
implementation o f the GEF/SCCF project at the provincial level, similar to the national level,
with specific responsibilities and unit(s) added as needed. Special units for the GEFISCCF
project have been established within the existing PPMOs in Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Anhui,
Jiangsu andNingxia with terms o f reference, staffing and other resources acceptable to the Bank.
PPMOs will be responsible inter alia for day-to-day implementation management, direction,
monitoring and supervision o f implementation, providing periodic progress reports, ensuring
coordination between different departments involved in implementation, provision o f adequate
andtimely flow o ffunds to lower levels, coordinating fundingfrom the various sources, ensuring
financial management and procurement inaccordance with Bank requirements, management and
disbursement of the GEF/SCCF grant funds and ensuring accurate accounting for their use,
provision o f specialized technical assistance support to lower levels, proper operation o f the
MES and analysis o f MES data, operation o f the METs, carrying out various types o f
procurement, and arranging for project research, information dissemination, workshops and other
related activities. GEF/SCCF units in the PPMOs would include senior-level, expert staff from
WRB, AB, andFRB.
5.      Local Level Project Management Offices (PMOs).                    Similarly, local level
(municipality and/or county) PMOs at lower levels for IAIL3 will be responsible for
implementation o f the GEF/SCCF project, but will have specific responsibilities and units added
as needed. Membership o f PMOS will follow the same pattern as for PPMOs. These local-level
PMOs will be responsible for routine day-to-day operation and implementation o f the project,
including local project planning, field implementation, field supervision, inspection, field M&E
data and statistics collection and preliminary analysis, local procurement, reimbursements, local
project management activities, and coordination among local line bureaus involved in the
project. Satisfactory institutional arrangements for management o f the GEF/SCCF project have
been established in the concerned MunicipaWrefecture and County C A D Offices (MOCADs
and COCADs).        MOCAD PMOs would in particular be responsible for overseeing project
design, execution and supervision in the field, as well as overall local coordination and
financing. COCAD PMOs would be responsible for project implementation in the field and
arranging local fundingand labor contributions.
6.      Mobile Expert Teams (METs). METS have been established under IAIL3 by SOCAD
and the POCADs. For the GEF/SCCF project, these METswould be strengthenedand expanded
with suitable experts to provide guidance on climate change and adaptation to staff and farmers
inthe field duringimplementation, and shouldinclude inparticular experienced leading scientist
and experts on climate change, meteorology and environment, as well as the experts on water
resources and agriculture and forestry for IAIL3. The METs would coordinate internally to
ensure that the GEF/SCCF climate change work is fully integrated with IAIL3 work and that the


                                                48

messages delivered to the field are consistent. National-level experts, in particular, should be
utilized where appropriate.      The h c t i o n s o f the METs would include provision o f expert
advisory services for implementation o f the project aimed especially at the farmers; provision o f
technical consultation services to the PPMOs and lower-level PMOs for preparat.ion/updating of
the PIPSand implementation o f the project; contribution o f suggestions to the PMOs to help
facilitate smooth project implementation and recommendations to correct problems which arise
during implementation; and assistance in project supervision, monitoring, inspection and mid-
term and completion reviews.
7.       Farmer Participation. To establish adaptation priorities, needs and constraints,
engagement with farmers and other stakeholders i s essential. Major direct intended beneficiaries
o f the project are farmers and local communities in demonstration areas and technical line
agencies and governments and their staff at different levels. Because one o f the major goals o f
the project i s to change awareness and thinking on climate change and adaptation, it is essential
to ensure a carefully planned and inclusive stakeholder input. Stakeholder dialogue should: (a)
include a wide range o f viewpoints;          and (b) enable the project to respond effectively to
adaptation priorities.
8.       Preparation o f the proposed GEF/SCCF project has paid close attention to public
participation and consultation.      Extensive consultations were conducted with farmers on the
possible components to ascertain their views and priorities on issues affecting agricultural
development and climate change adaptation, as well as their own interests and lives. A
questionnaire survey o f 5,070 farm households under IAIL3 showed that project area farmers
looked forward to having adequate on-farm works and improved irrigation efficiency with great
enthusiasm and wanted to participate with their voluntary labor input.A number o f consultations
during the preparation o f the GEF/SCCF project also showed that farmers would welcome
adaptation measures which would help them reduce risks o f climate disasters. To help strengthen
individual farmers' capability to deal flexibly with climate change, support for expansion o f
Water Users' Associations (WAS)and Farmers' Associations (FAs) as the farmers' own
organizations has been included to enable farmers to participate in and, where appropriate,
control decision-making on local irrigation management and agricultural production. Each o f the
IAIL3 provinces prepared WUA and FA development plans for IAIL3 and those have been
revised to make them conducive to agricultural adaptation to climate changes as part o f the
GEF/SCCF project design. In doing so, care was also taken to ensure full participation o f
women farmers in W A Sand FAs, particularly as managers o f household land and water when
males migrate out for work.          Moreover, the project has also paid particular attention to
vulnerable groups in the official poverty counties that count for about one-third o f the IAIL3
project areas, in order to promote inclusive institutions to increase poor farmers' participation in
andbenefits from bothIAIL3 andthe GEF/SCCF project.
9.       Major stakeholders o fthe project include:

         (a)     National government departments and technical line agencies including MOF,
         NDRC, MWR, and MOA;
         (b)     National andRegional research institutions anduniversities;
         (c)     Local governments;
         (d)     Civil societies including W A S ,FAs and village communities; and
         (e)     Individual farmers.

   CHINA: MainstreamingClimateChangeAdaptation inIrrigatedAgricultureProject


ExecutiveSummary
1.      The Financial Management Specialist (FMS) has conducted an assessment o f the
adequacy o f the project financial management system o f the Mainstreaming Adaptation to
Climate Change into Water Resources Management and Rural Development (MACCWRMRD)
Project. The assessment, based on guidelines issued by the Financial Management Sector Board
on November 3, 2005, has concluded that the project meets minimum Bank financial
management requirements, as stipulated inBP/OP 10.02. Inthe FMS' opinion, the project will
maintain financial management arrangements that are acceptable to the Bank and that, as part o f
the overall arrangements that the borrower has inplace for implementing the operation, provide
reasonable assurance that the proceeds of the trust fund are used for the purposes for which the
trust fund was granted. The FMrisk ratingproposed for this project during the appraisal stage i s
modest.
2.      The project is partially blended with the on-going IBRD lending project and the total
project investment i s USD 55.5 million. However, the GEF/SCCF grant i s USD 5 million and
the remaining USD 50.5 million is the counterpart funds committed under the Bank's on-going
IAIL3 lending project. There is no additional counterpart funds injection for the GEF/SCCF
project. Inorder to avoid any confusion and duplication, the Bank agreed that only GEF/SCCF
financed transactions would be recorded in the project accounting and financial reports. The
IAILI11financed activities would be recorded separately through its accounting and reporting
system. The GEF/SCCF grant will flow from the Bank into project designated accounts (DA) to
be set up at and managed by the State Office for Comprehensive Agricultural Development
(SOCAD) under the MOF.
3.      N o outstanding audits or audit issues exist with any o f the implementing agencies
involved in the proposed project.     However, the task team will continue to be attentive to
financial management matters duringproject supervisions.


Audit Arrangement
4.      The Bank requires that project financial statements be audited in accordance with
standards acceptable to the Bank. Inline with other Bank financed projects in China, the project
will be audited in accordance with International Auditing Standards and the Government
Auditing Standards o f the People's Republic o f China. The Audit Services Center (ASC) o f
CNAO has been identified as auditors for related project components and annual audit reports
will be issuedbythe ASC accordingly.
5.      The annual audit reports o f project financial statements will be due to the Bank within 6
months after the end o f each calendar year. SOCAD i s responsible for submitting Consolidated
Project financial statements on June 30 o f each year o f implementation.

14.      During project implementation, the Bank will closely monitor the efficiency and
effectiveness o f the approval and disbursement procedures. Ifpossible, the Bank will work with
related implementing agencies and PMOSto find ways for more effective streamlinedprocessing
procedures.
15.      Inorder to facilitate project disbursement, it was agreed that a "sub-grant" category will
be established for some small value project activities, including establishment o f WUA and FA,
water wells, biogas, green houses and tree planting.            These activities are supposed to be
conducted by the communities themselves.              Meanwhile, in order to ease disbursement
monitoring and review process, the output-based disbursements (OBD) will be used for some o f
project activities to be financed under the Sub-grant category including water wells, biogas and
green houses.      The following requirements regarding output based disbursement should be
followed and the only exception is that the unit cost i s not applicable for activities which are not
usingthe OBD.

(a)   Selection o fHouseholds: Participating households would be selected through a
participatory approach inaccordance with principles agreed with the Bank. The list o f
project villages i s provided ineachprovincial PIP and would be updated as needed.
(b) Signing o f ImplementationAgreements with Villages: Based on approved annual
work plans, the County PMOs would sign the detailed village implementation
Agreements with individual villages. The Agreements should include: (i)       scope o f
work; (ii) total cost and agreed grant and household contributions; (iii)

regulations; (v) supervision and final acceptance procedures; and (vi) payment
arrangements.
(c)   Implementation: Household(s) would purchase the materials from the local
market and employ certified technicians andor carry out the works by themselves
under the technical guidance from County PMO in accordance with the technical
standards set out in the Implementation Agreement. But due to unavailability o f some
materials, as per request o f households, County PMOs may help purchase those
materials inlarge package andprovide in-kindto households.
(d) Inspection and Pavment: After project activities are completed, the County PMO
will organize an inspection panel to inspect the completed works and issue inspection
certificates to accept the works. Payment would be made based on the agreed amount
o f Bank contribution per package against completed and acceptedcertified physical
works.

(e)   Special Checking, Monitoring and Reporting: Special checkinghpervisionwould
be arranged by the County PMO to verify implementation o f the works and proper use
of fknds on a six-month basis by external consultants hired by County PMOs. The six-
month checking report would be available for review by Bank supervisionmissions. In
addition, each project village should disclose completion information to the local
public, including names o f households, use o fthe funds and the completion date.

Strengths and Weaknesses
18.     Strengths.         SOCAD, provincial PMOs and lower level PMOs have accumulated
extensive experience in Bank project financial management and disbursement procedures and
requirements, including the ongoing MIL3 project. Inaddition, the provincial PMOs, equipped
with experienced and qualified financial staff, will guide and provide oversight on participating
communities' implementation and enhance overall project financial management capacity.

Budgeting
20.     Inaccordance withproject implementationplanandconstructionprogress, provincialand
county PMOs will prepare annual budgets corresponding to the project activities they are
responsible for. These budgets will be reviewed and approved by provinciaVcounty finance
bureaus and/or related line authorities, which provide related counterpart funds. For budget
variances arising during execution, necessary authorization procedures and close monitoring
should be established. Timely and accurate information on variances should be used as the basis
for mid-term adjustments.


Accounting
21.     After discussing with MOF and SOCAD, it was agreed that the accounting regulation
stipulated by MOF for trust funds will be used for this GEF/SCCF grant.                        But given this
regulation i s too simple and may not meet project financial management requirements, SOCAD
will prepare more tailored accounting requirements, which will be achieved by revising the


                                                         55

current regulation and adding some more accounts and statements. All these requirements will
bereflectedinthe financial management manual.
22.     The project financial reporting package, including detail format and content o f project
financial statements, was agreed and will be included in FM manual. The project financial
reporting package set includes the following:
        (a)     Balance Sheet

        (b)     Summary o f Sources andUses o fFundsbyProject Component

        (c)     Statement o f Implementation o f Grant Agreement
        (d)     Designated Account (DA) Statement
        (e)     Notes to Financial Statements
23.     County PMOs will be managing, monitoring and maintaining respective project
accounting records.     Provincial PMOs will prepare consolidated project financial reporting
package for their province and submit to the SOCAD.            The SOCAD will consolidate the
financial reporting and submit it to the Bank for review and comments on a regular basis.
Original supporting documents for project activities will be retainedby implementing agencies at
different level.
24.     Adequate project accounting staff with educational background and work experience
commensurate with the work they are expected to perform is one o f the factors critical to
successful implementation o f project financial management. Based on discussions, observation
and review o f educational background and work experience o f the staff identified for financial
and accounting positions in the implementing agencies, the task team noted that all staff i s
qualified and appropriate to the work they are expected to perform. However, given this i s the
first time for all the entities involved to implement a GEF/SCCF-related project, FM and
disbursement training for all financial staff should be provided before signing o f the grant
agreement.
25.      To strengthen financial management capacity and achieve consistent quality o f
accounting work, the task team has recommended that a project financial management manual
(the FMM) be prepared. The FMMwill be part o f the Project Implementation Plan (PIP). The
FMMwill provide detailed guidelines on financial management, internal controls, accounting
procedures, fund and asset management and withdrawal application procedures. The second
draft o f the FMMhas been submitted to the Bank for review. The FMS reviewed the FMMand
provided comments for their W h e r modification. The FMMwill be finalized and distributed to
all the relevant financial staffbefore implementation starts.


Internal Control and Internal Auditing
26.      The project will use the internal control procedures and policies established for the IAIL3
project, including approval and authorization controls, segregation o f duties, clear staff
functions, and safeguarding o f assets. The funds flow will be arranged and monitored through
FinanceBureau channels and will include their substantive review.
27.      There will be no formal internal audit function to be set up within project. However,
project expenditures will be disbursed based on reimbursement basis and all supporting


                                                  56

documents are subject to detailed review conducted by the Finance Bureaus at different levels.
Duringproject implementation, the FMS will review the Finance Bureaus' project examination
reports anddetermine whether the Bank can rely on their work.


Financial Reporting
28.    The format and content o f the project financial statements represents the standard project
financial reporting package agreed to between the Bank and MOF and have been discussed and
agreed to with all parties concerned.
29.     County PMOs will prepare financial statements on their implemented components, which
will then be usedby the related Provincial PMOs for preparing consolidated provincial project
financial statements. The provincial consolidated financial reporting will then be consolidated
by SOCAD and submitted to the Bank for reviewandcomment on a regular basis.


SupervisionPlan
30.     The supervision strategy for this project is based on its FM risk rating, which will be
evaluated on regular basis by the FMS andinconsultation with relevant Bank Task Team leader.

                             Annex 8: ProcurementArrangements
China: MainstreamingClimateChangeAdaptation inIrrigatedAgricultureProject

A. Introduction
1.      Procurement for the proposedproject would be carried out in accordance with the World
Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004 and
revised inOctober 2006; the "Guidelinesfor Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World
Bank Borrowers" dated May 2004 and revised inOctober 2006; and the provisions stipulated in
the GEF/SCCF Grant Agreement. The various items under different expenditure categories are
described below. For each contract to be financed by the Loan, the different procurement
methods or consultant selection methods, the need for pre-qualification, estimated costs, prior
review requirements and time frame are given in the Procurement Plan. The first procurement
plan will cover initially 18 months period and will be updated at least annually or as required to
reflect the actual project implementationneeds and improvements ininstitutional capacity.


ProcurementofWorks
2.      The works procured under this project would include low value farm irrigation and
drainage construction and improvements such as lining o f canals, structures, pumping stations,
buildings and tube wells. The procurement will be done using the Bank's Standard Bidding
Documents (SBDs) for all ICB and Model BiddingDocuments (MBDs) for N C B agreed with the
Bank.
        (a)     International CompetitiveBidding (ICB). Although not anticipated, any contract
        for works estimated to cost US$10 million equivalent or more would be procured under
        ICB procedures specified inthe Procurement Guidelines.
        (b)     National Competitive Bidding (NCB).     Contracts for works estimated to cost less
        thanUS$10 million equivalent may be awarded under NCB procedures acceptable to the
        Bank.    Works contracts with estimated values o f less than US$2 million may be
        advertised only inprovincial press. To the extent practicable, contracts for works shall be
        grouped inbidpackages estimated to cost US$lOO,OOO equivalent or more each.
        (c)     Small Civil Works Procurement (Shopping).       Contracts for works estimated to
        cost less than US$lOO,OOO equivalent per contract would be awarded through shopping
        procedures as specified in para. 3.5 o f the Procurement Guidelines. These works would
        be suitable for lump-sum and fixed-price contracts awarded on the basis o f quotations
        obtained from at least three qualified domestic contractors in response to a written
        invitation. To promote the transparency and competition,             County Offices o f
        Comprehensive Agricultural Development (COCADs)               shall carry out shopping
        procurement in accordance with the agreed Procedures for Procurement o f Small Civil
        Works developed for this Project.
        (d)     Community Participation      in    Procurement:     Plantation,   construction o f
        greenhouse, small scale bio-gas and other works which are small and widely scattered,




                                                58

       which are not suitable for competitive contracting, would be procured through
       communities participation inaccordance with the following procedures:
                  9. Siminp o f Implementation Agreement: Based on annual work plan issued
                  by POCAD, county PMO through its township government will sign detailed
                  implementation agreement with administrative villages to specify: (i)    scope o f
                  works and quantities; (ii)   total financing and source o f financing including
                  agreed unit cost for each activity; (iii)implementation schedule; (iv) technical
                  standards; (v) supervision and final acceptance procedures; and (vi) payment.
                  10. Implementation: Administrative villages would mobilize local villagers,
                  use local equipment and materials to implement the activities as specified in
                  the signed agreement under technical guidance from county PMOs.
                  11.Pavment and Auditing: Payment would be made on unit cost basis against
                  completed physical works as verified by county PMOs. A special review
                  would be arranged by county PMOs together with POCAD, to verify the use
                  o f the loans on a six-month basis. The review report would be provided to the
                  Bank supervisionmissionwithin one month after completion o freview.


Procurementof Goods
3.  Goods procured under this project would include equipment and seeds. The procurement
    will be done using Bank's Standard Bidding Document (SBD) for all International
    Competitive Bidding (ICB) and Model Bidding Documents (MBDs) for National
    Competitive Bidding(NCB) agreed with the Bank.
       (a)    International Competitive Bidding (ICB).          All contracts for goods costing
       US$500,000 equivalent or more, would be awarded through ICB procedures.

       (b)    National Competitive Bidding (NCB). N C B procedures would be used for
       procurement o f goods costing less than US$ 500,000 equivalent per contract. Contracts
       may be advertised only inprovincial press.
        (c)   Shopping. Other goods in smaller quantities and available o f the shelf, would be
       procured using shopping procedures with contracts under US$ 100,000 equivalent per
       contract.
        (d)   Direct contracting. New species o f seeds and equipment with proprietary nature
       would be procured through direct contracting with prior agreement to the Bank.


EstablishmentofWater Users Associations (WUAs) andFarmersAssociations(FAs)
4.      Sub-grants would be provided to establish W A Sand FAs. Each WUMFA established
which meets agreed project requirements and principles set forth in its WUA/FA Development
Plan and is so certified by the responsible PMO would be eligible for a Sub-grant. The Sub-
grants as agreed WUMFA Development Plan would be used to cover costs for association
establishment including: association registration; office equipment and facilities; office building;
water measurement facilities and equipment; and training activities required for the
establishment and operational start-up o f each association. Considering that the amounts


                                                59

involved are very small and are at scattered locations, no centralized procurement i s required.
For each association, procurement would be conducted by the concerned local project agency
responsible using local shopping practices in accordance with the agreed Project Implementation
Plan.


Selectionof Consultants
5.      Consultants' services would be required under this project. The consultants' services
would include development o f MIS, mobile expert team and groundwater management. Most
services would be provided by individual consultants and some would be provided by consulting
firms. The consulting contracts for firms which are expected to cost more than US$200,000
equivalent per contract will use the Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS) inconformity with
paragraphs 2.1 through 2.31 o f the Consultants Guidelines. Most consulting contracts for firms
are estimated under US$200,000 equivalent per contract under this project. The Selection Based
on Consultants Qualifications (CQ) would be used for these contracts.       Chinese University,
Design and Research Institute as source o f consultants may be included in the shortlist if they
meet the requirements specified in paragraph 1-11o f the Consultants Guidelines. In such case,
CQ would be usedinstead o f QCBS. Shortlists o f consultants for services estimated to cost less
than US$300,000 equivalent per contract may be composed entirely of national consultants in
accordance with the provisions o f paragraph 2.7 o f the Consultants Guidelines. Under the
circumstances described inparagraph 3.10 o f the Consultants Guidelines, the consultants would
be selected and awarded under a sole-source basis, subject to the Bank's prior approval.
Individual consultants would be selected and contracts awarded in accordance with the
provisions o fparagraphs 5.2 through 5.3 o f the Consultants Guidelines. Under the circumstances
described inparagraph 5.4 o f the Consultants Guidelines, individual consultants may be selected
and awarded on a sole-source basis, subject to the Bank's prior approval.


Training and Studies
6.      Training and studies would be required. Detailed programs will be developed by the
SOCAD during project implementation and included in project annual work plans to be
submitted each year by November 30 for the Bank's review and concurrence. Loan hnds for
training and studies will be disbursedbased on the actual expenditures.


B. Assessment of the Agency's Capacityto ImplementProcurement
7.      Procurement activities would be carried out by project provinces through the established
C A D Offices at various levels. SOCAD will play a coordinating role in the project
implementation. Since GEF/SCCF i s supplementary to IAILI11Project, no separateprocurement
assessment was done. The organizational structure, roles, functions and M&E mechanism are
already in place. Implementing units are equipped with experienced procurement staff, The
overall project procurement risk is average.

C. ProcurementPlan
8.     SOCAD has developed a procurement plan for project implementation which indicates
the procurement methods to be used.        The initial 18 months procurement plans has been
reviewed at appraisal and cleared duringGEF/SCCF grant negotiation on February20-25,2008.


D. Frequencyof ProcurementSupervision
9.     Inaddition to standard prior reviews, procurement supervision will be carried out from
the Bank offices. The Project Team has recommended that a supervision mission visit the field
every six months to carry out procurement post reviews during the first two years of project
implementation; ifprocurement i s satisfactory duringthat period, procurement post reviewsmay
be carried out once a year for the remaining three years. The sampling ratio for the ex-post
procurement reviews would be one out o f five contracts.

                            Annex 9: EconomicandFinancialAnalysis
    China: MainstreamingClimateChangeAdaptation inIrrigatedAgriculture Project


Introduction
1.      Securing food production for a large and growing population, while also maintaining the
sustainability o f natural resources such as land and water, has long been a great challenge for
China. With climate change, addressing such a challenge may become even more difficult.
Climate change i s already suspected o f affecting the pattern o f water resource availability,
rainfall and temperature to some extent in some areas; and thus may impact agricultural
production in various locations o f the country. Such impacts would be especially critical in the
case o f the 3 H basin, which i s China's breadbasket. It should be noted that impact o f climate
change on agricultural production may vary substantially by region (some may benefit and some
may lose), depending on the climate that farmers in a specific location face at present and
potential climate changes inthe hture.
2.      Farmers may modify their production practices in response to changes in water
availability, rainfall pattern and temperature. The set o f possible modifications that farmers may
undertake i s called adaptation. The ability of farmers to adapt to climate change i s based on
many factors, including existing technologies, input and output prices, human capital and
knowledge, infrastructure and support services by the government. Inthe event that farmers do
not adapt to negative impacts of climate change, they may face losses because o f possible
reduction in yields and increase in costs o f production. If farmers adapt, they may be better off
compared to the no-adaptation case, although they may still face losses. Inthis case, their losses
would be smaller than inthe no-adaptationcase.
3.      Measuring the economic benefits from adaptation is, however, not a simple task. It faces
difficulties that may arise in identification o f the set o f adaptations farmers may undertake, the
costs and benefits associated with each o f them and the selected subset o f adaptation measures
chosen by the farmers. Because there i s a high degree o f uncertainty associated with a likely
climate facing a given region, the set o f prioritized adaptation measures undertaken by different
groups o f farmers i s also uncertain. Hence, there i s a wide range o fpossible adaptation strategies
and a wide range o f opportunities and benefits to be realized from adaptation to climate change.
Moreover, climate change and adaptation to it i s relatively slow and changes are incremental and
mixedwith other changes such as market signals. This situation makes it difficult to recognize,
observe andmeasure the process o f climate change adaptation.


Methodologyfor ProjectAssessment
4.      A two-model methodology, used to assess the likely benefits from the proposed
GEF/SCCF-financed project, i s described below. The methodology i s applied to the 3H basin
and focuses on the project provinces o f Jiangsu, Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Anhui and Ningxia
andthe 10pilot areas (pilot project sites) inthose provinces. Any methodology for assessmentis
constrained by the assumptions inherent in the models used. In this case, two complementary
model approaches are used: (a) a set o f bio-physical process based crop models prepared by a
team o f scientists from the Chinese Academy o f Sciences (CAS); and (b) a farm-level,



                                                   62

statistically-based economic model to simulate inferred farmer behavior prepared by an
agricultural economics group at CAS. The latter i s referred to as "Ricardian" model.
5.      Overall, the CAS crop models are used to simulate the impact o f expected climate change
on the yields o f major crops inpilot locations (the "without project" or without adaptation case),
while the farm-level economic models are used to estimate the impact o f farmer adaptation to
climate change on farm income (the "with project" or with adaptation case).            Although a
quantitative comparison o f the two models is not feasible, a qualitative comparison could
indicate roughly the value o f adaptation measures taken by farmers in response to climate
change. Crop models, ifproperly calibrated to local conditions, can provide reasonably accurate
estimates o f forecasted changes intemperature and precipitation on the yields o f specified crops
in particular locations.   Crop models can also simulate the impact o f changes to production
practices or technologies, or o f external conditions (such as fertilization effects from ambient
CO2). By themselves, however, unless otherwise specified, such models do not evaluate
adaptation options. Moreover, it must be emphasized that the CAS crop simulation models are
purelybio-physical and do not consider farm economics. And by definition, the crop modeling
methodology i s limited to the crops being modeled and therefore does not a priori capture
situations where farmers may switch crops which i s one important adaptation measure.
Nevertheless, even with such limitations, crop model simulations can provide a base-line case
corresponding to an assumption o f current conditions unchanged except for the climate changes
specified inthe crop simulation models.
6.       To evaluate possible farmer adaptive responses to climate change in various locations,
the Ricardian economic model methodology was used. The Ricardian model assumes that each
farmer wishes to maximize income subject to the exogenous conditions o f their farm.
Specifically, the farmer chooses the crop and inputs for each unit o f land in order to maximize
income per hectare. Ifthe farmer chooses crops that provide the highest net income and for each
crop also chooses each endogenous inputs in order to maximize net income, the resulting net
income will be a (Ricardian) function o fjust the exogenous variables (prices, climate, soils, and
water availability). The Ricardian function i s the locus o f income with respect to each o f these
exogenous variables. Because the Ricardian net income function does not include unprofitable
alternatives, it does not look like the standard response function for any single crop. It is a
"comprehensive" function across many crops and technology choices undertaken by farmers. As
climate changes, farmers move from one set o f crops and or technology to another. Because o f
the wide set o f crops, technologies and production practices included inthe Ricardian function, it
provides an estimate o f the benefits derived from adaptation (although it is limited to the
observed ones in the particular region). It should be noted that the Ricardian function can also
include livestock and thus allow farmers switch between crops and livestock as climate changes.
However, inthis analysis only cropped agriculture will be considered.
7.       An important caveat that applies to both the bio-physical crop models and the Ricardian
economic models i s that the impact o f climate change on availability o f water in the various
sample locations was not analyzed. Water availability, which i s an external variable, can affect
the adaptation decisions which farmers undertake, including water saving technologies to help
farming with less water. Inorder to add water availability considerations, the water system in
the 3H basin should be modeled to assess various future climate scenarios and their impact on
water availability from the basin down to the field. Although the crop models do consider on-
farm water availability by adjusting irrigation schedules according to soil moisture status, they



                                                 63

assume implicitly that additional basinwater resources are available when needed. Similarly, the
Ricardian analysis does not consider variations inthe amount o f water available and used at the
farm level; it implicitly assumes that sufficient water i s available at the specified location to
accommodate the specific adaptation measurers undertaken by farmers. Both o f these models
and their analyses need to be enhanced to include the impact o f changes inwater availability as a
result o f climate change. This was not done at this stage due to lack o f time and resources, but
should be done in the future to help guide future programs, investments and policy related to
climate change. Water availability i s an especially important consideration for agriculture inthe
3H Basin because the basin is already critically water-short over wide areas. Another caveat is
the C02 fertilization effect which i s included inthe crop models analysis cannot be addressed in
the Ricardian model analysis due to the non-spatial distribution o f C02.
8.       Climate change scenarios (assessed in both the crop models and the Ricardian model)
include combination of: (a) increased temperature o f 0, 2, and 5 degrees; and (b) increased and
decreased precipitation o f 0 percent, +15 percent and -15 percent, +30 percent and -30 percent
&year.       Changes invariations by season were not simulated.


Without ProjectCase/Results
9.       A first approximation o fpossible outcomes without adaptation was provided by running
one o f two crop models for crops in each sample location, with both rainfed and irrigated
conditions being simulated. Because the volume o f output for all cropAocation combinations is
high, only the results for two locations are presented to indicate the impact on crop yields. Two
typical counties and eight demonstration locations in other counties were selected. For the
typical counties, the results are simulated by the Vegetation Interface Program (VIP) model. For
the other counties, the results are simulatedbythe Decision Support System for Agro-technology
Transfer (DSSAT) model. The presentation of the DSSAT results in the CAS report could be
provided, with an incremental effort, in terms o f percent reduction from present yield values
using the same scenarios as inthe case o f VIP. But at present, only the VIP results for the Botou
and Huaiyuan counties are usedfor comparisonwith the Ricardianresults.
10.      Tables 1 and 2 below present results for the two counties o f the various climate change
scenarios for two crops (maize and wheat), under two technologies (irrigated and rainfed). The
climate change scenarios are shown as percent changes in mm of rainfall (+ and -), and
temperature increases in degrees C (5 degrees and 2 degrees). Values are percent reduction in
yields compared to the present climate (rounded values) as a result o f those changes. Because
the way the irrigated crops were modeled.' one can view the irrigated simulation as an adaptation
compared with the rainfed simulation.




'The  crop models allow adjusting irrigation schedules according to soil moisture status. When soil moisture is
below a given threshold, then water i s applied during the simulation. This i s a case where water is provided o n
demand, which is typical o f an irrigation system. However, by doing so, the modelers still assume that water i s
available at the source to satisfy the demand.

11.           As can be seen, in all cases for maize, the simulated climate change lead to losses
compared to the present climate in the two sample locations. And under most climate change
scenarios maize yield always shows a more negative response than wheat, for both irrigation and
rainfed technologies. Generally, crop yields are higher from irrigated land than rain-fed land in
3 H plain.2 This i s true not only for the baseline but also for the climatic change situation. The
relative negative change o f crop yields i s usually smaller for irrigated land than that for rainfed,
especially in the range o f a 2 degree C increase, showing that irrigation helps mitigating the
negative impact of increased evapotranspiration (ET) that results from rising temperatures and
changes inprecipitation, on crop yields.


With ProjectCase/Results
12.           As explainedabove, an estimate o fpossible outcomes with adaptation was provided from
the Ricardian economic models in each sample location, for both irrigated and rainfed farms.

2While yield under irrigation is higher than under rainfed technology, these incremental yield changes may not
necessarily be high enough to justify investment in irrigation. Net economic benefits may actually be negative
under irrigation. Additional economic assessment would be needed to verify this point.


                                                       65

 The Ricardian climate estimates were taken from a recent all-China statistical analysis o f
 agricultural sensitivity. To estimate the economic impact o f adaptation at the local county level,
 the present climate for each county was inserted into the Ricardian function inorder to calculate
 the present net revenue per ha. It shouldbenotedthat the net revenue per ha captures a crop mix
 that i s being grown all year round, as well as technologies and management practices that
 farmers already undertake in response to various signals they perceive, including responses to
 present changes inclimate.
 13.     As can be seen from Table 3, the 10 counties vary in their sensitivity to climate.
 Additionally, changes in net revenue per ha resulting from change in climate vary across
 counties. For example, Botou and Gaomi are counties that face already extreme climate and this
 is reflected intheir low net revenue per rainfed land. Therefore, with climate change inthe range
 simulated in this study, these two counties may face less favorable situation compared to other
 counties. Unlike the other counties, Nanyang and Mingguang counties exhibit almost no
 difference between rainfed and irrigated net revenueper ha.

 14.     Climate change scenarios (following the ones that were used in the crop modeling
 simulations) were then incorporated into the Ricardian models to calculate the change in net
 revenue resulting from change inclimate for each county. The change innet revenue per ha are
 presented in Table 4. The results in the table show a large variance in the economic impact o f
 climate change on net revenue for both irrigated and rainfed farms. It is also clear that the
 various counties exhibit different sensitivities, interms o fthe size o f gains or losses.

15.      Except for two sites and a few anomalies inthe results, Table 4 shows that ingeneral net
farm income per hectare increases somewhat with increased temperatures o f 2 and 5 degrees C.
These results indicate that, with adaptation, farmers in the 3H Basin can compensate for
increasing temperature due to climate change and maintain or even increase their net farm
income per hectare. Although results are not completely consistent, Table 4 also indicates that,
interms of percent, change in net returns rainfed farms may in general benefit relatively more
from adaptation under the climate change scenarios tested, compared to irrigated farms.


Conclusions
 16.     Overall, the comparison o f the bio-physical crop simulations models show that reductions
inmaize would occur as a result of climate change without adaptation (`without project's case),
while the Ricardian models indicate that with adaptation net farm income can increase (`with
project's case). Although it i s not possible to compare the outcomes o f the two model systems
directly, these results provide a strong qualitative justification for the proposed project. These
results o f course assume that the farmers have the knowledge, guidance and support needed to
facilitate adaptation and thus, it i s a major purpose o f the proposed project. In addition, the
Ricardian analysis did not consider water availability, which i s an implicit assumption that water
i s non-limiting. Given that water supplies are very limited in the 3H Basin, this provides a
justification for the project's strong focus on improving "real water saving" as a means for
climate adaptation.



                                                 67

17.    More specifically, while it i s difficult to compare percent change in per ha yield o f
individual crops with dollar reduction inper ha net revenue, it is possible to make a number o f
observations and comparisons which serve to justify qualitatively the project.
       (a)      Modeling the production o f two major crops (wheat and maize) that capture 40-
       60% o f the sown area in various counties inthe 3 H basin, suggests that at the crop level,
       climate change scenarios will result in maize yield losses and loss and gain in wheat,
       ranging between 1-46 percent, depending on the scenario and the crop and technology
       (irrigation or rainfed crops). Translating yield losses to economic losses could be done
       using crop budgets data and would enable a closer comparison. But even without such
       data, it is reasonable to conclude conservatively that without adaptation, the agricultural
       sector in the 3 H Basin will face significant economic losses at least in maize under
       various climate change scenarios; and that with adaptation those losses can be mitigated
       or eliminated.
       (b)       Another likely conclusion from the crop model simulations is that use o f irrigation
       (considered to be an adaptation measure) may result in lower losses due to climate,
       compared to rainfed technology for the same crop. Holding all other factors constant, if
       the incremental change inyield under irrigation pays for the irrigation investment (or part
       o f it + the value o fthe water), then irrigation could be an important adaptation measure in
       the 3HBasin.
       (c)       The results o f the Ricardian method suggest that adaptation matters. Adaptation
       is embedded implicitly and explicitly inthe Ricardian function. The methodology is able
       to observe differences between irrigated and rainfed farms and between cropping patterns
       (shares o f various crops used in various farms). Although the Ricardian methodology is
       not able (inthe case o f the 3 H basin) to observe differences stemming from specific farm
       level production methods that have been adapted to climate change, these are implicitly
       included in the observed data. Therefore, if one can obtain monetary values per ha o f
       agricultural production from a crop model (CP) and from the Ricardian model (RM), the
       difference RM-CP (all other factors being equal) may reflect the "value" o f adaptation.
       While the CP impact values are given inpercent yieldha lost and the RM impact values
       are given in $ha, it i s clear that such differences would (after transformation) always be
       positive, at least inthe sample locations inthe tables above.
18.    Several caveats to this qualitative analysis need be addressed.
       (a)       Water availability should be part o f the analysis. This i s important since climate
       change may reduce (or increase) the amount o f water that i s available to farmers and this
       effect i s not captured so far in the Ricardian analysis.       Therefore, the current "with
       adaptation" estimates be upward-biased.         The role o f water-saving technologies as an
       adaptation measure i s likely to be especially significant in the 3 H Basin. Including real
       water-saving technologies in the project assessment would be possible if water
       availability analysis (including both surface water and groundwater) is connected to the
       agricultural production system.
       (b)       All models are constrained bythe assumptions and processes represented inthem.
       Giventhe importance o fthis topic, continued effort and fundingis needed to enhance and
       expand boththe bio-physical crop models and the Ricardian economic models.

1.      The proposed GEF/SCCF project would be partially blended with the ongoing IAIL3
project, which itself is focused on rehabilitation o f existing sites with limited construction and no
major civil works. Inaddition, the proposed GEF/SCCF adaptation project is an environmental
project and aims: (a) to help strengthen the resilience o f agricultural development to climate
change in China through implementation o f selected adaptation measures at demonstration sites;
and (b) to mainstream climate change adaptation into irrigation, water resource management and
thus, in the wider context o f rural development.          It has been designed to have positive
environmental and social impacts effects, avoid negative impacts and improve the sustainability
o f IAIL3.
2.      The proposed adaptation project will use a "gap-filling plus programmatic approach". A
gap analysis will be carried out and a flexible programmatic approach will be adopted with the
objective o f identifying priority issues to address.        Such a gap-filling plus programmatic
approach would help: (i)      focus on adaptation gaps from other partners' interventions (e.g.,
IAIL3);    (ii)provide an adaptation framework for comprehensive and cross-sectoral
interventions; (iii)support institutional capacity building and public awareness; (iv) create a
favorable environment for integrated water management, optimizing opportunities for replicating
good practices, and ensuring sustainability; and (v) avoid practices which are counter to
adaptation.
3.      Based on a preliminary gap analysis o f IAIL3, the proposed project would, in particular:
(a) identify, prioritize and select adaptation options and measures to be tested during project
implementation; (b) demonstrate and implement selected adaptation measures at demonstration
sites; and (c) help mainstreaming climate change adaptation into the national Comprehensive
Agricultural Development (CAD) Program and provide institutional strengthening support to
help replicate adaptation approaches into the wider context o frural development.
4.      The particular strength o fthe proposed project is that it will screen relevant IAIL3 project
activities on the basis o f climate change impacts and then suggest specific adaptation measures
(including changing the mind-of decision makers) in view o f making IAIL3 and Chinese
agriculture and irrigation more resilient and sustainable. The project will raise public awareness
o f adaptation to climate change, strengthen institutional coordination and build capacity to
identify and implement adaptation measures needed.              In selecting appropriate adaptation
measures, the project will rely on scientific knowledge, experiences gained, lessons learned and
"learning by doing" in pilot demonstrations. This approach will be fhther strengthened by full
participation o f stakeholders at different levels. For the IAIL3 Project, the EMP was prepared
for each province. The mitigation measures, monitoring program and other activities described in
the EMP would also be applied to GEF/SCCF-supported activities.
5.      Insummary, the proposed project aims to further strengthen positive environmental and
social impacts through new concepts o f risk management, new standards in irrigation
infrastructure and management, local and farmer participation and use o f natural resilience (land,

project activities are expected to be positive and the project has therefore been classified as a
Category C project.      Based on review o f proposed activities, other environment safeguards

6.      As described above, there are no major adverse environmental impacts expected as a
result o f this project. The project i s designed to be entirely positive from an environmental point
o f view, particularly by protecting vulnerable ecosystems from the impact o f global climate
change. Some expected direct positive impacts include: (i)        reduced uncertainty o f impacts o f
global climate change and formulation o f adequate adaptation measures; (ii)        mitigation o f the
impacts o f unsustainable agricultural practices and development and implementation o f
sustainable alternatives; (iii)reduced vulnerability o f agro-systems and planning and
management o f irrigation water supply; and (iv) increase public awareness based on adaptation
needs and increased social and institutional capacity to manage the ecosystems. Adaptation
measures selected under the project would be assessed in terms o f environmental impact (or an
Environmental Assessment will be performed as part o f the preparation o f the adaptation
measures).

7.      The proposed project will not undertake activities that will require taking off land, and
neither land acquisition nor involuntary relocation i s expected during project implementation.
Any potential impacts resulting from the proposed testing o f adaptation measures at
demonstration sites will be dealt in accordance with the Resettlement Policy Framework
prepared for the ongoing IAIL3.

 impact review carried out by SOCAD. The proposed GEF/SCCF project demonstrations sites are
 all within the original IAIL3 project areas, except for Tongxin county inNingxia which has been
 newly added to the IAIL3 project area as a Participating Province for WUA development and in
 which there are Hui minority communities. For the five recently added Participating
 Provinces/regions under IAIL3, Ethnic Minority Development Plans (EMDPs) have been
 prepared for WUA pilot areas for the three provinces where ethnic minorities reside. Seven
 ethnic minorities including Hui ethnic groups reside in about 61 WUA pilot sites in Ninxia,
 Yunnan and Inner Mongol. Because Tongxin county underthe GEF/SCCF program is located in
 the same project area inNinxia, those Hui communities related to GEF/SCCF program will also
 be coveredby the EMDPprepared for Ninxia. The EMDPwill help ensure that Huicommunities
 have equitable opportunity to participate in and benefit from the GEF/SCCF program and that
 they have cultural and location-specific compatibility within the context o f both the IAIL3 and
 GEF/SCCF projects.
 9.     Inparticular, the Eh4DP for ethnic minorities inNingxiaHuiAutonomous Regioncovers
 all the project areas mainly in three prefecture level cities, namely Yinchuan, Wuzhong and
 Nonghen. Inthese project areas, the ethnic minority group i s only the Huipeople. The proposed
 GEF/SCCF program would be located in a township called Xiamaguan in Tongxin county o f
 Wuzhong city. Ten village communities from the Xiamaguan township would participate in the
 GEFISCCF program, and six o f them have Huipopulation, accounting for about 47% o f the total
 population o f the ten. There are four villages which are almost purely Hui. The table below

fields is readily accepted among local villages, while water cisterns are another priority need
because o f their adaptation to the local arid climate. Inaddition to extensive consultation among
these communities, the EMDP also requires that a participation mechanism be established
specifically for the Hui communities' regular involvement in the project, not only for project
implementation but also for choices and decision-making on project activities. This leads to
establishment o f farmer W A Sand farmer professional association (FAs) under both IAIL3 and
the GEF/SCCF project, in parallel with a participatory identification of project beneficiaries.
Both give assurance that Hui villagers will share voluntarily in the control o f the project
processes. Inaddition, a special dissemination campaign on the GEF/SCCF project concepts and
intensive training for new adaptation technologies and production patterns are also planned and
included under the EMDP. As in IAIL3, a participatory approach i s thus especially ensured
through the EMDPinthe Huiethnic minority area under the GEF/SCCF project.

                              Annex 15: AdditionalCost Analysis
   CHINA: MainstreamingClimateChangeAdaptation inIrrigatedAgricultureProject


I.Overview
1.      The project development objective is to enhance adaptation to climate change in
agriculture and irrigation water management practices through awareness raising, institutional
and capacity strengthening and demonstration activities in the 3 H Basin.         This would help
mainstream climate change adaptation measures, techniques and activities into the national
Comprehensive Agricultural Development (CAD) Program which is China's largest national
investmentprogram inirrigated agriculture.
2.      Key components o f IAIL3 project are related and sensitive to climate change. However,
adaptation measures for climate change were not included in IAIL3 project design because the
need for climate change adaptation has been widely recognized only recently. Therefore, the
proposed project would identify gaps in the IAIL3 project design with regard to needed
adaptation measures and this will help integrate adaptation measures inIAIL3 components. The
proposed project has been designedto be partially blendedwith IAIL3.
3.      The proposedproject has therefore been designed to be partially blendedwith IAIL3. As
such, it will provide additional and gap filling support to existing and planned (baseline)
activities related to sustainable development o f modem irrigated agriculture in Hebei, Henan,
Shandong, Jiangsu and Anhui provinces o f the Huang-Huai-Hai river plain (3H Basin), which i s
China's most important agricultural region. Activities inthe five Project Provinces are part o f the
ongoing IAIL3 Project, while a sixth -NingxiAutonomous Region-has been recently added to
IAIL3 as a "Participating Province" for Water User Association (WUA) development. The
proposed project i s also important to C A D ingeneral for "best practice" demonstration purposes,
as about 85 percent o f CAD'S investments target water saving irrigation, on-farm irrigation
infrastructure and agriculture and water management which is closely related to and affected by
climate change.
4.      China has documented and described various phenomena showing its vulnerability to
climate change in different regions and provinces, especially given its vast geographic area and
widely varying climate conditions. For example, China's initial national communication states:
"There has been a continuous drought in the North China Plain since the 1980s, while flooding
disasters have happened more frequently in southem China; these natural disasters have been
more pronounced during and after the 1990s; global warming would speed up plant growth and
shorten the crop-growing period, so it would affect the accumulation o f dry biomass and grain
yield."
5.      For the purposes of the proposed GEF/SCCF project, vulnerabilities to climate change in
the North China Plain canbe summarized as follows:
        (a)     Water availability, as indicated by projections o f river run-off (according to the
        Assessment Report o f Climate Change in 3 H Basin done by the Chinese Academy o f
        Science) i s likely to decrease significantly in the future. Water scarcity threatens both
        rural income growth and food security. China i s in fact among the bottom 25 percent o f
        countries globally interms o f water availability per capita and inthe 3 H Basin area water



                                                84

       availability per capita i s only about one-third o f the national average and about half the
       standard specified by the UnitedNations as necessary for maintaining socioeconomic and
       environmental development. At the same time, the 3 H Basin i s China's prime agricultural
       area and breadbasket, producing some 50 percent o f national grain output, and about 35
       percent o f national industrial output. Because o f this, water demand in the region i s
       already high and growing rapidly and available water resources generally are fully
       allocated and often overexploited, especially groundwater. Moreover, inmany locations,
       increasing water pollution and water quality degradation is exacerbating water shortage
       problems and the projected climate changes could further decrease water stream flows
       and groundwater recharge inthe Basin.
       (b)     It has been shown recently that grain production has been stagnant for a number
       o f consecutive years in the 3 H Basin area due in part to climate variability. Given the
       current global warming trend, China's irrigation-based agriculture in this basin is likely
       to be further negatively affected by climate change and remedial measures need to be
       taken to ameliorate these effects. Action is needed quickly because it takes time for such
       remedialmeasures to have a significant impact.
       (c)     Climate change may offset IAIL3 and C A D Program benefits and poverty
       reduction efforts. The above issues and their relationship to climate change are only
       recently becoming clear and their seriousness understood.         In fact, past and current
       interventions generally have not considered or addressed climate change and how to
       adapt to it. This is the case, for example, with the country's national C A D Program and
       the Bank-supported IAIL3 referred to above. IAIL3 needs to be strengthened to include
       measures for adaptation to climate change; if not, the expected benefits from IAIL3 (and
       from C A D in general) could be substantially offset by the negative impacts o f climate
       change.


11. BroadDevelopmentGoals andthe Baseline
Development Goals
6.     China has signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol and joined the Convention on Biological Diversity and the
United Nations Convention on Drought and Desertification. Recently, China has developed a
strong policy and strategic framework to support climate change adaptation and has set out
several national environment and sustainable development policies, strategies and programs, all
o f which now identify adaptation to climate change as a national priority. The main thrusts o f
these programs relate primarily to China's Initial National Communication on Climate Change,
National Strategy for Climate Change, New Environmental Protection Standards, National
Comprehensive Agricultural Development Program (CAD) and the World Bank-supported
IAIL3. More recently (June 11, 2007), China has promulgated a National Climate Change
Program which took two years to prepare and which documents the country's efforts to deal with
climate change issues, analyzes future climate change challenges for China and describes
China's policies and positions on international cooperation to deal with climate change. The
program both elaborates on China's own initiatives and vows to continue support for
international cooperation dealing with climate change issues.

BaselineScenario
7.      The overall development objectives o f the baseline project (IAIL3) are to: (a) increase
water and agricultural productivity in low and medium yield farm land areas; (b) raise farmers'
income and strengthen their competitive capacity under post-WTO conditions; and (c)
demonstrate and promote sustainable participatory rural water resources and agro-ecological
environmental management inthe 3 H Basin. The project i s consistent with the Bank's assistance
to China in the rural sector which is focused on reducing current trends o f inequality between
urban and rural areas and on facilitating the shift from subsistence to commercial agriculture and
from quantity to quality o f production. It i s also consistent with the Bank's recent China Water
Resources Assistance Strategy, which confirmed that better water resources management,
through both broad-based and targeted interventions, was central to sustainable growth and
poverty reduction. IAIL3 also supports a range o f related national and domestic policies aimed
at sustainable rural development, in particular, increasing fanners' incomes, reducing poverty,
promoting more efficient, sustainable agricultural production and competitiveness and meeting
WTO and international market requirements.
8.       IAIL3 finances sustainable development o f modem irrigated agriculture in 107 counties
located in 32 prefecturedcities inthe five project provinces in the 3 H Basin (Le., Anhui, Hebei,
Henan, Jiangsu and Shandong) through five components: (a) Comprehensive Water-saving
Irrigation and Drainage (US$3 16.14 million); (b) Agricultural Modernization and Organization
Development (US$65.47          million);  (c)  Agro-ecological    Environmental Protection and
Management (US$24.46 million); (d) Institutional Development and Support (US$33.78
million); and (e) Project Survey, Design and Management (US$23.33 million). The investment
cost o f IAIL3 totals $463 million.
9.       The main project outcomes o f the baseline scenario would be: (a) increased water and
agricultural productivity and resource use efficiency; (b) increased per capita income for farm
households; (c) increased high qualityhalue and non-polluting/green crop production; (d)
adoption o f techniques leading to "real" water savings and mitigation o f adverse environmental
impacts; and (e) establishment o f institutional mechanisms for enhanced farmer involvement and
participation.


Summary of theIAIL3 "Adaptation GapAnalysis"
10.      As stated above the key components IAIL3 are relevant to climate change, butthe overall
project design o f IAIL3 did not consider climate change or identify and integrate measures for
adaptation to climate change. A number o f specific weaknesses in IAIL3 with regard to climate
change have been identifiedandare summarized below:
         (a)     The public's awareness o f issues relating to adaptation to climate change is very
         limited, and so is the understanding and capacity o f staff, officials and decision-makers
         regarding climate change and adaptation.
         (b)     Inthe design ofwater saving works, the concept of collecting and storing natural
         precipitation was not integrated with irrigation and drainage works and there are few, if
         any, works and facilities in the field to collect and store rainfall runoff to use available
         rainfall more effectively;



                                                  86

       (c)     Some agricultural measures for climate change adaptation have not been filly
       considered, such as planting nitrogen fixation crops, adjusting sowing times o f double
       cropped areas, staggered maturity o f crops to reduce peak water demand and the more
       widespread development o f agriculture facilities such as greenhouses;
       (d)     Farmer associations (FAs) and cooperative organizations are weak and have only
       limited ability to popularize new varieties, practices and technologies which are more
       adapted to climate change;

       (e)     Although farmer water user associations (WAS)are included in IAIL3, their
       coverage i s limited and they lack focus, activities or support on adaptive water
       management;
       (f)     Development o f water and soil conservation forestry was not considered (hence
       soil erosion by wind and water are not effectively controlled) and tree species adapted to
       climate change have not been selected; and
       (g)     Insufficient consideration was given to biogas activities under the project,
       although biogas i s an important measure in adapting to climate change, provides a new
       rural energy resource (in place o f coal, for example), develops recycling and supports
       rural and agricultural sustainability.


111.Alternative (GEF/SCCF Project Enhancement o fIAIL3)
11.    The proposed GEF/SCCF climate change adaptation project will support baseline
development goals included in M I L 3 (and the national C A D program). In addition, it will
increase the sustainability o f IAIL3 and more broadly the resilience o f Chinese irrigated
agriculture in the face o f climate change and support global environmental objectives. The
project would, among other things, identify gaps in the M I L 3 project design with regard to
needed adaptation measures and help integrate adaptation measures in the main IAIL3
components. Specifically, the project will focus on those IAIL3 activities that are identified as
being at risk from climate change. Scientific analysis and modeling would be applied in the
design o f these components and provide more climate resilient outcomes (sometimes referred to
as "climate proofing").    The proposed GEF/SCCF project will review and refine the original
IAIL3 technical design for all adaptation-related activities and adjust the IAIL3 Project
Implementation Plan to respond to the effects o f both short term climate variability as well as
long term climate change in each region. As indicated above, the proposed GEF/SCCF project
has been designed to partially blend with IAIL3. Of the $463 million total cost o f IAIL3, an
estimated $50.5 millionwould be used to co-finance the proposedGEF/SCCF project.
12.    Major expected outcomes o f the proposed project include:
       (a)     Identification and Prioritization of Adaptation Options. Adaptation involves
       making adjustments in economic, social or ecological systems in response to actual or
       expected climatic changes and their effects or impacts. The goal o f adaptation is to
       reduce the vulnerability o f individuals, communities, regions, or activities to climatic
       change and its variability and to promote understanding o f climate change and the need
       for climate change adaptation. Understanding adaptation to climate change i s important
       for two reasons: (i)adaptation will reduce the impacts o f climate change and thus
       understanding the need for adaptation i s important for reducing vulnerability; and (ii)


                                               87

       understanding what specifically should be done in different places over different time
       periods will facilitate adaptation. Understanding expected adaptations is also needed for
       impact and vulnerability assessment and estimating the costs or risks o f climate change.
       Inaddition, the analysis of potential impacts and adaptation methods will help develop
       andevaluate different response options to climate changes that will likelyoccur.
       (b)      Demonstration and Implementation of adaptation measures. This component
       aims to: (i)   introduce, demonstrate and implement specific climate change adaptation
       measures in selected demonstration areas; and (ii)integrate appropriate adaptation
       measures into the implementation o f IAIL3 to help reduce vulnerability to climate change
       inthe 3HBasin. The adaptation measureswould focus mainlyon agriculturalproduction
       and practices and on rural water management and use, taking into account expected
       temperature increases due to climate change. Both demonstration and implementation
       measures would be carried out in conjunction with the ongoing IAIL3 project and would
       be expanded to cover as much o f the IAIL3 project area as possible.
       (c)      Mainstreaming Adaptation into national CAD Program and institutional
       strengthening. The component would aim at integrating and mainstreaming climate
       change adaptation into the national C A D program. Key activities would be a series o f
       capacity building, technical assistance, knowledge sharing, public awareness activities
       and preparation o f a "National Climate Change Adaptation Plan" for CAD under the
       leadership o f SOCAD, with the close cooperation o f NDRC and MOF national climate
       change adaptation offices.
13.    As a result o f the above project activities, both farmers and the agricultural system in
Northern China would become more adaptive and resilient to short-term climate variability and
long-term climate change; and adaptation to climate change consideration and measures would
be integrated into the national rural development process through the C A D program.
14.    Overall, the logical framework which has been followed for the general design o f the
project and will continue for sequencing o f project components during implementation i s
summarized inthe diagram below:


                         Analytic work on             New adaptive                   Demonstrations
       Grant                  impacts of         '   actions (e.g., crop

                                                         strategies)

    mainly dealing with water conservation           design




Scope of the Project
15.    The proposed GEF/SCCF project will mainly cover the IAIL3 project area, inparticular
under its Component 2. This includes the five Project Provinces o f IAIL3 (Hebei, Henan,
Jiangsu, Anhui, and Shangdong) and the Ningxia Autonomous Region. The latter was selected
mainly because it represents an arid climate typical o f the provinces o f north-western China. It


                                                88

has in fact been added to IAIL3 as a "Participating Province" for WUA development. Within
these provinces, project activities will be concentrated inthe selected 10 demonstration counties,
including the Cangxia county inHebei, Xionyi and Suyu inJiangsu, Huaiyuan and Mingguang in
Anhui, Gaomi and Yanggu in Shandong, Wancheng and Liangyuan in Henan, and Tongxin
county inNingxia.
16.    As CAD i s a national program, some o f the proposed activities under Component 1 and
more-so under Component 3 are expected to be implemented outside these six provinces. For
example, development o f adaptation policy and plans within CAD, mainstreaming adaptation
into C A D and the proposed replication o f good practice adaptation measures could be used inthe
C A D program inmany other regions and provinces inChina.


Additional Costs under the GEF/SCCF Projectfor adaptation to climate change in IAIL3
17.    Total expenditures associated with the GEF/SCCF Climate Change alternative adaptation
scenario are estimated to be US$55.5 million. These include 2 parts: (a) US$50.5 million co-
funded under the ongoing IAIL3 Project to support those activities o f this project that are
potentially most affected by climate change. These have been identified by SOCAD and the
POCADs and are mostly included in Component 2 below; and (b) US$ 5 million funded by
GEF/SCCF to support the other activities o f the proposedproject.
18.     Component 1:Identification and Prioritization of Adaptation Options (US$0.50million
GEF/SCCF). Specific activities include: (a) Impact assessment o f climate change in the 3H
Basin and project area; (b) Gap analysis and study on adaptation measures; and (c) Prioritization
and selection o f adaptation measures and demonstration areas. These would include: (i)
conducting a gap analysis o f IAIL3 to identify adaptation measures and plan their
implementation; (ii) identification and selection o f adaptation demonstration areas, which would
be in accordance with well defined selection criteria. Priority is given to areas where there is
both high vulnerability and a high likelihood o f making significant impacts in terms o f
strengthening resilience to climate change; and (iii)  use of the computer models and scientific
technical analysis to select and refine adaptation options in content, implementation, cost and
impact for each project demonstration area and province.
19.     Component 2: Demonstration and implementation of adaptation measures (US$48.43
million including GEF/SCCF, US$2.25 million and IAIL3 cofinancing, US$46.18 million).
This component aims to introduce, demonstrate and implement specific climate change
adaptation measures in selected demonstration areas; and to integrate appropriate adaptation
measures into the implementation o f IAIL3 to help reduce vulnerability to climate change in the
3 H Basin. The adaptation measures would focus mainly on agriculturalproduction and practices
and on rural water management and use, taking into account expected temperature increases due
to climate change. Both demonstration and implementation measures would be carried out in
conjunction with the ongoing IAIL3 project and would be expanded to cover as much of the
IAIL3 project area as possible. The two sub-components would be as follows:
       (a)     Demonstration of Climate Change Adaptation Measures (US$2.25 million
        GEF/SCCF). Based on the gap analysis o f IAIL3 and preliminary conclusions of the
       various models described under component 1, the GEF/SCCF project has identified
       demonstration adaptation measures, and in consultation with the concerned stakeholders,



                                                89

        specific adaptation techniques and measures would be introduced and demonstrated in
       the selected sites. This would focus on agricultural production, rural water management
        and efficient water utilization and take into account the expected temperature increases
        due to climate change. The selected specific new adaptation activities (in addition to
       those in IAIL3) would include measures to: (i)       explore and develop alternative water
       resources based on each sub-region 's conditions, including the development of
        catchments (natural and artificial ponds) to enhance rainfall storage capacity and reduce
       water logging threats in the alluvial plain, well irrigation for reinforced resistance to
        drought, and advanced field water-saving irrigation technologies and works; (ii)  promote
        adaptation-oriented farming practices, including adjustment o f agricultural farming
       pattern to reduce water consumption in agricultural production (proportion o f wheat-rice,
        wheat-rape seed and other crop would be suitably adjusted based on climate change
        tendencies) combining drainage with irrigation to avoid the soil deterioration; and (iii)
        adopt water-savings-oriented farming technologies, including development and spread of
        drought resistant varieties, "seeded in water" practices, membrane and biological water
        conservation, etc. to deal with water scarcity, land and eco-system rehabilitation and
        amelioration;   and (iv) supporting the development and expansion o f Farmers
        Associations and Water Users Associations for carrying out water saving management
        and agricultural adaptation measures. The identified innovative adaptation activities
        would be implemented and tested in selected demonstration areas, and then supported,
        expanded and promoted where appropriate inall IAIL3 project areas.
        (b)     Integration of Adaptation Measures into IAIL3 Project Implementation
       Activities (US$46.18 million IAIL3). The proposed project would specifically focus on
        IAIL3 activities that are at risk from climate change perspectives. Based on the gap
        analysis o f IAIL3, scientific andmodeling analysis under Component 1,and lessons from
        demonstration sites, this sub-component would review and refine the original IAIL3
        technical design to help "climate proof' IAIL3 project activities. IAIL3 activities related
        to climate change adaptation would be modified and expanded as appropriate, including
        in particular: (i)engineering water-saving measures, including various water-saving
        irrigation and drainage technologies and facilities; (ii)
                                                                agronomic water-saving measures,
        including land leveling, deep plowing, minimum tillage, balanced fertilizer use, use o f
        crop residues, introduction o f adaptive varieties and highquality seeds, adaptive on-farm
        forestry belts, etc.; and (iii)
                                      water-saving management measures such as volumetric water
        charges and high quality WUAs/FAs. IAIL3 activities in the GEF/SCCF project area
        which would be enhanced to strengthen climate change adaptation, and respond to actual
        or expected short-tern climate variability and long-term change and their effects in each
        specific region. All identified IAIL3 activities related to adaptation measures would be
        supported and expanded where appropriate.
20.     Component 3: Mainstreaming Adaptation into National CAD Program and
Institutional Strengthening (US$6.58 million, GEF/SCCF, US$2.25 million, co-financing,
US$4.32 million). Under this component a series o f research and development, public
awareness, capacity building, technical assistance, knowledge sharing, and M&E activities
would be carried out to increase CAD'Scapacity to address this newly recognizedissue. Based in
part on the demonstration with adaptation, a "National Climate Change Adaptation Plan" for
C A D would be prepared under the leadership o f SOCAD, with the close cooperation o f NDRC
and MOF national climate change adaptation offices.


                                                 90

21.     The GEF/SCCF alternative scenario incorporates both the baseline costs o f the IAIL3
plan indicated above, as well as the costs o f activities required to adjust IAIL3 for mitigating or
preventing expected climate change impacts. Additional costs are calculated as the difference
between baseline costs and the GEF/SCCF alternative, implying that all the proposed project
activities and costs are additional to the baseline scenario. The proposedproject would therefore
cover two types o f additional costs: (1) gap filling costs, including the additional costs for
Component 1 (identification and prioritization o f adaptation options), Component 2 (a) (new
adaptation measures); and Component 3 (mainstreaming adaptation in the national C A D
program and institutional strengthening); and (2) costs to refine and enhance IAIL3 activities,
which mainly relate to Component 2(b).       The following detailed GEF/SCCF costs which are
additional to IAIL3 are estimated for each component at:

        (a)    GEF/SCCF US$495,600 for Component 1: Identification and Prioritization o f
        Adaptation Options;

        (b)    GEF/SCCF US$2,246,000 for Component 2: Demonstration and Implementation
        o f Adaptation Measures, with specific measures to include:
               (i) Demonstrationof ClimateChangeAdaptationMeasures (US$2,246,000,
               GEF/SCCF)

                       e. Development o f greenhouses (237,200 m2 o f greenhouse space);
                       f. Establishing additional Water User Associations (WAS)and Farmer

                       (above),  the project would assist development o f comprehensive
                       Groundwater Management Plans for 19 water-short counties inHebei.

               (ii)    Integration of Adaptation Measures into IAIL3 Project Implementation

Summary
22.    The difference between the cost o f the baseline scenario (US$50.5 million) and the cost
o f the GEF/SCCF alternative (US$55.5 million) i s US$5.0 million.           This represents the
incremental cost o f introducing climate change adaptation andmitigation into IAIL3 andinto the
C A D Program. For details see the table below:

Additional Costs and Domestic/Global benefits
23.     The additional financing o f US$5 million from the GEF-managed SCCF for the China
Mainstreaming Climate Change Adaptation in Irrigated Agriculture Project will serve as a
catalyst to integrate climate change adaptation into China's national sustainable development and
poverty reduction strategy. This project is expected to have three main outcomes: (a) increased
awareness by farmers, government staff and officials and policy makers; (b) climate change
adaptation measures implemented in selected demonstration areas; and (c) policy and
implementation plans issued by SOCAD/POCAD/COCADs on climate change adaptation
policies, measures and activities. Awareness and adaptation measures under the project would
improve agricultural productivity and water resource management (compared to a "non-
adaptation" scenario) in cases where agriculture and water i s adversely impacted by climatic
change patterns.     The additional resources from GEF/SCCF would be used, inter alia, to
finance: (a) capacity building at the national level in view diversifying agricultural practices to
deal with adaptation; (b) utilization o f water saving and environmental friendly technologies,
techniques and management; (c) demonstration o f adaptation measures for rural development
based on China's special circumstances; (d) identification and filling o f adaptation gaps in the
ongoing Bank-supported IAIL3 project and the national C A D Program; (e) mainstreaming
adaptation to climate change into CAD; and (f) replicating and scaling- up adaptation measures
which prove successhl. All these activities have great potential for integration into China's
national strategy for sustainable development and poverty reduction.
24.     The GEF/SCCF financing will also generate additional domestic development benefits.
For example, the proposed project i s expected to hrther strengthen environmental and social
impacts by bringing in a new concept o f risk management, new standards in irrigation
infrastructure and management, and a wiser use o f natural resources (land, water, forests) to
moderate extreme weather conditions. The project activities would also contribute to poverty
reduction by making poor farmers less vulnerable to climate changes by teaching new
technologies and techniques to better use and manage land, water and other natural resources.
Improved water works and water management would enable them to use scarce water more
efficiently and help them to deal more effectively with both droughts and floods; and drought
and water-stress resistant crops would be better able to withstand both short-term droughts and
changes inclimate patterns.

25.     Besides the above-mentioned national, social, economic and environmental benefits, a
few direct global benefits would be generated from this project, for example, reduced emission
o f greenhouse gasses from substitution o f biogas for certain other fuels; increased greenhouse
gas sinks because o f afforestation; and reduced deforestation and cutting o f trees for firewood by
providing biogas. The project would also contribute to the expansion o f experiences with
adaptation to improve global understanding o f the challenges brought on by climate change. The
project would demonstrate how a comprehensive approach to deal with climate change
adaptation and change in thinking can strengthen the resilience o f farmers and agriculture in
dealing with climate change and it would serve as an opportunity to reconsider and change
current unsustainable development patterns infavor o f longterm sustainability.

OverallAssessment
1.       The adaptation imperative. As global progress in the reduction o f greenhouse gas
emissions continues at a slow pace it is becoming increasingly clear that all countries face a
considerable challenge in finding and implementing ways o f coping or adapting to the inevitable
changes in climate, including the risks o f climate variability and extremes. The need for
adaptation is greatest in those countries where development i s already stressed by climatic
variables. The area o f north China (3H Basin area) covered by this project certainly qualifies as
one o f the world regions where development is at risk especially inthe field o f rural agricultural
development and the availability o f water resources. This project i s therefore timely, opportune
and well conceived.
2.       A pilot, experimental approach. While there is considerable experience in the
management o f water resources and agricultural development under "normal"                 climatic
conditions in China, including farmers, the agriculture and food industries, and governments at
all levels, many are only now becoming aware o f the serious new threats being generated by
climate change. While the fact o f climate change i s now accepted there remains considerable
uncertainty about the exact nature and rate o f the changes in temperature and rainfall in specific
regions. There can therefore be no clear blueprint for action. It is necessary to "learn by doing"
in an experimental pilot project approach. The north China adaptation project falls into this
mould. It i s carefblly planned and at the same time designed to be flexible and responsive to
inputs from the farming community and to new information about the nature o f the climate risks
as this is generated duringthe course o f the project. China as well as other countries with similar
challenges stands to learn and gain a lot from this project.
3.       Mainstreaming adaptation into development. Although climate change is a new threat to
water resource management and rural development it makes no sense to develop new purpose-
built or problem-specific responses and institutional capacity. Such so called "stand-alone'
adaptation projects can be expected to have little value, and could be quite counter-productive. It
i s entirely appropriate therefore that this project is an "add-on" to existing World Bank projects
in the region including especially the IAIL3. These projects did not specifically take climate
change into consideration. Nevertheless they do involve the sorts o f actions that are needed to
cope with the added risks o f climate change. This means that if climate change should by some



                                                  97

good fortune happen at a slower pace that anticipated there would still be considerable potential
benefit from the adaptation measures that it i s anticipatedwill be put inplace. This project i s also
therefore a good example o f "no regrets" adaptation.
4.      The future incorporation or mainstreaming o f adaptation. While adaptation to climate
change has not been specifically incorporated into existing World Bank projects innorth China,
it is encouraging to note that the designers o f this adaptation project have planned to extend the
lessons learned more broadly into China's national agricultural development, (Comprehensive
Agricultural Development). Inthis way this project promises to be a good model that can lead to
the much wider adoption o f the mainstreaming o f climate change risks into development
activities inChina and elsewhere.
5.      The dynamics and sustainability o f adaptation. A fundamental and recurrent problem in
development assistance o f all kinds i s the matter o f the continuity and sustainability o f the
changes initiated. This i s likely to be especially acute indealing with climate change, because the
nature o f the climate problem i s essentially dynamic, fluid and indeterminate. It is not a matter o f
shifting from adaptation to present climate to adaptation to a future climate as in moving from
one equilibriumstate to another. Climate i s changing, will change, and will go on changing. The
task i s not so much therefore to promote the adoption o f a set o f specific selected adaptation
measures although this certainly forms an important part o f the project. The task includes the
creation o f an adaptable farming and water management community and capacity. There i s
probably enough o f this kind o f flexible learning and adaptability build into the project. It i s
important to recognize however that an important legacy o f the project should be the generation
and strengthening o f a sense o f adaptability and adaptive capacity. Such benefits are not readily
measured inmonetary terms.
6.      A positive assessment. The perspective o f this reviewer is that this is an excellent, first
rate, timely and much needed project. The vision and enthusiasm o f the project developers and
proponents comes through all the technical text. It i s easy to be captured by the enthusiasm. It
may be appropriate therefore to express a cautious note. The project i s very ambitious and
promises a lot. Some o f the claims made seem a little optimistic. These are not small plans, and
even if they are not fully achieved in all respects there is every indication that this will be an
extremely valuable project.


Some Specific Comments
7.       Baselines. It i s important for project evaluation and for the future application o f this type
o f work elsewhere to know and understand enough about the starting conditions. One way to
express this i s to ask, "How well adapted to current climate i s agriculture and water management
now?" The project documents provide some evidence that crops yields are already suffering as a
result o f climate stress and water deficiency.
 8.      The mix o f rainfall and irrigation. The relative role o f rainfall versus irrigation clearly
varies from on part of the project region to another. In developing adaptation measures it i s
important to tailor or design such measures to present and future changes inthe balance between
rainfall and irrigation water.
9.       Specific measures versus adaptation and development strategy. There i s a dominant
 flavour in the project documents that seems to lean towards the selection and promotion o f


                                                   98

specific adaptation measures. While this i s valid it should also be recognized that vulnerability to
climate change can be increased or decreased by the overall choice o f development path or
strategy. How will this be taken into account? For example the focus o f the project i s on rural
development and agriculture, but there are also likely to be competing demands for water from
other uses. The documents refer at one point to the potential for "reallocation" o f water
resources. It might be advisable as the project develops therefore to keep inmindwhat i s known
(and not known) about the expected development trajectory o f the region. This involves not only
the strategy for agricultural development, choice o f crops, anticipated markets and the like, but
also the phenomena o f urban growth, rural-urban migration and so forth.
10.     Constraints and opportunities. The project includes stakeholder involvement, interviews
and surveys o f the farming community, farmer's perception o f climate risks, and the choice o f
adaptation measures. These are important ingredientso f the project. It should also be recognized
that there are many other factors that enter into farm-level decisions about choice o f crops and
cultivars, modes o f cultivation, and other agricultural practices, including such things mentioned
inthe project documents as tree planning and conservation, biodiversity, off-farm employment,
size o f farm and farm boundaries, and scores of other variables. All o f these can interact with
climate variables and affect farmer's choices. The importance o f this i s that adaptation measures
for climate change that may seem to make sense and should be widely adopted face obstacles
and barriers that are not immediately apparent, or may be deliberately disguised or concealed.
Farmers and farming communities make choices inrelation to a wide range o f considerations and
variables and climate and especially climate change i s not necessarily perceived as being
important among them.
11.      Opportunities. It i s good that the project documents also mention the idea o f pro-active
adaptation in terms o f new opportunities. It i s a common pattern in the adaptation literature to
talk about worst case scenarios and emphasize the negative aspects o f climate change
exclusively. It i s surprising however how often challenges can lead to new opportunities and this
project does recognizethat.
12.     Partially blended? The projects make reference to the fact that the proposed adaptation
project will be "partially blended" with the ongoing Intensified Irrigated Agriculture Project
(IAIL3). The integration o f adaptation to climate change into ongoing development makes good
sense and i s essential in this case. Why then only "partially blended"? There may be good
reasons for this but they are not explicit or apparent inthe project documents.


Summary
13.      From the project documents this has all the hallmarks o f an acceptable project. It i s
technically sound; the project team is competent, capable and balanced, and the necessary
safeguard polices have been applied. The project has good country level buy-in. It promises to
fillsome importantgaps indevelopment inatimely andeffective fashion andits demonstration
value should be considerable both within China and more widely in the international
development community.

Responses to STAP reviewer comments
14.      The project task team would like to express their gratitude to the STAP reviewer for the
encouraging and supportive comments on this proposed GEF/SCCFadaptation project. The team
also appreciates the highly insightful and professional views o f the STAP reviewer. The team
reviewed the STAP review's comments carefully and incorporated the points as appropriate to
further strengthen the project documents, including the GEF/SCCF Executive Summary. In
particular, the team would like to underline the following points:

  2. A pilot, experimental approach is needed. There i s     This is a very important point, especially inChina,
  considerable uncertainty about the exact nature and        where implementation o f "plans" i s a standard
  rate o f the changes intemperature and rainfall in         procedure. The GEF/SCCF project will break this
  specific regions and there can therefore be no clear,      pattern as it requires "learning by doing" and
  fixed blueprint for action. It is necessary to "learn by   adjusting project implementation accordingly while
