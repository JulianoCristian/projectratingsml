Irrigated Agriculture Project\n            for China were as follows: overall outcome was highly\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible, and both the Bank and the borrower performance\n            were highly satisfactory. Some important project lessons\n            learned were: (a) the project has demonstrated that it is\n            possible to provide a climate adaptation focus to most water\n            and agriculture-related investments. Even with on-going\n            agriculture and irrigation projects, retrofitting an already\n            existing program to include integrated measures with a\n            climate adaptation focus is not difficult. (b) The usual\n            approach to intensification of irrigated agriculture is\n            investment in infrastructure, in many cases, completely new.\n            The project has demonstrated that identifying ways to\n            improve efficiency of the water resource already available,\n            obtaining real water savings, and improving water\n            productivity should be the approach. This can be achieved\n            with minimal investment, with huge gains to be realized. (c)\n            It is eminently desirable to ensure that there are\n            activities focused on knowledge generation, analyses,\n            capacity building, and creation of an intellectual\n            underpinning for an innovative operation which incorporates\n            climate adaptation. (d) It is critical to get all of the\n            stakeholders to buy into the program. Dissemination of\n            information to civil society and to government officials and\n            political leaders to obtain their support to implement such\n            initiatives was a key success factor. (e) Strengthened\n            cooperation with research institutions and scientists and\n            experts, and timely transformation of the latest research on\n            climate change adaptation into practical action provided\n            strong scientific and technical support for project design\n            and implementation, and guided adaptation practices on the ground."}, "docdt": "2012-12-12T00:00:00Z"}
