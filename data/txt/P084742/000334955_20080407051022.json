This will help mainstream\n            climate change adaptation measures, techniques, and\n            activities into the national Comprehensive Agricultural\n            Development (CAD) Program which is China's largest\n            national investment program in irrigated agriculture. There\n            are three components to the project. The first component is\n            the identification and prioritization of adaptation options.\n            The second component is the demonstration and implementation\n            of adaptation measures. The purpose of this component is to\n            introduce, demonstrate and implement the specific adaptation\n            measures in selected demonstration areas, and adjust and\n            integrate appropriate adaptation measures into the\n            implementation of the Third Irrigated Agriculture\n            Intensification Project (IAIL3), in order to reduce\n            vulnerability to climate change in the 3H Basin. Finally,\n            the third component is the mainstreaming adaptation into\n            national CAD program and institutional strengthening. The\n            component will aim at integrating and mainstreaming climate\n            change adaptation into the national CAD program, including a\n            series of capacity building, technical assistance, knowledge\n            sharing, public awareness activities, and preparation of a\n            national climate change adaptation plan for CAD by State\n            Office of Comprehensive Agricultural Development (SOCAD),\n            with the close cooperation of Chinese Academy of Sciences\n            (CAS), the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC)\n            and Ministry of Finance (MOF) national climate change\n            adaptation offices."}, "docdt": "2008-03-18T00:00:00Z"}
