                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The overall development objectives of the project are to increase water and agricultural productivity in low and medium yield farm land areas; raise farmers'
                         income and strengthen their competitive capacity under post-WTO conditions; and demonstrate and promote sustainable participatory rural water resources
                         management and agro-ecological environmental management in the 3-H Basin.

                          Although it's objectives are similar to those of IAIL2, IAIL3 would focus more on raising productivity of land and water, rather than only production; and on
                         enhancing the farmer income and the farmers' share of higher market values, rather than raising income solely through higher production. And IAIL3 would add
                         important innovations to modernize agriculture and enhance farmer competitive capacity. The competitive challenges resulting from China's entry into the WTO
                         are driving these changes.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         By Dec. 30, 2010, the project implementation for IAIL3 was fully completed, all project objectives were met and all expected outcome and output target were achieved, even many
                         were exceeded the Appraisal and the MTR targets.

                         For the GEF Mainstreaming CC Adaptation in Irrigated Agriculture Project (GEF CC Project), the overall implementation progress of the project components is proceeding very well
                         with a total disbursement rate (with both IAIL 3 and GEF funds) of over 95%. As of Feb 28, 2011, the implementation progress of the three project components is as follows:
                         -         Component A. Identification and prioritization of adaptation measures: 89% complete.
                         -         Component B. Implementation and demonstration of adaptation measures: 74% complete; and
                         - Component C. Mainstreaming of climate change adaptation in CAD and institutional support : 29% complete
                         The implementation progress of the key activities under component C, such as a large CAS study mentioned above and improving the demonstrative capacity of project activities to a
                         wider impact area, is expected to speed up with more efforts from CAS team and SOCAD/POCADs.
