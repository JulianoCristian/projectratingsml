                         Implementation Status Overview
                          Most of project activities are under implementation, with some activities progressing at a faster rate than others. All of IAIL III funds (counterpart funds) have been fully disbursed
                         since the IAIL III project closed in December 2010. The overall implementation progress to date is 66% with an aggregate disbursement rate of 62%. The project is scheduled to close
                         on June 30, 2012.

                         The project has been restructured following a request received from SOCAD, through the Ministry of Finance. The purpose of the restructuring is to reallocate the grant proceeds
                         among disbursement categories in order to (a) adjust for the appreciation of the Chinese currency over the US dollar since the time of project effectiveness (from RMB7.5/USD in
                         2008, to RMB 6.5/USD in 2011), and (b) shift resources away from slow progressing activities towards faster moving activities.

                         The emphasis over the remaining project period is to (a) complete the implementation of project activities; (b) update procurement plans regularly, and simplify internal financial
                         management procedures to avoid lags between physical and financial progress; (c) continue to monitor the outcomes and impacts particularly for the new adaptation measures that
                         are being demonstrated; (d) disseminate the findings in order to share the lessons, expand the outreach, and inform the overall efforts of agricultural adaptation to climate change in
                         China.
