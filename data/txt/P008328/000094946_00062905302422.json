The physical targets of\n            reconstruction were met - in many cases, exceeded\n            expectations - within the original cost estimates, except\n            for increases in amounts expended under specific components,\n            which were either due to reallocations from other\n            components, or to changes in composition of investment. The\n            key lessons suggest that complexity in emergency operations\n            may not need to be entirely avoided, as long as the Bank is\n            prepared to support the Borrower through proactive, and\n            staff-intensive involvement during project preparation, and\n            subsequently during implementation, ensuring adequate\n            technical assistance, and financing, either under the loan,\n            or preferably, through grant financing from donors. The Bank\n            should promptly respond to project preparation needs, to\n            avoid delays which can change the composition of assistance.\n            Changing circumstances, particularly in operations under\n            harsh political environments, call for adjustments within\n            components, thus requiring flexibility, and timeliness to\n            ensure an effective assistance. Since time is of the essence\n            in emergency operations, special attention should be given\n            to defining procurement arrangements, and capacity building,\n            thus a strong preparation would ease the burden of\n            correcting deficiencies in the subsequent supervision stages."}, "docdt": "2000-05-10T00:00:00Z"}
