Pyongtaek LNG Receiving Terminal\n            outlines potential, negative environmental impacts and their\n            proposed mitigations. Expected changes to topography include\n            changes caused by disposing of dredged soil and by\n            accumulating building materials for construction work. The\n            amount of suspended solids because of the outflow of muddy\n            water would only minimally affect the quality of seawater\n            and its ecological balance, but building embankments and\n            erosion control will offset this impact. Because fishery\n            resources may be affected, compensation should be considered\n            for affected populations. Although the risk of gas leakage\n            is reduced because the weight if liquid natural gas (LNG) is\n            lighter and less explosive than LPG, potential accidents can\n            be avoided by using detectors and alarms, providing safety\n            education, and improving skills in accident prevention."}, "docdt": "1981-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
