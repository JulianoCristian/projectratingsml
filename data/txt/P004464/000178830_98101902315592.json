of irrigation and\n            drainage facilities and roads on a total area of about\n            26,770 ha of currently rainfed land; (c) construction of\n            three pumping stations of serve lands at higher elevations\n            covering 8,000 ha of the project area; (d) supply and\n            installation of pumps, motors, auxiliary equipment and\n            pipelines; (e) provision of consulting services to assist\n            NIA in designing the pumping stations, and procurement,\n            installation and testing of pumping equipment; and (f)\n            procurement of vehicles and equipment for project\n            implementation and operation and maintenance. About 8,000\n            farm families and 4,400 landless laborers' families,\n            most of whom are below the poverty line, will benefit\n            directly from increased production and consequent\n            employment. The project will create a demand for an\n            additional two million man-days of farm labor per year\n            equivalent to some 8,400 full-time jobs. At full\n            agricultural development the project will about $25 million\n            per year at forecast world market prices. The economic rate\n            of return is sensitive to the possibility of farmers\n            achieving less than expected yields."}, "docdt": "1978-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
