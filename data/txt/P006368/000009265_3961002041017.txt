MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF TH.- PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD Ta THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE FEDERATIVE REPUBUC OF BRAZIL
FOR A WATER SECTOR MODERNIZATION PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Federative Republic of Brazil for the equivalent of US$250 million to help finance a project for
the modernization of the water sector. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate,
with a maturity of 15 years, including five years of grace, Proceeds of the loan will be passed on by
the Federative Republic of Brazil to the State Water Companies 1SWCs) of Santa Catarina (CASAN),
*        Bahia (EMBASA), and Mato Grosso do Sul (SANESUL) on the same terms and conditions as those of
the Loan, including the foreign exchange risk.
Background
2.    The Brazilian water sector developed rapidly during the 1970s to the mid 1 980s, under the
direction of the National Water and Sanitation Program (PLANASA), dramatically increasing urban
coverage by 1988 to 83% (from 456 in 1970) for water and to 38% (from 24% in 1970) for
sewerage. During the past few years, however, the sector has entered a financial and institution
crisis that has severely affected it, leaving its agencies with large debts, and the country facing
decreased service coverage levels. 3esides Brazil's macroeconomic crisis and its accompanying high
inflation, the sector's performance has deteriorated due to an excessive reliance on govemment
financing and subsidies, a lack of appropriate asset valuation, and a govemmental policy that allowed
inadequate tariff adjustments in an effort to moderate inflation. The abolition of Banco Nacional da
Habitacao (BNH) in November, 1986, significantly weakened PLANASA. Caixa EconOmica Federal
(CEF), the commercial bank which received BNH's operational portfolio, has been unable to adequately
perform the investment planning and financial and operational control of sector companies. On the
other hand, the decentralization reforms brought about by the 1988 Constitution have increased the
role of the state governments in the regulation of the water sector. Tariff-setting, for example, has
been formally transferred from the federal authorities to the states-with so far very positive results
for the financial health of many SWCs. The urgency of restructuring the sector is clear. The
reformulation of the sector's organization and objectives should place primary emphasis on improved
efficiency, through the use of commercial practices in all entities, regulatory arrangements which foster
competiton among service providers, and, where feasible and appropriate, increased private sector
participation.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
3.    The Bank's assistance strategy in Brazil is to support policies and investments that will
encourage economic growth and social development in the context. of macroeconomic stability. Our
emphasis is on efficient resource allocation, increased efficiency in the public sector and the
*       approptiate targeting and delivery of services to the poor. In this context, our ultimate goal for the
water and sewerage sector is that operations become commercial, with any public funding explicitly
directed to provide the poor with access to appropriate services. Poverty-targeting, financial self-
sufficiency and accountability of the sector agencies, and effective pollution management are basic
goals. Through its participation in the Project the Bank will assist: (i) the newly created National
Secretariat for Water Supply and Sanitation ISNS) to reorient the sector's organization and objectives
to achieve higher efficiency and improved financial viability, through decentralization, greater financial
autonomy and accountability, improved tariff setting policies, and direct access to the financial sector;
and lii) the SWCs of Bahia (EMBASA), Mato Grosso do Sul (SANESUL), and Santa Catarina (CASAN)
to improve their standards of commercial performance.



-2-
Lessons Leamed from Past Bank Projects
4.    The 'Project will continue the Bank's active participation in the development of the Braziian
water sector. Since 1971, thirteen water supply and sewerage loans (US$1.4 billion) have been
approved to support PLANASA's objectives and assist the Govemment in expanding the coverage level
of water supply and sanitation services. The main lessons leamed from these operations are: {i) water
and sanitation projcts are not immune to a lackluster macroeconomic performance; (ii) frequent
management changes at the Borrowers and/or executing agencies and long implementation periods
compromise proJect objectives; (iii) projects should emphasize more cost recovery, lower operational
costs through higher operatinal efficiency, and a larger Internal contribution to investments; (iv)
physical and institutional components should be adequately linked; and (v) project scope and design
should be simple, with a minimum of components.
Project Objectives
5.    The main objectives of the Project are: (f) to strengthen the sector's institutional capabilities
by laying the foundations of a modern and efficient legal and regulatory framework, and upgrading the
efficiency and competence of the sector financial model; (ii) to help CASAN, EMBASA, and SANESUL,
to oper  on a commercial basis, with financial self-sufficiency, corporate autonomy and
accountability for their actions, through the financing of a time-slice of their six-year investment
programs; and ffil) to improve environmental and health conditions in the project's urban areas, through
the expansion of water supply and sewerage services.
Project Descrpion
6.    The project consists of an institutional strengthening component (ISC) and an investment
component jIC). The ISC (2% of project total costs) will help finance: (i) the formulation of a proposal
for setting-up a new regulawory framework for Brazil's water and wastes sector, including a detailed
plan of action for institutional reformulation, drafts of proposed legislation and regulation, and definition
of functions and mechanisms at the Federal and state levels; ii) the evaluation and reformulation of
the sector's investment programming and financing framework, aimed at upgrading its efficiency and
ensuring an improvement In the self-financing of sector companies; (iii) technical assistance and
training for SNS and other Federal and local sector agencies to increase their institutional capacity to
carry out their responsibilities under the project and under the instttional arrangements and sector
policies to be proposed; (iv) training of sector management; and (v) preparation facilities for a proposed
Water Demand Management and Systems Rehabilitation Project. The IC (98% of project total costs)
will help finance a time-slice of the six-year investment program of CASAN, EMBASA, and SANESUL.
The investment programs are concentrated in: (i) expanding and reinforcing distribution of water, and
collection and treatment of sewage; {ii) improving the companies operational efficiency; and (iii)
enhancing the quality of services offered by the companies.
7.    The cost of the project is estimated at about US$500 million equivalent (US$8 million for the
ISC, US$161 million for CASAN, US$202 ,,iillion for EMBASA, and US$129 million for SANESUL),
with a foreign exchange requirement of about US$102 million. The Bank will help finance about 50%
of the total cost of the project-100% of the cost of the ISC and about 49% of selected portions of
the 1992-1997 total investment programs of CASAN, EMBASA, and SANESUL. Financng for the
remaining investments will be provided by the companies themselves. Given that the creation of a
competitive financial environment among SWCs is a key feature of this project, the initial distribution
of Bank resources among the three companies will be guaranteed only during the first two years of
project implementaion. At the beginning of the third year of project implementation and each year
thereafter, the Bank and SNS will redistribute (if necessary) the funds remaining to be disbursed, based
on a review of each company's achievement of project objectives and compliance with agreed
monitoring indicators. The projeces costs and financing plan are shown in Schedule A. The Bank will
provide funds for civil works, equipment and materials, engineering and technical assistance, studies,



-3-
and training. Project Implementation is expected to take six years. Project cost by procurement
method and disbursement schedule are shown In Schedule 8. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in Brazil are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.
I1RD Map No. 23322 is attached, as is Staff Appraisal Report No. 10024-BR, dated February 7, 1992.
Project ImplementatIon
8.    The project will be managed by the Project Management Unit (PMU), a technical unit
established jointly by the Ministry of Social Action (MAS) and the Ministry of Economy, Finance, and
Planning (MEFP) for the duration of the project. The PMU, headed by a Technical Coordinator
supported by a small staff of full-time employees, will be specifically responsible for the implementation
of the ISC, for the coordination and supervision of the Technical Agents (TAs) to be selected to
supervise implementation of the investrnent component, and for the coordination of activities necessary
to translate the resulting set of proposals into apprt-priate legislation. The investment component will
be implemented by and under the entire responsibility of CASAN, EMBASA, and SANESUL. The TAs
will report to and work under terms of reference defined by SNS/PMU, but will be paid by the OTN-
through a commercial bank, on behalf of the companies and making use of Bank resources. SNS will
sign an agreement to that effect with each company. In addition to supervision of technical and
financial matters, the TAs will verify company eligibility for subproject financing, subproject compliance
with agreed selection criteria, company compliance with Bank procurement procedures and methods,
and company compliance with performance indicators defined in the Letters of Agreement to be signed
among the companies, the states and the Federal govemment.
9.    The SWCs' eligibility criteria for Bank financing will include: lil compliance with the National
Tariff Law; lit) generation of enough intemal cash to annually cover a gradually larger percentage of
new Investments; (iii) compliance with agreed targets for number of water and sewerage connections
per employee and personnel costs as a percentage of operating costs--excluding depreciation; and (iv)
demonstration of the company's solvency, profitability, and liquidity according to standard financial
ratios. Each proposed subproject should correspond to the least-cost solution, and should be the
object of a feasibility study prepared by the SWC in accordance with guidelines agreed with the Bank,
reviewed by the technical agent (TAs), and approved by PMU. The analysis of a given subproject
seeks to establish the priority of the proposed components, its consistency with sector policies, and
ts contribution to improve the delivery of services in a given locality. This analysis also aims to
ascertain that neither the subproject nor its components adversely affect the environment and that
their benefits equal or exceed their costs. The justification of each individual subproject will be based
on the long-run average incremental costs ILRAIC) vis-a-vis the company's current average tariffs.
Project Sustainability
10.   The high contribution to investment required from the SWCs' internal cash generation and the
reformulation of sector organization and objectives should be the main elements contributing to project
sustainability. Departing from a past practice of near total debt financing for new investments, the
SWCs will provide a counterpart cash contribution amounting to about 60% of the project's cost or
about 45% of the companies investment programs in the period 1992-1997. This new investment
policy will strength the SWCs' financial discipline and independence, by making them less reliant on
govemment funds-only about 17% of the SWCs' investment programs will be financed by the Federal
and state govemments (CEF and the FAEs will provide the rest of financing). On the other hand, a
rapid and efficient reform of the sector's regulatory system wil strength the sector's institutional
capabilities, by clarifying the Federal and state govemments' responsibilities regarding the d sign and
implementation of national water policies, creating independent regulatory commissions, and
reformulating a new sector investment planning and financing framework. Other elements that shoultO
also contribute to project sustainability are the open competition for Bank resources that will begin in
the third year and the close overlap between the project's implementation period and the recently
elected governors' terms of office.



-4-
Environmental Aspects
11.   The project will significantly improve sanitary and environmental conditions in the area of
responsibility of the SWCs, ane no major environmental problems are envisaged. The project will help
finance sewage collection and treatment in greater proportions than in past Bank projects-about 34%
of total investment will go to sewerage. Befides major facilities to be built in the capitals and other
large cities, the project also Includes kiw cost sanitation programs to be implemented on the
countryside and metropolitan peripheral areas, where conventional systems would not be financially
viable. CASAN's sewerage projects- to be designed and built including final treatrnent and disposal,
will increase the company's sewerage coverage level from the current 9% to 21 % In 1997 and turn
many touristic areas of the state seashore to be appropriate for bathing. EMBASA's sewerage projects
will concentrate at improving the satwttary conditions of the Metropolitan Region of Salvador and the
quality of the seashore. SANESUL's investment program includes the construction of a complete
sewerage system in Campo Grande and Important facilities in several medium- and small-sized
localities. The facilities to be built in Campo Grande will reduce the organic pollution, protecting the
riverside community from the risk of contamination during rainy season flooding.
12.   To assess the proiects' env.ronmental impact, the companies are required by Federal Law to
prepare environmental impact reports (RIMAs) following state guidelines. During Appraisal, the
capacity to assess the RIMAS was reviewed and found sufficient in the state of Santa Catarina, but
not completely satisfactory in the sates of Bahia and Mato Grosso do Sul. Santa Catarina's
environmental agency is a nationally well known control agency that has good experience on managing
environmental control assessments, and has succeed on cleaning up some important rivers. The
institutional capacity of Bahia's environmental agency to control environmental degradation is very
incipient. The agency has no experience introducing sanitation projects on the permit system and, so
far, Bahia's environmental control system has not issued any license to EMBASA. Mato Grosso do
Sul's environmental agency has been trying to introduce environmental impact assessments as a
routine tool and has been training many members of its staff at these techniques, but its institutional
capacity to control environmental degradation is still incipient. To remedy these shortcomings, SNS
will provide training and institutional strengthening to the environmental agencies of Bahia and Mato
Grosso do Sul.
Program Objective Categories
1i.   The institutional restructuration of the water and wastes sector and the financial, operational,
and the commercial strengthening of CASAN, EMBASA, and SANESUL are the project's crucial
objectives. Helping the Federal and state governments to address environmental management issues
is also a key objective (paras. 13 and 14). And though poverty alleviation is not an explicit objective,
the urban poor will benefit considerably from the project. About 54% of its beneficiaries--about 2.3
milliorn peopte, will belong to families earning a monetary income of three minimum salaries or less.
Agreed Actions
14.   During Loan Negotiations, the Federal govemment, the states, and the SWCs agreed with the
Bank on: (a) terms of reference (TOR) satisfactory to the Bank for the creation and staffing of the PMU,
including qualifications and experience of the unit manager; (b) the employment throughout the life of
the project of consultants (TAs) to assist in the supervision of each of the SWCs, selected based on
TOR satisfactory to the Bank, not later than September 30, 1992; (c) carrying out and/or participating
in the studies and training programs included in the ISC in accordance with TOR and timetables
satisfact'4y to the Bank; (d) company eligibility criteria for continual participation in the project; {e)
authorizing, permitting, or promoting any improvement to the companies' management and operational
systems, and if necessary, any adjustment to the companies' tariff rates to assure a permanent
compliance with the financial performance established in the NTL and the generation of adequate
intemal cash consistent with the Project's financial plans; (f) holding a mid-term review (about June,



-5-
1994) to assess completion of studies and degree of implementation of proposed recommendations,
to evaluate progress made by the SWCs in carrying out plans to improve their commercial performance,
to assess the effectiveness of the training and institutional st.-sngthening to be provided by SNS to the
environmental agencies of Bahia and Mato Grosso do Sul; and to verify compliance with covenants of
the. Loan and Project Agreements; Ig) assuring the timely provision of counterpart finanicing; (h)
generating sufficient internal cash to annually cover an increasing percentage of total new investment
costs-excluding interest during construction, beginning with at least 20% In 1992 and reaching at
least 35% in 1997 and thereafter; (i) refraining trom changing annual investments during the project
implementation period by more than 20% of the investment amounts originally agreed, without prior
Bank approval; a) selecting all individual subprojects, 'n'luding those outside the Bank-financed part
of the SWCs' Investment programs, based on criteria 1-,reed with the Bank; (k) carrying out action
programs satisfactory to the Bank to improve the SWCs' commercial performance vis-a-vis agreed
operating and financial targets; (1) adjusting overdue accounts for inflation or taking other measures
which would reduce the financial losses resulting from overdue bills; (m) after two years of project
execution, reallocating undisbursed and uncommitted Bank funds among eligible SWCs; In) submitting
to the Bank, not later than October 15 of each year, a general financial projection for the following six-
year period, with specific details on investment plans for the upcoming year; (o) submitting to the Bank
progress reports by January 15, April 15, July 15, and October 15 of each year; and (p) preparing the
following studies In accordance with TOR and timetables satisfactory to the Bank, Including discussion
of results and recommendations: {i) marginal cost pricing before December 31, 1993, and
implementation of agreed set of recommendations before June 30, 1994; (ii) amounts involved and
likely fiscal implications of an asset revaluation, and incorporation of results into the audited financial
statements of fiscal year 1993; (iii) water demand management and systems rehabilitation before June
30, 1994, and implementation of agreed implementation plan; and (iv) SANESUL, in particular, hydro-
geological potential of Mato Grosso do Sul by December, 1993, and based on its conclusions and
recommendations, reevaluation of the economic justification of water production siubprojects involving
superficial water.
15.   Prior to Loan Effectiveness: (a) at least two of the companies should have signed on-lending
contracts with the Federal government; and (b) Letters of Agreement among the SWCs, the states,
and SNS, satisfactory to the Bank, should be signed and submitted to the Bank.
ProJect Benefits
16.   The project will directly benefit more than 4.3 million people with water supply and sewerage
services in hundreds of cities and towns in the states of Bahia, Mato Grosso do Sul, and Santa
Catarina. in addition, the project will also: {i) benefit the companies' old and new customers, through
the provision of services of better quality, higher reliability, lower costs, and faster access; (ii) help the
companies to strengthen financial viability, and improve operational and management efficiency; (iii)
provide a role model for the rest of the sector; and (iv) lessen the water sector's financial dependence
on Govemment funding. The financial rate of return is estimated to be about 17%, based on a sample
of nine subprojects representing about one third of the companies' 1992-1997 investment programs.
Risks
17.   There are no serious technical risks in the project. Possible risks include: inadequate tariff
adjustments in a continuing highly inflat;onary economy; the government's willingness to continue
supporting the institutional reform to strengthen the sector; and the institutional capability of
MAS/SNS. To minirr.ize these risks: (i) agreement was reached with the Federal and local governments
to maintain current policy on tariff adjustments, which during the past three years have produced very
positive results for the financial health of the SWCs; (1ii1) a mid-term review will assess completion of
all studies, degree of implementation of proposed recommendations at Federal and state level, and
progress made by the companies on operating and financial matters; and (iii) a PMU in SNS, supported
by consultants, will assure an efficient technical and administrative direction of the project; and (iv)
