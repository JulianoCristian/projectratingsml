SCHEDULE 2
Description of the Project
The objectives of the Project are: (i) to strengthen the water and sewerage 
sector's institutional capabilities by laying the foundations of a modern and 
efficient legal and regulatory frame-work, and upgrading the efficiency and competence 
of the sector financial model; (ii) to help CASAN, EMBASA, and SANESUL to operate on a 
commercial basis, with financial self-sufficiency  including independence from 
earmarked funds, corporate autonomy and accountability for its actions, through the 
financing of institutional improvement plans and a time-slice of their six-year 
investment programs; and (iii) to improve environmental and health conditions in urban 
areas, through the expansion of water supply and sewerage services.
The Project consists of the following parts, subject to such modifications 
thereof as the Borrower and the Bank may agree upon from time to time to achieve such 
objectives:
Part A:
Institutional Development
 
A technical assistance and training program, including the acquisition and 
utilization of equipment, to assist the Borrower in: (i) the formulation of a proposal 
for setting up a new regulatory model for Brazil's water and wastes sector, including 
a detailed plan of action for institutional reformulation, drafts of proposed 
legislation and regulations, and definition of functions and mechanisms at the federal 
and state levels; (ii) the evaluation and reformulation of the sector investment 
programming and financing model at the federal and local levels, aiming at upgrading 
its efficiency and ensuring an improvement in the self-financing of sector companies; 
(iii) improving the institutional capabilities of SNS and other federal, state and 
local sector entities to carry out their responsibilities under the Project and under 
the institutional arrangements and sector policies to be proposed; (iv) improving 
sector management in planning, marketing, and operational techniques--including cost 
reduction; and (v) the preparation and design
