In the last decade, India has seen some\n            major disasters including the Bhuj earthquake in 2001 and\n            the tsunami in 2004. India has a coastline of 7,516 km\n            covering 13 coastal states and union territories, of which\n            5700 km are prone to cyclones of various degrees. The\n            coastal districts of Odisha are prone to frequent cyclonic\n            storms and concurrent flood hazards. The Odisha\n            Super-cyclone of 1999 killed over 8,900 people and 440,000\n            livestock, affected more than 15 million people and\n            disrupted over 2 million households across 14 districts of\n            the state. The Odisha state disaster management authority\n            (OSDMA) set up after the super cyclone of 1999 was the first\n            disaster mitigation authority set up in the country. India\n            in the last decade has also made significant strides in\n            moving from reactive emergency response to being proactive\n            and implementing disaster preparedness and risk reduction\n            initiatives. The use of Geographic Information System (GIS)\n            based mapping is playing a major role in achieving the\n            objectives of the National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project\n            (NCRMP). It is helping in enhancing the effectiveness of\n            early warning dissemination systems and communication,\n            improving access and evacuation and in better locating infrastructure."}, "docdt": "2013-02-01T00:00:00Z"}
