                         Department has awarded 157 contracts for reconstruction of about 14,500 structurally vulnerable houses across 11 coastal districts of Tamil Nadu. About fifty percent of these
                         houses are approaching lintel level. The active involvement of the beneficiaries in the monitoring of the housing reconstruction activities by the contractors is being facilitated by
                         NGOs who also assist beneficiaries (where required) with invoking the grievance redress system at the level of District Collectors.

                         The Fisheries departments in Government of Tamil Nadu and Government of Puducherry have initiated the process of inviting tenders for the fisheries infrastructure works - including
                         work shelters and fish landing centers. Several contracts have been awarded in Puducherry while there have been some delay in award of contracts in Tamil Nadu In addition in
                         Tamil Nadu, while construction of urban houses in Marina has proceeded in one pocket, in the balance two pockets, construction has not begun.
