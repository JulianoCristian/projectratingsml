                         Department has awarded 156 contracts for reconstruction of 15,500 structurally vulnerable houses across 11 coastal districts of Tamil Nadu. The active involvement of the
                         beneficiaries in the monitoring of the housing reconstruction activities by the contractors is being facilitated by NGOs who also assist beneficiaries (where required) with invoking the
                         grievance redress system at the level of District Collectors.

                         The Fisheries departments in Government of Tamil Nadu and Government of Puducherry have initiated the process of inviting tenders for the fisheries infrastructure works - including
                         work shelters and fish landing centers. The bidding documents for the fishing harbor related infrastructure works in both States are in an advanced stage of preparation and are
                         expected to be awarded by January 31, 2011.
