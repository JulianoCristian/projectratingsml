   INDIA: EMERGENCY TSUNAMI RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT (ETRP)

                             RESTRUCTURING PAPER


SUMMARY
1.       The Project with a Credit of $465 million became effective on August 09, 2005.
Despite two project restructurings (described below) implementation progress of agreed
activities remained slow due to several reasons documented by regular implementation
support missions. A further extension of the current closing date of December 31, 2011
was requested by the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Government
of India, on November 09, 2011. However, after due deliberation this request was not
agreed to by the International Development Association. Following this, the DEA on
December 28, 2011 requested cancelation of undisbursed credit. In response, this
restructuring paper has been prepared to seek approval for cancelation of SDR
152,350,000 (US$ 235 million equivalent).



PROJECT STATUS
2.      Government of Tamil Nadu’s tsunami recovery program implementation has been
successful and substantially achieved the original program objectives of reconstruction of
damaged houses albeit without using ETRP funds, as replacement funds in the form of
grants became available from various NGOs for construction of houses. On account of
accumulated savings, the project was first restructured in 2009, to change the project
development objectives and to include a new component, namely ‘Vulnerability
Reduction of Coastal Communities (VRCC)’. The first restructuring became effective on
August 13, 2009. Thereafter, during November 2010, a second restructuring was carried
out to: (i) reduce $69 million from the original credit; and (ii) reallocate the balance
proceeds across different categories.

3.      The project’s implementation progress and the likelihood of achievement of the
project development objectives are both currently rated as Marginally Unsatisfactory,
primarily due to delays in implementation.

4.      Tamil Nadu: Contracts related to six fisheries infrastructure works have recently
been awarded and construction is in preliminary stage. Other works related to vulnerable
rural housing reconstruction and urban housing reconstruction are currently underway.
Out of about 15,000 structurally vulnerable houses being reconstructed under VRCC,
around 5,000 houses are complete and the balance is at various stages of completion. The
financial progress vis a vis the housing reconstruction under VRCC is about 50% while
physical progress is about 70%. Works related to evacuation shelter, evacuation route and
early warning system are yet to be contracted.




                                            6
5.     Puducherry: Housing reconstruction through beneficiaries numbering about
1,100 is going on, while 300 houses are being constructed through a contractor. Six
works related to fisheries infrastructure remain to be contracted.

6.      Government of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry will continue with the execution of
ongoing works that primarily include urban and rural housing reconstruction; and
fisheries infrastructure works. These works are likely to be completed by June 2013.
