unsatisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was low or negligible, the Bank\n            performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was also unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: bank procedures for emergency projects aim to\n            substantially compress the preparation time. However,\n            planning mechanisms for facilitating speedier implementation\n            normally receive little attention. During preparation, the\n            Government and the Bank should also focus on how these\n            procedural delays can be minimized through special fiduciary\n            arrangements. The restructuring process focused on utilizing\n            the use of expected savings. This resulted in addition of a\n            completely new component vis-a-vis the original project\n            design. At that time, discussions should have been held with\n            the borrower on designing a new project focusing on disaster\n            risk reduction rather than combining reconstruction with\n            risk reduction. In ETRP, the housing component tended to be\n            the sole focus in the initial period of implementation. For\n            instance, the Government of India (GoI) and Government of\n            Pondicherry (GoPY) gave housing the top priority. Therefore,\n            the Project Implementation Agency (PIA) chose to sequence\n            implementation and deferred actions pertaining to the\n            fisheries and livelihood component. This has resulted in\n            incomplete outcomes in constructing the Fisheries\n            infrastructure even after six years of project implementation."}, "docdt": "2012-06-18T00:00:00Z"}
