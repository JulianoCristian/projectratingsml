The project\n            with a credit of $465 million became effective on August 09,\n            2005. Despite two project restructurings implementation\n            progress of agreed activities remained slow due to several\n            reasons documented by regular implementation support\n            missions. A further extension of the current closing date of\n            December 31, 2011 was requested by the Department of\n            Economic Affairs (DEA), Ministry of Finance, Government of\n            India, on November 09, 2011. However, after due deliberation\n            this request was not agreed to by the International\n            Development Association. The DEA on December 28, 2011\n            requested cancelation of undisbursed credit. In response,\n            this restructuring paper has been prepared to seek approval\n            for cancelation of SDR 152,350,000 (US$ 235 million equivalent)."}, "docdt": "2011-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
