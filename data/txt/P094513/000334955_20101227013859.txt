INDIA: EMERGENCY TSUNAMI RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT 
RESTRUCTURING PAPER 
SUMMARY 
 
1. 
The proposed changes will support the cancellation of an amount of US$ 69 million 
from the Emergency Tsunami Reconstruction Project (ETRP) (Credit 4054-IN). 
 
PROJECT STATUS 
 
2. 
As of November 30, 2010, out of the IDA Credit of US$465 million only about 
$112.80 million has been disbursed. The key project data is as follows:

3. 
Soon after the project became effective it became clear that the project would 
accumulate significant cost savings primarily on account of: (a) overestimation of 
housing reconstruction needs which was based on the initial damage assessment and used 
for emergency project preparation, and (b) replacement of IDA project funds with private 
funds, mainly from Non Government Organizations. Therefore, the Government of India 
(GoI)/Government of Tamil Nadu (GoTN) requested the utilization of these savings for 
an integrated disaster risk reduction program for highly vulnerable communities in the 
project area. A first order restructuring of the project was carried out and made effective 
on August 13, 2009 with the addition of a new component titled ‘Vulnerability Reduction 
of Coastal Communities (VRCC)’, $136.40 million. VRCC includes (a) setting up an 
upgraded early warning system; (b) improved access to evacuation and cyclone shelters; 
(c) reconstruction of structurally vulnerable disaster-prone houses in rural areas; and (d) 
protection of assets through insurance policy in identified vulnerable coastal locations. 
 
4. 
The progress of the VRCC in its primary subcomponent i.e. reconstruction of 
vulnerable houses has been satisfactory. Since the effectiveness of the restructured 
project, 157 construction contracts for reconstruction of about 15,000 rural houses have 
been awarded. Reconstruction has begun and will have positive impact on the 
disbursements during 2011. The progress on the other VRCC subcomponents i.e. 
Page  5

evacuation routes, cyclone shelters and early warning systems has not kept pace. It is 
likely that contract award for the remaining VRCC activities will be completed by May 
2011. 
5. 
Implementation delays continue to plague the original ETRP components, 
primarily the Urban Housing Reconstruction in Tamil Nadu and the Fisheries 
Infrastructure Works in both Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. The scope of Urban Housing 
Reconstruction in Tamil Nadu includes, four  major subcomponents:  
 
·
construction of 3,616 houses at All India Radio (AIR) site,  
·
purchase of about 5,000 ready-built tenements at two different sites.  
·
construction of 2,048 houses at Okkium Thuraipakkam (OTP), and 
·
construction of about 5,500  permanent and 2,500 transit houses at Marina,  
 
Housing reconstruction at AIR is complete and about 3,500 ready-built houses are 
allotted to eligible beneficiaries at Semmancheri and Thazankuppam. At OTP, 
construction work has now resumed after more than a year of stoppage due to legal 
matters and the construction of Transit shelters at Marina is completed. The scope of 
reconstruction has significantly reduced at Marina and GoTN has delinked the 
construction of about 2,800 tenements planned under Phase-II of Marina schemes for 
reconstruction from the Project. The delay in Fisheries Infrastructure Works has been 
primarily on account of the statutory (environmental) clearances. Tendering for these 
works has only started now. 
 
PROPOSED CHANGES  
 
6. 
Cancellations
:
Owing to the delays and significant reduction in scope of urban 
housing reconstruction, the mission during January 2010 identified the possibility of 
significant potential non-utilization of credit by the project and estimated the savings to 
be about $80 million. The subsequent mission in July 2010 revised its estimated savings 
to $100 million from Tamil Nadu alone. The Government of Tamil Nadu (GoTN) and 
Government of Puducherry (GoPy) were requested by the Department of Economic 
Affairs (DEA) during consecutive review meetings to come up with estimation of 
possible non-utilization of credit. DEA after discussions with GoTN and GoPy, vide its 
letter dated November 08, 2010 has requested cancellation of a total of $69 million from 
the credit: $67.6 million from Tamil Nadu and $1.4 million from Puducherry. 
 
7. 
DEA, GoTN and GoPy have also agreed to further review potential additional IDA 
savings and take a decision by March 2011. 
 
8. 
Reallocation
:
The revised re-allocation of the credit for Tamil Nadu and 
Puducherry consequent upon cancellation is reflected in Annex 1.

APPRAISAL SUMMARY 
 
9. 
This restructuring is to enable cancellation of US$69 million from the credit and 
further cancellation is likely. As a result of partial cancellation, the implementation 
progress will improve contributing to overall project risk reduction. There are no changes 
to the technical approach to the project, nor to the safeguards requirements under the 
project.
