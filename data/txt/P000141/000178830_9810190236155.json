Botswana's road network, encourage rural development\n            and strengthen road maintenance. It would complete the\n            paving of an extension of the north-south road to link with\n            Zimbabwe; improve road access to portions of the Tuli Block\n            and adjacent areas; strengthen the Roads Department by\n            building a soils and materials testing laboratory and road\n            maintenance depots, and providing consulting services and\n            two instructors to complete the staffing of Botswana's\n            Roads Training Center. By reducing transport and vehicle\n            operating costs, it would benefit consumers and traders. The\n            Project faces no special risks, although realization of its\n            potential would be adversely affected by a decline in\n            cross-border traffic between Botswana and Zimbabwe."}, "docdt": "1980-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
