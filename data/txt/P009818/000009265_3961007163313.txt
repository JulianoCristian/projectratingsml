MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:    Project Completion Report on India:
Cambav Basin Petroleum Project (Loan 2403-IN)
Attached is the Project Completion Report on India - Cambay Basin Petroleum Project
(Loan 2403-IN) prepared by the Finance and Private Sector Development Vice Presidency, with Part II
provided by the Borrower.
The objective of this project was to increase the long-term production of petroleum
resources from the Cambay Basin in Gujarat State. This was to be accomplished by an integrated
program to expand exploration programs, upgrade the development of known established resources,
rehabilitate facilities in developed fields, undertake pilot operations in enhanced production techniques,
and provide training in all aspects of petroleum exploration and production activities. With the exception
of the training component, which was never implemented, the project was successfully implemented at
a substantial lower cost than originally estimated.
Financial savings were used to increase seismic data acquisition, drill four offshore
exploration wells in addition to the original four onshore wells, and increase the number of development
and rehabilitation wells. Three additional enhanced recovery schemes were also introduced. The increase
in project related oil and gas production was substantially greater than originally estimated.
The project outcome is rated as satisfactory and sustainability as likely. Institutional
development is rated as negligible.
The PCR is of high quality and provides insightful discussions of the reasons for the large
cost underruns as well as the implementation difficulties encountered in procurement.
No audit is planned.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Cambay Basin
Petroleum Project, for which Loan 2403-IN in the amount of US$242,500,000 was
approved on May 25, 1984. The loan was closed on September 30, 1993, two years
behind schedule. It was fully disbursed and the last disbursement was on January
1, 1994.
The PCR was prepared by the Oil and Gas Division (IENOG) of the
Industry and Energy Department (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III).
The Borrower has prepared his Completion Report, a condensed version of which is
included as Part II.
The PCR is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report; the Loan
and Project Agreements; supervision reports; correspondence between the Bank and
the Borrower; and internal Bank memoranda.

CAMBAY BASIN PETROLEUM PROJECT
(LOAN 2403-IN)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Oblectives
The primary objective of the Cambay Basin Petroleum Project was to assist
the Government of India (GOI), specifically the Western Region of the Oil &
Natural Gas Commission  (ONGC),  in optimizing the long-term development of
petroleum resources in the Cambay Basin  (Gujarat State) .  This was to be
accomplished by aiding in the development of several underdeveloped fields and
improving remedial work on existing wells. In addition, selective exploratory
activity, seismic survey in the Gulf of Cambay, the drilling of eight deep
exploratory wells (4 onshore and 4 in the Gulf of Cambay), and enhanced oil
recovery pilot schemes were included. The goal of the project was to arrest and
reverse the decline in production which was in effect at the time and to provide
a basis for future development and production of oil and gas. In addition to
financial support, the project was designed to upgrade and modernize development
through the infusion of the latest technology in terms of equipment, material and
services. (See para 6.)
Im=lementation ExDerience
The project was satisfactorily implemented even though a two-year extension
was necessary to accomplish all objectives. A defining feature of the Cambay
Basin Petroleum Project was the substantial underrun in costs, being about one-
half of that estimated at appraisal. This permitted a significant expansion to
project components to the overall benefit of the project.  Another important
aspect was that the greater use of local contractors than envisioned at
appraisal, contributed to a far larger proportion of local costs vis-a-vis
foreign exchange.   Thus the substantial over estimate of project costs at
appraisal versus actual experience was caused primarily by a 67% Rupee
devaluation versus the US$ over the project life and the sharp break in
international oil prices in 1986 with a commensurate decline in prices for oil-
related goods and services. The appraisal was made in 1983 when both oil prices
and related service prices were at all-time highs with every evidence for further
increases. It also appears that project cost estimates at appraisal were biased
toward the high side, the safe side as seen at the time. (See para 12.)
Procurement problems were commonplace during the Cambay Basin Petroleum
Project, most of which were self inflicted, which delayed implementation and
added to Bank supervision.  (See para 11.)  The most serious procurement delay
involved the contract for exploratory drilling in the Gulf of Cambay which in
itself was responsible for the 2-year postponement of the Loan closing date.
While procurement delays often resulted in cost reduction due to declining
prices, it should be remembered that the revenue stream was delayed by about two
years.
The decisions by ONGC to forego the training component and to back off of
additional agreed seismic surveys in the offshore Gulf of Cambay appear to have
been questionable. Both decisions were taken counter to Bank recommendations.
(See paras 16g & 21.)
Results
The Cambay Basin Petroleum Project objectives were met, generally exceeded.
The development and workover components provided a production increment of 2.5
million tons of oil and 500 million cubic meters of gas during the peak years of
1988-92. The expected lifetime increment of production is 26.7 million tons of
oil and 5480 million cubic meters of gas. In terms of oil, the project exceeded



iii
appraisal projections by 0.5 million tons per year at peak production and by
about 10 million tons over lifetime production. In terms of gas, the project
exceeded appraisal projections by 368 million cubic meters per year at peak
production and by 3400 million cubic meters over equivalent lifetime production.
With respect to both oil and gas, the building up of production paralleled that
forecast at appraisal. (See para 16.)
With respect to economic results, the actual return substantially exceeded
that projected at appraisal, with lower oil prices being more than offset by
reduced project costs. In terms of internal rate of return to ONGC, the project
is expected to vastly exceed the 17.5% projected at appraisal. (See para 17 &
18.)
Intangible benefits include the exploration results and the successful Balol
heavy oilfield in-situ combustion pilot for enhanced oil recovery.  The Lanwa
heavy  oil  field  in-situ  combustion project  also  appears  positive.    The
exploration component includes the first seismic survey in the harsh (10 m
diurnal tides) operating environment in the offshore Gulf of Cambay. Some nine
prospects were delineated and four were drilled resulting in two promising but
as yet unevaluated oil discoveries. In addition four deep exploratory wells were
drilled onshore which resulted in one discovery (a 10 plus km extension to the
Gandhar field) and a generally negative evaluation of the deeper section of the
basin.
Sustainability
The incremental production of oil and gas is expected to last until post
2010 for both oil and gas. The technology and operating practices introduced
during the project should have permanent benefit. This successful pilot at Balol
field is planned to be extended field-wide. The pilot at Lanwa may also prove
commercial. Successful appraisal and ultimate development is probable for the
two offshore oil discoveries plus additional prospects yet to be drilled. (See
para 19.)
Findings and Lessons Learned
The Cambay Basin Petroleum Project was well designed, balancing key longer
term exploration and pilot EOR investments with shorter term development
investments with high rates of return. The remedial work component on existing
wells  (work over)  was particularly productive.   The development  cost  for
incremental production amounted to about US$1.40/bbl (US$10.00/ton) which
compares very favorably with current international experience. Workovers, on the
other hand, yielded incremental production estimated to cost US$0.51/bbl
(US$3.70/ton).   Since India,  as well as the majority of borrowers in the
developing world, are deficient in workover capability, this is a most important
component to be included in future petroleum projects where applicable.
The program of "indigenization" was adopted after appraisal of this project
which resulted in an abnormal number of procurement problems.   Any future
petroleum project in India should have prior agreement as to the application of
domestic preference, with final judgement retained by the Bank as to whether
value added by domestic intermediary companies is sufficient to qualify for
preference.
Most of the implementation delays were due to procurement problems and
delays, hence some consideration should be given to streamlining of the
procurement process. One remedial step might be the appointment of a procurement
adviser, permanently assigned to the project and resident in India whose
responsibility would be to ensure that every step in the procurement process is
properly done without delay.
To ensure that needed training is undertaken as contemplated and agreed
upon, future loan documents should include an agreement (covenant) with the
Borrower regarding the scope, content and implementation of the training
provisions with the possibility of cancellation of associated funds.

B.   Backqround
2.   Oil  and  gas  exploration,  development,  and  production  in  India  are
principally conducted by the state-owned entities; The Oil and Natural Gas
Commission (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd. (OIL) . Of these, ONGC is by far the larger
and produces from fields in the Bombay Offshore, Cambay, Western Assam, and
Southeast Indian regions (listed in descending quantitative order) . OIL produces
oil and gas in Eastern Assam.
3.   The Bank's initial involvement in the upstream petroleum sector (excluding
refining and marketing) started with a loan of US$400 million for the initial
development of the Bombay Offshore in 1981. This was followed in 1983 by the
Krishna-Godavari Petroleum Exploration loan of US$165.5 million to assist in
exploring for oil and gas both onshore and offshore in the Krishna and Godavari
River delta area in southeastern Mahdya Pradesh state in SE India.   The
development and pipeline transport of the South Bassein gas field offshore
Bombay, South Bassein Project loan of US$222.3 million followed later in 1983.
The Cambay Basin Petroleum Project is the Bank's fourth lending operation in the
upstream petroleum sector in India. Subsequent to Cambay, additional loans have
been made for petroleum development by OIL in eastern Assam and Rajasthan; the
Western Gas Project involving further development of Bassein gas (Phase II) and
the Heera oil and gas field offshore Bombay plus the first phase development of
the onshore Gandhar gas and oil field in the Cambay Region (Gujarat state); and
the Gas Flaring Reduction Project to provide the infrastructure to utilize
associated gas in offshore Bombay. (See Table 1., Part III.)
4.   The Cambay Basin, was deemed to be in a mature stage of development and in
1983 the Government of India (GOI) requested Bank assistance to attempt to stem
the declining production and to explore, in a limited way, those areas in which
the petroleum possibilities had not yet been evaluated.
C.   Prolect Oblectives and Description
5.   In furtherance of GOI's objectives, the Cambay Basin Petroleum Project was
designed to optimize the long-term development of the petroleum resources in the
Project Area; to arrest and reverse, if possible, the established decline in
production; and to extend the productive life of the basin.  This was to be
accomplished by: (1) selective exploratory seismic surveys particularly in the
Gulf of Cambay; (2) drilling several key exploratory wells; (3) infill drilling
in selected fields; (4) development of extensive and unutilized heavy oil
resources in the northern part of the basin; (5) an aggressive program to
rehabilitate sick wells by remedial work (work overs); and by the initiation of
several pilot schemes for enhanced oil recovery (EOR).



2
6.   The project consisted of the following:
Part A:   Exploration
The carrying out of a program to extend the search for petroleum into the
portion of the Project Area covered by the Gulf of Cambay and its shores and the
deeper horizons (3,000 to 5,000 meters depth) in the onshore part of the Project
Area through:
(i) seismic surveys with a coverage of about 1,750 line-km in the Gulf of
Cambay and its shores; and
(ii) drilling in the onshore portion of the Project Area of about four
exploration wells of 3,000 to 5,000 meters depth each including
provision of related technical well services, equipment and
materials.1/
Part B:   Oil and Gas Field Development and Rehabilitation
The carrying out of the: (i) final development, or completion of the final
development schemes, of the following oil fields: Kalol, North Kadi, South Kadi,
Sobhasan, Nawagam, Santhal, Balol and Lanwa; (ii) rehabilitation of the Cambay
gas field on an experimental basis; and (iii) program for improving the well
maintenance operations of the Commission with a view to reducing the number of
wells needing repairs in the Project Area. These will involve, among others, the
following:
(a) drilling of about 540 new production and water injection wells; and
(b) provision of equipment, materials, cement, chemicals and technical
services related to such wells.
Part C:   Enhanced Oil Recovery Pilots
The carrying out of three enhanced oil recovery field pilots as follows: two
thermal enhanced oil recovery pilots, the first based on the in situ combustion
technique, in the Lanwa heavy oil field, and one chemical flood enhanced oil
recovery pilot using polymers in the Jhalora oil field.
Part D:   Imorovement of the Field Operations
The improvement of the Commission's oil field operations in the Project Area
through establishment of training programs for oil field operations and the
introduction of new or appropriate technology, equipment and materials in
carrying out Parts A, B and C of the Project.
D.   Prolect Deficn and Orcanization
7.   The project was designed to achieve the objectives over a 6-year period by
providing the necessary acquisition of equipment, materials, technical services
and training required. The defined scope of work was left flexible to the extent
that the project could remain responsive to changing conditions and varying
results achieved during its progress. All variations to the original project
description were to be mutually agreed to by the Borrower or its implementing
agency (in this case the Western Region of ONGC) and the Bank.
8.   The Bank Project provided a loan of US$242.5 million to support project
costs estimated to be US$954.3 million including contingencies; amounting to
25.4% of the total estimated cost and 48.9% of the foreign exchange component.
Export credits of US$245 million and ONGC internal sources of US$ 466.8 million
were allocated to cover the balance. While the Project Loan was provided to the
1/In January, 198B, Part A was amended to read as follows:
"Part A: ExDloration
The carrying out of a program to extend the search for petroleum into the
portion of the Project Area covered by the Gulf of Cambay and its shores and
the deeper horizons (3,000 to 5,000 meters depth) in the Project Area through:
(i) seismic surveys with a coverage of about 5,200 line km in the Gulf of
Cambay and its shores; and
(ii) drilling in the Project Area of about four onshore and four offshore
exploration/appraisal wells of 3,000 to 5,000 meters depth each,
including provision of related technical well services, equipment and
materials."

Government of India, the funds were on lent to the Western Region of ONGC, the
Implementing Agency.
E. Proiect Im=lementation
9. The Loan, 2403-IN was approved on March 29, 1984, signed on May 25, 1984,
and became effective August 31, 1984. The project was originally scheduled to
be completed on September 30, 1990. Despite the fact that project implementation
lagged significantly at the outset, approximately 95% of the original program was
completed by the original closing date.  Due to cost savings and in spite of
cancellation of US$29 million on April 7, 1988, the project scope was enlarged
to include four additional exploratory wells in the offshore Gulf of Cambay in
order to evaluate prospects defined by project-supported seismic surveys.
Lengthy procurement delays in obtaining satisfactory drilling equipment for this
particularly hostile operating environment resulted in postponement of the
project closing date to October 31, 1992.
10. Other changes in the project scope during the implementation period included
the addition of 1440 km of seismic survey in the Gulf of Cambay, the addition of
302 development wells, the addition of approximately 830 workover operations, and
the cancellation of the training component.
11. Procurement problems were recurrent throughout project implementation and
were largely responsible for early delays in implementation and the need for two
one-year postponements of the closing date. The principal procurement problems
fall into three categories:
(a) "Indigenization"--While a worthwhile effort to promote domestic
suppliers and contractors, in practice it often went beyond Bank
guidelines and good business practice, i.e. price preference to
domestic suppliers of imported goods with little or no domestic value
added; and award to domestic contractors without necessary equipment
requiring inordinate time to acquire equipment (principally foreign)
within their bid price, requiring waiver or extension of mobilization
periods;
(b) When a contractor (principally domestic) failed to perform (mobilize
within specified or extended period), entering into lengthy price
negotiations with second lowest qualified bidder; and
(c) Persistence in using two-envelope procedures when tendered supplies
are uncomplicated.
Project implementation, particularly that performed by contractors lagged up to
3 years behind schedule  due mainly  to procurement  problems.    While  the
procurement process, at the request of the Bank, was decentralized from ONGC
headquarters in Dehra Dun to the Western Region management at Baroda, all
tendering decisions were subject to more than 5 different layers of review. As
a result, approvals were delayed due to cumbersome procedures.  These layers
consisted of committees, of which the two highest in hierarchy, convened twice
a month in Delhi. The Delhi committees had no accountability for the project and
their members were not directly associated with the project.  Utilization of
these committees reflected the Government's strong desire to control the
procurement activity.   Any member of the two highest committees can ask and
obtain a further review of the recommendation.   The Petroleum Ministry often
appointed new committees to review the evaluations and often returned the
evaluations back down the approval chain to the project level for a new start.
These interventions usually involved "indigenization". There were also frequent
complaints from bidders, which required resolution. The long delay in securing
the drilling rig for the Gulf of Cambay exploratory well program was also an
"indigenization" problem further complicated by the tender for a turnkey
contract, highly inappropriate in a difficult and untested environment.
Procurement of material, while involving many problems concerning applicability
of domestic preference required constant Bank surveillance but did not result in
major delays.
12. Project costs proved to be substantially below appraisal estimates. Bank-
supported project components were estimated at appraisal to cost US$684.4



4
million, excluding contingencies (which were not used in this project). Even
with significant program additions, i.e. 1440 line km of offshore seismic in the
Gulf of Cambay, 4 exploratory wells in the Gulf of Cambay, 302 development wells,
and over 800 workover jobs, the actual final cost of the Cambay Basin Petroleum
Project was US$341.6 million (excluding US$0.6 million initial commitment fee).
Several factors were involved in the original overestimate of costs.   These
included changes in work program, Rupee devaluation and excessive cost estimates.
The program changes occurred because procurement delays resulted in more
development and workover operations being done with ONGC equipment and less by
higher cost contractors. These savings were offset by delayed implementation and
deferred income.   Since some 72% of project costs was in Rupees  (versus 43%
estimated at appraisal), the 67% devaluation of the Rupee over the project life
caused a significant cost reduction. Nevertheless appraisal cost estimates for
the project were unduly high.   There were extenuating circumstances for the
margin of error in appraisal estimates. These were made in 1983 during a period
of rapidly escalating oil prices and associated prices for material and services.
Prior to significant project implementation, these prices dipped sharply in
concert with a major break in oil prices in 1986. With the 1988 cancellation,
the Bank loan accounted for 62.4* of the project investment, far above that
intended at appraisal.   Suppliers credits,  estimated to be about US$245.0
million, were not utilized by ONGC.
13. The schedule of disbursement for Loan 2403-IN is shown on Table 3 Part III
comparing actual disbursements to that predicted at the time of appraisal. As
can be seen, disbursements got off to a slow start primarily due to delays in
procurement and use of ONGC material stocks, later replaced, and quickly fell
about one year behind appraisal estimates. The lag in procurement continued to
grow both as a result of continuing procurement delays as well as over estimated
program costs. By the original closing date, September 30, 1990, about 62% of
the loan had been disbursed,  excluding late program additions.   The final
disbursement was made on January 1, 1994 some four months after the closing of
the loan.
14. The original and revised allocations and actual costs for Loan 2403-IN are
shown in Table 5 Part III.
F.   Prolect Results
15. Overall, the project met its principal objectives regarding exploration,
field development,  workovers,  and Enhanced Oil Recovery  (EOR)  Pilots.   The
proposed training component was deleted by ONGC with the Bank's reluctant
concurrence.
16. The physical results of the project were significant and can be briefly
described as follows: (See Table 6B Part III)
(a) Exploration Seismic Survey--The 3190 line-km seismic survey , the
first survey to have been conducted in the hostile environment of the
shallow offshore Gulf of Cambay (Diurnal tides of 7 to 10 meters),
identified nine drillable prospects and determined the western
offshore limits of the developing Gandhar Field, an areally large
stratigraphic trap.
(b)  Exploration Drilling--Eight deep exploratory wells were drilled, four
onshore and four offshore.   While none of these was completed as a
producer, three discoveries were made. One onshore well provided a
significant northeast extension to the Gandhar productive belt. Later
a twin well was drilled at this location and completed as a commercial
producer. Two offshore wells tested substantial quantities of oil and
may develop into commercially viable fields in the future. All the
wells were designed to evaluate the less well explored deeper section
of the Cambay Basin.   The discoveries were made in the shallower,
previously productive section while the results of the tests of the
deeper section were not encouraging thus seriously downgrading the
potential of deep prospects.



5
(c)  Development Drilling Light Oil Fields--The project supported the
drilling of 444 wells in light oil fields; Kalol, Sobhasan, N. Kadi,
S. Kadi, Nagawam, Jotana, Jalhora, and Sanand. These wells resulted
in an incremental production of 1.43 million tons per year in 1989/90;
produced 8.68 million tons of oil during the project life and are
expected to have about 4,87 million tons remaining to be produced post
project prior to abandonment. Average lifetime production per well is
30,520 tons (220,000 bbls). In addition, this component is expected
to yield 5480 million cubic meters of natural gas, 2540 million cubic
meters during the project and 2940 million cubic meters post project
prior to abandonment.
(d)  Development Drilling Heavy Oil Fields--The project supported the
drilling of 398 wells in heavy oil fields; Balol, Lanwa, Santhal, and
Bechraji.   These wells resulted in an incremental production of
830,000 tons per year in 1991/92; produced 3.87 million barrels during
the project  life and estimated to have about 4.43 million tons
remaining post  project  prior  to abandonment.    Average  lifetime
production per well is 20,850 tons of oil (137,000 bbls) . Very little
gas is produced in association with the heavy oil.   The heavy oil
production is likely to be extended by enhanced oil recovery (EOR)
requiring a new investment program. {See part (f) of this para.}
(e) Well Workovers--Remedial work on existing wells was also supported by
the project. Some 1177 remedial jobs were undertaken, an average of
235 per year during the period 1987/88 - 1992/93.   The incremental
production from this investment reached 708,000 tons per year in
1992/93; produced an increment of 3.2 million tons during the project
life and is expected to yield an additional 1.6 million tons post
project. The gas increment from workovers is included with the light
oil (see part (c) this para.).
(f)  Enhanced Oil Recovery (BOR) Pilot Projects--Six EOR pilot projects
were  supported by the Loan.    These were  Jhalora  Field polymer
injection (included in SAR), Lanwa heavy oil field in-situ combustion
(included in SAR), Kalol Field CO2 injection (added), Sanand Field
caustic injection (added), Ankleshwar Field polymer injection (added),
and Balol heavy oil field in-situ combustion  (added) .  A seventh,
Lanwa Field steam pilot (included in the SAR) had not been undertaken
by the closing date.  The Kalol and Ankleshwar pilots failed.   The
Jhalora and Sanand pilots, after initial difficulties, are still
underway with evaluation incomplete.   The Lanwa combustion pilot
appears to have positive results and testing continues.   The Balol
combustion pilot, after overcoming a hazardous H2S problem, is deemed
commercial and is being systematically expanded toward field-wide
application.
(g)  Technical Assistance and Training--Some thirty-eight consultancy jobs
were awarded under the Loan involving production engineering and
workover and EOR pilots. Although substantial funds were allocated to
training, ONGC Western Region received practically no training during
the project implementation, due mainly to intervention by ONGC
headquarters.   Despite the fact that two years were necessary to
finalize a global training contract, it was turned down at the final
approval stage on the grounds that ONGC's central training department
could provide equivalent training.   While judgmental,  this latter
assumption is questionable. The planned training would have greatly
enhanced ONGC's Western Region operation performance, not just during
the period of the project implementation, but into the future as well.
This decision was taken in spite of Bank staff recommendations but was
reluctantly accepted.
(h)  S-nary--Tangible physical results accounted for a peak oil production
increment of 2.54 million tons in 1989/90 and a peak gas production
increment of 510 million cubic meters in 1992/93.   Total project
supported oil production is expected to amount to 26.7 million tons
and 5.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas over its productive life.
Intangible benefits include a possible future development of oil and
gas associated with the three discovery wells (37.5% success rate) and



6
the 20-30 million tons of heavy oil that may result from successful
in-situ combustion.
17.  The economic performance of the project is highly satisfactory.   The
development component of the project had a net positive cash flow within the
first year making a rate of return calculation inappropriate. Net cash flow of
US$2231 million is anticipated for the project through 1999. This is based on
international oil and fuel oil equivalent gas prices. The Borrower, ONGC, using
domestic oil and gas prices, is expected to realize a 379% financial rate of
return from the project. (See Part III)
18. Both the economic and financial rates of return for the Cambay Basin
Petroleum Project exceeded those anticipated at appraisal by a significant
amount. These figures resulted in spite of 43% reduction in international oil and
equivalent gas prices during the project and forecast into the future.   The
reasons for this are three: (i) lower than estimated project costs; (ii) the
increased physical program; and (iii) improved results in terms of production
increment added per development or workover well and in particular, the rapid
production increase in the early life of the project. Due to the dynamism of
this project, it is possible that all costs at the outset of the project were not
captured, which may have affected the return calculations.
G.   Project Sustainabilitv
19. As noted above, production from development and well workovers achieved
during the Project should impact on production at least through 2010. The less
tangible results from the exploration component, i.e. seismic surveys in the Gulf
of Cambay, exploratory drilling both onshore and offshore, and the pilot EOR
components, particularly heavy oil in-situ combustion, are expected to positively
impact Cambay Basin development far into the future. Geophysical and geological
data which have been acquired under the project will be useful well into the
future for ongoing exploration and development drilling as well as promotion of
acreage to international oil companies. Certain procedures introduced during
project implementation with respect to well casing and completion programs,
workover methodology, and artificial lift are also expected to have lasting
effects on Cambay Basin development.
H.   Bank Performance
20. Throughout the implementation of the Cambay Basin Petroleum Project, the
Bank made a positive contribution to the successful outcome. These included:
(a) Meaningful and well-received advice on the physical components of the
project, i.e. drilling, casing, and testing programs for exploratory
and development wells and workovers;
(b) Resolving the many thorny procurement issues, in particular those
involving "indigenization"; and
(c) Providing flexibility in redirecting loan components in line with
ongoing project results. In the matter of flexibility, the following
adjustments to the original program were made:
(i) the Cambay gas field rehabilitation and development was
deleted at the suggestion of ONGC after obtaining poor results at
the outset of the project;
(ii) the training component was eliminated due to ONGC's desire
to incorporate the component in commission-wide program (the Bank
objected but acquiesced to this.);
(iii) the Lanwa EOR steam pilot was deferred post project
although still expected to be implemented (Bank encouraged
earlier implementation);
(iv) the offshore Gulf of Cambay seismic survey was expanded by
1440 line km as a result of the excellent results obtained in the
first 1750 km program;



7
(v) the addition of four offshore exploratory wells in the Gulf
of Cambay to evaluate the potential structures indicated by the
seismic surveys;
(vi) the addition of the Kalol Field CO2 pilot and the Sanand
Field caustic pilot and the Balol Field in-situ pilot as EOR
activities;
(vii) the addition of 302 development wells, 197 in light oil
fields and 111 in heavy oil fields, which essentially completed
development of the undeveloped reserves existing at the beginning
of the project; and
(viii) the expansion of workover operations from 345 jobs to 1177
jobs (note that WO operations provide the highest return on
investment of all development activities).
21. The only addition recommended by the Bank which did not materialize wis the
extension of the seismic survey into the southern portion of the Gulf of 'ambay
tieing data to the Bombay offshore Region. Although ONGC and the Bank had agreed
to an extension of the seismic program in the Gulf of Cambay, and indeed a
contractor had been chosen and negotiations were underway, the seismic work was
temporarily deferred and negotiations were terminated. ONGC later decided to
cancel the program and leave the work to be done by foreign oil companies, as
part of ONGC's promotional activity, who were expected to enter into production
sharing agreements with GOI which would include seismic acquisition work as well
as drilling. This was acceptable to the Bank.
22. The principal lesson to be learned by the Bank is to improve project cost
estimates at the time of appraisal. While the Cambay Basin Petroleum Project was
appraised during a period of rapidly escalating petroleum prices and
commensurately escalating material and contract services costs, a more rigorous
estimate of costs, considering deflationary as well as inflationary factors,
should have been made. The major impacts of over-estimation of costs was that
more work was accomplished although the Bank financed a higher proportion of
project investment than was intended.
I.   Borrower Performance
23. The Borrower, ONGC, complied with all Loan Covenants (Table 7 Part III) and
with a few exceptions, performed very well in bringing the Cambay Basin Petroleum
Project to a successful conclusion. The few exceptions relate to Borrower-caused
procurement delays, the elimination of the training component, the rejection of
additional agreed upon seismic surveys, and the long delay in implementing of the
Lanwa Field steam EOR pilot.
24. As mentioned above in Para 11, procurement was consistently a major cause
of delay in project implementation and in less-than-optimum Bank-ONGC relations.
To improve its procurement activity, ONGC requires external specialized
assistance to:
(a) carry out: (i) a thorough assessment of the problems that impaired the
procurement activity and contract administration practices of not only
the Cambay Project, but other Bank financed projects as well; and (ii)
a review of existing procurement laws, regulations and procedures at
the Government level particularly the application of domestic
preference;
(b) develop suitable standard tender documents, including sector-specific
special conditions, regulations, advertizing and shortlisting
practices, bid evaluations and contract award approval procedures, and
manuals to support the reform measures;
(c) review existing structures and procedures used by ONGC and GOI for
tender review and approval with the objective of revising and
shortening the process; and



8
(d) initiate the process of procurement reform, including training of
personnel in the application of the standard tender documents and
procedures.
J.   Proiect Relationship
25. On balance, the Bank relationship with GOI and the Borrower, ONGC, was quite
good throughout the project. The frank and open discussions which took place
resulted in satisfactory solutions in spite of differences in viewpoints which
occurred from time to time, aiding in greater understanding between the parties.
This should assist in any future petroleum lending in India by the Bank.
K.   Consulting Services
26. Consulting services were utilized sparingly in the execution of the project.
While 38 consultancy jobs were utilized in the Cambay Basin Petroleum Project,
only two were of significance. Scientific Software Inc. (SSI-USA) was used for
development and workover design and evaluation and Rompetrol (Romania) for design
of in-situ combustion EOR. Both consultants performed satisfactorily.
L.   Environmental Considerations
27. During the course of the project, all normal precautions were taken to avoid
spills and other possible contaminations of the environment.   In offshore
operations, wells were abandoned according to recognized petroleum industry
standards using cement plugs below the sea bed and cutting the casing at or near
the sea bed.   In the case of workovers,  the intention was to upgrade the
condition of the wells, not only to increase the production, but also to reduce
the environmental threat which would arise from leaking well heads and poor
cement down the hole. During the conduct of the offshore seismic program, the
work was undertaken in an environmentally benign fashion using state-of-the-art
non-explosive techniques.
28. Shortly after startup of the Balol in-situ combustion pilot, an excess of
H,S was produced creating a potentially serious environmental hazard.   This
problem was addressed by reducing the compressed air input and effectively
reducing the temperature in the reservoir, after which the H,S content of the
produced gas declined dramatically without affecting the rate of oil production.
M.   Project Documentation and Data
29. The Loan Agreement 2403-IN was quite adequate for the project framework and
provided the flexibility required to meet the several objectives of the project.
ONGC provided periodic status reports and accounts which, with normal Bank
supervision reports, were sufficient to monitor the progress of the project and
provide most of the basis for this Project Completion Report. Documents in the
Central Files appear to be deficient regarding project correspondence. Due in
part to the significant Rupee devaluation during the course of the project and
the strong reliance on local contractors ("indigenization") the foreign
exchange/local currency costs by year were not readily captured.   Thus the
foreign vs local expenditure relationships had to be estimated for the PCR.

PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
This is an edited version of the Borrower,s submission of Part II. The original
is available in the Project Files.
30.  Adequacy of factual information contained in Part III of the PCR.  The
project costs and physical results were provided by ONGC for the purpose of
preparing Part II are factual up to March 31, 1993 with estimated data
thereafter.
31. Bank's Performance. The suggestions and guidance received from Bank staff
during the project implementation , were helpful in the successful completion of
the project and full utilization of the revised loan of US$213.5 million. All
project components were completed except for the Cambay gas field development and
rehabilitation and for the training of personnel which was clubbed with the
overall training program of ONGC.
32. The other reasons for slow loan utilization were:
(a) Slump in international well material costs, charter hire rates for
deep drilling rigs and overall drilling costs;
(b) Non-utilization of contingencies which were made anticipating rising
costs which in fact, fell sharply;
(c) Reduction in the cost of seismic surveys since the work could be
carried out using the streamer mode as against the Teleseis mode
envisaged at appraisal which would have required more time and cost.
(d) The delay in finalizing the Gulf of Cambay drilling contract in a most
hostile operational environment, was caused by inability of lowest
bidder to perform and time required for second lowest bidder to accept
the contract;
(e) The purchase approvals from the Bank were delayed for indigenous
bidders in cases of services and material due to problems affecting
the domestic price preference.
33.  Borrower Performance.  The Cambay Basin Petroleum Project was the first
project of its kind affecting the Western Region of ONGC. Close monitoring and
interim review of both the physical and financial aspects were made in order to
take corrective actions in time.  A number of alterations were made.  It was
observed in December, 1987 that the loan utilization would fall short. Therefore
the amount of US$29 million was canceled in 1988 leaving a balance of US$213.5
million.
34. The Bank made several observations during their supervision missions. These
included:
(a) The need to develop an overall workover policy which resulted in
increasing the fleet of workover rigs from 50 (including 11 charter
hire) to 62 (including 23 charter hire) by the close of the project;
the increase being attributed to charter hire only. Artificial lift
programs should be tailored to specific needs and workover plans are
based on consultation with reservoir engineers for the repair of
individual wells;
(b) The shortcomings of using poor quality drilling mud and well
cementation procedures were pointed out by the Bank staff.  ONGC's
Western Region called on ONGC's Institute of Drilling Technology (IDT)
to assist in improving the quality of drilling fluids and primary
cementation;
(c) That ONGC should review its targets of meterage rate yardsticks in
light of quality of work.   ONGC has attempted to achieve world
standards of both hole conditions and penetration rates;
(d) The development of the Kalol field and the Balol/Lanwa heavy oil
fields was delayed due to retendering and subsequent mobilization of
charter hire rigs;
(e) Retendering of bids, particularly those made by domestic suppliers,
was somewhat common due to : (i) rejection of initial bids on



10
technical grounds; (ii) rejection of bids on commercial grounds, i.e.
late submission or lack of bid bond; (iii) foreign exchange crunch
applicable to domestic bidders when imported goods or services were
involved; (iv) slow clarification of bid conditions by generally
inexperienced bidders; and (v) slow mobilization and/or delivery of
equipment, material, and services.
35. Borrower/Bank Relationship. The Bank introduced a project concept which was
somewhat  new  to the ONGC Western  Region.    Progress  reports  and  records
maintenance were kept to the satisfaction of the Bank and to the benefit of ONGC.
All Bank mission visits were successful.  There was a meaningful exchange of
ideas  and  suggestions;  many  of  which  were  implemented.    Most  problems,
particularly regarding procurement were cleared by Bank missions on-the-spot
after detailed discussions with ONGC management.
36. Co-finance. No cofinancing was involved in this project.

NOTES
1.  All values are in constant 1983/84 US S.  All prices and indices in calenoar years were adjusted to correlate with the Indian fiscal
year from April 1 to March 31.
2. Capital Costs result from Bank staff estimates of the breakdown of foreign and local costs in US S based on data from ONGC. which
they usea for their econamic analysis   Foreign costs were aeflated to constant US S based on the unit value index in dollar terms of
manufactures exported from the G-5 countries (France. Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States). known as the MIJ Index.
Local costs were deflated based  the Indian wholesale Drice index. supplied by the Country Programs Division.  Local costs were also
adjustea by the standard coversion factor (SCF) of 0 8 usea to equate domestic ana foreign values of  gooos and services..
3 Operating Costs are based on ONGC's reporting of acutual past operating costs and their projections for the future.    They were
deflated by the Indian WPI to arrive at a value in constant prices: converted to US S using the excnange rates in Table 1: and made
conaraDle to foreign values by applying the SCF of 0.8 .
4 Revenues are based on the incremental oil and gas production attributable to the proJect at constant international prices of the
units produced.  Both actual and orojected  internationai oil prices are based on FOB prices per barrel of crude oil quoted in various
issues of the Bank's Primary Comimooty Price Forecasts.    The price in barrels was converted to tonnes using the conversion factor of
7.0 barrels per tonne.  ine landed cost to tne reTinery in India was based on a constant figure of USS 12 per tonne for transport.  Gas
rices are expressed in the equivalent price of fuel oil which would be required in the absence of the increxental gas production. The
basis for the fuel oil equivalent price was the international price landed used for crude oil adjusted to reflect actual and proJected
values for fuel oil as shown in Table 2. Fuel oil equivalent prices in tonnes were converted to cubic meters using the converslon
factor of .936 tonnes of fuel oil per thousand cubic meters.
