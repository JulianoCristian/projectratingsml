                         The Project continues to make important progress with implementation and is likely to achieve its development objectives, but more evaluation is needed to link the activities to actual
                         impact on health outcomes:

                         (i) The National Master Plan (NMP) for Health Workforce and Health Infrastructure, developed and approved by the Ministry of Health (MoH) in January 2009, is now implemented in

                         the entire country;
                         (ii) A health sector strategic plan for 2011-2015 has been developed and approved by the MoH. The technical basis for piloting new financing mechanisms has been launched with (a)
                         data collection on patients; and (b) development of Diagnosis-Related Groups (or new payment mechanism for hospitals) model for the country;
                         (iii) Construction. Two new hospitals have been constructed and equipped and construction of 8 Primary Health Care (PHC) facilities and 4 village hospitals are underway;
                         (iv) Health Human Resources Strengthening. The national standards for the allocation of human resources based on the population size have been adopted by Ministerial Order.
                         Certification of medical staff has been introduced. Training in public health, clinical and managerial capacity, drug procurement, pharmaco-vigilance, rational drug use, health
                         statistics, information systems, health financing, human resources and laboratory practice have been conducted for medical staff in the pilot areas and surrounding districts, as well
                         as for MOH staff. Two key policy documents/strategies (i) Development of under-graduate medical education; and (ii) Development of Post-Graduate medical education, have been
                         prepared and endorsed by MoH and all stakeholders. Concrete steps have already been taken in terms of changing teaching methods, examinations, and restructuring the faculties
                         of the under-graduate medical education program, including the launching of the residency program in post-graduate medical education.

                         However, due to the complexities in measuring the indicators, which have been recognized as being very ambitious, it is difficult to demonstrate the impact of the above successful
                         implementation on actual health outcomes and the project overall development objective achievement. In the case of a follow-up operation, the DO and indicators will be restructured
                         and the activities realigned.
