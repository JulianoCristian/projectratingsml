1.     Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.       The Health Sector Reform Project was approved on June 29, 2006. The Financing
Agreement was signed on October 9, 2006 and it became effective on December 20, 2006.
The Project was the second health-supported project by the International Development
Association (IDA) for the country. The first project was the Health Reform Learning and
Innovation Loan (HR LIL, 2001). In addition: (i) the Second Institution Building Technical
Assistance Project (IBTA-2, 2002) financed a survey on household health expenditures, and
(ii) the Poverty Reduction Support Credit Program (2005) complemented and supported the
health sector reform agenda through its policy agenda, which included program budgeting,
medium-term expenditure framework, and expenditure tracking in the health sector.

1.1    Context at Appraisal

2.       The healthcare system in Azerbaijan remained largely unreformed and continued
to function according to the old Soviet centralized norms both in terms of financing and
allocation of human and physical resources. Some limited attempts were made to enhance
the primary health care (PHC) level, but this had not gone beyond a few pilot initiatives
spearheaded by the Bank and other development partners. The main issues with the system
related to: (i) excessive but collapsing infrastructure; (ii) outdated or missing equipment; and
(iii) inadequate mix and distribution of skilled and competent staff, particularly with regard
to providing comprehensive and continuous care with an array of services. In theory, the
country had a very high bed-to-population ratio (7.7 per 1,000 population), second only to
the Russian Federation (9.5 beds) in the Former Soviet Union (FSU), and almost twice as the
EU average of 4.1 beds. In practice, however, the real complement was much smaller. Yet,
the average admission and occupancy rates were low, 4.7 and 25.6 percent, respectively.
Meanwhile the average length of stay (ALOS) was high (15.3 days) by EU standards (EU
average admission rate: 18.1 percent; occupancy rate: 77.9 percent and ALOS: 7.1 days).

3.      Health status was poor and deteriorating, as evidenced by a dramatic six year
decline in Life-Expectancy at birth, between 1990 and 2002, from an average of 70.9 to 65.1
years, one of the lowest in the region and 13 years lower than the EU average. This decline
represented the highest downtrend in the world, excluding countries of Sub-Saharan Africa,
which lost up to three times as many years due to HIV/AIDS. If this trend was to continue it
was foreseen that Azerbaijan was unlikely to meet the health-related Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs). Despite concerns with the reliability, validity and the limited
comparability of pre- and post-independence administrative data, there was evidence that the
main reasons behind this decline was high infant and under-five mortality rates (IMR: 81 and
U5MRE:92 per 1,000 live births, both 16 times the EU average) and high maternal mortality
ratio (MMR: 94/100,000 live births, ten times the EU average). The main causes of mortality
and morbidity in infants and children were respiratory diseases and diarrhea while causes of
maternal deaths were acute post-partum hemorrhage and post-abortion complications.

4.    Azerbaijan had and still has the double burden of communicable and non-
communicable diseases (NCDs). The decline in life expectancy related to the persisting high
premature adult mortality, which accounted for 68 percent of all deaths compared with the



                                             1
EU average of 51 percent. The main causes of morbidity and mortality included non
communicable diseases (NCDs), accidents, injuries and poisoning as well as the re-emerging
communicable diseases (CDs), including sexually transmitted infections (STIs), tuberculosis
and HIV/AIDS which also posed a considerable threat to the health of the population.

5.      Most determinants of health were and continue to be related to behavior, lifestyle
and environment. Patterns of, and trends in, mortality and morbidity are entrenched in
several determinants of health, which are responsible for the deteriorating health outcomes.
Prevalent unhealthy lifestyle choices include tobacco use, alcohol abuse, a high-fat diet, lack
of physical activity, a relatively low intake of fruits and vegetables, and drug addiction. The
consequences include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes, all of which
contribute to high circulatory diseases morbidity accounting for 57 percent of adult mortality.
Lifestyle determinants were compounded by socio-economic factors, including urban/rural
and poor/rich disparities, as well as by environmental factors (inadequate water quality and
sanitation). Survey data suggested that IMR and U5MR were three times higher in poor
households and 50 percent higher in rural areas. The same was true for diarrhea incidence
among children from poor households, with 60 percent more children suffering from diarrhea
in rural than urban areas. This correlated with the fact that only 55 percent of the population
in poor and rural areas had access to safe drinking water.

6.      However, the lack of equitable access to appropriate and quality care was and still
is an equally important determinant of poor health outcomes. The health care system has
been persistently ineffective in delivering affordable, quality services equally accessible to all
segments of the population. In fact, Azerbaijan was behind most post- transition countries
not only in health status, but also in terms of the inadequacy of the health care system to meet
needs and respond to epidemiologic and demographic challenges. For example, only half of
the population utilized health services when experiencing illness, indicating that people either
could not, or will not pay for what is often perceived as poor-quality healthcare. According
to the 2002 Household Budget Survey (HBS), one in three households responded that they
could not use health services because of their inability to pay.

7.      The health system was and remains severely under-funded, and its resources were
poorly pooled and inequitably allocated. Despite attempts to increase the health budget,
public resources invested in health represented about 20 percent of total health expenditures,
with the remaining 80 percent being out-of-pocket (OOP). With governmental health
spending being roughly 1 percent of GDP for 2005 – as compared with an average of 4
percent for the countries of Europe and Central Asia (ECA) – and a mandate to provide
practically all health care services for free, there was a general agreement that the health care
system was in need of additional public funds, as well as a revision of the package of health
care services funded by general tax revenues. In per capita terms, public expenditures on
health were about US$20, or about six times less than the average for ECA (about US$130).
This led to OOP expenditures of about US$96 per capita, quite a high figure in a country
where about 30 percent of the population lived below the poverty line.

8.      The governance structure of the sector was at odds with the macroeconomic and
sectoral realities in the country. The Ministry of Health (MOH) was responsible for the



                                              2
sector albeit with little clout over major policy decisions, which were the competence of the
President, the Cabinet of Ministers and its advisory units. MOH’s role and capacity to
govern the system, make policies, set standards, regulate and control overall quality and
gather the intelligence needed to monitor public health was limited. MOH did not have a
unit tasked with policy-making, nor did it have departments for monitoring and evaluation
(M&E), human resources or long-term planning. The system was plagued by the absence of
an active purchaser of services, weak representation of providers and consumers, and
fragmentation of health investment and budget decisions. MOH controlled only about 25
percent of public health expenditures, covering its central administration and the republic
hospitals. The remaining of the public funds were the responsibility of the Ministry of
Finance (MOF), responsible for allocating funds to district health facilities, and of the
Ministry of Economic Development (MOED) in charge of budgeting for capital investment
in the sector. As a result, the system suffered from the following shortcomings: (i) a legal,
organization and regulatory platform that was not conducive to effective system stewardship;
(ii) fragmented accountability for technical, administrative and financial matters leading to
inefficient allocation of human and financial resources; (iii) excessive hospital and
specialized care facilities, albeit mostly in a dire need for renovation, refurbishment and
upgrading because of lack of capital investment and maintenance; (iv) poorly funded and
managed, and highly fragmented, PHC services, obsolete diagnostic and laboratory
equipment and shortage of supplies; (v) a de-motivated health workforce that relied on
informal payments to cope with low wages and a practice environment devoid of incentives
to provide appropriate care; and (vi) major inequalities in health and healthcare outcomes as
a result of low public outlays, coupled with increasingly high levels of OOP payment.

1.2       Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

9.      The objective of the Project was to improve overall health system stewardship and
financing, and enhance equitable access to, and technical and perceived quality of essential
health care services, in the selected districts in a fiscally responsible and sustainable manner
with a view to improving health outcomes.

10.     The wording of the PDO was the same in the main text of the Project Appraisal
Document (PAD), Annex 3 of the PAD, the Financing Agreement, and the Minutes of
Negotiations. The achievement of the PDO was to be measured by the following performance
indicators corresponding to seven main areas supported by the Project.

         Financial sustainability:
              o Public expenditures on health gradually increased to a sustainable level that
                 would ensure full coverage of the population with the basic package of
                 services.
         System governance:
              o A white Paper for Health is adopted
              o A long-term health sector investment plan is prepared as a result of a nation-
                 wide mapping of facilities and the subsequent rationalization plan.




                                             3
         Equity (applicable to pilot districts only):
              o Household OOP expenditures for health as a proportion of total expenditures
                  decreased as a result of free access to essential package of health care
                  services.
         Access (applicable to pilot districts only:
              o Proportion of sick people seeking health care increased.
              o Satisfaction of the community with overall access to care increased.
         Quality (applicable to pilot districts only:
              o Perceived quality of care of the services covered by the Basic Benefit
                  Package (BBP) by the community increased.
         Efficiency (applicable to pilot districts only):
              o Budget allocations to districts is made on the basis of demographic and
                  morbidity criteria.
         Health outcomes1 (applicable to pilot districts only):
              o Infant mortality rate
              o Under-five mortality rate
              o Maternal mortality rate (MMR)
              o Under-weight prevalence rate in children less than 5 years of age
              o Adult age and cause-specific mortality rates
              o Self-reported health status

1.3       Revised PDO

11.       The PDO was not revised.

1.4       Main Beneficiaries

12.      Direct beneficiaries of the project investments were to be the communities
benefiting from the construction/refurbishments of hospitals/PHC facilities. Poor people
were to benefit more from PHC interventions, including construction of PHC facilities,
training of health staff, and equipment. Physicians, nurses, laboratory technicians, hospital
managers, and the faculty of the Medical University are professional groups who were to
benefit from the Project through training and retraining. Longer-term benefits were expected
to the whole society from the implementation of the master plan. In addition, district and
village hospitals, PHC facilities, and training centers to be constructed/refurbished by the
Project were to benefit from investments. These facilities were to benefit from improved
infrastructure, strengthened clinical capacity, improved regulatory environment, and
institutional capacity for better governance and optimization.          Also, MOH, local
governments, the Drug Analytical and Expertise Center, the Innovation and Supply Center
were to benefit from improved institutional and clinical capacities.

  It was recognized that it was unlikely to expect any significant reduction in MMR during the course of the Project,
but these were to be monitored to establish trends and for future comparison with other districts.

1.5    Original Components

13.    The Project supported the following five components:

14.     Component A – Building MOH Capacity for Stewardship (US$8.13 million or 9
percent of total project costs) supported: (i) capacity building of MOH in policy making,
planning and regulation; (ii) training of MOH staff; and (iii) upgrading MOH’s technological
and physical infrastructure. The component financed five sub-components to: (i) develop a
health policy framework, and review and reorganize MOH functional and administrative
structures, including establishing a Health Policy and Planning Unit (HPPU); (ii) develop a
national drug policy and strengthen the capacity of MOH Pharmaceuticals and Medical
Devices Unit to develop and monitor the effective management of this policy, develop the
necessary legislative and regulatory framework, as well as procedures and tools for rational
drug use; (iii) support the development of an accreditation and licensing scheme for public
and private health facilities and set-up a mechanism for quality control and assurance of
health care services; (iv) strengthen the health information system; and (v) improve MOH
technical/information dissemination capacity for dealing effectively with emerging diseases.

15.     Component B – Improving Delivery of Health Care Services (US$73.55 million or
85 percent of total project costs). The component supported four sub-components aiming to
improve the appropriateness, quality and technical and allocative efficiency of health care
services in five pilot districts -- Apsheron, Agdash, Ismaili, Sheki and Gakh by: (i)
upgrading/renovating/constructing PHC facilities at the sub-district level and construction of
three district hospitals in Agdash, Ismaili and Sheki; (ii) strengthening managerial and
clinical skills of health care workers; (iii) introducing new planning and management
methods and tools; and (iv) improving coordination and strengthening system hierarchy
between the primary and secondary levels of health care. This involved an improved referral
system within each district to reduce the number of referrals to Baku. The component was
also to take stock of the pilot experience under the HR LIL Project and finance baseline, mid-
term and final evaluations to assess the impact of investments under the component.

16.     Component C – Ensuring Sustainable Health Financing and Resource Allocation
(US$1.83 million or 2 percent of total project costs). It supported health financing reform to
gradually introduce universal risk protection against OOP expenditures and move towards
insurance principles through improved revenue mobilization, pooling and allocation of sector
resources, and purchasing of services. It supported two sub-components: (i) strengthening
planning, implementation and monitoring mechanisms for effective formulation of a health
care financing policy; and (ii) establishment of a health fund to act as a single pool for health
sector funds and a single payer/purchaser of health care services.

17.     Component D – Human Resources (HR) Development (US$1.32 million or 2
percent of total project costs). It had two sub-components: (i) developing a labor adjustment
policy, including provisions for a more dynamic retirement and compensation policy and a
detailed strategy/plan for the sector; and (ii) reviewing reform initiatives for under-graduate
medical education, specialty training and post-graduate training programs to improve the
quality of education. Support was also provided to develop clinical guidelines/protocols,



                                             5
improvements in the education programs, strengthening the medical faculty to develop new
curriculum for under-graduate education and post-graduate training of physicians, nurses and
other PHC staff. The component also supported the development of a certification program
for medical personnel and the strengthening of Physicians’ Associations in the country.

18.    Component E – Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$1.93
million or 2 percent of total project costs). The component was to ensure effective
administration and implementation of the Project by supporting the operations of a Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) in the MOH responsible for day-to-day implementation,
coordinating with relevant stakeholders and donors, procurement, financial management,
disbursements, coordination of training activities, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E).

1.6       Revised Components

19.       The components were not revised.

1.7       Other significant changes

20.    There were two amendments to the Financing Agreement both related to the
extension of the Closing date for a cumulative extension of 12 months.

         The first amendment, letter of October 23, 2012 extended the Closing Date by six
          months from December 31, 2012 to June 30, 2013. It allowed for: (i) completion of
          construction of two PHC facilities in Sheki and Gakh regions; (ii) completion of
          renovation of the premises of sanitary epidemiology centers; (iii) wider-scale
          introduction and application of information technologies; (iv) further development of
          medical education; and (v) additional training for medical staff.
         The second amendment, letter of June 29, 2013 extended the Closing Date by six
          months from June 30, 2013 to December 31, 2013. The extension was necessary to:
          (i) implement necessary corrections to village hospitals in the Sheki and Gakh
          districts, including ensuring proper ventilation, adding rails to stairways, and
          installing adequate heating systems, (ii) finalize the installation of waste water
          management facilities for the Sheki and Agdash hospitals; and (iii) finalize the
          completion of the two PHC facilities in Sheki and Gakh districts. The second
          extension required a Waiver to Bank Operational Procedures (OP) 10.00 from the
          Bank’s Managing Director given that financing agreements are typically not extended
          when projects’ development objectives are not deemed to be achievable.

2.        Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1       Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

21.     This evaluation rates Design and Quality at Entry as Moderately Satisfactory. This
rating reflects the formulation of an overly ambitious and difficult to measure PDO, and of a
complex Results Framework, which often lacked baseline figures, limiting the ability to




                                              6
properly assess and attribute project outcomes. All other elements for preparation were
Satisfactory, as discussed in the following paragraphs.

22.     Soundness of background analysis. The background analysis conducted during
preparation was Satisfactory. Preparation was supported by a Policy and Human Resource
Development (PHRD) Grant of US$580,000 of which US$186,893 were cancelled. The
Grant assisted GoA to develop design, including architectural blue prints for the hospitals, a
GPS study to measure distances between facilities, and the Environmental Management Plan
(EMP). Project design benefited from the findings of a Health Sector Review (HSR)
conducted by the Bank (Report No. 31468-AZ of June 20, 2005). The HSR addressed the
burden of ill-health, its distribution and trends, adequacy of the healthcare system in meeting
the unmet needs and in responding to the epidemiologic and demographic challenges, and
provided a set of options for reforming the system. It examined the issues affecting the
sector and presented a set of options for reforming the system, ranging from changes in the
margin to a full-blown systemic reform, albeit phased in sequentially. The HSR provided
recommendations on the ways the sector should be organized, i.e. main functions, including:
(i) stewardship; (ii) financing arrangements; (iii) organization and delivery structure; (iv)
human resources; and (v) pharmaceuticals. The design also benefited from extensive
analytical work on health financing and expenditures under the Bank-financed Institutional
Building Technical Assistance Project and health financing papers produced by USAID.

23.     Project design addressed several key lessons from the design and implementation of
health project in the ECA region, as well as those derived from the HR LIL. Key lessons
of the LIL were: (i) political commitment and ownership, a sine qua non for buy-in,
collaboration and accountability for results, which excluded MOH from the direct
implementation of PHC activities in the field; (ii) accurate sector diagnosis made possible
through the commissioning of high quality studies on health financing, expenditures and
pharmaceuticals; (iii) involvement of both providers and communities in the process of
rationalization of facilities and staffing, which helped build consensus at the district level,
although not implemented because of lack of MOH commitment and ownership; (iv)
flexibility in view of the rapid political and economic transition during implementation such
as foregoing the introduction of revolving drug funds which were no longer needed due to
wide-spread availability of pharmaceuticals in the market; (v) value added of investment in
PHC; and (vi) a built-in rigorous M&E scheme to measure Project accomplishments.

24.      Quality Enhancement Review (QER). The QER of February 17, 2006 concluded
that: (i) recent events (appointment of a new Minister of Health) provided a new window of
opportunity for the Bank to become seriously engaged in the sector in a way that was not
feasible in the past; (ii) poor health outcomes, especial IMR and MMR and the absence of
reforms since independence made the health sector a priority for new investments; (iii) the
Bank’s experience in systemic reform in neighboring countries increased its potential value-
added; (iv) the impressive progress in project preparation over the past two months suggested
a level of high commitment and ownership; (v) the task team’s clear sense of priorities and
the analytical work underway suggested that it should be possible to deliver a project of
acceptable technical quality before the end of the fiscal year (to enable the country to benefit
from its final IDA allocation); and (vi) acknowledgement that a number of critical analyses



                                             7
will not be completed by the proposed approval date – June 2006 – and that both MOH and
the new established PIU lacked experience and capacity to manage an operation ten times the
size of its predecessor. The QER recommendations were for the most part introduced in the
design of the Project and addressed in the PAD.

25.      Assessment of project design. The Project design was based on a highly consultative
preparation process. The Bank team visited Azerbaijan frequently to engage a wide range of
counterparts at the central and district level to ensure that the scope and content of the Project
was well understood and accepted. The team engaged actively in discussions, including
through policy seminars, with highest level of government, including the Prime Minister,
Minister of Finance and Governor of the Central Bank. The consultative process included
visits to selected districts and consultations during national and district level seminars with
the participation of other development partners. In fact, WHO and USAID participated in
Bank’s missions and USAID financed the costs of workshops and seminars.
Notwithstanding the strong elements of project design, the content of the Results Framework
had some problems, discussed in more detail in Section 2.3.

26.    A number of options were considered during preparation, including: (i) more
limited involvement (only capital investments and no policy reforms); (ii) a policy based
operation or sector-wide approach; (iii) Adaptable Program Lending; and (iv) a more
comprehensive investment with nation-wide coverage.

27.     The objective of the Project was relevant and consistent with development priorities
of both the Government and the Bank, but its formulation was overly complex and
ambitious relative to the scale and scope of the project. Dealing with the key issues
affecting the performance of the sector was central to the goals of the GoA and the Bank.
The State Program on Poverty Reduction and Sustainable Development (SPPRED)
developed prior to Project processing focused on the need to improve the quality of, and
equity in access to health, central goal of the Project. Similarly, the FY03-05 2 Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS, Report No. 25790-AZ) approved on April 29, 2003 underlined the
importance of improving the quality, efficiency and coverage of health services. Reforming
healthcare also featured prominently in the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) approved in
September 2006. The Project was approved earlier in the CPS preparation cycle than
originally planned to take advantage of the new commitment given to healthcare reform by
the GoA. At the same time, PDO achievement partly depended on the formulation and
approval of specific policy reforms, such as the one on Health financing, which are normally
beyond the scope and scale of an investment lending operation.

28.    Risk Assessment. The PAD identified five risks, whose rating ranked from Modest to
High. The fifth risk – potential lack of inter-ministerial coordination was rated Substantial
and proved to be a strong constraint to moving forward with the reform agenda for health




2
    The Project was prepared during the time frame of the FY03-05 CAS, thereby its relevance in this paragraph.




                                                           8
financing, including lack of operationalization of the Health Insurance Agency.             The
mitigation measured identified for this risk proved to be unworkable.

2.2    Implementation

29.     The ICR team rates implementation as Moderately Satisfactory. The Project was
successful in delivering most of the outputs and achieving for the most part its expected
outcomes (see details in Section 3.2, Annex 2, and the data sheet). Project implementation
performance was mixed. Two components were implemented well such as Component A –
Building MOH Capacity for Stewardship and Component D – Human Resources
Development. Part of Component B, i.e. B.1 – Strengthening District and National Level
Health System, and B.2 – Strengthening PHC Services were also implemented fairly
successfully, with the exception of the number of PHC facilities constructed (8 instead of 30
planned) because of low cost estimates at project appraisal together with substantial cost
inflation. While B.3 – Upgrading Impatient Care Services was well executed, it was not fully
realized for the same reasons as for the PHC facilities (4 instead of 14 village hospitals and 2
instead of 3 district hospitals). Although, several important activities were completed under
Component C -- Ensuring Sustainable Health Financing, the health financing reforms stalled
pending political decisions regarding the placement of the Health Insurance Agency.

30.     Project Management was rated Satisfactory (S) for most of its life span, but was
downgraded to Moderately Satisfactory (MS) when constraints were identified. The ratings
fluctuated between S and MS for Implementation Progress and Progress towards achieving
of PDO for most of the implementation period. The rating for PDO was downgraded to
Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU) during the last six months of implementation as it was
judged that the PDO could not be achieved. The rating was also linked to a decision by the
Government not to proceed with the Additional Financing (AF) as had been agreed with the
Bank, which would have provided an opportunity to restructure the Project’s Results
Framework among others. Similarly, Financial Management and Procurement were rated S
for most of its implementation period while there were some periods when one or the other
was rated MS.

Positive factors and events that influenced project achievements

31.     The Project has helped to strengthen MOH’s stewardship by: (i) developing
capacities to formulate and implement health policies; (ii) developing the Health
Management Information System (HMIS); (iii) improving M&E capacity; (iv) strengthening
pharmaceutical policy and management; (v) strengthening quality assurance and
accreditation of health facilities; and (vi) improving response capacity for emerging diseases.

32.     The Project has assisted in improving delivery and efficiency of health care services
through the: (i) construction of health facilities in the participating regions following
development of the master plan; (ii) development of investment plans for
rehabilitation/construction and equipping of PHC and other health facilities; (iii) training and
retraining of health staff; (iv) strengthening of the medical education system; and (v)
strengthening of district management capacity through in-country training and study tours.



                                             9
33.     Hospital rationalization has been effective. The importance of the implementation
of the master plan, especially the decision of GoA to implement rationalization plans nation-
wide, cannot be under-estimated. In the international context of how difficult such reforms
are, its successful implementation nation-wide becomes even more notable. By 2010 the
plans had been implemented in 65 districts resulting in reduction from 444 to 214 secondary
care facilities and increase from 543 to 782 PHC facilities.

Less effective factors and events which influenced Project’s achievement

34.     The Project has been less successful in supporting financial sustainability and
equity. Despite a substantial increase in health public spending (from 168.9 million mantas
in 2006 to 609.4 million mantas in 2012), by international comparisons it remains low. Total
spending on health is about 6 percent of GDP, which is close to the regional average, but the
public share is far lower than the comparators. As a result, there is a high reliance on OOPs3.

35.     Although the Project supported preparation of various policy documents covering
the legislative framework in the context of the health financing reforms, the Health
Financing Component has not been fully implemented. The policy documents included a
paper on the status of health financing and recommendation for reforms. Legislation was
drafted for new provider payment mechanisms in the hospital sector. Based on the Hospital
Patient Discharge Form AZ#66, the Project collected and analyzed data in 31 hospitals to
calculate diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) for Azerbaijan. Alongside the data collection, the
Project supported the preparation of cost estimates for different DRGs. While the technical
basis for piloting new financing mechanisms, including budget allocations, has been
established, the system has not been piloted, due to stalling of the health financing reforms.

36.      GoA formally requested the Bank on May 12, 2011 to provide AF to scale-up the
activities initiated by the Project and to finance remaining activities that could not be
finished under the Project due to cost-overruns. The AF also meant to improve availability
and quality of health services in other districts. The AF was to support: (i) upgrading of
health infrastructure by reconstructing 17 new PHC and 4 village hospitals in ten additional
districts; (ii) health system stewardship; (iii) health care management; (iv) the HMIS; (v)
training for PHC physicians and nurses across the country beyond the selected pilot districts,
including training abroad and in-country for narrow specialists and managers in selected
hospitals; (vi) technical assistance to expand reforms in the under- and post-graduate medical
education and certification of health professionals; and (vii) the ongoing health finance
reforms. The AF also intended to simplify the PDO and streamline the Results Framework.

37.    There were delays in reaching agreement with the Government on how to proceed
with the AF. A Project Paper for the AF was prepared in June 2012 and appraised in August
2012, with negotiations planned for October 2012. However, GoA chose not to go ahead


3
 A survey (EBRD Life in transition Survey, 2010) showed that the prevalence of informal payments for health in
Azerbaijan is the highest among 30 ECA countries, and, after Georgia, is the highest in the ECA region.

with the AF and instead requested an extension of the Credit closing date initially for six
months until June 2013 and later for an additional six months, i.e. to December 31, 2013.

2.3    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

38.    Design, implementation, and utilization of M&E are rated Moderately
Unsatisfactory for reasons elaborated below.

39.      Design. The Results Framework in the PAD included 9 PDO indicators and 26
Intermediate Outcome Indicators. This evaluation finds that PDO 4 indicator (see datasheet)
was too ambitious and difficult to achieve over the life span of the Project. In addition, the
number of intermediate indicators was excessive (26) and some were repetitive (indicators 17
and 22), with different wording for monitoring the same type of information. Also, no
baseline data were defined at Project approval for the majority of indicators. As per the
PAD, USAID was to finance the design and field-testing in one district of the health
utilization and health facilities survey. This survey was to provide baseline data for the
indicators. It is not clear if this happened, but the baseline data were not recorded in ISRs.

40.     Implementation. The PIU was responsible for collecting and reporting on the
monitoring indicators. To assess the health system performance, the Project developed a
comprehensive M&E framework. With support from the PIU, MOH prepared two Health
System Performance Assessment Reports covering the results of 2009 and 2011. The Project
supported a nation-wide survey (2011) to identify the risk factors of NCDs. On the basis of
the data collected and analyzed, a national strategy for NCDs was prepared. That said, while
information on some indicators was issued by the PIU and reported in Aide Memoires,
perhaps because of the attempt to make changes to the results framework during the MTR
and AF preparation, several indicators were not measured or not reported in ISRs nor was the
baseline data recorded. The qualitative studies and the ex-post evaluation surveys that were
to be conducted prior to the completion of the Project did not materialize. The datasheet in
this ICR comprises all PDO and intermediate indicators as agreed at negotiations. Since
several indicators were not measured/reported in ISRs, this evaluation reviewed a number of
reports and held discussions with MOH and other relevant agencies/research/education
centers to obtain/validate information presented in this report.

41.     Utilization. M&E has become an important learning tool. It has been strengthened
significantly with the development and piloting of the HMIS at the hospital level and it is
being rolled out nation-wide. Staff has completed a number of system developments,
including introduction of the Hospital Patient Discharge Form AZ#66.

2.4    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

42.    This was a Category B project, which triggered Safeguard Policy OP/BP 4.01 –
Environmental Assessment. Safeguards implementation is rated Moderately Satisfactory.
An environmental analysis conducted during preparation identified potential adverse impacts.
They were found to be restricted in scope and severity. They were associated with
construction and rehabilitation of health facilities and included excessive dust and noise,



                                           11
generation of construction and domestic wastes, and collection and disposal of medical
wastes. As a result of the EMP, measures were introduced to mitigate the risks in the design,
planning, and supervision of the construction as well as during the operation of the facilities.
During implementation, facility-specific EMPs were prepared as part of the design of each
hospital. Mitigation measures identified in the EMPs were incorporated in the terms of
reference (TOR) for detailed design and construction supervision. However, at the time of
the preparation of the AF, it was found that due to insufficient in-house environmental
expertise within the PIU, the environmental compliance of the original Project activities had
not been properly monitored. To address the shortcoming, the PIU prepared and
implemented a time- bound action plan with installation of on-site waste water treatment
facilities for the hospitals, measures for proper collection and disposal of waste from health
facilities, and training on medical waste management for staff of the facilities. These
measures were implemented thanks to the second credit extension. This was the first project
to focus on issues of waste water management. It led to the development of a Waste Water
and Sanitation Plan, which was implemented in all facilities under the Project. All health
facilities to be constructed in future, regardless of source of finance, will include such plans.

43.      The Project did not have significant or irreversible negative environmental impacts
during the construction phase of the facilities. Environmental impacts during the
construction phase were typical for all small to medium scale rehabilitation/construction
activities and were limited to the Project sites. Project sites were state-owned land plots with
user rights already granted to the medical institutions operating on those plots.

44.    Financial Management (FM) is rated Satisfactory. The FM arrangements at the
PIU, including accounting, reporting, budgeting and planning, internal controls, funds flow
and staffing, were considered to be strong and were rated Satisfactory throughout
implementation with one exception when the rating was downgraded to MS (November
2009). External audits were prepared and issued on a timely manner and have consistently
been unqualified. The 2013 external audit was finalized and sent to the Bank in mid-March
2014. Disbursements under the Project proceeded generally as planned. As of May 2, 20144,
US$51.56 million equivalent have been disbursed from the Credit. Withdrawal applications
were prepared regularly and supporting documentation was complete.

45.     Procurement is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Procurement was rated Satisfactory
for most of the Project’s implementation period. Some procurement issues arose during the
last year when the rating was downgraded to MS, rating which was maintained up to the
closing date. The Procurement Plan was updated as required. Procurement under the Project
included: (i) civil works; (ii) medical and office equipment; (iii) furniture; (v) medical
supplies; and (vi) consulting services.

2.5       Post-completion Operation/Next Phase


4
  The original SDR amount of SDR 34.3 million was equivalent to US$50 million at the time of Credit approval. The
availability of more US dollars reflects the appreciation of SDR currencies against the US dollar. Total Credit proceeds at
the time of this ICR (May 2014) were equivalent to US$53.22 million.




                                                          12
46.   Although discussions are ongoing, no agreement has been reached yet with the
Government for a new Bank-supported operation in the health sector.

3.        Assessment of Outcomes

3.1       Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

47.    While the relevance of objectives, design and implementation are rated as
Substantial, the relevance of implementation arrangements for the health financing
reforms is rated as Modest. This evaluation finds that the Project was relevant and
consistent with development priorities of both the Government and the Bank (see paragraph
27). However, given the slow advancement of health financing reforms, the project should
have been restructured to maintain its relevance several attempts to restructure were
undertaken but failed to come to closure.

3.2       Achievement of Project Development Objectives

48.     This evaluation rates achievement of the PDO as Modest. This evaluation is based
on the achievement of the PDO indicators and on the analysis of the accomplishment of
intermediate indicators (Table 1). Despite the high number of achievements and outputs as
listed below, some of the core achievements were not reached, such as the number of health
centers rehabilitates and the health financing reforms. In addition, the missed restructuring of
the PDO and realignment of the results framework during the life of the project contributed
to an overall difficulty in attributing some of the outcomes to the project, and to adequately
measure improvements in some of the indicators, given the lack of several baselines.

                                 Table 1 – Status of Progress Against Project Indicators
Status                    9 PDO Indicators      % of total PDO         26 Intermediate                 % of total PDO

Not Achieved                            2                       22%                        1                     4%
Total                                   9                      100%                       26                    100%


49.    The evaluation was also based on analysis of how Project activities were linked to
achievement of the PDO. Table 2 illustrates these linkages for each of the two PDOs.
Achievement of the PDO is further addressed in the subsequent paragraphs.

                                            Table 2 – Achievement of PDO Indicators
1. Public expenditures on health gradually increased     ACHIEVED. Public health spending increased           PDO 2
to a sustainable level that would ensure full coverage   from 168.9 million mantas in 2006 to 604.9 million
of the population with the basic package of services     mantas in 2012 or 2.3% of non-oil GDP. However
                                                         it remains low in international comparisons.
2. A White Paper on health is adopted                    ACHIEVED. White Paper was adopted in 2008.           PDO 1
3. A long-term health sector investment plan is          OVER ACHIEVED. Long-term sector                      PDO 1
prepared as a result of a nation-wide mapping of         investment plan was prepared and approved
facilities and the subsequent rationalization plan
4. Household out-of-pocket expenditures for health       NOT ACHIEVED. Health financing reform has            PDO 1

                                                              13
decreased as a result of free access to essential
package of health care services.
5. Proportion of sick people seeking healthcare           ACHIEVED. Although no survey was                            PDO 2
increased                                                 undertaken, information/data gathered and
                                                          analyzed for the M&E of the national master plan
                                                          confirms an increase.
6. Satisfaction of the community with overall access      ACHIEVED. 20% increase in mean value.                       PDO 2
to care increased
7. Perceived quality of care of the services covered      NOT ACHIEVED. The BBP was developed, but                    PDO 2
by the BBP by the community increased                     not adopted as health financing reforms have
                                                          stalled.

8. Budget allocations to districts is made on the basis   PARTIALLY ACHIEVED. The master plan                         PDO 1
of demographic and morbidity criteria                     included demographic indicators for the design of
                                                          PHC services. The technical basis for piloting new
                                                          financing mechanisms, including budget
                                                          allocations has been determined, but not
                                                          implemented as the financial reform has stalled.
9. IMR, under-five MR, MMR, underweight                   ACHIEVED. Official and international data show              PDO 2
prevalence rate in children (<5y). Adult age and          that IM, MM, and under 5 have decreased over the
cause-specific mortality rates. Self-reported health      life span of the Project, however it is not possible
status                                                    to attribute this to the project. As stated earlier, this
                                                          objective was too ambitious.

50.     PDO 1 – Improve overall health system stewardship and financing. The Project
was successful in helping to strengthen MOH’s stewardship by developing capacities to
formulate and implement health policies and by developing the HMIS, thus improving M&E
capacity, including the successful introduction of the Hospital Patient Discharge form (Form
66). A White Paper on health was developed and adopted; a policy unit was established at
MOH; a restructuring Master Plan was developed and implemented (paragraphs 33 and 56);
and background studies to support future drug policy reform were conducted and policies
prepared (paragraph 51). A number of HR policies in the area of medical education and
certification were adopted and implemented (paragraph 55). Information technology
activities, including system development and training, were implemented. As a result, MOH
has a tool and data with which to assess the performance of the country’s health system on a
regular basis. Form 66 also allows the government to monitor trends and compare efficiency
and quality among facilities and districts. Form 66 has been used to develop a hospital
payment system which is ready for implementation and can contribute to improved efficiency
of the hospital system. The HMIS was strengthened with the introduction of Form 66. Using
this form, a data-base with 100,000 discharged cases was established and has been used to
determine costs of services and to allocate departmental budgets. It served as the basis for
the development of a DRG-based hospital payments mechanism, which is ready to be
piloted. Together, these developments have resulted in a much improved information
system, including policy development and monitoring capacity at the higher management
levels, and quality of medical education. All these are drivers of improved quality of
services and health outcomes in the long-term.

51.    The Project has been successful in supporting MOH in its health system
stewardship capacity. It supported, inter alia: (i) development of the Health Strategy for the
period 2007-12 and later updated to cover up to 2015; (ii) development of a health system
performance framework and, based on the M&E framework, two Health System
Performance Assessments; (iii) upgrading the legal and regulatory framework of MOH; (iv)
upgrading pharmaceutical policy and management through the development of a number of


                                                                14
strategic reforms – essential drug list, national drug policy and drug formulary; (v) MOH’s
improved response capacity for emerging diseases, including development of national
strategies for NCDs and CDs; (vi) development of a licensing system for health facilities; and
(vii) setting up mechanisms for quality control and assurance of services.

52.      The Project has been less successful in supporting health financing reforms.
Although important steps have been made during the past six years to prepare for financing
reforms, initiatives in this area have not proceeded as far as expected. Based on a
comprehensive review of the current legislation, regulatory documents necessary for
implementing future health financing reforms were drafted. A Policy Concept on Health
Financing Reform and Introduction of Compulsory Medical Insurance, which stated the main
goals for the health financing reforms, was developed. The Concept and an Action Plan for
its implementation were endorsed by the Cabinet of Ministers and the President in 2008.
This document was to serve as a roadmap for the reforms. However, as discussed earlier, the
Health Insurance Agency has not become operational and, as a result, few actions have
materialized as they depend on the agency being in place. Finally, training for medical and
administrative staff on different aspects of health care financing was conducted. Much of
these preparatory efforts, however, will be outdated and some of them lost, such as the
institutional capacity that was established.

53.     PDO 2 – enhance equitable access to, and technical and perceived quality of
essential healthcare services, in the selected districts in a fiscally responsible and
sustainable manner with a view to improving health outcomes. The Project was successful
in improving access and delivery of health care services through, inter alia, the construction
of health facilities in the participating districts, the training and retraining of health staff, the
development and implementation of clinical protocols and guidelines, and the strengthening
of the medical education system. As discussed in Annex 3, in terms of fiscally responsible
and sustainable manner, the operation and maintenance costs of the facilities
constructed/refurbished under the Project are not significantly high when compared with the
public expenditures of the health sector in the country. Therefore, the recurrent cost impacts
of the Project are not significant.

54.      Following the Master Plan, rationalization resulted in a reduction of the number of
beds by about 56 percent. The importance of the master plan, especially the decision of the
government to implement rationalization plans nation-wide, cannot be under-estimated (see
also paragraph 33). The Project supported improvements in quality of care through, inter
alia: (i) development of 40 guidelines and clinical protocols in the areas of neonatal care and
resuscitation, antenatal care, and preventing bleeding in labor and the training of health
workers in the use of the protocols; (ii) development of standard operating procedures to
complement the laboratory manual on the 14 priority CDs; (iii) strengthening data collection
and assessments of NCDs risk factors as the basis for the preparation of a national strategy
for the prevention and control of NCDs; (iv) strengthening of PHC services through the
training and retraining of physicians and nurses in the FM approach, followed by training of
trainers for physicians and nurses in participating and neighboring districts; (v) provision of
health management training for hospitals managers and mid-level staff; (vi) improving the
quality of medical education; (vii) alignment of the medical education curricula to



                                               15
international standards; (viii) establishment of close linkages between theoretical training and
practical applications; and (ix) improvements of teaching methods in medical education.

55.      A policy document was prepared to support the improvement of undergraduate
medical education in the country, including a revision of the curricula. Recommendations
were provided on strengthening the curricula and implementation of an integrated curriculum
system at the Medical University under a long-term implementation plan. In parallel, the
Project provided technical support for the introduction of a residency program to develop and
improve post-graduate medical education. To that effect, state education standards for the
residency program were developed and a process to align the residency curricula to
international standards started. Curricula of 40 subjects in the residency program were
reviewed by Hacetepe University of Turkey to be aligned to international standards and were
approved and introduced at the Medical University. A new curriculum on health care
management was developed and introduced at the Medical University for the 2013 study
year. Based on this course, a Health Care Management Faculty is planned to open at the
Medical University. Moreover, the Project: (i) developed implementation mechanisms for
the certification process; (ii) developed the legislative documents regulating these processes;
(iii) identified exam questions for the certification of health professions; (iv) developed an
electronic portal for the Certification Commission; (v) designed training materials to improve
awareness among health professionals on certification; and (vi) provided technical assistance
to facilitate the operations of the Certification Committee.

56.     Implementation of the above-mentioned Master Plan has contributed to
rationalization of health infrastructure. Monitoring data show positive trends in utilization
of health care services at the facilities in general, and from skilled birth attendance in
particular. There are also signs of efficiency gains with a much higher bed occupancy rate
and an increased number of out-patient visits.

57.      Nonetheless, the Project has not entirely succeeded in achieving financial
sustainability and equity. Despite a substantial increase in public spending for health, by
international comparisons it remains low and there are no signs yet that the increase in public
expenditures has impacted the reduction of OOPs spending. Throughout the country, there
remains a high level of inequality in health care utilization. Richer households use health
facilities more often than the poor. Nonetheless, proportion of sick people throughout the
country seeking health care has increased slightly from 4 in 2006 to 4.3 patient visits to PHC
per capita in 2010 (PDO Indicator 5). Annual number of visits made to PHC facilities has
increased substantially in some Project-districts (see intermediate indicator 9). In general,
households spend a considerable proportion of their budgets, 10 percent on average, for
health care services. They face uncertainty of OOP payments and potentially high costs as
the majority of services have to be out of pocket. Publicly financed health worker salaries
are low and informal payments are often requested for services. The World Bank-EBRD
Life in Transition Survey of 2010 indicated that the prevalence of informal payments for
health in Azerbaijan is the highest among 30 other ECA countries and Western Europe and,
after Georgia, Azerbaijan has the highest level of OOPs in the region. The survey also
showed that the other large part of the high OOPs costs is due to high cost of drugs.

3.3    Efficiency

58.     Efficiency is rated Modest. Three types of economic/financial analysis were carried
out in the PAD. The first was a cost-benefit analysis for the Service Delivery Component
(Component B). The second was a qualitative analysis that took into account all project
components and established the economic rationale behind the Project on the basis of: (i)
establishing a firm justification for public involvement; (ii) determining the counterfactual,
i.e. with and without the Project; and (iii) identifying the fiscal impact of the Project on
public funds. Although the PAD assigned the major share of estimated project benefits to the
Service Delivery Component, other components/subcomponents of the Project also yielded
large efficiency gains, leading to a reasonably balanced economic outcome across the
activities. Thanks to the Project, there was a strong performance with respect to: (i)
reduction in ALOS (from 15.1 in 2005 to 12.2 in 2011), thereby reducing productivity losses
associated with medical care; (ii) reduction of hospital beds (from 444 secondary facilities to
214 and concomitant reduction of beds by 56 percent); and (iii) increase in bed occupancy at
hospitals (from 25.6 in 2005 to 51.2 in 2011). In addition, thanks to the master plan, the
Project has contributed to the rationalization of the health infrastructure not only with the
decrease of hospitals, but a substantial increase in the number of PHC facilities from 543 to
782, yielding concomitant increases in utilization of primary care. The Project focus on
primary care addresses the growing burden of NCDs, which account for over 80 percent of
the overall burden of disease and cause of death in the country. There are also indications of
efficiency gains with an increased number of out-patient visits.

59.     The Project has had significant impact on health reforms in the country. In
particular, the Project records significant achievements in: (i) implementing PHC reforms
with emphasis on the family medicine model; (ii) rationalizing health infrastructure; (iii)
strengthening stewardship capacity of MOH to formulate and implement health policies; (iv)
improving MOH’s monitoring and evaluation capacity through the design and
implementation of the HMIS; (v) improving human resources policies in the areas of medical
education and certification of health professionals; (vi) upgrading the legal and regulatory
framework of MOH; (vii) upgrading pharmaceutical policy and management; (viii)
upgrading MOH’s response capacity for emerging diseases; and (ix) setting up mechanisms
for quality control and assurance of services. All these features are drivers of improved
quality of services and health outcomes, both during implementation and for the long-term.
This said, the Project was not as successful in implementing the health financing reforms as
the Health Insurance Agency did not become operational.

3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

60.     Notwithstanding the achievements under the Project discussed under Section 3.3, the
Project’s overall outcome is considered Moderately Unsatisfactory. This rating is consistent
with the rating in the last ISR of November 2013. While relevance is rated Substantial
(Section 3.1), both Efficacy and Efficiency are rated Modest. As far as Efficiency is
concerned, available data are not sufficient for the original economic analysis to be
reproduced (see also Section 3.2). Although it is clear that the Project achieved most of its
indicators and targets (Table 1), the failure to restructure the PDO and Results Framework as
well as the issues with the implementation of the health financing reforms (paragraphs 35 and


                                            17
52) led to Modest achievement for Efficacy. The formulation of the PDO, which was
considered ambitious, was to be addressed through a restructuring at the time of the AF,
when the PDO was to be simplified and the Results Framework streamlined. As discussed in
paragraph 37, the AF never materialized.

3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)    Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

61.     While the Project was not explicitly classified as a poverty-targeted operation, it has
had some positive impact on the poor of participating districts. The physical and system
improvements in the two district hospitals, the four village hospitals and the PHC facilities
constructed under the Project have improved access and the quality of care for of all socio-
economic groups, including the poor and women, especially in rural areas. During ICR
discussions, patients noted that with the new and improved health facilities, they did not have
to travel to Baku to access hospital services.

(b)    Institutional Change/Strengthening

62.     The Project had a significant impact on institutional development and building
long-term capacity in various areas. During ICR discussions, central and district authorities
recognized the important impacts that project investments in capacity building and
technology had on institutional development. The Project strengthened several institutions
(MOH, training centers, hospitals and PHC facilities, Medical University, Advance Medical
Training Institute) and supported development of the family medicine approach to improve
PHC. It also strengthened the legal framework for health care waste management, which is
highly praised by GoA. Staff highlighted the direct benefits of the Project in training and
retraining of doctors and nurses, enabling them to work as teams in the FM setting.
Physicians and nurses in participating hospitals and other health facilities acknowledged the
positive role the Project has played, not only in improving the physical infrastructure and
availability of medical equipment, but in promoting staff efficiency and productivity gains.

63.     Each of the components supported institutional strengthening in its respective area.
Component A - Building MOH Capacity for Stewardship supported TA and training for:
(i) development of a health system performance capacity; (ii) a nation-wide survey of risk
factors for NCDs; (iii) improving the reliability and frequency of data on health through the
electronic collection and analyses of data from inpatient facilities; (iv) developing a roadmap
for a Unified HIS for Azerbaijan, including standardization, collection and analysis of health
information; (vi) developing software for certification of health care professionals; (v)
strengthening the health information system (620 staff trained); (vii) strengthening
pharmaceuticals policy, including development of procedures and tools for rational drug use
(80 staff trained); (viii) improving quality assurance and accreditation of health facilities; (ix)
improving MOH response capacity for CDs and NCDs (35 staff trained).

64.     Component B – Improving Delivery of Health Care Services financed TA and
training for: (i) developing a master plan to rationalize health infrastructure and human
resources; (ii) strengthening the SanEpid system through surveillance and development of


                                              18
guidelines and clinical protocols; (iii) strengthening PHC services through the training of
physicians and nurses in the family medicine approach (240 physicians and 570 nurses
trained); (iv) upgrading impatient care services in the pilot districts through health
management training for hospital managers and middle-level health staff (244 hospital staff
trained); and (v) upgrading of skills of clinical specialists through local training and study
tours (250 medical staff trained, including 20 trained as trainers).

65.    Component C – Ensuring Sustainable Health Financing and Resource Allocation
supported TA and training for: (i) designing options for sustainable financing, including the
development of policy papers and legislation for implementation of new provider
mechanisms in the hospital sector (1,793 staff trained); (ii) developing a publicly-financed
basic benefit package (BBP); (iii) developing a concept policy on health financing reform
and introduction of compulsory medical insurance; and (iv) reviewing legislation and
developing regulatory documents for implementation of future health care financing reforms.

66.     Component D – Human Resources Development financed TA and training for: (i)
developing a strategy for reforms of under-graduate medical education and a strategy for
post-graduate training programs; (ii) developing a national strategy for Human Resources;
(iii) designing mechanisms for the implementation of a certification process of physicians
and nurses; (iv) developing software for the certification program; (v) developing guidelines
and clinical protocols; (vi) implementing the under-graduate strategy through extensive
training of the Medical University faculty (3,713 staff); (vii) introduction of the residency
program; and (viii) developing a strategy to strengthen health professional associations.

67.     Component E – Project Management and M&E has improved overall project
management and coordination through staff participation in training courses, on-the job
training provided by consultants and PIU participation in training courses in procurement and
financial management in and outside the country. Key PIU staff has been absorbed in
strategic departments of the MOH further contributing to health sector reforms led by MOH.

(c)    Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

68.    Close coordination and synergies with activities financed by WHO, UNICEF and
USAID has resulted in stronger outcomes for the sector. USAID has supported health
financing reforms’ efforts and has worked with MOH to help review and revise hospital
payment mechanisms. WHO has provided technical assistance for improving health policy
formulation, including development of the health strategy. WHO and UNICEF supported the
preparation of clinical guidelines and protocols.

3.6    Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

69.    Not applicable.




                                           19
4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

70.     The risk at the time of the ICR that development outcomes (or expected outcomes)
will not be maintained is rated Moderate. Reforms in medical education, family medicine,
and certification of health professionals have been important and are likely to be expanded.
Equally, improvements in the health information system are likely to be expanded as there is
commitment beyond MOH to create an integrated information system in the country.
However, caution should be exercised about the capacity of MOH to remain committed to
the reforms, especially considering the high level of staff turnover.

5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank Performance

(a)    Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

71.     This evaluation rates the Quality at Entry as Moderately Satisfactory. The Project
design was relevant to the objectives of the CAS and the Government’s strategy as described
in Section 1.1. The design benefitted from the analysis and recommendations of the Health
Sector Review. The Bank team applied the lessons drawn from implementation of the Bank-
supported HR LIL as well as other health projects in the region. The background analysis
was sound. The team considered a number of options during preparation, which were well
justified in the PAD. The Bank team ensured a participatory approach during Project
preparation and engaged both central and local counterparts, as well as other development
partners, in discussions to ensure that there was overall agreement in project design and
scope. This said, the M&E system for monitoring project implementation and assessing its
achievements was not adequate, including a lack of baseline data for most indicators. In
addition, as stated earlier, the PDO formulation and Results Framework were overly complex
and in part difficult to link to the project’s activities.

(b)    Quality of Supervision

72.     The ICR team rates the quality of supervision as Moderately Satisfactory. The
Team Leader (TL) responsible for processing the Project for approval continued as TL for
one and a half years after Credit effectiveness. The second TL guided implementation for
over three years, and the third TL saw the Project to the closing date (two years). Generally
there were two missions annually. At the beginning of Project implementation, the team
addressed in Aide Memoires progress with implementation of overall health sector reform, in
addition to reporting on progress with implementation of the Project. This is a good practice,
which helped ensure that the Project was closely linked to, and contributed to, the overall
sector performance. Unfortunately, this practice was not continued by other Project teams.

73.    The Project team developed strong relations with MOH and prepared a health sector
note and the health chapter of the Public Expenditure Review to help identify continuing
bottlenecks in sector’s performance and ways on how the Bank could expand collaboration
with the Government. The team’s focus on waste water management, led to the development
of a Waste Water and Sanitation Plan. MOH decided to apply it to all the facilities


                                           20
constructed under the Project and future construction of health facilities in the country.
Project implementation was monitored regularly by Bank staff during and between missions.
The skills mix was appropriate, with the exception of the lack of a health facility architect
during the planning and construction of the physical facilities. Such expertise was only
added to the Project team during the last six months of implementation and proved to be most
useful. One less optimal part of supervision was that Aide Memoires and ISRs did not focus
and/or reported on the complete set of indicators as per the Financing Agreement. They
reported on a limited number of indicators.

74.     Procurement and financial management was well managed throughout the life of the
Project. Management of safeguards policies was a particular focus of the Project team during
the last year and a half of project implementation, which helped identify and ensure that
measures were taken to rectify issues that were identified.

75.    From discussions during the ICR mission and a review of Aide Memoires and other
documents, it is evident that teams for the most part coordinated well with other development
partners, including WHO, UNICEF and USAID, to ensure optimal use of resources.

(c)         Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

76.    Overall Bank performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Although
implementation support frequency, quality, regularity and skills mix was good, it can be
argued that more should have been done to restructure the project. Two main attempts were
made with frequent follow up, however they did not materialize. The team could have
explored alternative, and more simple, restructuring possibilities.

5.2         Borrower Performance

(a)         Government Performance

77.    Government’s performance during project preparation and implementation is rated
Moderately Satisfactory. Prior to Project approval, GoA had developed key strategic
documents such as the Health Sector Policy Note. Also, the SPPRED focused on the need to
improve the quality and equity in access to health. In addition: (i) a draft Project
Implementation Plan was prepared by an inter-governmental working group; (ii) a draft
contribution for the ICR of the HR LIL was developed; (iii) background studies for a report
on pharmaceuticals were prepared; and (iv) the PIU within MOH was re-established5. GoA
engaged actively in discussions during project design at the highest possible levels. The
Prime Minister, Minister of Finance and Governor of the Central Bank engaged in these
discussions and helped reach agreement on its overall scope and content. Notwithstanding,
GoA’s political and institutional commitment to the health financing reform during
implementation as well as delays in processing the AF and ultimately GoA’s decision not to
negotiate its Financing Agreement were less than Satisfactory.


5
    The PIU for the HR LIL had been abolished by the previous Minister of Health.




                                                          21
(b)       Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

78.     MOH’s performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. In general, MOH’s
commitment to health reform has been strong since November 2005. MOH management was
effective in helping resolve complex issues arising during development and approval of the
master plan and coordinated well with other agencies participating in the Project, such as
hospital and other health facilities’ management, the Medical University, and district
authorities. The appointment of a former PIU staff as Head of Apparatus of MOH helped a
great deal to resolve difficult issues during implementation requiring the Ministry’s
intervention.     MOH’s commitment to the Project extended throughout Project
implementation. Its management and staff participated actively in the ICR discussions and
the Ministry prepared a solid contribution to the ICR (Annex 7).

79.     Overall coordination, as well as procurement, financial management, and M&E,
worked well. The PIU was successful in building and maintaining productive relationships at
all levels of the health system. It worked effectively to monitor and evaluate project
performance and facilitated the full participation of a number of institutions charged with
implementing various parts of the Project. As indicated earlier, project management and
coordination was assessed as fluctuating between S and MS during the life of the Project.

(c)       Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

80.     The reasons for the MS rating include: (i) overall commitment to the objectives of the
Project; (ii) adequate allocation of counterpart funds for civil works; (iii) compliance with
fiduciary and safeguards requirements; and (iv) effective administration and coordination of
project activities. However, as noted in paragraph 77, GoA’s political and institutional
commitment to the health financing reform during implementation was less than
Satisfactory.

6.        Lessons Learned

81.       Lessons learned can be categorized under the following headings:

Government ownership and capacity development

         Reforms to a sector such as health are costly and time consuming. The Project
          devoted resources to building the capacity of MOH to be a better steward of the
          sector. It also focused on building the capacity for health information and for the
          formulation and implementation of reforms and associated policies. The direct
          tangible benefits of the policies and of the training for improved efficiency and health
          outcomes will only become visible several years after Credit closing.
         Strong Government ownership is critical, particularly with reform-oriented
          projects. Reforms in the health sector not only concern technical health-related
          changes, but depend heavily on institutional capacity and the political process.
          Limited government ownership and commitment affected negatively the

          passing/adoption of policies and strategies such as the Essential Drug List, National
          Drug Policy, drug Formulary, Basic Benefit Package.
         Lack of strong leadership to ensure effective implementation of health financing
          reforms critically impacted the performance of the health financing component.
          Despite several policy papers, legislation and related documents to support these
          financing reforms, the Health Insurance Agency has not become operational.
         Consensus building among stakeholders is critical, not only during preparation but
          during implementation as it can affect the success and sustainability of any reform.
          The consensus needed to overcome the government impasse for the Health Insurance
          Agency to start functioning did not happen.
         Long-term engagement. Health sector reforms are complex and often take 6-10
          years. The Bank should adopt a longer-term approach in supporting such reforms.
          Unfortunately this was not the case in the country as the first HR LIL did not focus
          much on reforms and now, with the closing of this Credit, the momentum gained is
          likely to be lost.

Coordination

         Close coordination with development partners was critical. Close coordination and
          collaboration with USAID and WHO during preparation was exemplary. Both
          institutions provided technical expertise and USAID financed and participated in
          seminars and workshops. Close collaboration during implementation helped keep
          key activities on track and ensure complementarity of the interventions.

Implementation guidance by the Bank

         A focus on identifying problems and seeking solutions by the Bank-client team is
          important for achieving results.
         Both the Bank and the Government need to maintain appropriate expertise in all
          areas of the Project. While strong expertise was provided in most areas, Bank
          supervision was wanting until the last year of the Project, specifically in the provision
          of expertise in health facilities construction. The PIU, with no civil engineer or health
          facility architect to review required technical specifications and bid evaluations, and
          later to help supervise the construction, was unable to secure the quality of the
          designs. The fact that the Bank’s team did not include the expertise of a health
          facility architect during the design and construction phases exacerbated the situation.
         More flexibility and pro-activeness from the Bank to address implementation
          weaknesses should be considered. Bank procedures provide for exceptions to extend
          projects whose objectives may not be achievable. These exceptions can be lengthy
          and burdensome. However, when reputational risks call for remedial actions to be
          taken, as was the case in this project, more flexibility and positive incentives should
          be provided.

82.    Authorities contacted by the ICR mission commented positively on the role the
Project has played in helping to further develop the sector. During the ICR mission, the
Minister of Health commented positively about the achievements of the Project and the role
the Bank has played in assisting GoA in the development of the sector and expressed his
wish for future Bank cooperation in the sector. The MOH provided its contribution to this
ICR, including Annex 1. The Bank provided GoA the Azeri and English versions of the draft
ICR for comments on April 28, 2014. However, by the time of completion of this ICR,
comments had not been received despite several follow ups by the ICR team.

83.      The ICR team visited the 100-bed central district hospital in Aghdash District, the
Golgati Village Hospital, two PHC facilities in Aghdash and the Peri-natal Center. In
discussions with medical staff, they expressed their enthusiasm for the quality of the
facilities, including the equipment. Likewise, discussions with patients and family members
attested to their satisfaction with the improved services.

(c)    Other partners and stakeholders

85.     The ICR team held discussions with WHO and UNICEF, but could not meet with
USAID staff as USAID is no longer active in the sector. WHO’s and UNICEF’s comments
are reflected in this document to the extent possible.

  Actual expenditures represent only 50% of projected at appraisal as several activities were not undertaken because the
health financing reform stalled. Activities not undertaken include: (i) public expenditure reviews; (ii) development and
institutionalization of the National Health Accounts; (iii) pilot testing of provider payment mechanisms and population-
based allocation formula for district budgets (See also Annex 2). Some of the unused funds were diverted towards
activities under the Human Resource Development Component (see below).
7
  This Component was successful and in view of its progress, additional funding was provided for technical assistance
and training towards design of mechanisms for the implementation of a certification process of physicians and nurses
covering 95% of physicians and nurses. Also, additional funds than initially allocated were used to finance additional
training for the Medical University for the implementation of the undergraduate strategy.
8
  The Credit closing date was extended by 12 months, therefore increasing project management costs. The costs also
include additional consultancies and training financed under the Component.
9
   Total Project costs do not include parallel financing from USAID (US$8.0 million, WHO (US$0.04) million and
UNICEF (US$0.47 million). USAID is no longer involved in the sector and data on UNICEF and WHO’s parallel
financing was not available during the ICR mission.

Annex 3.       Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      The main text (Section 3.3) notes that the Project activities resulted in Modest
efficiency gains, particularly as a result of reductions in redundant hospital capacity and
related performance improvements. The activities undertaken as part of the major
component - Improving Delivery of Healthcare Services (Component B) represented a major
step in the progression away from the previous soviet service delivery model towards the
current European and international norm, with their emphasis on a strong PHC health care
model and a streamlined hospital sector. These reforms, which directly improve efficiency in
the use of physical and human resources in the health sector, were intended also to contribute
to the overall objective of better health outcomes.

2.       The cost-benefit analysis presented in the PAD only accounted for the costs and
benefits related to Component B. The total cost of the component, including contingencies,
was estimated at appraisal to be US$73.55 million, to be disbursed over 7 years. It included
the construction of three new hospitals, 30 PHC facilities and 14 village hospitals, together
with associated equipment and training. In addition, the component included technical
support for a mapping exercise and preparing a rationalization plan to cover existing health
facilities throughout the country. The benefit stream expected to derive from these
investments was based on several efficiency considerations tied to increased service delivery.

3.       The main benefits expected were decreases in unnecessary hospital stays due to
improved primary care in the selected districts, decreases in ALOS due to better equipped
hospital facilities, savings in travel costs to Baku through decreased referrals of rural
patients, , and a reduction in mortality rates due to improved service delivery. The PAD
noted that the cost-benefit analysis served more as an attempt to estimate the dimension of
the improvements in service delivery necessary to generate a positive NPV than as one of the
criteria for Project approval.

4.     The cost-benefit analysis for Component B estimated an IRR of 44 percent over a
horizon of 20 years as the base case scenario. It was estimated that the IRR would decrease
to 25 percent in the event the assumed benefits were reduced by 40 percent. When taking
into account the entire costs of the Project (US$78.24 million), instead of the costs of
Component B (US$63.35 million), the base case IRR was estimated to be 34 percent over a
horizon of 20 years and 21 percent over a horizon of 10 years. Assuming the benefits of the
supported interventions to be 40 percent lower, the IRR was expected to decrease to 20
percent over a horizon of 20 years and to 2 percent over a horizon of 10 years.

5.     The NPV of the Project was also estimated applying a 10 percent discount rate and
considering benefits and costs over 20 years as well as applying a 5 percent discount rate and
considering benefits and costs over 10 years. These NPV estimates respectively were
US$104.4 million and US$43.4 million. When assuming a reduction in benefits of 40
percent, the NPV over a horizon of 20 years was estimated at US$36.6 million and at minus
US$5.3 million over a horizon of 10 years.




                                           35
6.     The Efficiency Section in this ICR (Section 3.3) takes into account several areas
where the Project has had a positive impact on the efficiency of health services delivery. The
available data, however, are not sufficient for the original economic analysis to be
reproduced. New assumptions on benefits would have to be made for the analysis.

7.      It is difficult moreover to delineate the impact on the Category B benefits of
expenditures on Components A, C, D, and E, which comprise primarily technical assistance
and training activities. They were designed to benefit the country’s health sector as a whole
(65 districts) rather than focused on the five districts included in the Project.

8.       At this point we should refer to three major changes during implementation of the
Project, which have impacted on its economic viability. First, under Component B only two
of the three planned district hospitals were built, only eight of the planned 30 PHC facilities
were constructed, and only four of the planned 14 village hospitals were built. Besides these
facilities, the Project refurbished a Pre-natal center (as planned) and two training centers,
which had not been planned. The actual total cost of Component B turned out to be
US$65.35 million compared to US$61.45 million (net of contingencies) in the PAD. It
follows that the unit costs of constructing these Component B facilities were higher than
expected at appraisal. For example, each district hospital was projected to cost US$9.75
million but actually cost US$16.37 million (68 percent increase); each PHC was projected to
cost US$77,000 but actually cost US$412,000 (435 percent increase; and each village
hospital was projected to cost US$335,000 and actually cost US$1.2 million (258 percent
increase).

9.      If the economic benefits deriving from each facility were consistent with those
assumed in the PAD, the IRR of Component B would be clearly less than the base case 44
percent (over 20 years) estimated in the PAD. On the other hand, the Component generated
substantial efficiency gains that were not captured by the Project monitoring indicators, but
nonetheless were important drivers of improved quality of services and health outcomes. For
example: (i) ALOS were reduced from 15.1 in 2005 to 12.2 in 2011; (ii) and the number of
secondary hospitals were reduced from 444 to 214 resulting in a 56 percent reduction of
hospital beds; and (iii) bed occupancy increased from 25.6 percent in 2005 to 51.2 percent in
2011. These data suggest that Component B generated a satisfactory economic outcome, but
again, the actual data are not sufficiently consistent to enable reproduction of the original
economic analysis.

10.     Second, an important reason for the increase in the unit costs of facilities in
Component B were movements in the AZN/US$ exchange rate and domestic inflation,
caused by an oil boom and a huge expansion in budgetary spending amid a situation that has
been referred to as a modern case of the “Dutch disease”. According to the IMF Article IV
consultations for Azerbaijan, the exchange rate in 2005 when the project was appraised was
AZN0.945 = US$1. The AZN appreciated by 18 percent to 0.802 by when most of the
Project costs had been incurred. In terms of domestic inflation, the CPIs for the years 2005
to 2011 were 9.7, 8.4, 16.6, 20.8, 1.6, 5.7, and 7.9 percent, yielding an overall price increase
of 94 percent from 2004 to 2011. The impacts of these price movements on Project costs
were considerably greater than the 6 percent price contingency assumed at appraisal.



                                            36
11.      The third major change during implementation was the Government’s decision to
develop and implement rationalization plans (closing secondary health facilities and
increasing the number of PHC units) in the entire country rather than just in the five pilot
districts of the Project. This scaling-up became possible due to the mapping exercise and
preparation of the national rationalization plan financed by the Project. Just as important, the
breadth of technical and institutional support and training built into the Project enabled the
Government to accelerate district rationalization plans to effect the efficiencies described in
paragraph 9 above and Section 3.3. No funds from Component B for civil works or
equipment were expended in non-Project districts.

12.    Project outcomes suggest that due to the application of Components A, C, D, and E
(and some technical support included in Component B) to the health system of the entire
country, the economic impact of these interventions has been considerable.

13.     The Project is expected to yield reasonable returns over the next few years. The
operation and maintenance costs are not significantly high when compared with the public
expenditures of the health sector in the country. Therefore, the recurrent cost impacts of the
Project are not significant.

A.      Summary of Borrower’s ICR (Ministry of Health)

I.      PROJECT START UP and CONTEXT AT APPRAISAL

1.      The national health strategy paper of January 2006 created outstanding opportunities for the
national level project and the Bank’s involvement in the sector. The improved cooperation among
the government organizations and the Bank also contributed to the launch of the Project.

2.       Health status in Azerbaijan had been poor and deteriorating, as evidenced by a dramatic six
year decline in Life Expectancy at birth, between 1990 and 2002, from an average of 70.9 to 65.1
years, one of the lowest in the region and 13 years lower than the EU average. This decline
represented the highest downtrend in the world, excluding countries of Sub-Saharan Africa which
lost up to three times as many years during the same period due to HIV/AIDS.

3.       In this context, Azerbaijan was unlikely to meet the health-related MDGs. Despite concerns
with the reliability, validity and the limited comparability of pre- and post-independence
administrative data, there was evidence, backed up by survey data, that the main reasons behind this
decline were high infant and under-five mortality rates (IMR: 81 and U5MR: 92 per 1,000 live
births, both 16 times the EU average) and high maternal mortality ratio (MMR: 94/100,000 live
births, ten times the EU average). The causes led to these problems were all easily avertable by
effective interventions and could be largely prevented or effectively dealt with by a well-performing
healthcare system.

4.      Azerbaijan had the double burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases. The
decline in life expectancy was also due to the persisting high premature adult mortality, which
accounted for 68 percent of all deaths compared with the EU average of 51 percent. The main causes
of morbidity and mortality included NCDs, accidents, injuries and poisoning as well as the recently
(re)emerging communicable diseases, including STIs, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS, which also posed
a considerable threat to the health of the population. As a result, the probability of dying between the
ages 15 and 60 was 23.1 percent for Azeri males and 12.2 percent for females, twice as high, for both
sexes, as the EU average.

5.      Most determinants of health were related to behavior, lifestyle and environment. Patterns of,
and trends in, mortality and morbidity in Azerbaijan are, in fact, entrenched in several determinants of
health which were responsible for the deteriorating health outcomes.

6.       However, the lack of equitable access to appropriate and quality care was an equally
important determinant of poor health outcomes. The healthcare system in Azerbaijan had been
persistently ineffective in delivering affordable, quality services equally accessible to all segments of
the population. In fact, Azerbaijan lagged behind most post-transition countries not only in terms of
health status, but also in terms of the inadequacy of the existing healthcare system to meet healthcare
needs and respond to epidemiologic and demographic challenges. For example, only half of the
population utilized health services when experiencing an illness, indicating that people either could
not, or would not pay for what was often perceived as poor-quality healthcare. According to the 2002
Household Budget Survey, one in three households declared that they could not use health services
because of their inability to pay.




                                                42
7.       There was a general consensus that the healthcare system in Azerbaijan remains largely
unreformed, and continued to function according to the old Soviet centralized norms both in terms of
financing and allocation of human and physical resources. Some limited attempts had been made to
enhance the primary health care level in Azerbaijan, but that had not gone beyond a few pilot
initiatives spearheaded by the Bank and the donor community. The main reasons were: (i) excessive
but collapsing infrastructure; (ii) outdated or missing equipment; and (iii) inadequate mix and
distribution of skilled and competent staff, particularly with regard to providing comprehensive and
continuous care with an array of services, mainly preventive in nature, thereby limiting the high rate
of referrals to district and republican hospitals. Indeed, while in theory, Azerbaijan had a very high
bed-to-population ratio (7.7 per 1,000 population), almost twice as high as the EU average of 4.1
beds. Yet, the average admission and occupancy rates were low, 4.7 and 25.6 percent, respectively.
Meanwhile the ALOS was high (15.3 days) by EU standards (EU averages being 18.1 percent, 77.9
percent and 7.1 days, respectively).

8.      The health system also remained severely under-funded, and its resources were poorly pooled
and inequitably allocated. Despite several attempts to increase the health budget, public resources
invested in health represented approximately 20 percent of total health expenditures, with the
remaining 80 percent being OOP, mostly informal. With government health spending being roughly 1
percent of GDP for 2005 - as compared with an average of 4 percent of GDP for the countries of the
ECA region - and a mandate to provide practically all health care services for free, there was a
general agreement that the health care system was in need of additional public funds, as well as a
revision of the package of health care services funded by general tax revenues. In per capita terms,
public expenditures on health were about US$20. Inevitably, this led to OOP expenditures of about
US$96 per capita, quite a high figure in a country where about 30 percent of the population lived
below the poverty line.

9.       The governance structure of the health sector was at odds with the macroeconomic and
sectoral realities in the country. MOH’s actual role and capacity to govern the system, to make
policies, set standards, regulate and control overall quality and gather the intelligence needed to
monitor public heath was limited. The ministry did not, for example, have a unit tasked with
policymaking, nor did it have departments for monitoring and evaluation (M&E), human resources or
long-term planning. Indeed, MOH controlled only about 25 percent of public expenditures on health
which covered its central administration and the republican hospitals.

10.       As a result, the system suffered from the following shortcomings:

         a legal, organizational and regulatory platform that was not conducive to effective system
          stewardship;

         fragmented accountability for technical, administrative and financial matters, leading to
          inefficient allocation of human and financial resources;

         excessive hospital and specialized care facilities, albeit mostly in a dire need for renovation,
          refurbishment and upgrading as a result of lack of capital investment and maintenance;

         poorly funded and managed, and highly fragmented, primary healthcare services obsolete
          diagnostic and laboratory equipment and shortage of supplies;

         a de-motivated health workforce that relies on informal payments to cope with low wages and
          a practice environment devoid of incentives to provide appropriate care; and,



                                                  43
          major inequalities in health and healthcare as a result of very low public outlays, coupled
           with increasingly high levels of out-of-pocket payments.

1.2        Long term project Objectives

11.      Dealing effectively with some of the key issues plaguing the health sector in Azerbaijan was
central to the goals of the government and the Bank. The State Program on Poverty Reduction and
Sustainable Development (SPPRED) focused on the need to improve the quality of, and equity in
access to, health and education, a goal central to the Project. The SPPRED was candid about the
large burden of disease in Azerbaijan, the deterioration in quality of care and the need to strengthen
services to the population. Similarly, the Bank’s FY03-05 CAS (Report No. 25790-AZ approved by
the Board on April 29, 2003) also underlined the importance of improving the quality, efficiency and
coverage of health services for better health outcomes.

12.     The project aimed to help the Government to initiate and pilot a gradual but a comprehensive
reform of the healthcare system.

1.3.       Short Term Project Objectives

13.      The development objective of the proposed project was to improve overall health system
stewardship and financing, and enhance equitable access to, and technical and perceived quality of
essential healthcare services, in the selected districts in a fiscally responsible and sustainable manner
with a view to improving health outcomes. The Project aimed at: (i) reforming the overall system
governance by increasing MOH’s policy, planning, management and M&E capacity; (ii) improving
allocative and technical efficiency by developing new models of resource allocation, pooling, and
provider payment; and (iii) enhancing equity by designing a fiscally sustainable package of essential
healthcare services for free delivery to the poor.

1.4.       Project Components and Sub-components

14.      Component A: Building MOH Capacity for Stewardship. This component assisted MOH
to build its capacity in policy making, planning and regulation to design and introduce mechanisms,
instruments and tools, training MOH staff and upgrading MOH’s technological and physical
infrastructure. To this end, support was provided under five sub-components to: (i) develop a health
policy framework, and review and reorganize MOH functional and administrative structures,
including establishing a Health Policy and Planning Unit (HPPU) to strengthen MOH capacity to lead
health and healthcare policy analysis and development; (ii) develop a national drug policy and
strengthen the capacity of the MOH Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Unit to develop and
monitor the effective management of this policy, develop the necessary legislative and regulatory
framework, as well as procedures and tools for rational drug use; (iii) support the development of an
accreditation and licensing scheme for both public and private health facilities and set-up a
mechanism for quality control and assurance of health care services; (iv) strengthen the health
information system to improve MOH capacity to monitor population health and health sector
performance; and (v) improve MOH technical and information dissemination capacity for dealing
effectively with emerging diseases, such as Avian Influenza in humans.

15.      Component B: Improving Delivery of Healthcare Services. This component included three
sub-components which aimed to improve the appropriateness, quality, and technical and allocative
efficiency of health care services in five pilot districts of Apsheron, Agdash, Ismailli, Sheki and Gakh
by: (i) upgrading/renovation/construction of primary health care facilities at the sub-district level and
construction of three district hospitals in Agdash, Ismailli and Sheki in lieu of the old hospitals which


                                                 44
were to be decommissioned; (ii) strengthening managerial and clinical skills of the healthcare
workers; (iii) introducing new planning and management methods and tools; and (iv) improving
coordination and strengthening system hierarchy between the primary and secondary levels of health
care. This involved an improved referral system within each district and with the national level, with
an aim to reduce the number of referrals to Baku.

16.       Component C: Ensuring Sustainable Health Financing and Resource Allocation. This
component supported health care financing reform aiming at gradually introducing universal risk
protection against out-of-pocket health expenditures and moving towards insurance principles
through improved revenue mobilization, pooling and allocation of health sector resources and
purchasing of health care services. This component included two sub-components which addressed:
(i) the need to strengthen planning, implementation and monitoring mechanisms for effective health
care financing policy; (ii) the need to define a package of publicly financed health care services and
design new output-based budgeting and funding allocation mechanisms at national, district and
facility level; and (iii) the need to design and assist in the establishment of a health fund that will act
as a single pool for health sector funds and a single payer/purchaser of health care services.

17.     Component D: Human Resources Development. This component included two sub-
components which aimed to address the long term human resource needs of the health sector by: (i)
developing a labor adjustment policy - including provisions for a more dynamic retirement and
compensation policy - and a detailed strategy/plan for the health sector, based on review of existing
capacity and programs, which outlined the human resources needs, in terms of skills and competence
mix and equitable distribution, and proposed solutions regarding which areas of medical specialty
needed to be emphasized and/or curtailed; (ii) reviewing the current reform initiatives regarding
under-graduate medical education, specialty training and post-graduate training programs, with a
view to improving the quality of education.           Support was provided to develop clinical
guidelines/protocols, improve management of medical education programs, strengthen faculty for
undergraduate education, and develop new curriculum for under-graduate education and post-
graduate training of physicians, feldshers, nurses and other PHC personnel. This component also
supported the development of a certification program for medical personnel and the strengthening of
Physicians’ Associations in Azerbaijan.

18.     Component E: Project management, monitoring and evaluation. This component
ensured effective administration and implementation of the Project by supporting the operations of a
PIU in the MOH which was responsible for the day-to-day project implementation, including
coordinating with relevant stakeholders and donors, as well as for procurement, disbursement,
financial management, coordination of training events, and for ensuring effective monitoring and
evaluation of the outcomes of the Project.

19.     The Project was implemented by MoH. However, project activities were also supported by
three international agencies, WHO, UNICEF and USAID, which were conducting projects in the
sector.

II.     PROJECT ACHİEVEMENTS

20.    During the Project period, new health care facilities were constructed and put into operation,
reform policies were developed and implemented on health care service delivery mechanisms,
improving health policy, applying information technologies in health care, financing health care and
developing human resource as well as organizing medical education at a level to meet the current
demands. Moreover, trainings were provided in and outside the country for the purposes of



                                                 45
improving knowledge and skills of health care professionals. The Project conducted activities under
the following components:

2.1.    Component A – Building MOH capacity for stewardship:

2.1.1. A1 - Building capacity for health policy: The Project has been successful in supporting
MOH in its health system stewardship capacity. It achieved: (i) development of a Health Strategy for
the period 2007-2012 with assistance from WHO, which was updated to cover the period up to 2015.
In addition, the health chapter of the Development Concept – Azerbaijan 2020 was approved in
December 2012; (ii) development of a health system performance framework and based on the M&E
framework, two Health System Performance Assessments (HSPA) have been prepared to guide
policy making, planning and regulation; (iii) MOH’s functional and administrative structure has been
reviewed and changes were made; (iv) the establishment of the HPPU in 2009, which played an
important role in the certification of health professionals’ process; (v) upgrading major legal and
regulatory documents facilitating the operation of MoH and health care system; (vi) public
information campaigns through a number of workshops in the pilot and neighboring districts in the
context of the master plan, its methodology and proposals before the master plan was finalized; and
(vii) identification of the risk factors of NCDs and CDs which enabled MoH to develop national
strategies for NCD and CD management.

2.1.2. A2 - Strengthening pharmaceuticals policy and management: Pharmaceutical policy and
management have been strengthened with support from the Project through achieving: (i)
development of a number of strategic reform policies, such as: (a) essential drug list, (b) National
Drug Policy, and (c) Drug Formulary; (ii) trainings for the Drug Analytical and Expertise Center
(DAEC) and the Innovation & Supply Center (ISC) of MoH and provision of equipment (including 2
pieces of bio-equivalence lab equipment, drug quality control lab equipment and IT equipment); (iii)
analyses of international and local practices and implementation of a methodology recommended for
drug quantification; (iv) trainings on pharmaco-vigilence and rational drug use; and (v) development
of standard operating procedures to improve the centralized procurement of drugs and equipment for
the health care organizations under MoH’s direct supervision.

2.1.3. A3 - Quality Assurance and Accreditation of Health Facilities: Quality assurance and
accreditation has been strengthened through achieving: (i) development of a licensing system for
private medical facilities; and (ii) development of a number of legislative documents to improve the
quality of health care services in the country.

2.1.4. A4 - Strengthening the Health Information System: The HIS was strengthened
significantly by: (i) the development and piloting of a HMIS at the hospital level, completion of a
number of system developments (e.g. Patient Discharge Form AZ#66 (Form 66)), which allow the
government to monitor trends, compare efficiency and quality between facilities and regions; (ii)
development of a Unified Health Information System Road Map to promote the future integration of
health information systems and strategic development of HIS in the country; and (iii) preparation of
several modules to support the operation of various priority areas of MoH, including Form 66, HR,
Certification etc.

2.1.5. A5 - Improving MOH response capacity for emerging diseases: MOH’s response capacity
for emerging diseases has been improved by achieving: (i) development of the national strategy on
CD, including implementation of the international Health Regulations as well as standard operating
procedures (SOP) to complement the laboratory manual on the 29 priority CDs; (ii) introduction of an
electronic version of case investigation forms supported by GIS for CD; (iii) preparation of a national



                                                46
strategy for the prevention and control of NCDs through strengthened data collection and assessment
of NCDs risk factors; and (iv) establishment of the Public Relations Unit (5 staff).

2.2.    Component B – Improving Delivery of Health care Services

2.2.1. B1 - Strengthening District & National Level Health System: District and National level
have been strengthened through achieving: (i) development and approval of the Master Plan to
rationalize health infrastructure and human resources. Its implementation started in four out of the 5
project districts (Absheron, Agdash, Gakh, Ismayili, and Sheki) and the methodology was used for
optimization of health facilities in the entire country; (ii) development of the CD strategy and SOPs
for lab operations; (iii) training of trainers (TOT) (23 persons) on epidemiology and guidelines for the
control over the selected CDs; (iv) preparation of the investment plans as part of the master plan for
PHC facilities and other health facilities; (v) trainings for the health care professionals of the selected
districts on a wide range of topics; and (vi) development of the National Health Care Waste

III.    PROJECT IMPACT

21.      The Project had a significant impact in the health sector reform in Azerbaijan, particularly on
the following directions: (i) promoting health care reforms through developing policy documents on
health care reform and applying information technologies in health care; (ii) improving access and
availability of health care services through infrastructure development; and (iii) building capacity
through organizing trainings for health care professionals.

Promoting health care reforms in Azerbaijan

22.     The Project played an outstanding role in creating necessary databases, performing analyses
and developing assessments based on this information, as well
as proposing alternatives to conduct reforms in the health care sector of the country. HSRP produced
tens of monitoring and assessment documents, including more than 20 pieces of reform packages.
These documents mainly cover the areas of building capacity for stewardship, improving health care
service delivery, ensuring sustainable health financing and resource allocation and supporting human
resource development.

23.     Building capacity for stewardship and strengthening health policy: Effective health
system stewardship and health policy require creating database, analyzing and assessing the
information on this area. To assess the health system performance, HSRP developed a monitoring
and evaluation framework composed of 140 indicators and developed "Azerbaijan Health System
Performance Assessment Reports" covering the results of 2009 and 2011 (based on 45 and 13
indicators respectively). Moreover, HSRP financed a nation-wide survey on the "Risk Factors of the
Non-Communicable Diseases in Azerbaijan" and prepare an assessment report thereon, which aimed
to monitor the health status of the population, specifically to identify the risk factors of NCDs.

24.       Furthermore, in order to improve the reliability and frequency of data on health, HSRP
provided technical support on electronic collection and analyses of the data from the inpatient
facilities of the country based on patient discharge forms. Consequently, it became possible to
electronically collect and analyze the data on 700.000 cases electronically. This database enabled to
assess the quality of health care services, including the performance of inpatient health care facilities
and develop health care policy.

25.    Last but not least, the "Roadmap on a Developing Unified Health Information System in
Azerbaijan" was prepared to improve health information database and effective health information


                                                48
exchange. The recommendations of the Roadmap were incorporated in the State Program of MoH on
Developing Health Information and Communication Technologies as well as MoH's long-term
development objectives. Respective software programs were developed to enhance the information
database of the health care sector, collect and transmit information electronically as well as perform
electronic services, and the information and communication infrastructure and supply of the pilot and
other districts as well as MoH was strengthened.

26.     Strengthening the normative and legislative basis of MoH is another important area addressed
by HSRP. Thus, the Project supported the improvement and development of more than 100 pieces of
normative and legislative documents governing the health care sector. Moreover, the project
developed "National Drug Policy", "Essential Drug List", "National Drug Formulary" for the
purposes of improving drug supply and drug policy, and prepared "Health Care Quality Control and
Accreditation" for the purposes of implementing quality standards in the health care sector of the
country.

27.     At the same time, the Project established and facilitated the operations of the Health Policy
and Planning Unit, Public Relation Unit and IT Support Group, which are closely supporting MoH in
developing and implementing health policy.

28.      Improving health service delivery: To strengthen the delivery of primary and secondary
health care services the "National Master Plan on Health Workforce and Health Network
Rationalization" (National Master Plan) was developed and implemented not only in the pilot
districts, but also across the country. The implementation of the new methodology based on the
Geographical Information System (GIS) enabled to determine the number and location of the primary
and secondary health care facilities in the regions based on the local demands, optimize the network
of health care facilities and adjust to the international experience, strengthen primary health care
services and ensure a more effective distribution of health care workforce. According to the analyses
on the implementation plans of the National Master Plan, the number of primary health care facilities
increased by 44% and the population access to primary health care services increased compared to the
beginning of the Project.

29.     Additionally, training materials and curriculum on health care management were developed
to improve the knowledge and skills of health care administrators and non-medical staff. The training
focused on progressive international management practices and some fundamental areas of the health
care sector such as delivering health care services based on effective, quality and evidence-based
medicine, quality control, effective health care financing mechanisms, health insurance etc.

30.     Health care financing: HSRP conducted activities to develop the necessary reform strategies
and normative and legislative documents to reform the health care financing in Azerbaijan. That is, a
program and action plan was developed for the purposes of implementing the National Health
Accounts in Azerbaijan and the “Action Plan for the National Concept on Reforming Health Care
Financing System and Implementation of the Mandatory Health Insurance in Azerbaijan”. The
Action Plan covers issues such as establishing a single body to reimburse health care services,
developing the basic benefit package, mobilizing resources, making the budget, reimbursing health
care providers for the services delivered, implementing per capita financing in health care and
implementing the new financing mechanisms in pilot areas and across the country.

31.     Additionally, the existing normative and legislative documents regulating the health care
financing in Azerbaijan were comprehensively reviewed and the draft legislative acts required for the
implementation of the new financing mechanisms in Azerbaijan in future and the amendments to the
existing legislative documents were developed.


                                               49
32.     Developing human resources in health care: To improve human resource policy and
planning, the Project developed a policy document namely “Health Workforce Planning and Policy”
(methodology and assessment) on determining the long-term needs of the country for health
workforce and its planning based on the equal distribution methodology on medical specialties.
Based on this policy document, MOH introduced Order#151 on the “Thresholds for the Provision of
Health Workforce in Azerbaijan” dated 31.10.2008.

33.     Another important area that HSRP supported for the purposes of strengthening human
resources in health, was to improve the quality of medical education, align the medical education
curricula to international standards, establish close relations between the theoretical training and
practical application and improve teaching methods in medical education. Thus, to improve under-
graduate medical education in Azerbaijan, a policy document was prepared, the curricula used in the
under-graduate medical education were reviewed, recommendations on improving the curricula and
implementation of an integrated curriculum system at the Medical University were developed, and
preparation of a long-term implementation plan started on this direction.

34.       At the same time, HSRP provided technical support to the introduction of the residency
program to develop and improve post-graduate medical education. That is, the state education
standards for the residency program were developed and the process of aligning the residency
curricula to international standards started. Moreover, the Project developed the implementation
mechanisms of the certification process as well as the legislative documents regulating these
processes, the exam questions were prepared for the certification of health professionals, the
electronic portal of the Certification Commission was developed, training materials were prepared to
improve the awareness among health professionals on certification, and provided expertise in
facilitating the operations of the Certification Commission.

Improving access to and availability of health care services

35.      HSRP financed the construction and renovation of health care facilities in the pilot districts as
well as supplying them with necessary medical equipment to improve primary and secondary health
care services. Constructed in accordance to the modern standards, these facilities created a new
health care facility model in Azerbaijan. Two 100-bed surgery corps of Sheki and Aghdash central
district hospitals were built and put into operation, and the delivery department, sanitary-
epidemiology center and blood bank in Sheki region and the sanitary-epidemiology center in Gakh
region were renovated.

36.     To improve the population access to health care services in remote areas, 4 village hospitals
and 8 primary health care facilities were built and put into operation in Aghdash, Ismayilli, Gakh and
Sheki. These health care facilities were supplied with the medical and other equipment meeting the
current demands. At present, these facilities are providing health care services to approximately
46,247 rural people in the respective areas.

Building capacity of health care professionals

37.      HSRP provided trainings for the medical and non-medical professionals both from the pilot
districts and other regions as well as MOH staff. The training was to facilitate the development and
implementation of health care reforms, exploring international experience, learning the modern
treatment methods, ensuring the application of progressive technologies and overall managing health
care system more effectively. HSRP can be considered as one of the most successful projects in the
country in terms of the number of professionals (more than 7,000 persons) involved in the trainings.



                                                 50
These trainings are of great importance from the view point of building local capacity in health and
improving the knowledge and skills of health care professionals.

IV.   ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE WORLD BANK, GOVERNMENT AND TECHNICAL
ASSISTANCE

38.     There was a direct supervision and strong support by the Bank team to the Project with close
involvement in its design and implementation. The Bank was particularly supportive in helping to
introduce reform initiatives, which were new for the country and therefore the country had little
experience with reforms. The key decision made by the Bank to adapt the Project activities to the
country’s needs facilitated the effective identification and implementation of activities. However,
considering that some activities such as health financing reforms, were not successfully launched, the
Bank could have taken the role of advocacy as the biggest funding organization in the health care
sector of the country and could have promoted policy dialogue of key decision makers for policy
solutions to the critical pending issues.

39.     The GoA, particularly MOH, MOF and the Ministry of Economy and Industry (previously,
Ministry of Economic Development) demonstrated outstanding support to Project implementation.
As the implementing agency, MOH maintained effective partnership with the Project throughout its
life and went beyond the Project areas and introduced nation-wide reforms based on the products
prepared under the Project.     Compared to other initiatives, GoA demonstrated a very flexible
approach towards the Project, which helped the Project team to be more flexible in design and
implementation. However, some of the Project activities, particularly health financing reforms, were
pending and waiting for the decision by the GoA, which was not made during the Project period.

V.      LESSONS LEARNED

40.      Project coordination and management was Satisfactory in terms of identifying the country’s
needs for health reforms, implementing reform initiatives, building and sustaining good relationships
with all the stakeholders and keeping key decision makers informed about Project activities. Despite
focusing on the selected districts, many activities conducted under the Project went beyond the
selected areas and became national initiatives. Project activities were adapted to the changing
priorities of MOH effectively and reflected the existing needs of the country. However, the Project
management and coordination could have been more effective if MOH professionals were more
active participants of the activities and the PIU was more integrated to MOH.

6.      SUSTAINABILITY OF PROJECT INVESTMENTS

41.     The activities described above are of great importance from the view point of accomplishing
the goals and objectives of the Project, as well as the successful implementation of reforms. The
reform strategies developed, infrastructure created and health care professionals trained have
provided a significant input in the health care sector of the country and played an important role in
developing the health system and the application of the international experience in the country. The
strong basis created under the Project and knowledge will serve to further develop the health care
sector of Azerbaijan and improve the population health.

B.      Comments on Draft ICR (Ministry of Health)

42.     The Bank provided Azeri and English versions of the draft ICR for GoA comments on April
28, 2014. By the time of completion of this ICR, no comments had been received.

Annex 8.        Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

1.      During discussion with the ICR mission, WHO expressed its appreciation for the close
collaboration the Bank team has maintained with its staff and consultants. WHO recognized the role
the Project played in the development of the sector and the importance of the areas that it addressed.
While the technical assistance and training provided by WHO were important in building institutional
capacity for the development of the health strategy, WHO acknowledged that the integration of the
various pieces of analytical work were part of a bigger picture in the sector.

2.       UNICEF also expressed its appreciation for the collaboration the Bank team has maintained
with its staff. UNICEF recognized the importance of working together towards achieving the same
goals of supporting the sector and the comparative advantages each of the organizations had in
different areas. UNICEF was particularly encouraged by the strong collaboration during the
development of clinical protocols and guidelines.

3.      Unfortunately, the ICR mission did not meet with USAID as they are no longer active in the
health sector and the staff remaining in the USAID office in Baku had no knowledge of activities
financed by USAID in the health sector.
