This restructuring paper seeks the approval\n            of the Country Director for a six-month extension for the\n            project from December 31, 2012 to July 1, 2013. The closing\n            date extension was requested by the Government of the\n            Republic of Azerbaijan by letter dated October 2, 2012. The\n            extension is required to complete the construction and\n            equipment of facilities and installation of the information\n            technology system as well as finalize the training of\n            medical specialists. The main reason for the delay in\n            finalizing the project within the originally estimated\n            timeframe is the slow start of the project due to management\n            issues in the early years of project implementation.\n            Disbursements picked up considerably after an initial slow\n            start and in particular after a management change in the\n            Project Implementation Unit (PIU) and improved relation\n            between the PIU and the Ministry of Health (MoH). At\n            present, more than 80 percent of the funds have been\n            disbursed, about 10 percent is committed and the revised\n            procurement plan, attached to the extension request, shows\n            that all activities will be finalized by the closing date.\n            The six-month extension of the closing date, will enable the\n            completion of all remaining activities, help ensure\n            disbursement of remaining funds, and allow for successful\n            achievement of key activities that will contribute to the\n            development objective. It will also help to ensure\n            sustainability of the investments completed so far."}, "docdt": "2012-10-18T00:00:00Z"}
