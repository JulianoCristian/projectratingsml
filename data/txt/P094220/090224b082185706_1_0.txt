                         The Project Development Objective (PDO) remains rated as moderately unsatisfactory. Although the Project achieved a number of important indicators and targets, due to the failure
                         to restructure the PDO the overall achievement remains modest. The proposed restructuring would have revised the PDO to a less ambitious and more measurable development

                         objective more closely aligned with Project activities. The original HSRP PDO was to improve overall health system stewardship and financing, and enhance equitable access to, and
                         technical and perceived quality of essential healthcare services, in the selected districts in a fiscally responsible and sustainable manner with a view to improving health outcomes.
                         The revised PDO would have been simplified to reflect the changes in activities and scope as well as adaptation to what an investment loan can achieve. The revised PDO would
                         have been to improve quality and availability of health-care services and strengthen the capacity of the Health authorities to manage the system (stewardship).
