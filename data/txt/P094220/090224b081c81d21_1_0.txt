                         With the support of the project, the Ministry of Health of Azerbaijan has made progress in health system stewardship, access to health services and improved efficiency and quality of
                         service provision. A national Master plan was developed, approved and implemented nationwide and led to construction of facilities where access to services was previously
                         inadequate. An increase in utilization of services is seen in several of the project target areas. A survey regarding the burden of non-communicable disease (NCD) led to the

                         development of a national NCD strategy to be implemented over the next decade. The development and piloting of a health management information system at the hospital level is
                         being rolled out nationwide. The development of standards of procedures for 28 diseases as well as the medical education reforms and introduction of certification is likely to have led
                         to improvements in quality of service delivery. A new specialty was introduced with the Family Doctor approach increasing access and quality of services in rural and remote areas.
                         The construction of new facilities (primary care centers, village and district hospitals) increased access to services and the equipment of the facilities as well as (re) training of all staff
                         is likely to contribute to improved quality as well.

                         Despite these achievements however, overall project implementation performance has been mixed. Several components have been implemented well and showing results such as
                         mentioned above, other however were only partially or not achieved. The improving delivery of health services component was implemented successfully, but was not finalized and
                         due to unrealistic estimates at project appraisal and substantial inflation in the years between appraisal and implementation. In addition to cost underestimation and inflation, the
                         development of the Master Plan to rationalize health facilities also contributed to a downward estimate of infrastructure needs. As a result the project delivered less than half of the
                         planned facilities: 9 instead of 30 primary care facilities, 4 instead of 15 village hospitals and 2 instead of 3 district hospitals. The Government requested an Additional Financing (AF)
                         to construct the remainder of facilities planned under the Master plan and the Bank appraised the AF in August 2012, however the decision to negotiate is still pending. The Health
                         Financing component has not been implemented as the Health Financing Reform has stalled pending political decisions regarding the placement of the Health Insurance Agency.
