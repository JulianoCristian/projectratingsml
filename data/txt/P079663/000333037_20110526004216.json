The recent Quality Assurance Group (QAG) review\n            of the project in July 2010 pointed out that the project\n            development objective (PDO) and intermediate result\n            indicators were not adequately formulated to measure the\n            achievement of the project with reasonable validity and\n            accuracy. The initial set of indicators was considered as\n            lacking focus on outcomes, not specific on quality dimension\n            to be measured, and vaguely formulated on patient\n            satisfaction. Following the QAG review, the project team\n            conducted a review mission to revisit the PDO and\n            indicators. It was agreed with the government counterparts\n            to revise the project results Indicators so as to better\n            measure project achievements."}, "docdt": "2011-05-17T00:00:00Z"}
