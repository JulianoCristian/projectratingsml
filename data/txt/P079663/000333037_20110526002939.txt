A. SUMMARY
The recent QAG review of the project in July 2010 pointed out that the PDO and
intermediate result indicators were not adequately formulated to measure the achievement
of the project with reasonable validity and accuracy. The initial set of indicators was
considered as lacking focus on outcomes, not specific on quality dimension to be
measured, and vaguely formulated on patient satisfaction. Following the QAG review,
the Project team conducted a review mission to revisit the PDO and indicators. It was
agreed with the government counterparts to revise the Project Results Indicators so as to
better measure project achievements.


PROJECT STATUS
Overall, the project has made impressive progress under all components. Disbursement
has reached 60% and commitment reached 85%. All activities are expected to be
completed before project closing date of June 30, 2012. The performance of the project is
assessed as Satisfactory by the Supervision Mission in September/October 2010.

     •    Results/indicators {refer to Annex 1 }

The recent QAG review of the project pointed out that the PDO1 and intermediate result
indicators were not adequately formulated to measure the achievements of the project
with reasonable validity and accuracy. Therefore during the latest mission, one of the
main objectives was to critically review the indicators and the measurement strategies.
The review of the indicators was guided by the comments provided in QAG review report
and also the experiential knowledge gained during the baseline and mid-term evaluation.
Special attention was paid to the PDO indicators, which were considered critical for

1
  The project aims to improve health services in the Mekong region and to enhance access to and coverage of these
services, especially for the poor through: (i) strengthening the health financing policy framework and increasing the
financial accessibility of health services for the poor and near-poor; (ii) improving the availability and quality of
curative care, including responsiveness to changing disease patterns; (iii) increasing the capacity of preventive health
activities; and (iv) building the capacity of the health workforce. The project therefore blends support for demand for
health care services among the poor and near poor with outlays that address supply-side opportunities and needs while
building physical and human resource capacity. Key outcome indicators include: (i) Percentage of patients and services
users, poor and non-poor, and other groupings satisfied with provision of different levels of health services, including
hospital care; (ii) percentage of poor and near poor to whom health insurance cards have been issued in project
locations; and (iii) percentage of poor patients in selected project areas with increased use of quality health care.

demonstrating the project’s progress. The initial set of indicators lumped together access
and satisfaction, and lacked focus on outcomes. Quality dimension to be measured was
not specified, and patient satisfaction was vaguely formulated. The revised indicators
have addressed this limitation: access was specified to be measured through utilization of
inpatient and outpatient services, equity dimension in access was introduced, dimension
of the patient satisfaction was specified, and quality of care was linked to specific health
outcomes related to the type of interventions that project supports.

In relation to the intermediate result for Component A, the number of indicators has been
reduced by removing redundancy with the PDO and other intermediate result indicators.
The revised set includes only two indicators focusing on the important expected
outcomes of Component A – reduction of out-of-pocket spending among the poor and
near poor, and knowledge of health insurance benefits. The other outcome such as levels
of utilization is already captured in PDO indicators. Some output indicators, which were
not critical, have been removed from the result framework, as they are captured already
in the project implementation process tracking indicators, which has been used by the
PMU for day-to-day tracking of the implementation of project activities.

Significant revisions were made to Component B intermediate result indicators. The
initial set of six indicators was reduced to two indicators capturing the outcome
dimension of quality as opposed to the outputs and availability of inputs. One of the
revised indicators now focuses on the ability of hospitals to offer a new
services/treatment procedures and diagnostic tests as a result of the project’s investment
in health equipment. For this purpose a several tracer procedures will be selected that are
linked to the type of equipment that the hospitals received. Another indicator focuses on
the official referral of patients from provincial hospitals to HCMC hospitals. Reduction in
referrals would mean increased capacity of provincial hospitals to handle cases that they
were not able to handle before the project.

Intermediate result indicators for Component C were also streamlined. The revised set
now focuses on the ability of provincial preventive health center labs to conduct the
standard set of tests required by the MOH, and the use of improved surveillance software.
Intermediate result indicators for Component D were rationalized and made more
outcome oriented. In addition to the number of medical professionals trained, a new
indicator was added to measure the impact of training on skill shortage in health care
facilities and the retention of trained staff.

As a result of the revisions, PDO and intermediate result indicators are reduced from 21
to 14, and the revised indicators are more precisely formulated and more aligned to the
project activities.

In addition, the project needs to remove the disbursement conditions in Schedule 1, 3.(b)
of the DCA that no withdrawals shall be made in respect of "(b) payment made in respect
of Categories 2(b) and 3(b) until disbursements under Categories 1 and 2 respectively, set
forth in the Table of paragraph 1 in Schedule 1 to the PHRD Grant Agreement have been
completed". The rational for this condition in 2006 was to prevent double dipping.
However, the task team believes that the condition is no longer relevant for two reasons:
(i) category 2 under the grant had been fully disbursed or the disbursement condition
                                             5
under category 3b was met; and (ii) categories 2a and 2b were collapsed into     one
category under the Amendment dated March 10, 2010. The team would like to note   that
the removing of the disbursement condition is the initiative of the Bank not      the
Government. Therefore, it is not in the Government request. However, the team     has
communicated with SBV to explain the rational for this.
