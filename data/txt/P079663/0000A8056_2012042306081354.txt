                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project aims to improve health services in the Mekong region and to enhance access to and coverage of these services, especially for the poor through: (i)
                         strengthening the health financing policy framework and increasing the financial accessibility of health services for the poor and near-poor; (ii) improving the availability
                         and quality of curative care, including responsiveness to changing disease patterns; (iii) increasing the capacity of preventive health activities; and (iv) building the
                         capacity of the health workforce.
                          The project therefore blends support for demand for health care services among the poor and near poor with outlays that address supply-side opportunities and needs
                         while building physical and human resource capacity.

                         Key outcome indicators include:

                         Percentage of poor and others using and expressing satisfaction with the provision of different levels of health services, including hospital care
                         Percentage of poor and near poor to whom health insurance cards have been issued in project provinces
                         Improvement of quality of hospital care in the project hospitals
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project closing date is June 30, 2012. In the past year, the CPMU and LPMUs have escalated the disbursement of the Credit significantly. Up to now, the disbursement rate is
                         97.4% of the total budget, with $63.95 million from IDA (97.7% of the IDA budget), $4.74 million from PHRD grant, and $2.24 million from the counterpart funding. There are no major
                         issues in implementation in the past months since the last supervision in March/April 2011. The procurement of medical equipments of Can Tho General Hospital has sped up
                         significantly. Four out of 7 packages were delivered to the hospital; the contracts for the remaining 3 packages have been signed and the equipment is expected to be delivered in the
                         first quarter of 2012. Overall, the project implementation performance is assessed as Satisfactory.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project has made a good progress in the past year. The CPMU has maintained the satisfactory implementation of the project. Disbursement by March 31 has reached 97.4% with
                         $68.32 million from IDA and $4.7 million from PHRD and $2.24 million from the government. There are no major issues in implementation, except some difficulties in bid evaluations
                         and contracts awards for high tech medical equipment in a few provinces and Can Tho General Hospital, which have been resolved with close attention and support by the CPMU
                         and the Bank to escalate the procurement performance.
