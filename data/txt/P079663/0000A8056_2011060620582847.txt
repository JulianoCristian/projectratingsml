                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project aims to improve health services in the Mekong region and to enhance access to and coverage of these services, especially for the poor through: (i)
                         strengthening the health financing policy framework and increasing the financial accessibility of health services for the poor and near-poor; (ii) improving the
                         availability and quality of curative care, including responsiveness to changing disease patterns; (iii) increasing the capacity of preventive health activities; and
                         (iv) building the capacity of the health workforce.
                          The project therefore blends support for demand for health care services among the poor and near poor with outlays that address supply-side opportunities
                         and needs while building physical and human resource capacity.

                         Key outcome indicators include:

                         Percentage of poor and others using and expressing satisfaction with the provision of different levels of health services, including hospital care
                         Percentage of poor and near poor to whom health insurance cards have been issued in project provinces
                         Improvement of quality of hospital care in the project hospitals
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This is the last year before the project closes. The CPMU and LPMUs have raced against time to implement all activities under each component in order to achieve the project
                         Development Objectives before the Closing Date of June 30, 2012. Disbursement by March 31,2011 has reached 70%, with $54.67 million from IDA, $3.5 million from PHRD grant,
                         and $2.24 million from the government. There are no major issues in implementation in the past months since last supervision in September/October 2010. The only exception has
                         been the long delays in bid evaluations for a few packages of medical equipment for some LPMUs. Overall, the project performance is assessed as Satisfactory and the Project
                         Development Objective is assessed as achievable by end of the project.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project has made a good progress in the past year. The CPMU has maintained the satisfactory implementation of the project. Disbursement by March 31 has reached 70% with
                         $54.67 million from IDA and $3.5 million from PHRD and $2.24 million from the government. There are no major issues in implementation, except some difficulties in bid evaluations
                         and contracts awards for high tech medical equipment in a few provinces and Can Tho General Hospital, which have been received close attention and support by the CPMU and the
                         Bank to escalate the procurement performance.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
