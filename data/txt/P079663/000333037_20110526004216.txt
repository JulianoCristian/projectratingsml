7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The project aims to improve health services in the Mekong region and to enhance access to and coverage of
these services, especially for the poor through: (i) strengthening the health financing policy framework and
increasing the financial accessibility of health services for the poor and near-poor; (ii) improving the
availability and quality of curative care, including responsiveness to changing disease patterns; (iii)
increasing the capacity of preventive health activities; and (iv) building the capacity of the health
workforce. The project therefore blends support for demand for health care services among the poor and
near poor with outlays that address supply-side opportunities and needs while building physical and
human resource capacity. Key outcome indicators include: Percentage of poor and others using and
expressing satisfaction with the provision of different levels of health services, including hospital care
Percentage of poor and near poor to whom health insurance cards have been issued in project provinces
Improvement of quality of hospital care in the project hospitals
