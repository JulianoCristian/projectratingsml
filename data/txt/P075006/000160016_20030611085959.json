development o f the land\n            administration capacity to support the country's\n            economic  development and poverty reduction goals. The\n            project would contribute to the government's National\n            Poverty Eradication Program (NPEP) under preparation. The\n            objectives o f the project are to (i) improve  the security\n            o f land tenure; (ii) develop transparent and efficient land\n            administration institutions at the  national and provincial\n            levels; and (iii) improve the government's capacity to\n            provide social and  economic services through broader\n            revenue base from property related fees and taxes. These\n            objectives  would be achieved through formulating and\n            approving land policy and regulatory changes, strengthening\n            institutional capacity and project management, accelerating\n            land titling activities in areas o f high  demand,\n            developing and implementing an efficient and transparent\n            land registration system, and  strengthening land valuation\n            systems. There are 5 project components. Component 1\n            provides support to develop the land policy and regulatory\n            framework, and specifically helps to develop the\n            government's capacity to formulate land policies and\n            establishes a coordination mechanism for land information.\n            Component 2 supports long-term development of the Department\n            of Lands and the Provincial Land Office; provides training\n            and human resources development; and supports education in\n            the areas of land administration, land management, and\n            property valuation. Component 3 develops a modern land\n            registration system by helping land offices operate\n            according to agreed standards, providing community education\n            and services, strengthening land valuation to support land\n            registration, and supporting the Department of State Assets\n            Management. Component 4 accelerates land registration\n            through systematic registration. Component 5 supports\n            project management and implementation."}, "docdt": "2003-05-29T00:00:00Z"}
