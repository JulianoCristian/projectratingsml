Nonetheless, setting\n            land titling (LT) boundaries may potentially come in\n            conflict with road widening, or construction lines, where a\n            variety of public services could be held up, made more\n            expensive, or abandoned altogether, causing serious public\n            health consequences. Similarly, illegal landfills, and/or\n            when at illegal distances from water courses (thus\n            encouraging natural drainage uses), may compromise\n            acceptance of LT boundaries, since this issue could have\n            serious flooding, and public health consequences. To this\n            end, this environmental assessment looks at mitigation\n            measures, by ensuring the availability of town plans that\n            include land titling maps, revised and approved by the Town\n            Planning Office.
