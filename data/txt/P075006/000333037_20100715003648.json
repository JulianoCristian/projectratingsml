"Ratings for the Second Land Titling\n            Project (LTP II) for Laos were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            reform of land administration is a long-term endeavor that\n            requires decades of investment of capital and human\n            resources and sustained commitment. However, the path\n            towards reform of land reform is rarely straight-forward,\n            and commitment on the part of authorities is often neither\n            sustained nor consistent. Thus, a support strategy should\n            balance a clear sense of direction and priorities with a\n            significant dose of pragmatism. This project could have\n            benefited from a more stable policy framework and closer\n            engagement between the donors and the government. It is\n            important that reform is demand driven, i.e. by the\n            government, rather than supply driven, i.e. by the donors.\n            There is a risk when measurement of project impact depends\n            on a self-standing study to be completed toward the end of\n            the life of the project. In the case of LTP II, relying too\n            heavily on a self-standing impact assessment unrelated to\n            the ongoing monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system\n            resulted in the inability to fully measure the\n            project's impact."}, "docdt": "2010-05-20T00:00:00Z"}
