    Republic of Tunisia - Integration and Competitiveness Development Policy Loan
                                     (Loan Number 76960)
                              Second Tranche Release Document

                                        November 1,20 10

Recommendation

   1. This memorandum summarizes progress in the implementation of the policy-based
      operation in support of Tunisia's integration and competitiveness reforms. The
      memorandum focuses on the actions taken by the government of Tunisia to meet the
      specific conditions of the second tranche release of the Integration and Competitiveness
      Development Policy Loan (ICDPL). The Government of Tunisia has made satisfactory
      progress overall in implementing the program supported by the Loan as set forth in its
      Letter of Development Policy dated February 17, 2009, and has fully met nine out of ten
      conditions of second tranche release actions. One condition, namely that "the Central
      Bank of Tunisia shall publish statistics for 2010 that shall show a decrease in the rate of
      non-performing loans to fifteen percent (1 5 percent), and an increase in provisioning of
      non-performing loans to seventy percent (70 percent) is partially met. Indeed, while the
      rate of non-performing loans has been brought down to 12.7 percent in June 2010,
      surpassing the program's target, the increase in provisioning of non-performing loan
      reached 58 percent, below the ambitious target of 70 percent.

  2. In recommending the release of the second tranche, the Task Team agrees with the
     Government's request to waive the above condition. A more difficult environment linked to
      the global crisis largely explains that non-performing loans (NPL) provisioning levels do not yet
      meet the prudent 70% target set by the Program. The Tunisian authorities have indicated that the
      soundness of the banking sector has significantly improved in the period covered by the Program
      (lower and better provisioned NPLs, as well as higher profitability and capital adequacy) and
      announced their intention to pursue their efforts to meet the 70% target as soon as conditions
      permit.

Background

  3. The Board approved the two-tranche ICLDPL in the amount of US$250 million on
     March 24,2009. Following the Board approval, the Loan Agreement was signed on April
     11, 2009 by the Borrower and the International Bank for Development and
     Reconstruction (IBRD). The Loan was declared effective August 11, 2009 with the first
     tranche of US$125 million being released upon effectiveness.

  4. The ICDPL supports the key strategic elements of Tunisia's 1I* National Development
     Plan (2007-1 1) which seeks to strengthen growth and ensure that this growth is translated
      The design and implementation of the ICDPL was strongly affected by the global crisis
      which hit Tunisia in the early stages of preparation of this program. By December 2008,
      it had become evident that the real economy could not escape the effects of the emerging
      recession in Europe. Growth in the volume of exports declined sharply in the second
      semester to 1.5 percent (against 14 percent in 2007). This triggered a swift government
      response. A series of ?Presidential Measures? were announced following a Cabinet
      meeting on December 23, 2008. These included both emergency measures aimed at
      assisting exporting firms already adversely affected by the slowdown in Europe and
      measures to be implemented in 2009 and 2010, discussed with the Bank, the EU and the
      AFDB and contained in the matrix of this ICDPL program. The emergency measures
      included: (i) a subsidy of 50 percent of the employer?s cost of social security for firms
      witnessing a dramatic fall in exports to Europe; (ii) a subsidy of 100 percent of the
      employer?s cost of social security for firms that had to stop production and run down
      stocks; (iii) a subsidy of 50 percent of the cost of export insurance.

Recent macroeconomic performance and medium-term macroeconomic framework

   8. Leveraging the benefits of the reform program and sound macroeconomic policies
      implemented in recent years, the Tunisian authorities were able to mitigate the impact of
      the worsening of the international environment, which was particularly acute among
      Tunisia?s main trading partners, and strengthen growth in the first half of 2010. The
      economy slowed down significantly to at 3.1 percent (against 6.3 percent in 2008) but a
      contraction was avoided. Strong growth in agriculture and steady expansion in public and
      commercial services more than offset a contraction in manufacturing induced by a slump
      in nominal exports (- 22 percent). Consumer price inflation slowed to an estimated 3.7
      percent mainly due to a decline in food and energy prices. The decline in international
      prices of food and energy, combined with increased tourism receipts and workers?
      remittances helped narrow the current account deficit to 2.8 percent against 4.2 percent in
      2008. Despite a considerable fall in FDI during 2009 (-32 percent), Tunisia remained in a
      solid external position, with comfortable reserves level of US$ 9.8 bn (around 5.5 months
      of imports) thanks to a 43 percent increase in public and private overseas borrowing.

   9. The fiscal deficit increased to 3 percent in 2009, from a marked improvement in the fiscal
      position in 2008 when it stood at 1 percent of GDP. The comfortable fiscal position of
      2008 allowed Tunisia to respond adequately to the crisis with a fiscal stimulus package
      (1.4 percent of GDP), while maintaining fiscal prudence. The overall fiscal deficit
      (excluding grants and privatization receipts) rose by 2 percentage points of GDP, and was
      financed almost entirely from domestic sources (external budgetary grants remained
      stable at 0.3 percent of GDP). Public investment increased by 20.5 percent during the
      year both fiscal revenues and subsidies expenses declined (respectively by 3 percent and -
      25 percent) during 2009 (subsidies and transfers dropped from 5 percent to 3.7 percent of
   GDP). Despite the widening fiscal deficit, the public debt ratio continued to fall in 2009
   from 43.3 percent of GDP in 2008 to 42.8 percent of GDP in 2009.

10. Real growth was driven by the upturn in demand for manufacturing sector exports,
   especially mechanical and electrical goods (+35 percent in the first 7 months of 2010
   with respect to the same period in 2009) and, to less extent, textiles (+5 percent). This
   increase was only partially offset by the slowdown in agricultural sectors (-2 percent in
   monthly exports between July 2010 and the same month in 2009). Domestic demand was
   sustained by persistently buoyant consumption fuelled by the steady rise in per capita
   income. Growth can be expected to be supported by a recovery of industrial activity
   (industrial production expanded by 7.3 percent in the first half of 2010 compared with a
   contraction of 4.3 percent in the same period of 2009) and investment (particularly in
   construction and infrastructure projects).

11 The current account deficit has worsened in the first semester of 2010, as growth in
   imports outpaced exports, and remittances from Tunisians abroad and tourism revenues
   stagnated. Despite an 8 percent increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) relative to the
   same period in 2009, international reserves have declined but remain comfortable at
   around US$9 billion at end-May 2010. Inflation rose back to its 2008 level ( 5 percent
   year-on-year) as a result of rising commodities prices (food and crude oil). The current
   account deficit, which had narrowed in 2009, widened again considerably in early 2010 (-
   3.8% in the first 6 months of 2010) following deterioration in the trade balance and
   stagnating tourism revenues.

12. The Tunisian financial sector has been largely spared from the global financial crisis.
    Credit to the economy has held steady, thanks to the ongoing strength of deposit
    mobilization at banks, and the Tunis stock exchange continues to record exceptional
    growth. In addition, the authorities have pursued their long-term strategy for restructuring
    the banking sector, which has lead the rate of nonperforming loans (NPL) as a percentage
    of total loans to decline from 15.5 percent in 2008 to 13.2 percent in 2009 and the
    provisioning rate to raise from 56.8 percent in 2008 to 58 percent in 2009.

13. The IMF's recent article IV report supports the government's fiscal and monetary policy
    stance in 2010, which are designed to maintain macroeconomic stability while providing
    further support for economic activity and maintaining the room for maneuver needed to
    address the risks associated with the international environment. On this basis, the target
    of 3.8 percent GDP growth in 2010 may be achieved, provided that there are no fiu-ther
    delayed repercussions from the global crisis.
14. Tunisia?s macroeconomic medium-term outlook and prospects rests on government?s
    strategy for fiscal consolidation, the Central Bank?s vigilance towards inflation, pursuit of
    structural reforms and remaining risks in the global economy. Table1 reflects the
    government?s policy stance in the years leading to 2013. With gradual economic recovery
    in Europe, the need to maintain the fiscal stimulus will fade and the authorities intend to
    revert to fiscal consolidation as of 201 1 as they seek to quicken the decline in the rate of
    public indebtedness and maintain room for maneuver if necessary. This approach will
    rely on control of current fiscal spending, particularly through reform of the social
    security system to ensure the financial sustainability of the pension funds. The fiscal
    deficit is expected to decline to about 2.8 percent of GDP in 2011 thanks to the above
    policies and more vigorous growth (4.8 percent). Both the current account balance and
    foreign direct inflows are expected to improve.

15. To avoid a resurgence of inflationary pressures (partly from a rise in international
    commodity prices) and preserve macroeconomic stability, the Central Bank of Tunisia
    has indicated its intention to adopt a vigilant monetary policy. At the same time, further
    gradual liberalization of the Tunisian economy-with the goal of achieving convertibility
    for the dinar by 2014-will continue to create a sound environment conducive to private
    investment. Tunisia is also taking hrther steps to improve the business climate, in
    particular by simplifying customs procedures and creating better infrastructures with a
    view to promoting investment, innovation and international trade. The World Bank
    supports these efforts through an Integration and Competitiveness DPL I1 and a Third
    Export Development Project.

16. Risks to the outlook are related to the significant downside risks to growth in Tunisia?s
    European partners, entailing a possible escalation of financial stress and contagion and a
    more severe impact than currently expected of the planned fiscal consolidation on still-
    weak domestic demand. The strength of the recovery in Europe will determine to a large
    extent the pace of Tunisian exports growth, tourism receipts and remittances. On the
    other hand, the recent depreciation of the euro could boost exports of the euro area, and
    could benefit Tunisian exports in sectors such as electrical and mechanical industries.
    The medium-term outlook is subject to similar risks, with Tunisia?s traditional partners
    expected to be a less buoyant source of external demand than prior to the crisis.

Progress on ICDPL Second Tranche Release Actions

    17. The Government of Tunisia has made satisfactory progress in implementing the ICDPL.
        Out of the ten actions listed in the Loan Agreement as second tranche release conditions,
        nine and a half have been implemented satisfactorily according to the task team. Here is a
        summary.

    18. Condition 1. The Borrower's budget law for 2010 which shall revise the Customs targff
        regime by reducing the number o Cuslorns tariff rates from 6 to 5, including the tariff
                                          f
        rate "zero", shall be enacted. This action is considered met. The enacted 2010 Budget
        Law has indeed reduced the number of rate from 6 to 5 . At the same time. the 7 percent
        rate that applies on pharmaceutical products has been replaced by a zero rate. As a result
        of these changes, Tunisia's average tariff rate at 6 digit of the Harmonized System was
        brought down to 16.6 percent in 2010, from 18.6 percent in 2009.
19. Condition 2. The Ministry of Commerce shall put in place M system of selective
    management of imports control based on the risks presented by bhe imported products
    and the importers in order to allow speedier controls for Ron-risks products and
    importers. This action is considered met. Following a decree signed by the President
    that indicates that selectivity is the guiding principle for controls, the task team has had
    the chance to comment on a Ministry of Commerce's draft arrete aimed at indicating
    precisely the new selectivity-driven control procedures that Ministries and Agencies
    should now use for import controls. The revised draft took full account of the task team
    comments. The new text. The arrete has been published in the Journal Officiel (Gazette)
    under the reference JORT no 76 dated November I , 201 0.

20. Condition 3. The Customs Authorities and the Rades Port Authorities shall make the
   Jirst one-stop trade control procedures ofice (guichet unique) at Rades Port operational
    and the Ministry of Transport shall make the electronic platform (liasse transport) which
    shall connect all operators in the transport chain operational. This action is considered
    met. The one-stop trade control procedures office is operational since July 2009 and is
    conveniently located in the Rades Port, Tunisia's largest port, which handle 90 percent of
    national merchandise container traffic and 22 percent of total maritime traffic. Banks,
    technical control services, customs and other institutions involved in imports and exports
    are all represented in the one-stop trade office. The electronic platform for trade
    documents ("liasse de transport") that electronically interconnects maritime agents, the
    Port authority (Office de la Marine Marchande), customs, freight forwarders, trade
    intermediaries, etc. is also fully operational since January 20 10. Now document
    transmission and approval of about 80 percent of maritime transactions are undertaken
    through this platform.

21. Condition 4. The Inter-Ministerial Council shall adopt an action plan to reform the
    regulatory framework of the services sectors, to be prepared on the basis o a regulatory
                                                                               f
    assessment to be carried out by NCS. This action is considered met. The Inter-
    Ministerial Council adopted in August 19, 2010 the action plan for the reform of the
    regulatory framework of services sectors as as attested by the Letter to the World Bank
    country director sent by the Legal counsel of the Tunisia Government on August 26,
    2010. The action plan is based on a satisfactory study and the reforms included in the
    action plan reflect it.

22. Condition 5. The Prime Minister shall sign an executive order (arrztb,, reducing by half
    the number of activities where operators are required to obtain a prior authorization in
    order to start their bzuinesses. This action is considered met. In 2008 (baseline), prior
    authorization was required to operate in 95 sectors. Following the elimination of prior
   authorization requirement in 2009 and the first semester of 201 0, by July 201 0, prior
   authorization was required in only in 48 sectors.

23. Condition 6. The Inter-Ministerial Council shall adopt an action plan for the
                   f
    establishment o a unique common identijkation number for businesses to be used by the
    National Statistics Institute, the tax authorities and the social security authorities, based
    on a feasibility study to be conducted with the support o the Bank. This action is
                                                                   f
    considered met. The Bank study was undertaken and presented to the authority in March
    2010. Following various interactions between the involved technical department and the
    Bank team, the action plan was drafted in August 2010 and adopted by the Inter-
    Ministerial Council on August, 24 2010 as attested by the Letter to the World Bank
    country director sent by the Legal counsel of the Tunisia Government on August 26,
    2010.

24. Condition 7. The Competition Council shall be requested by the relevant sector
    Ministries to conduct a regulatory and competition assessment of businesses in two new
    sectors within the services sector. This action is considered met. In 2009, regulatory and
    competition assessments of businesses were realized by the Competition Council upon
    request in 5 services sectors (assurance, pesticide distribution, seeds distribution,
    livestock food distribution, microelectronic and small retail shops). The Competition
    Council has also shared with the task team its regulatory and competition assessments in
    3 additional services sectors realized in 20 10 (public transportation, professional services
    and audiovisual sector).

25. Condition 8. The Central Bank o Tunisia shall publish statistics for 2010 that shall
                                         f
    show a decrease in the rate o non-performing loans to fifteen percent (15%), and an
                                    f
                               f
    increase in provisioning o non-performing loans to seventy percent (70%). This action
    is partially met. A waiver is requested. The soundness of the banking sector has
    significantly improved with lower and better provisioned non performing loans (NPLs) as
    well as higher profitability and capital adequacy. NPL ratios declined to 13.2% in
    December 2009 and 12.7% in June 2010, well below the 15% target. However, NPLs
    were only covered by specific provisions up to 58.3% at the end of 2009 (latest data
    available), below the 70% target. The Central bank (BCT) indicated that although all
    banks complied with provisioning requirements for individual loans, this did not translate
    in four cases in overall provisioning levels meeting the prudent 70% target. In a more
    difficult environment, the BCT indicated that this target was unlikely to be met in the
    short term. The global crisis has indeed led to a slowdown in economic growth in Tunisia
    which affects banks' profitability and ability to constitute additional buffer to cover
    NPLs. The BCT also emphasized that the Tunisian authorities remained committed to
   meeting this target when conditions normalize, as evidenced by objectives set in the 2009
   Presidential program (NPL ratios below 7% and provisioning rate above 70% buy 2014).


26. Condition 9. The Stock Market shall publish its annual reports that shall show an
    increase of the stock market capitalization to at least twenty percent (20%) of the
    Borrower's Gross Domestic Product, due in particular to the increased number of
   privatizations implemented through the stock market. This action is considered met.
    The Stock Market capitalization reached 22.9 percent in 2009 against 16.5 percent in
    2008. By July 2010, the stock market capitalization witnessed an increase of 17 percent
    (year-on-year) indicating further improvement. While in 2009 privatizations played a
    minor role in boosting the stock market capitalization (growth was driven by an increase
    in the value of listed firms and the creation of two new investment funds), in 2010, 3
    public companies were privatized via the stock market.

27. Condition 10. The Borrower shall adopt institutional and regulatory provisions in order
    to improve the performance of the Borrower's micro-finance market, to be adopted on
    the basis of a study to be carried out by the Ministry of Finance. This action is
    considered met. Based on a study completed by the Ministry of Finance in May 2010, a
    satisfactory action plan containing institutional and regulatory reforms of the
    microfinance market was adopted by the Inter-Ministerial Council. Importantly, the
    action plan includes a provision to modify by the end of 2010 the arete of the Minister of
    Finance that so far has imposed a low interest rate ceiling on micro-finance companies
    (with the exception of one NGO that obtained a waiver) except for micro-finance
    institutions that receive public (Treasury) money. This particular measure is a major step
    toward fully liberalizing entry into the micro-finance sector (the low interest rate ceiling
    acted as a barrier to entry).
