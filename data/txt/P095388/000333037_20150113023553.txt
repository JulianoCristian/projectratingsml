 Synopsis

   Faced with persistently high unemployment, particularly among college graduates, Tunisia has been
   working with IBRD to improve its global competitiveness and accelerate economic growth. Since the
   late 1990s, Tunisia has become one the leading economies in Africa in terms of competitiveness and
   between 1996 and 2007 saw a doubling in exports of goods and services.



The Challenge
In the half century since independence, Tunisia country has
made major economic and social advances, reflected in the
combination of a quadrupling of per capita gross domestic
product (GDP), the increase in life expectancy to near de-
veloped-country levels, and the drop in poverty to less than
four percent of population.

The creation of an offshore regime in 1971 to reduce the
anti-export bias inherent in the strict import-substitution
policy of the 1960s significantly contributed to economic
performance. The offshore regime grants several fiscal and        pace at which young university graduates enter the labor mar-
