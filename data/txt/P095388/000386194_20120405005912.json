{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Integration and\n            Competitiveness Development Policy Loan Project for Tunisia\n            were as follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory; risk\n            to development outcome was moderate; Bank performance\n            satisfactory; borrower performance was also satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned includes: The importance of grounding\n            Development Policy Loans (DPLs) in solid analytic work. This\n            operation was exceptional for the quality of the analytic\n            work that had preceded it, notably the Tunisia: Global\n            Integration Study. This work served to identify key problem\n            areas, to a degree that is almost prescient in light of the\n            events of January 2011, and provided a platform and\n            justification for the measures contained in the operation.\n            The limits of gradualism. The reform efforts under this\n            program have focused on bringing gradual change where\n            opportunities arose, on the assumption that society was only\n            prepared for incremental moves. As it turned out, the\n            January 2011 revolution demonstrated that the said society\n            was actually hungering for quantum change. The need to\n            factor in more explicitly political tensions in assessing\n            risks. It is noteworthy that while the analytic work\n            indicated clearly the social tensions arising from the\n            continuation of Government policies, the discussion of risks\n            in the program document focused exclusively on the\n            likelihood of external shocks and lack of supply response to\n            policy measures. The need to go beyond measures that\n            initiate a reform process but that are not clearly linked to\n            the subsequent phases of this process. As shown in the\n            discussion on the prior actions, some of these measures were\n            completed but there was no significant impact or substantive\n            improvement in the areas of interest due to weak\n            implementation or lack of follow up on the measures. The\n            need to spend more time upfront on the development of the\n            monitoring system, including selection of development\n            indicators. While these indicators must necessarily take\n            into the account the impacts expected during the period of\n            the project, they must also be selected with an eye to\n            measurability as well as relevance."}, "docdt": "2012-03-23T00:00:00Z"}
