Lessons that may benefit future operations are\n            as follows. Cross conditionalities, and invested decision\n            making by an Inter-Ministerial Committee (e.g., appointment\n            of project coordinators), are difficult to manage, and can\n            create unnecessary problems leading to delays; rather,\n            committees at this level, should be involved in the overall\n            progress evaluation, strategic directions, and policy\n            guidance. And, to ensure effective learning outcomes and\n            adequate ownership, project activities should be implemented\n            through Ministry structures, further ensuring collaboration\n            with end-users in procurement matters, and alignment with\n            government recurrent budget applications. Moreover, the\n            changing socioeconomic context of a country requires the\n            Bank to be responsive to such changes, through a project\n            design that would allow government priorities achieve their\n            full political support and ownership, and, responsive as\n            well to the specialized nature of rehabilitation, through\n            adequate consulting engineers' terms of reference, to\n            avoid unnecessary addenda during implementation. As for\n            capacity building, it is worth noting that such should not\n            be limited to staff development, but include as well,\n            broader issues of staff retention, and non-salary incentives."}, "docdt": "2002-03-29T00:00:00Z"}
