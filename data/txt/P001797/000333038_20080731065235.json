Lessons learned from the projects included:\n            very low-income countries receiving donor aid may succeed in\n            providing broad access to education. But without a critical\n            number o f reasonably well educated teachers, interested\n            administrators, and strong instructional supervision, the\n            educational system may provide little learning to the\n            students. Monitoring of learning outcomes is critical in all\n            education projects, particularly where very poor populations\n            are involved. Without clear and monitor able targets,\n            educational systems may enroll and graduate students who\n            lack basic skills. Governments are likely to respond to\n            donor priorities and informational requirements. If donors\n            are perceived as focusing mainly on access, governments are\n            less likely to focus on improving learning outcomes.\n            Strategies aimed at increasing girls' enrolment require\n            strong government commitment at a high level to be\n            effective. Otherwise, activities may take place but prove\n            unsustainable or ineffective in the long run."}, "docdt": "2008-06-17T00:00:00Z"}
