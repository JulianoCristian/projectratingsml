F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

The Project Development Objective (PDO) was to obtain a sustainable improvement in the
supply and performance of transport infrastructure (including services), in order to create an
environment for improved economic growth through expanded access and reduced transport costs.
The specific project objectives were to: (i) strengthen institutional capacity, financial viability and
operational efficiency of the transport sector agencies (Land Transport Department, Public Works
Department, Road Agency, Port Authority of Dakar, Civil Aviation Department, Maritime
Transport Department); (ii) encourage more direct private sector involvement in investment and
management of the sector; (iii) stabilize and improve the condition of the priority road network,
reducing the long-run economic costs of road maintenance and rehabilitation in order to enhance
regional competitiveness and attain sectoral financial sustainability; (iv) increase the number of
district capitals with access to all-weather roads; and (v) reduce transport cost for the poor.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

The Project Development Objectives remained unchanged throughout the life of the project.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.       The Economic Situation at Appraisal. In 1998 at appraisal, the Gross National Product
(GNP) had been growing at about 5% per annum for the previous four years following the 1994
devaluation of the FCFA Franc. Services accounted for 54 percent of GNP, agriculture for 19
percent, and industry for 17 percent. Overseas Development Aid (ODA) remained important and
accounted for almost 12 percent of GNP. In early 1998, Senegal had a population of 8.5 million
which was growing at a rate of 2.6 percent per annum. Over 40 percent of the population lived in
urban areas where growth was about 5 percent per annum. Illiteracy was high (about 80 percent),
as was unemployment (about 30 percent of the labor force), and under-employment
(approximately 76 percent). The incidence of poverty was also significant, with 54 percent
earning less than US$1 per day. Senegal belongs to the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS) which has been pursuing the physical integration of its member states through
the development of regional highways and telecommunication networks.

2.       The Transport Sector. The transport sector played a strategic role in the economy of
Senegal. It accounted in 1998, for approximately 10 percent of GNP and generated a significant
share of revenues. As a center of French colonial administration in the 1950's, and following
independence in 1960, Senegal, and particularly the capital Dakar, acquired a relatively good
infrastructure base. However, economic crisis and decline during the 1970's and early 1980's, and
weak institutional capacity, led to deterioration of the infrastructure network.

3.       At appraisal, the transport infrastructure network consisted of 14,500 km of classified
roads of which about 5,500 km were rural earth roads. The rail network consisted of 1,058 km of
track. The Port of Dakar was the main international seaport handling container as well as other
cargoes. There were three secondary and several tertiary ports and harbors. Senegal had one main
international airport (Leopold Sedar Senghor, Dakar), 16 regional airports and one wholly-owned
national airline.

4.       Since 1992, the Government had undertaken major efforts to remedy sector policy, and
institutional and physical imbalances within the framework of the Transport Sector Adjustment
Program (PAST). PAST was supported by twelve donors/international financial institutions,
including the Bank. Achievements under PAST were good despite the devaluation of the CFA
Franc which substantially raised transport costs.

5.       Sector Policies and Plans. The Government remained committed to reforms and
development of the sector as outlined in their Ninth Economic and Social Development Plan,
Medium Term Strategy Paper for the Transport Sector (MTSTS, June 1997), and Letter of Sector
Policy (LSP2, January 1998). LSP2 outlines a Sector Maintenance and Investment Program
(SMIP) aimed at: (i) improving sector policy, planning and management, land transport
administration, road maintenance and finance, civil aviation management, port, maritime and
river transport, and rural transport; (ii) mitigating environmental impacts; and (iii) increasing the
efficiency of the railways; and, increasing private sector involvement in the sector.




                                                   13

6.       The Project. The project was designed to support a five and a half year time-slice of the
SMIP at an indicative cost of US$581 million. Other donors and bilateral/multilateral institutions
would finance about 51 percent of the project, with the Government (including public enterprises)
financing about 27 percent of project; the private sector 6.5 percent; and the Bank covering the
remainder, about 15.5 percent.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

7.       The Project Development Objective.               The PDO was to obtain a sustainable
improvement in the supply and performance of transport infrastructure (including services), in
order to create an environment for improved economic growth through expanded access and
reduced transport costs.

8.       The Specific Objectives of the Project. The PDO was consistent with the Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) of December 29, 1997 which sought to address among other things,
the cumbersome administration, the incomplete privatization, the high cost of factors of
production including transport, and the incidence of poverty and unemployment. The PST2
addressed these issues through its specific objectives which were to: (i) strengthen institutional
capacity, financial viability and operational efficiency of the transport sector agencies1; (ii)
encourage more direct private sector involvement in investment and management of the sector;
(iii) stabilize and improve the condition of the priority road network, reducing the long-run
economic costs for road maintenance and rehabilitation in order to enhance regional
competitiveness and achieve sectoral financial sustainability; (iv) increase the number of district
capitals with access to all-weather roads; and (v) reduce transport cost for the poor.

9.       Key Indicators of Performance. The key performance indicators were2: (i) reduction in
freight rates and vehicle operating costs; (ii) reduction in goods delivery time; (iii) improvement
in the overall condition of the roads network as reflected by the IRI (international roughness
index); (iv) increase in the number of district capitals with access to all-weather roads; (v)
mainstreaming of better planning and programming tools for road maintenance and rehabilitation
works (e.g. three-year rolling plan); (vi) creation of a Road Works Management Agency; (vii)
operation of a Road Fund Mechanism under a new institutional structure and procedures; (viii)
further improvements in financial performance and efficiency gains (e.g. reduction in work force,
declining ratio of wage bill to revenues) and management capacity of parastatals; (ix) improved
competitiveness vis-à-vis other ports and airports of the region; (x) adoption of a new Maritime
Code in line with international standards; (xi) increased traffic to the secondary ports of
Ziguinchor and Kaolack, as well as reduced transport cost and travel time savings from the Dakar
region to Ziguinchor; and (xii) successful privatization of the operation of international rail
services on the Dakar-Bamako corridor, Air Senegal, and airport management. In addition, there
were 33 key performance indicators for the ten parts of the project. These are listed in Annex 10.




1 Including: the Land Transport Department, Public Works Department, Road Agency, Port Authority of
Dakar, Civil Aviation Department, and Maritime Transport Department.

2The Development Credit Agreement (DCA) has different indicators. Schedule 6 lists 12 performance
indicators for the Port of Dakar and 18 for the Road component.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

10.      Project Restructuring in 2004. In 2002, the Bank team agreed with the Government on
an action plan to improve project implementation. The plan included: (i) a proposal for the
restructuring of the Road Agency to improve its operational efficiency; (ii) a reallocation of
project funds to the road component to account for the increased cost of roadwork; (iii) a set of
revised project performance indicators to improve the measurement of project performance and
the M&E system, (iv) and, guidelines for the on-going institutional reforms and privatization
activities, in particular the railway concession. The action plan helped to facilitate the discussions
with the new Government and get implementation back on track by mid 2003. It was the basis for
the 2004 (informal) restructuring and for the formal restructuring in 2005.

11.      Project Restructuring in 2005.         Although it would seem that restructuring could
have been done during MTR in 2002, it took until late 2004 to reach agreement about a
restructuring which reflected the policy changes initiated by the Government in 2000. The
project was formally restructured as approved by the Board on February 24, 2005. The PDO
remained unchanged. The restructuring resulted from changes introduced early on in the project
following the political transition of March 2000. The newly elected Government introduced the
following changes in the sector strategy: (i) decision to build a new airport, while the project was
initially supposed to support the expansion and concession of the management of the existing
airport - Léopold Sédar Senghor International Airport (LSS); and (ii) decision to use resources
from bonds on the local market for the construction of the third berth of the container terminal in
the port when private financing was initially foreseen through a BOT. These changes required the
restructuring of several components, changes in the key indicators, reallocation of project funds,
and extension of closing date.

12.      The restructuring comprised closing six, amending two, and adding one specific activity
under the railways sub-sector, airports and civil aviation sub-sector, modernization and
development of the Port of Dakar, and modernization and development of maritime and river
transport parts of the project3 (see sub-section 1.6). The key indicators were streamlined in an
attempt to improve monitoring. The number of indicators was reduced from 33 to 24 indicators
measuring the outcome and the outputs of the project. Although the number of 24 indicators
remained high, it reflected the complexity of the project, which covered all sub-sectors of the
transport sector (see sub-section 2.3). The closing of six activities and the addition of one specific
activity in a project with 47 project activities was not considered to reduce substantially the
achievement of the PDO. The credit amount remained the same. The uncommitted funds
remaining after the activities were closed were reallocated to other components of the project.
The specific objectives also remained the same with the exception of the last one - (v) reduce the
transport cost for the poor - which was revised to: reduce poverty. The PST2 did not directly
control transport cost for the poor, but reduced poverty through employment in road works
financed by the project. In addition, HIVAIDS campaigns articulated to road works were
strengthened, in line with poverty reduction objectives.



3 Closed were: Activities F5 and F7 of Part F: Airports and Civil Aviation sub-sector; activities G2 and G4
of Part G: Modernization and Development of the Port of Dakar; and, activities H3 and H6 of Part H:
Modernization and Development of Maritime and River Transport. Amended were: Activities E1 and E6
of Part E: Railway sub-sector. Added was: Activity D8 to Part D: Road Maintenance, Rehabilitation, and
Construction.

1.4 Main Benefits

13.     Project Benefits.     The project was to yield substantial benefits by improving the
productivity and competitiveness of the Senegalese economy and by improving access to markets
and services for the population. At appraisal, it was estimated that the share of total household
expenditures going to transport was consistently higher than the share going to health and
education. The roads component focused on the core road network and would benefit the rural
population in terms of improved rural and intra-rural mobility and increased access to
employment, education and social services. The rail component connecting six regions would
also benefit the rural population because of better inter-regional connections. The target
population was estimated at about 2 million people (about 24 percent of the population).

14.     Other benefits would include: (i) greater accountability and sustainability in public
financing of the road sub-sector (including stakeholder representation on the Road Fund Council)
and more efficient maintenance and rehabilitation through the restructuring and streamlining of
the Road Maintenance Fund; (ii) reduced transport costs, fresher produce to markets, and on-time
deliveries would make Senegal's products and services more competitive in local, regional and
international markets; (iii) mobilization of local contractors, firms and consultants for studies,
auditing, and other activities. An estimated 13,000 skilled and unskilled workers would be
employed each year for road works, rail track replacement and rehabilitation, and port and airport
construction and maintenance; (iv) the quality of rail transport services would be improved
through private operation of international services, and transport costs would be reduced as a
result of efficiency enhancing investments which would result in an increased use of the Port of
Dakar; (v) institutional strengthening and reform measures under the project would result in a
more efficient sector administration; (vi) improvement in road safety on the national network
would have a benefit in terms of the costs of avoided accidents (an estimated 2,200 road fatalities
annually); (vii) the development of national maritime transport would help reduce transport costs
and increase trade in agricultural produce to urban markets; and (viii) investments in civil
aviation would improve security and safety of airport operations, reduce travel time and costs,
increase passenger and cargo handling capacity, promote tourism and reduce export costs.

1.6 Revised Components




                                                  18

25.      As stated in sub-section 1.3, eight specific activities from five parts of the project were
formally closed or amended in 2005 as a result of government transport policy changes following
the political transition in March 2000. One activity was added. The other parts of the project
remained unchanged.

26.      Part F: Airports and Civil Aviation sub-sector: Changes in financing and regulations
of the Airport. The new Government decided to: (i) build a new airport instead of the agreed
actions of modernizing and expanding the LSS airport and privatizing airport management; and
(ii) delay indefinitely setting airport fees and regulating air navigation safety. During the mid-
term review in May 2002 it became clear that the Government was no longer committed to the
expansion, modernization and rehabilitation activities at the LSS. To reflect this, the expansion,
modernization and rehabilitation activity (F5) and the privatization activity (F7) were closed at
restructuring.

27.      Part G: Modernization and Development of the Port of Dakar: Changes in financing
and operations of the Ports. The new Government decided to finance the construction of the
third berth of the container terminal in the port with local bonds instead of private financing
through a Build Operate Transfer (BOT) as was agreed in the Development Credit Agreement
(DCA). The International Development Association (IDA) and other donors determined that
public financing of the container berth was not the most viable financial arrangement considering
the financial situation of the Port of Dakar. After further dialogue, IDA decided to close the
activities in the project that facilitated private sector participation in the financing of port
infrastructure (G4). In addition, the port authority failed to comply with the legal covenant related
to the ratio of personnel versus operating expenditures. This led to the decision to close the
expansion and rehabilitation activities (activity G2).

28.      Part H: Modernization and Development of Maritime and River Transport
Component. The IDA funded study of the Kaolack port showed that it was not economically
feasible to expand the port. The AFD (Agence Francaise de Developpement) decided therefore
not to finance this activity. The same study determined the need for signaling and navigation
equipment at the ports of Kaolack and Ziguinchor and the AFD financed the supply and
installation of this equipment. At the time of the 2005 restructuring, activities H3 (hydrographic
survey of Kaolack port), and H6 (equipment for the Kaolack and Ziguinchor ports) had been
completed and were closed.

29.      Part D: Road Maintenance, Rehabilitation, Construction Component: Feasibility of
a Toll Road. The Government decided to consider constructing a toll road in Dakar to alleviate
congestion, using a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) approach. Such a road would pose difficult
engineering issues and would have a substantial impact on the environment. Technical and
advisory services were needed to determine the feasibility and impact. The provision of such
services was added as activity D8.

30.      Part E: Railway sub-sector: Privatization of the international Railway line. Effective
October 2003, the international railway line between Dakar and Bamako was transferred from
SNCF to the private company TRANSRAIL. The DCA was amended to cancel the project
agreement with SNCF and enter into a Subsidiary Loan Agreement with TRANSRAIL. In
addition, CARCHEM (Cellule d'Appui a la Reinsertions des Cheminots), the unit to manage the
reinsertion of personnel of the former SNCS was established by the Government. Schedule 2 of
the DCA, Description of the Project was amended to reflect these changes in Part E: Railway sub-
sector activities E1 and E6.

1.7 Other significant changes

31.     Increases in the Cost of Road Works. Shortly after effectiveness when the autonomous
Road Agency had been established as part of the project's institutional reform activities, the
Agency faced two issues. One was the fact that the data obtained from the Road Maintenance
Data Base (RMDB) produced by the Department of Public Works (DTP) was incomplete, at least
for the paved road maintenance part (the Bank secured European Union support for the
computerization of the RMDB which was completed in 2004). The second was that when
contracts were awarded for road maintenance bids, prices were substantially higher than
estimated at appraisal. These issues delayed the execution of the paved road maintenance work to
2004 and made it necessary for the Government to seek additional financing from the AfDB and
EU. The disparity in costs was attributed to: (i) different types of works (rehabilitation vs.
periodic maintenance caused by the delays between appraisal and the preparation of the bidding
documents); and (ii) addition of some urban roads from the classified network for inter-urban
roads included at appraisal which it turned out were in good condition and required no
maintenance.

32.     The higher than estimated prices of road work required additional allocation from the
budget and/or donors, and reallocation of Credit proceeds. The higher price was a result of
external factors such as the substantial increases in the price of oil which raised the price of
bitumen and cement, as well as, the cost of transport. The 2007 study by AfDB later showed that
these cost increases occurred throughout the region and were not particular to Senegal. This
situation led to the decision at restructuring to transfer uncommitted funds (about 5 percent of the
project amount) from activities that were closed to the Road component.             Part D: Road
Maintenance, Rehabilitation, Construction was increased from US$27.4 million to US$30.4
million.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

33.      Project preparation addressed outstanding institutional, regulatory and sector-wide
infrastructure issues in the aviation, railway, roads, and maritime sub-sectors. As a result, the
project design was complex and depended on strong, stable and sustained commitment from a
multitude of agencies. The Quality at Entry Assessment (QEA) was rated marginally satisfactory.

34.      Sector Reform Issues at Preparation. The PST2 was the 16th infrastructure project and
was preceded by the Transport Sector Adjustment Program (PAST) which closed in December
1999 with satisfactory results.      Earlier projects had mixed results, especially in policy and
institutional reforms. The Bank had become a leading supporter of the transport sector since the
1970s and, in part because of the earlier mixed results with policy and institutional reforms, took
on a key role with other donors in those areas. During preparation, the Bank team mobilized four
ministries5, as well as, ten donors and secured champions for the project in the Prime Minister
and the Minister of Economy, Finance and Plan (MEFP). Stakeholder consultation was extensive,
and attempts to try new ideas and methods reflected the effective partnership between the
Government, the Bank and other donors. The successful implementation of PAST and lessons
learned suggested that a large multi-sector investment project would be feasible.

35.      Part of a Multi-donor Transport Improvement Program. The project, part of the
much larger Sector Maintenance Investment Program (SMIP),6 was ambitious, far-reaching and
complicated, designed to bring about comprehensive sector-wide (air, rail, roads, and maritime
transport) policy and institutional reforms among some 40 agencies and departments, complete
efforts towards privatization of public assets and autonomy of sector agencies, and bring about
physical improvements and expansion of the entire transport infrastructure while reducing
transport costs. As approved the project was part of a US$581 million program financed by the
Government, public and private sector enterprises, donors and the Bank. The Bank took on the
coordination of the program in addition to supervising the implementation of the project.

36.      Risks and their Mitigation. The risks that were identified and mitigated concerned the
government's commitment to adhere to: (i) sector policies; (ii) budget appropriations and
financial obligations; (iii) public sector restructuring and reforms; (iv) regulatory reforms, and (v)
environmental and social impact mitigation. These risks were to be mitigated by: (i) donor
financing predicated on adherence to reforms; (ii) due diligence covenants; (iii) assurances of
commitment at the highest level (Prime Minister and Minister of Economy, Finance and Plan), as



5 Including: the Ministries of Economy, Finance and Plan; Equipment and Land Transport; Tourism and
Air Transport; and, Fisheries and Maritime Transport.

6 The Program comprised 11 components with some 78 specific activities. Financing was provided by ten
donors, the Government and public and private sector agencies and the Bank. The project comprised 10
parts, mostly similar to components 2-11 of the program with 47 specific activities (Project Appraisal
Document, Report No 19023-SE. Annex 2A: Second Transport Sector Program (PST2) Project Description,
and Annex 2A bis: Second Transport Sector Program (PST2) Description of the Project financed by IDA).




                                                   21

well as, at the level of the transport ministries; (iv) agreements regarding maintenance and
environmental protection; and (v) guidelines issued by the government.

37.      Readiness for Implementation and QEA. The project was approved in March 1999,
but it took eight months till December 1999 to become effective. A combined Bank/donor
mission in July 1999 had to addressed issues concerning: the railroad concession; privatization of
Air Senegal and the Port of Dakar; the maritime code; and, rural and road transport. A subsequent
November 1999 mission had to conduct a workshop on privatization and road quality as it found
that preparation of these activities varied across agencies. QEA3 rated project concept, objectives
and approach; technical and economic aspects; financial management aspects; and, institutional
capacity analysis satisfactory. Readiness for implementation; risk assessment and sustainability;
and, Bank inputs and processes were rated marginally satisfactory and poverty and social aspects
unsatisfactory. The overall quality at entry was rated marginally satisfactory.

2.2 Implementation

38.      Implementation was substantially affected by the election of a new Government early in
the project which not only affected commitments, but resulted in changes in policies regarding
institutional reforms and privatization, as well as, seven changes in ministers and ministries. Also,
the initial capacity of the newly created Road Agency remained weak for a number of years
making it difficult to address the increases in the cost of road works, establish effective
procurement processes, and commence implementation of the roads program. The government's
position became clearer in 2004 which led to the 2005 formal restructuring of reform and
privatization activities and reallocation of funds to address cost increases in the roads program.

39.      Changes in Sector Policies. Shortly after the project became effective, by March 2000 a
new Government was elected (and the project had lost its two initial champions ­ the Prime
Minister and the Minister of Economy, Finance and Plan). Implementation of the policy,
institutional and regulatory reforms depended on the commitment of transport agencies which had
to seek approval to proceed from a new Government. This situation was aggravated by seven
changes7 in the structure of transport ministries between 2000 and project completion (the
coordinating unit (CELCO) was not affected and provided continuity). Staff responsible for
project activities changed every time the ministry structure changed which substantially affected
implementation capacity and experience, as well as, institutional memory. More importantly,
there was not enough stability in the bureaucracy to firmly establish the institutional reform
measures and make progress on autonomy of transport agencies. Many of these activities faced
delays affecting implementation progress (IP) and achievement of the PDO (from May 2001 till
June 2004 the project ratings were unsatisfactory with a satisfactory interruption from December



7In April 2000, the government merged the three ministries (Ministries of Equipment and Land Transport;
Tourism and Air Transport; and, Fisheries and Maritime Transport) and created a single Ministry of
Equipment and Transport. The implementation unit (CELCO) was moved from the Ministry of Economy,
Finance and Planning to the newly created Ministry of Equipment and Transport. In March 2001, the
Ministry of Equipment and Transport was split and the former Ministry of Fishery and Maritime Transport
was re-established. Then in August 2001 the two Ministries were merged again into one Ministry of
Infrastructure, Equipment and Transport. Next in April 2004, the Ministry was split in two and the
Ministry of Tourism and Air Transport was reestablished. In February 2006, the two Ministries were split
into three and the Ministry of Marine Economy and International Marine Transport was created. In early
December 2007, this was reversed and the transport sector Ministries have again been merged into a single
Ministry.


                                                   22

2002 till June 2003). However, since October 2004 until December 2007 (end of the project),
both PDO and IP ratings have been satisfactory.

40.     Implementation constraints. Implementation capacity of several agencies, especially of
the Road Agency turned out to be insufficient to execute the planning, computerization,
engineering, procurement and contracting, supervision, and retrenchment activities. It took the
recruitment of new management, new more competent staff and some three years of staff training
before the Road Agency was able to prepare the annual road maintenance and rehabilitation
program - PERA (Programme d'Entretien Routier Annuel), the three-year rolling Road Plan ­
PTG (Plan Triennal Glissant), and establish effective procurement, contracting and supervision
procedures and practices.

41.     Mid-Term Review and the Quality of Supervision Assessment (QSA6). The May
2002 Mid-Term Review (MTR) found progress to be satisfactory although the low disbursement,
caused by delays in awarding contracts for civil works, was noted. The mission was officially
informed about the changes in policies for the port and the airport and agreed with the
Government, in principle, about the need to restructure the project. An action plan was put in
place to address institutional shortcomings and to better monitor progress with a set of revised
indicators. The MTR mission agreed with the Minister of Infrastructure, Equipment and
Transport that the shortcomings in the decree which established the Road Agency, and the weak
capacity of the agency staff, needed to be addressed. Seven months later, the second stage review
of the Quality of Supervision Assessment (QSA6) rated the overall quality of supervision
moderately satisfactory and confirmed the overly complex project design. The panel
acknowledged that the Bank was awaiting government decisions on policy and investment issues
and that supervision was engaged in continuing dialogue while there were multiple changes of
government interlocutors.

42.     The Changes required Amendments to the Project.                   Although implementation
improved in 2004; the project gained momentum and progress was made in the roads, rail, port
subsectors, it became apparent that the Government was not going to go back on decisions it had
made to: (i) build a new airport; (ii) delay setting airport fees and regulate air safety; and (iii) use
public funds instead of BOT for the container berth at the Port of Dakar. In addition a number of
project activities had been completed or changed and a private operator had taken over the
international rail line to Bamako. Also, the increased cost of road works required reallocation of
Credit proceeds. These changes required amendments in the DCA which were made in 2005 and
approved by the Board on a no-objection basis. Also the Bank responded favorably to the
government's requests to extend the closing date by a total of two and a half years from June 30,
2005 to December 31 2007.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

43.     The M&E Design.           The monitoring and evaluation design required continuous
monitoring, annual reviews, and a mid-term evaluation based on predetermined indicators which
would measure inputs, process, outputs and outcomes. Performance and monitoring indicators
had been defined in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) and DCA (see Annex 10). The M&E
design included 12 key performance indicators, several requiring data on transport cost which had
not been collected before and which turned out to be difficult to collect. In addition, there were 33
performance indicators for the 10 components of the PST2 program.               The nature of these
indicators varied between those that required continuous monitoring, i.e. "increase railway
productivity" versus specific targets, i.e. "Air Senegal is privatized by December 1999". The



                                                  23

main challenge facing the staff of the transport agencies charged with monitoring was the absence
of baseline data for most of these indicators.

44.      Revision of the M&E System of the Project. Monitoring by the transport agencies had
to wait for the institutional reform, advisory services and studies and training to be done although
CELCO started monitoring early on. Moreover, early efforts to monitor progress against the
indicators were complicated by the large number of indicators, the lack of baseline values for
most indicators, and the difficulty of collecting data across the many transport agencies. Early on
in the project, the project team commenced working with the agencies to formulate indicators
which could be measured and agree on a baseline value for each indicator. In addition, the
number of indicators was reduced from 33 to 24 (Annex 10) measuring the outcome and the
outputs of the project. The number of 24 indicators remained high, which reflected the
complexity of the project, covering all sub-sectors of the transport sector. The new indicators are
described in Annex 11. While a large amount of data has been collected during the
implementation of the PST2, the focus of the M&E system was on five PDO Indicators and three
Intermediate Outcome Indicators which were systematically monitored and reported in the ISRs
(see Data Sheet - F. Results Framework Analysis pp. vii-ix). However, at completion, all the data
collected by the transport agencies during the life of the project was collected and described in a
report produced by the Ministry of Infrastructure, Equipment and Transport8. This data has been
used in sub-section 3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives and Annex 2.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Rating of Compliance is satisfactory.

45.      Safeguards. The QEA3 raised the issue of changing the rating of the environmental
assessment (OP 4.01) to an A instead of the B rating initially assigned. However, it considered
the issues mute in view of Senegal's commitment to environmental management. QEA3 also
raised the issue of compliance with safeguard policies on Natural Habitat (OP 4.04) and
Involuntary Resettlement (OD 4.20).         However, the project only financed maintenance and
rehabilitation. The expansion of the port and airport were dropped at restructuring. There was
therefore no infringement on natural habitat and OP 4.04 was not applicable. Similarly, there was
no land acquisition with relocation impacts during implementation and OD 4.20 has not been
rated.

46.      Environment: The project financed only maintenance and rehabilitation of existing
roads therefore OP 4.04 (natural habitat) was not triggered. Environmental impact of road works
were systematically mitigated as a result of the standards and guidelines developed and included
in all road work contracts under the project. Trained environmental staff of the transport agencies
regularly monitored mitigation activities.

47.      Social issues: A resettlement framework and a resettlement action plan were completed.
The study for the social and environmental impacts of the railway concession has been carried out
and approved by both the Governments of Mali and Senegal. Retrenchment of several hundred

redundant staff of former railways companies (SNCS in Senegal and RCFM in Mali) was carried
out with Bank support and under terms and conditions that were highly commended by staff
involved.

48.      Financial Management. Financial management by CELCO was efficient. The quarterly
Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) were received regularly and were fully compliant with the
agreed format. Audits were done annually and on-time and were unqualified except in 2001. The
issue raised by the auditors that year was addressed in the next audit.

49.      Procurement.       Procurement under the project was satisfactory. All procurement
activities and post-reviews were satisfactory. The weak procurement capacity at the onset of the
project led to the fact that from 2000 to about 2003, almost 25 percent of the contracts financed
by the Road Fund (not from the Credit allocations to the RF) were awarded on a sole source
basis. However, strengthening the capacity of staff of executing agencies, especially staff of the
Autonomous Road Work Agency (AATR) through intensive training programs for works and
consultant services helped to reduce sole source procurement to no more than 3 percent in 2004.
Subsequently, the procurement guidelines were tightened so that after 2004 all contracts have
been awarded competitively.


2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

50.      Sustaining Project Outcomes. Consolidation of the project's results is foreseen in the
2007 CAS which includes in 2008 the Dakar/Diamniado Toll Road Project and in 2009 a
Transport/Urban Mobility Project. The Bank will continue to work with the Government beyond
PST2's closing to ensure that the second generation Road Fund will operate effectively and that
the allocations from budget and external sources will meet the maintenance and rehabilitation
needs of the road sector. The institutional reforms have been enacted by decrees and are likely to
be sustained. Improved working conditions at the transport agencies particularly the acquisition
of computer equipment, modernized administration, and rehabilitated office facilities will help to
retain the staff that has been trained under the project. The Government is working on a strategy
to meet its financial obligations in the railway, airline, port, and maritime transport privatization
concessions. The new transport strategy, and a five-year investment program to be funded from
the budget and donor support, are under preparation and were not available at the time of project
completion mission.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

51.      The Project Development Objective remains relevant.               The overall objective of
improving the supply and performance of the transport sector to increase competitiveness and
contribute to growth remains a priority for Senegal and is reflected in the 2007 CAS. The
potential for transit trade to landlocked neighboring countries exists, but competition from nearby
ports and railways requires that Senegal's transport system is competitive in terms of cost and
efficiency. The rural economy's access to markets and the mobility of the urban population
continue to depend on the access and services provided by the sector. The project's specific
objectives of strengthening institutions including their financial viability and operational
efficiency; increasing private sector participation; stabilizing and improving the priority road
network; increasing access of district capitals to all-weather roads; and reducing poverty also



                                                 25

remain relevant. Transport sector agencies faced with new technologies and an increased need for
greater productivity and efficiency will continue to require further strengthening. The nature of
the transport sector requires permanent maintenance and there is ample scope for further
increases in rural access and urban mobility. This situation is reflected in the Bank's assistance
strategy which includes a toll road to improve access to the capital from the surrounding areas
and investments to improve urban mobility. The proposed projects would also sustain the
improvements in efficiency and in the regulatory framework of the transport agencies especially
in finance and procurement and, the improvement in services achieved under the project.

52.      Complex Project Design. The sector-wide and complex project design was opportune at
the time of preparation as it had strong political support, benefited from effective partnership with
donors and was building on achievements of the preceding project. It became somewhat of a
liability when the new Government was elected early in the life of the project and adjusted sector
policies. Also, three Task Team Leaders (TTLs) were successively in charge during
implementation, but management assured sufficient time for new TTLs to overlap and familiarize
themselves with the project. The third Task Team Leader was based in the country during the last
three and a half years of the project. Not only did his presence help intensify the constructive
dialogue with the Government in the face of adjustments in policies, and frequent changes in
ministries and interlocutors, but it also led to increased supervision efforts by the Bank.
Implementation that had slowed as a result of the government's policy changes improved
significantly after the project was restructured.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

53.      The PDO of PST2, to obtain a sustainable improvement in the supply and performance of
transport infrastructure (including services), in order to create an environment for improved
economic growth through expanded access and reduced transport costs, has been largely achieved
based on the assessment of the achievements against the specific project objectives described
below.

(i) Objective 1: Strengthen institutional capacity, financial viability and operation efficiency of
the agencies of the sector. Rating is highly satisfactory.

(a) Institutional Reform Outcomes. Reforms in the road sub-sector included the creation by
decree of the AATR in 2000. It was restructured in 2004 to strengthen its mandate, and improve
its structure, governance and oversight. At project closing, AATR operates efficiently and
autonomously as assured and supervised by the RC (which was also established under the project),
with competent staff operating within a sound regulatory framework for planning, procurement
and supervision, and with improved and regularized funding through the Road Maintenance Fund.
The second generation Road Fund, (created by decree in October 2007) expected to be
operational in December 2008 will improve funding and controls; contribute to the financial
viability and sustainability of AATR; and help sustain the effective maintenance of the classified
road network (see sub-section 3.3 Efficiency ­ Table 1). Improvements in the control of road
quality standards have been achieved by the modernization, equipment acquisition and staff
training at CEREEQ. CEREEQ now functions effectively and provides advisory services on
standards and quality issues in the sector.

(b) In the rail road sub-sector, CARCHEM created by a decree in 2003 is managing the
reinsertion of redundant former SNCS employees. It provides job training, identifies job
opportunities and assists with business plans. CARCHEM has placed some 190 redundant
employees in permanent jobs, which represents one third of the staff laid-off.


                                                  26

(c) In the air transport sub-sector, AANS (Activités Aéronautiques Nationales du Sénégal) the
executing arm of ASECNA(Agence pour la Sécurité de la Navigation Aérienne en Afrique et à
Madagascar) oversees air transport safety, and manages the LSS international airport and
regional airports. LSS's airport security agency (HAALSS - Haute Autorité de l'Aéroport
Léopold Sédar Senghor) manages airport security since its creation in 2003. So far, the LSS
international airport has obtained the category 1 safety standard set by the International Civil
Aviation Organization (ICAO) and is seeking the same classification from the United States
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Foreign airlines i.e. South African Airlines, Brussels
Airlines, and Delta Airlines are now operating passenger and freight services from LSS
International airport. Take off and landing increased by 17 percent between 2000 and 2006.
Passenger traffic increased by 43 percent between 2000 and 2006 and this trend is likely to
continue bringing among others, more tourists. Air traffic and safety have also improved because
of the modernization of the National Department for Meteorology (DMN). The DMN now
provides continuous weather updates for the entire transport sector. DMN's forecasts are integral
to safety in the air, on the sea, and on the roads, and inform farmers and others (see sub-section
3.3 Efficiency ­ Table 2). Overall, the outcomes sought for autonomous agencies and parastatals
in terms of improvements in financial performance, efficiency gains, and management capacity
have been achieved for AATR, CEREEQ, CARCHEM, HAALSS and DMN.

(d) Regulatory Reform Outcomes. In addition to the improved regulatory environment in the
road sub-sector achieved with the creation of AATR, regulations for testing and licensing drivers
and registering vehicles (including technical and environmental inspection established under the
Urban Mobility Improvement Project) are now enforced effectively throughout the country. The
time to get a license or car registration has been reduced from 30 to an average of two days (see
sub-section 3.3 Efficiency ­ Table 1). Stricter enforcement of licenses and registration has helped
to improve safety, keeping unqualified drivers and unsafe vehicles off the roads. Statistics from
Land Transport Directorate-DTT show that road accidents declined albeit unevenly from 4,074
accidents in 2003, to 3,277 in 2004, increasing to 3,446 accidents in 2005, but then declining
again to 3,107 in 2006. The road safety code sets strict standards for, among other things,
signaling, marking, and lighting of roads. Enforcements needs to be improved, but the pilot
project of physically installing safety measures (off-street parking spaces, bicycle lanes,
sidewalks, road markings and street lighting) has reduced accidents on the Niayes road from 371
annually in 2001 to an estimated 90 in 2007. The regulatory framework for rural transport
improved when the rural transport strategy formulated under the project was adopted in 2003.
The strategy also improved the financial viability of the DTT.

(e) In the maritime sub-sector, the adoption of the updated maritime code in 2002, helped to
improve the safety of maritime traffic. Together with the improvements in navigation and
signaling equipment at the ports of Dakar, Kaolack and Ziguinchor, a marked improvement of
safety and efficiency of maritime transport has been achieved, although no data has been
collected to confirm this at this time. The financial viability of the Port of Dakar improved with
the reduction of public payroll with the privatization of the container port. Passenger and freight
services between Ziguinchor and Dakar are now available three times per week compared to two
at project start, inspections of vessel safety standards are strict, and passenger and freight loads
have increased (currently 504 passengers and 300 tons of freight against 500 passengers and 100
tons before). Recently in 2008, the Government provided the private operator with a more
suitable ferry to replace the ship it had leased.




                                                 27

(ii) Objective 2: Encourage more direct private sector involvement in investment and
management of the sector. Rating is satisfactory.

(a) Increased private sector participation and management. The project has achieved three
difficult privatizations ­ Air Senegal, TRANSRAIL, and the Ziguinchor-Dakar Maritime Service.
In addition, management at LSS airport is now outsourced to the management company
Aéroports du Sénégal and security to HAALSS. Air Senegal has been privatized, although its
financial situation recently worsened in 2007, requiring a review of internal investment decisions.
The autonomous operations of the management and security services at LSS airport have led to
improved air services. The Civil Aviation Authority - ANACS has signed landing rights with
regional and international airlines and improved air safety. The security of the airport has been
certified by ICAO and a recent assessment by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was rated
satisfactory. The performance of TRANSRAIL which took over the exploitation of the
Dakar/Bamako line is improving as a result of investments that are being made in railway
operations. The railway infrastructure, rolling stock and signaling and communication systems
were in a poorer than expected state when it took over the line from the SNCS in 2003. A new
shareholder with a new management team took over in 2006 and has prepared an operation and
investment plan, requiring an investment of around 150 billion FCFA. About 20 billion CFA has
been invested from 2003 to 2007. Negotiations with banks, investors and shareholders (including
the Governments of Mali and Senegal) are underway for the remainder. The investments are
necessary to improve passenger traffic and services, reduce breakdowns and improve
communications. Freight traffic, after significant increases in volume in 2004, has stabilized.
Finally, in the maritime sub-sector, the exploitation of the Ziguinchor/Dakar line by the private
operator is better than before and economically sound. Service is likely to improve further with
the arrival of a new ferry in addition to the one provided by the Government. Overall the
privatization reduced the burden on the public sector and on the public sector payroll. This in turn
increased the financial viability of the transport sector as a whole, and of the transport agencies in
particular.

(b) The framework for Public Private Investment (PPI) developed under the project as a
best practice has contributed to the greater participation of the private sector in transport.
Management of transport services by the private sector is now the first option considered by the
Government, which is a complete change in approach compared to the situation at project
appraisal. In general, the privatizations achieved under the project are effective and sustainable.
However, the privatization under the project would benefit from more in-depth analysis to draw
lessons for future privatizations.

(c) In the road sub-sector, the number of Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) that compete for
and undertake road maintenance and rehabilitation projects has increased considerably (from less
that 15 SMEs in 1999 to an average of 92 SMEs in 2007). However, there is less than desirable
competition from larger contractors who operate region-wide which could positively affect the
price of road work. The Government is actively looking for private operators to participate in the
financing and management of new road projects using the PPI framework. An example is the
Government's collaboration with the Bank to establish the first toll road in the country (Dakar-
Diamniado). The technical, environmental and economic feasibility studies for the toll road
financed under PST2 confirmed the feasibility of a public private investment approach and form
the basis for the proposed Dakar/Diamniado Toll Road Project.

(iii) Objective 3: Stabilize and improve the condition of the priority road network, reducing the
long-run economic costs for road costs for road maintenance and rehabilitation in order to
enhance regional competitiveness and attain sectoral financial sustainability.
Rating is satisfactory.

(a) Sustainable improvements in the overall condition of the road network. The impact of
the improvements, with a total of 2,880 km of rehabilitated paved roads (100 percent of target),
and 3,870 km of periodically maintained gravel roads (86 percent of target), on transport services
and mobility is considerable based on incidental surveys and the data collected on road use and
road safety (see para. 53 (a) and (d) and sub-section 3.3 Efficiency - Table 1). The rehabilitated
and periodically maintained roads meet the standards of the 2000-2005 technical audits and
substantial portions of the gravel and paved road network meet the general roughness index9
(Data Sheet ­ F. Results Framework Analysis). The impact of the improved road network on
transport costs, one outcome to be achieved (reduction in freight rates and passenger fares) are
not directly under the control of the project. On the other hand, the long-run economic costs for
road maintenance and rehabilitation are likely to have declined due to the increased quality and
efficiency of the maintenance and rehabilitation work. However, the cost of the work per
kilometer which was measured increased compared to prices in 1999. This is attributed primarily
to oil related increases (affecting among others the cost of bitumen and cement), and lack of
competitiveness. The cost of road maintenance and rehabilitation increased not only in Senegal,
but throughout East and West Africa.

(b) Sustainable Regular and Periodic Maintenance. Both regular and periodic maintenance
are now executed under the annual road maintenance program and the three year rolling program
(PTG) which is a major outcome of the project. Maintenance under these programs by AART is
likely to be sustainable due to the mobilization of financing from a number of sources and the
increased budget for the Road Fund (from 15 billion CFAF in 2006 to 18 billion CFAF in 2007).
Data on improvements in road use are informative. Surveys by the DTP found an average
increase in vehicle traffic between 2002 and 2007 of almost 60 percent on five stretches of roads
after maintenance10. Forty-seven of the 65 district capitals are now connected to all-weather road
(94 percent of the key performance indicator). Furthermore, rural roads constructed under the
IDA funded National Rural Infrastructure Project have connected 120 villages with district
capitals.

(iv) Objective 4: Increase the number of district capitals with access to all-weather roads.
Rating is satisfactory.

(a) The project has helped unlock rural districts and villages, by linking them to the core road
network in addition to the rehabilitation of a significant set of rural roads, now passable in all
seasons. Forty-seven district capitals and 120 villages have access to the main network after
completion of patching potholes on 640 km of rural roads.



9 The General Roughness Index (GRI) uses a scale of zero to three for gravel roads where zero means "good" (routine
maintenance), one means "fair" (light leveling with some patching of holes) two means "poor" (heavy grading with
filling-in), and three means "poor" (filling-in or rehabilitation). The GRI uses a scale of one to seven for paved roads,
where 1-2 means "good" (no work required), 3-4 means "fair" (maintenance), and 5-7 means "poor" (heavy
maintenance or upgrading).

(v) Objective 5: Reduce poverty.
Rating: satisfactory.

(a) Potential Poverty Reduction Impacts. Increased mobility, particularly in the rural areas
where the project improved the road network, has opened up markets and opportunities for rural
residents. Access to markets to sell products and find opportunities for exchange and work is
likely to improve the income of the rural population and reduce poverty in general. The project
has created a substantial number of jobs (see (b) below) which have a direct positive impact on
family income. Improved road safety as a result of better road markings, the construction of foot
bridges and path, better safety inspection of vehicles, and stricter requirements for drivers' and
vehicle licenses are likely to have mitigated the potentially adverse effects of road accidents. As
a matter of fact, road accidents have declined during the life of the project nation-wide (para. 53
(d). Road safety could be improved further if parking spaces would be created for cars as was
done on the Niayes road in Dakar. In many streets in Dakar cars are parked on the sidewalks
forcing pedestrians to walk on the road. Freeing the sidewalks for pedestrians would reduce
accidents and save lives. Mitigation has also been achieved in the health sector. The HIV/AIDS
campaigns have increased awareness of prevention measures at bus stops and other transport
centers which in turn are likely to have mitigated the adverse effects of the spread of HIV/AIDS
infection. Mitigating accidents and illness has a beneficial impact on household income saving
households from having to spend on costly hospital or health care.

(b) Social Impact. The project has made tangible contributions to social issues such as
employment, education and health which in turn are likely to have contributed to poverty
reduction. The number of SMEs undertaking road work under the project increased from 15 in
1999 to 92 in 2007. These SMEs generated about 1,000 permanent employment opportunities.
The social impact of the project includes the creation of an estimated 7,730 jobs for temporary
workers on 13 road works projects for which employment data has been collected. CARCHEM
has helped mitigate the redundancy of the railway workers by assisting them with training,
entrepreneurship development, and actually placing 190 laid-off workers in permanent jobs.
CARCHEM also helped manage the social tensions resulting from the redundancy by providing a
venue for retrenched workers to express their views about the proposed mitigating measures. The
rehabilitation of Joal-Fadiouth Bridge has lastingly solved the threat of isolation for 8,000 people
who had been separated from the mainland by water. Besides the impact on mobility, the bridge
has a substantial impact on education as it provides daily access to schools for some 1000
children of which 530 are girls. With the support of the HIV/AIDS National Prevention
Committee, an action plan for the transport sector and HIV/AIDS prevention/mitigation measures
has been developed and implemented. HIV/AIDS awareness campaigns have been conducted
using guides developed under the project, and prophylactics given out by trained AIDS workers.
To address the potential impact on HIV/AIDS of increased transport and mobility, these
HIV/AIDS awareness campaigns have been conducted at busy transport centers such as bus stops,
garages, and railway stations.

(c) Impact on the Environment. The environmental impact of road work is now systematically
mitigated as a result of the standards and guidelines developed and included in all road work
contracts. Trained environmental staff of the transport agencies regularly monitors mitigation
activities. With Bank support, the Coordination Unit and the Road Agency co-sponsored a
regional workshop on safeguards and transport in December 2004. The workshop was successful
and achieved outstanding results with regards to strengthening Environmental Management Units
in more than 10 countries, mainstreaming environmental and social issues in transport, and
implementing Environmental Management Plans.

3.3 Efficiency

54.     Improved Operational Efficiencies. Efficiency improvements in the institutional and
regulatory reform parts of the project have not been measured in economic terms (cost-
effectiveness/least cost), but in terms of gains in procedural, process and service efficiency. At
AATR, efficiency increases have been achieved in the preparation of the PERA and PTG, in the
awarding and payment time of Road Fund contracts, and in production of technical and financial
audits. Now that the Road Maintenance Data Bank (RMDB) is operational, the efficiency gains in
the preparation of the PERA and PTG can be maintained. At the DTT, efficiency in the issuing
of drivers licenses and vehicle registrations, and the reporting of accidents has been achieved.
These gains are summarized in Table 1.

55.    The number of passenger traveling to and from the LSS International Airport has
increased substantially as has the number of take­off and landing as is shown in Table 2. In
addition, security inspections have increased resulting in the category 1 safety standard and
increased number of airlines using LSS. Also, the DMN is able to respond to weather inquiries
more efficiently.

56.      Economic and Financial Rates of Return of the Project. At appraisal, the Economic
Internal Rate of Return was calculated for the whole PTS2 program. The rate calculated at 35%
was considered high and was derived primarily from the largest component ­ roads rehabilitation
and construction. At completion, the data that has been collected indicates that increased freight
and passengers, shipping volume, freight and passenger rail and road traffic, and increased
vehicular traffic have been achieved in all of the sub-sectors, but the revenue increases have not
been calculated for the sector as a whole (Annex 3). Notwithstanding the limited revenue data,
the Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) has been recalculated for the IDA project only.
The EIRR for the project is 16.82%. It is based on the weighted average of the EIRR of the sub-
sectors supported by the project. The basis for the EIRR is described below.

57.      Airport and Air Traffic Sub-sector. The transfer of airport management and airport
security to autonomous agencies has created savings in terms of reduced public payroll. In
addition, enhanced security and safety measures have led to US safety certification at Dakar
airport and direct flights to the USA which creates significant additional traffic (Dakar is
currently the only airport in West Africa to have acquired such certification). Passenger and take-
off and landing volume has increased substantially. That and increased cost-benefit at the airport
results in an EIRR of 38.4 percent.

58.      Port and Maritime Transport Sub-sector.            Handling costs at the port have been
reduced substantially (the goals defined at the beginning of the project in terms of length of stay
in Dakar port have been achieved). Container traffic has increased in volume, as well as, in in-
port efficiency. Furthermore, savings at the port include the reduction of public payroll with the
privatization of the container port. These significant improvements translate in an actual EIRR of
31.1 percent.

59.      Rail Sub-sector. The privatization of SNCS has resulted in savings of public payroll
with a large decrease in the number of rail workers. The improvement in the cost-benefit ratio as
a result of increased freight and passenger traffic is small at the moment due to stagnating volume
in both. However, projections of future traffic volumes are very satisfactory. Rail traffic will
become profitable over a twenty-year period. The calculation of benefits and costs over the next
20 years results in an EIRR of 27.8 percent.

60.      Road Sub-sector. Benefits resulting from the improved road quality are substantial, both
in terms of travel times and vehicle operating costs (VOC).         In addition, benefits have been
derived from the reduction in road accidents, but these have not been quantified. The recalculated
EIRR is 13.1 percent.

61.          Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR).               The recalculation of the EIRR
established at appraisal shows that the project's actual EIRR is equal to 16.82 percent (calculated
through a weighted average of the EIRR for the different sub-sectors).

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating is Satisfactory.

62.      PST2 achieved the objective of obtaining a sustainable improvement in the supply and
performance of transport infrastructure (including services), in order to create an environment of
improved economic growth through expanded access and reduced transport costs. Improvements
in the supply of transport infrastructure have been achieved in the core road network, and in the
maritime and air sub-sectors. The performance of transport sector agencies improved in a
sustainable manner because of their increased autonomy and regularized funding, or because they
have been taken over by private companies. Increased access on the road, in the air, and in the
maritime sub-sector has contributed to economic growth through greater access to markets,
increased freight capacity and more efficient services. Overall transport cost has been reduced
certainly for the public sector. The reduction of the public sector payroll is significant and
improvements of roads have created benefits in terms of travel time and vehicle operating costs.
All objectives have been achieved with a few minor changes11 . The donors under the larger
program financed major component and in several cases substantially increased their
contributions to achieve the program objectives12. The Government has also achieved the
institutional reform, regulatory improvements and privatization objectives and financed its
counterpart contributions to the project and the program.

63.      Substantial Outcomes in Transport. The investments by the project and program
resulting in sector-wide improvements of the transport system are relevant to the economy and
growth, and contribute to employment and poverty alleviation. The project has laid a firm
foundation for the continuous up-keep of the classified road network benefiting commercial and
private road users. The employment provided under the project has benefited enterprises, as well
as temporary workers. Safety and environmental standards are enforced reducing accidents and
maintaining the environment. The project has helped to improve the efficiency and effectiveness
of the management and administration of the transport system, particularly of the roads, maritime
and air transport sub-sectors. These agencies have acquired more or full autonomy and
regularized funding. The management of the international part of the rail system by TRANSRAIL
is closely monitored by the Government with advice from the Bank. The other privatizations have
been effective and are relieving the public sector. Institutional efficiency gains benefit transport
sector clients and have improved the capacity of the transport agencies. The overall outcome is
substantially in line with the key performance indicators and expectations, despite delays
resulting from policy adjustments and resource allocation decisions by the Government.




11 The shortcomings include the construction of the Ziguinchor airport, lengthening of the runway at the St.
Louis airport, and rehabilitation of the port of Kaolack (the expansion of the Dakar airport planned under
PST2 is now done by the Government). These three activities out of 47 have not been done due to policy
adjustments and resource allocation decisions by the Government, and because it was not economically and
physically feasible to rehabilitate the port of Kaolack.

12 The AfDB, BADEA, BID, BOAD, CEDEAO, EU, FAC, FDS, and FKD have financed road
construction and maintenance. The FAC and EP have financed activities of the railroad component, and
the FND and EP financed parts of the air transport component. The port and maritime transport have been
supported by FAC, rural transport by EP, and environmental mitigation by FND.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

64.      Reducing the long-run economic costs for road maintenance and rehabilitation, attain
sectoral financial sustainability, strengthen financial viability of sector agencies, and reducing
transport costs in general and for the poor in particular were a series of related outcomes expected
to be achieved by PST2. The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) did not, however, provide
baseline data nor did it relate specific measures with any of these outcomes. Specific monitoring
and baseline setting started only after the mid-term review.

65.      Major benefits have been achieved, but the cost of road work increased. Overall
PST2 has contributed to increased economic benefits, reduced cost, cost savings, incremental
increases in revenue, and in value added. However, these economic benefits have not been
quantified for the transport sector as a whole except in terms of the EIRR (see sub-section 3.3.
Efficiency and Annex 3). The long-run economic cost for road maintenance and rehabilitation is
likely to have declined due to the increased quality and efficiency of the maintenance and
rehabilitation work13, however, the initial construction cost was substantially higher than expected
at appraisal (twice as much for rural roads for example). The 2007 study by the AfDB - Africa
Infrastructure Country Diagnostic Study - based on a sample of 24 contracts in 15 East and West
African countries concluded that substantial increases in unit prices for road work occurred in
every country included in the study (including Senegal). The study attributed the increases
primarily to oil related increases (affecting among others the cost of bitumen and cement) and
lack of competitiveness. The increases in the cost of oil are certainly outside the control of the
project, but competitiveness has increased. Notwithstanding the latter, costs have increased under
the project putting to doubt a reduction in long-term economic costs.

66.      Reducing the long-term economic costs of road maintenance and the related indicator of
lowering transport cost in general and for the poor in particular will continue to be affected by,
among other things, future increases in the price of oil.

67.      Attaining sector financial sustainability and strengthened financial viability of sector
agencies have been realized to an extent due to the mobilization of financing from a number of
sources which include grant financing and the increased participation of private sector investors.
Also the option of toll roads may contribute to these goals. Progress towards achieving financial
viability of sector agencies has been made under the project by, among others, the Road Fund and
the autonomous status of several agencies which regularized their financing from public, private
and external sources and make their management more like that of private enterprises.

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

68.      The project design mentions the benefits of better access to markets, services and schools
as likely to benefit women proportionally more, given their role in trade and services. Studies by
the Bank's education sector have shown that better access to schools may lead to increased
enrollment of girls. There is incidental evidence that women are more inclined to use better
maintained roads and benefit from the expanded rural roads network established under PST2 and
the parallel National Rural Infrastructure Project (NRIP).          An example is the footbridge



13No systematic data has been collected under PST2 or PAST about the long-term economic impact of
these investments in road rehabilitation and maintenance.




                                                    35

constructed at Joal Fadrouth which allows children to go to school located on the other side of the
water and women from the villages that used to be separated now able to trade and bring their
wares to the village markets. Based on an Impact Study (a sample of 850 households), which was
carried out in June 2005 under the NRIP project, results demonstrated that: (i) households
benefiting from NRIP experienced improvements in children's health in terms of weight and
height by age; and (ii) households needed less time to obtain access to essential services. Most
significantly, children of households affected by NRIP needed 10 minutes to travel to school
compared to 30 minutes by the control group.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

69.     The long-term capacity improvement of the transport agencies, particularly those that
were made autonomous under the project and received equipment, training and technical
assistance, is likely to be sustained. The legislative framework that has been created for these
agencies is unlikely to change in the near future, or during the useful life of the project.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

70.     Although the port component was dropped in 2005 when the Government decided to use
public financing for the container facility, IDA continued the dialogue to find an economically
sound approach. The technical and financial advice provided by IDA helped the Port of Dakar
authority to keep open the option for a private company to operate the container terminal. As
early as 2006, a company - Dubai Ports World was selected to operate the container terminal and
to participate in the port authorities plan to expand the port. Similarly, the expansion and
modernization of the Dakar airport planned under the project was rejected in favor of constructing
a new airport. However, expansion and modernization work at the airport is now being
undertaken by the Government and will be completed in 2008.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

71.     Findings from a Workshop with Contractors. In general, contractors and small and
medium enterprises (SMEs) who executed work under the Road Fund, said that the technical
standards set by AATR, the competitiveness of the contract award process, and the supervision
and audits, helped to deliver quality road maintenance work. Participants were, with a few
exceptions, pleased with the timeliness of contract payments, but expressed frustration with donor
funded activities with regard to threshold for ICB and complexity of procurement procedures.
They are also looking for more transparency in the short listing process for consultant services
and the bid award processes. The workshop was conducted in December 2007 as part of the ICR
mission (Annex 6).

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating is Moderate.

72.     Global Financial Risks. The probability that global or national economic changes pose
a risk to the remaining useful life of PST2 are moderate given the fact that the Government has
shown a commitment to meet the financing need of the sector and is drawing up plans to continue
to do so. However, one potential risk that could affect the government's capacity to continue to
finance the cost of operating and servicing the transport infrastructure established under PST2
would be future rapid increases in the price of oil. Senegal depends for its energy on imports and
rapid price increases are likely to affect the economy in general and the transport sector in
particular. The increase in oil prices on the cost of transport was substantial during


                                                36

implementation increasing the cost of maintenance and materials. It may also have affected
commercial and private road traffic, shipping and air traffic which has however not been
measured.

73.     Political and Sector Financing Risks. To a lesser extent, major changes in government
transport policies, commitments or resource allocation could pose a risk to the resource needs of
the sector and the project activities continuing during the remaining useful life of the project.
Earlier changes in policies did not substantially affect the achievement of PST2's objectives,
although it led to the restructuring of the project. At the same time, while sector finances have
improved the needs of the sector may pose a financing risk. The budget allocations to the Road
Fund have increased from 15 billion CFAF in 2006 to 18 billion in 2007. The expectation is that
the allocations under the second generation Road Fund will increase to 30 billion CFAF by 2012.
While this is a positive development for the road maintenance program, these allocations do not
cover the needs of the program (estimated at 45 billion CFAF as of December 2007) and other
sources of finance need to be secured. In addition to the Road Fund, the transport sector's
resource needs in the railway, air traffic, ports and maritime transport are also significant and
likely to increase if the Government goes ahead with plans to build a new airport and expand the
Port of Dakar.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating is Marginally Satisfactory.

74.     Preparation. Identification was good anchoring the proposed project securely in the
government's policies and plans. The proposed PST2 built on the achievements of the PAST
operation and addressed all outstanding issues in the transport sector. The Government was able
to do so thanks to the strong partnership with donors and the Bank. But addressing all outstanding
transport sector issues resulted in a large and complex project as was noted in the QEA3. It
required stable and committed sector agencies to prepare and implement institutional and
regulatory reforms (elections were a year away when the project was approved). Because there
was no mitigation built-in the project design for the effects of the change in Government and
frequent changes in the transport institutions which occurred early on, the Bank had to step-up
supervision and work closely with the new Government to keep implementation on track.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating is Satisfactory.

75.     The TTL who prepared and appraised the project moved after Board approval in March
1999. His successor found himself supervising a large and complex project which required more
attention before effectiveness. Moreover, the team had to work closely with five active donors
who had committed to financing activities in the project and in the larger program.             The
collaboration with the donors and partners throughout implementation was effective. The donors,
in several instances, increased their contributions substantially to account for increased costs and
to keep implementation on track. In addition, shortly afterwards a new Government was elected.
The coordinating unit CELCO, which had managed the PAST operation, provided much needed
continuity, good relations with sector agencies, and expertise in financial management,
procurement and coordination. Fiduciary supervision by the Bank was effective as was attention
to safeguards by environmental specialists. Throughout implementation, CELCO produced timely


                                                 37

and extensive semi-annual progress reports at the time of supervision. The dialogue with the
Government was facilitated by the 2002 plan that was agreed to move forward on strengthening
AART and the railway concession both part of the privatization and autonomy objectives, and to
reallocate funds to the road component. The plan also helped to improve the complex M&E
design (see sub-section 2.3) which was revised early in the project. Moreover, the supervision
missions worked with the Government and the donors to clarify the relationship between the 11
components of the program and the project financed by IDA (with 10 parts ­ Part A to part J) and
agree on the initial financial contributions of the donors for the program.

76.      Management allocated adequate supervision resources to deal with this complex project
from the beginning and the supervision team engaged the new government officials
constructively, even though the Ministers changed seven times. Management also closely
monitored and commented on implementation issues and progress in the PSRs/ISRs and
participated in supervision (management wanted crisper/shorter aide memoires and more clarity
and accuracy with progress monitoring indicators and compliance in the PSRs/ISRs).

77.      The third TTL took over in 2004 and was based in Dakar. He and the team were faced
with several adjustments in sector policy. However, dialogue with Government, stakeholders and
donors was maintained and began to show results. The team obtained Government and
management's agreement to undertake a restructuring. Non-performing activities and components
about which no policy agreement could be reached were dropped. The restructuring was
adequately documented and effectively carried out. The team subsequently managed to increase
disbursements and commitments and obtained three extensions from June 2005 till December
2007 to bring the project to completion.

78.      Overall, the Bank's supervision of the project, the engagement with the Government and
the partnership and coordination with other donors was satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating is Satisfactory.

79.      Effective and Sustained Partnership in the Transport sector. Despite the complexity
and the adjustments in policy early in the life of the project the Bank's supervision efforts and
engagement with the Government, stakeholders and donors were persistent and professional. The
collaboration with the EU and AfDB in particular was excellent. These donors participated in
supervision missions and both allocated additional financing to meet shortfalls due to cost
increases. Although it would seem that restructuring could have been done earlier than 2005,
however, as was acknowledged by the QSA6 panel, it took until late 2004 to reach agreement on
a restructuring that reflected the policy changes. The project team streamlined the key
performance indicators early on, but the frequent restructuring of the ministries and interlocutors
made monitoring difficult since there was, among other no stability in the ownership and
management of components and activities. Key indicators were streamlined at restructuring.
CELCO produced semi-annual progress reports included some monitoring data, but the systems
and capacity of agency staff to collect and analyze was weak until well into 2004. The Bank's
efforts to keep implementation on track paid off. At completion an estimated 98 percent of the
project activities have been completed and about 91 percent of the credit disbursed or committed.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating is Satisfactory.

80.     Sustained commitment to implementation. The quality of the sector policy, programs
and plans at identification was good and the preparation was marginally satisfactory, with the
exception of the coordination and partnership with stakeholders, donors and the Bank which was
excellent. The needs for institutional and physical improvements in the sector were large and
comprehensive despite earlier investments. Maintenance of the transport infrastructure in
particular was resource intensive and complex. With a few exceptions, the project was largely
ready for implementation at the time of effectiveness. The new Government, faced with a large
and complex sector investment operation just about to commence implementation expressed its
commitment to achieving the development objectives. Each transport sector minister was
committed to get implementation on the way, but in addition to managing their ministries, had to
familiarize themselves with complex sets of project activities. For internal reasons, the
Government changed the structure of transport ministries and ministers seven times between 2000
and 2007 which affected implementation progress. The Government, in 2002, made it clear that
it wanted to change agreements made earlier regarding private financing (BOT) at the Port of
Dakar, and the expansion of the Dakar airport. The Government remained open to discuss these
decisions and a number of related policy and regulatory changes were intensively discussed with
the Bank, donors and stakeholders.

81.     Meanwhile, the Government enacted decrees for the creation of AATR, RC, ANACS,
HAALSS and DMN and followed through with the reforms of these agencies. It also, went ahead
with the privatization of Air Senegal, the international Dakar/Bamako railway line, the Dakar-
Ziguinchor maritime line, airport management, and airport security. With a few exceptions,
counterpart funding for the Road Fund was adequate and on time. Relationship and coordination
with donors, partners and stakeholders remained good throughout implementation. The
Government has indicated that it would continue funding the operations of the project after
closing. This includes a commitment to funding the Road Fund for the maintenance of the road
system at a substantially higher amount to ensure up-keep of the road network and avoid, or at
least postpone, the need for rehabilitation.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating is Satisfactory.

82.     The performance of the implementing agencies, beginning with the Coordinating Unit -
CELCO, has been excellent. CELCO in particular has been wholly committed to achieve the
objectives, constantly attempted to resolve issues, maintain good relations with other agencies
and exercised good fiduciary management as well as sound reporting. The other implementing
agencies in the road sector such as AATR, DTP, CFP and CEREEQ, after making use of the
training, equipment and technical advisory services and studies provided by the project were able
to take on and execute their mandates. Similarly, in the air transport component, ANACS and
DMN after securing autonomy and benefiting from technical assistance operated effectively.

83.     Air Senegal and TRANSRAIL face operational and financial difficulties, but remain open
to dialogue. In the port and maritime transport sector, the agencies involved have implemented
privatization and are operating successfully. The relationship with partners is good. M&E was


                                               39

weak at the beginning of the project, but improved after the MTR and is now well-established in
the sector. The sustainability of the agencies during transition and the remaining useful life of the
project appears assured by their sound legislative basis.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating is Satisfactory.

84.      Two successive Governments and several transport sector agencies have been committed
to achieve the development objectives of PST2. Implementation was slow for the first two and a
half years, but picked up after firm agreement was reached on reform and financing issues and the
project was restructured. The Government has done its part together with donors, partners and
the Bank to accomplish the expected outcomes of the project. It borrowed the Credit funds for
the intended purposes with a reallocation approved by the Board.

6. Lessons Learned

85.      The Benefits of Comprehensive Sector-wide Institutional Reforms. Attempts in
earlier transport projects to reform transport institutions had limited success and at effectiveness
the QEA3 expressed concern about the ambitious reform program. However, the project took on,
among others, the objective of increasing private sector involvement in investment and
management of the sector and achieved this objective fully. PST2 also provided ample resources
to strengthen the institutions and brought about an improvement in the regulatory framework for
transport institutions. These three simultaneous interventions ­ private sector involvement,
institutional strengthening, and improved regulatory framework - proved that a comprehensive
approach rather than a piecemeal one does bring the intended benefits of reforms that are
sustainable. Although the privatizations of Air Senegal and SNCS have run into difficulties
(which are being addressed) the expanded capacity and increased autonomy of AATR, CEREEQ,
HAALS and DMN have led to improvements in transport services and in the quality of the air,
maritime, rail and core road network.

86.      Sustained commitment and partnership as a condition for effective implementation
and completion of a complex project. The QEA3 noted the complexity of project design and
the implementation risks attached to that. PST2 did face serious implementation difficulties and
delays, but achieved its objectives, albeit with three extensions. Two factors helped to overcome
implementation problems that were in part affected by design complexity i.e. many institutions
responsible for new approaches to their mandates and widespread and fluctuating financial
requirements in the air, maritime, rail and road subsectors. These are the sustained commitment
of the Government and the sustained partnership between the Government, the Bank and the
donors.

87.          The successful implementation of the preceding PAST investment led to a strong
commitment to continue the improvements in the sector commenced under the PAST. PAST's
success also showed that the Government, the Bank and donors could together bring about
substantial improvements in transport. The preparation by the Government working closely with
the Bank and donors solidified the partnership and despite a change in Government and changes
in sector policies, the partnership was maintained throughout implementation. The Bank's
supervision missions made major efforts to involve other donors and maintained an effective
dialogue with the Government. At the same time, the donors were ready to make substantial
contributions or, when shortage of funds hampered implementation as occurred with the
increased cost of roadwork, increase their financial contribution to the program as did the AfDB
and EU. Another example of excellent donor partnership was the EU's support for the transport


                                                 40

sector as a whole which is best practice in Senegal and the region. The EU also supported the
computerization of the Road Maintenance Data Base of DTP when the Road Agency found that
the data produced by DTP was incomplete and inaccurate. It is evident that commitment and
partnership have been important factors in achieving the intended outcome of PST2 despite early
concerns about the complexity of its design.

88.     Complex Privatizations in IDA financed projects. The privatization activities under
the project have advanced private sector investment and involvement in the transport sector
substantially. Air Senegal, TRANSRAIL and the Dakar-Ziguinchor maritime service have all
been privatized despite some initial resistance because of potential impacts on employment. In the
case of TRANSRAIL, the company inherited a deteriorated rail infrastructure, track, rolling stock,
stations, and workshops. Signaling and communication systems were also in poor condition. The
first management team was unable to make the company operate adequately and passenger and
freight services stagnated or declined further. The new management team has put together an
operations and investment plan that is going to require substantial investment from shareholders
including the governments of Senegal and Mali and from banks. The financial needs are large and
could be a drain on public finances. It is expected that the implementation of the plan will
improve services sufficiently and rapidly enough to make TRANSRAIL a viable company.
The privatization of Air Senegal, which was initiated under the PAST operation and completed
under PST2, has gone through a somewhat similar experience. After a successful 5 year period,
the company faced a dire financial situation in 2007. The government is looking for alternative
solutions to support the restructuring of the company.           These privatizations have been
accomplished within a well-defined Public Private Investment framework.           The framework
continues to assist the Government to examine further opportunities to privatize transport
infrastructure or services. It is hard to imagine what improvements in transport in Senegal could
have been accomplished without these privatizations.

89.     Use Proven Indicators for Monitoring and Evaluation. The design of the monitoring
and evaluation system under the project was complicated and optimistic with regards as to how
many indicators could be monitored. Moreover, some of the indicators, the ones related to
transport costs, were not feasible. Although the efforts to revise and simplify the M&E system
during and after the MTR and the 2005 restructuring were successful, the overly complex M&E
design initially obstructed effective monitoring of progress with implementation. The experience
with PST2 suggests that M&E of transport projects need to be based on a system of indicators
that have proven to be effective and measurable. In the case of Senegal with 16 earlier transport
projects, it should be possible to find those that worked in one or more transport projects so that
the M&E system can be built upon indicators which are country and sector specific and have
proven to enable sound monitoring of performance and informative evaluation of results.

90.     Independent and Stable Institutional arrangement. The decision to maintain CELCO
as the coordinating unit for the new much larger and more complicated PST2 project proved
effective. CELCO had effectively coordinated the PAST operation and during preparation it was
decided to keep the unit in place for PST2. The mandate of CELCO to coordinate rather than
manage implementation proved to be sound. PST2 activities were spread out over the five sub-
sectors of the transport sector and required coordination among some 40 transport agencies which
made coordination critical.      CELCO's staff was able to establish good relations with the
(frequently changing) staff of the agencies as well as with the staff of the donors and partners
involved in the project. At the same time, CELCO operated with a very small staff ­ two
permanent and a small number of part-time specialists. CELCO's institutional set-up as an
independent unit proved very effective.        Not only that it was a force of stability during
implementation, but also able to move between ministries during the many changes in the


                                                 41

structure of transport ministries and continue its coordinating role unimpeded by institutional
changes. CELCO coordinated the financial management, fiduciary and procurement activities
under the project with great care and attention to detail. The success of PST2 was in part due to
CELCO's proven coordinating expertise and institutional independence.

93.      Conditions for Readiness for Implementation are met. The project was initially not
fully ready for implementation because of the marginally satisfactory preparation and the great
complexity of its design. The overly complex design obscured the fact that conditions for reform,
procurement, and privatization had not been put in place and that implementation and policy risks
had not been adequately identified or mitigated. Not only that effectiveness required two
additional preparation missions, but it became clear early on that the preparation of the
arrangements for institutional and regulatory reforms and for procurement and monitoring were
not complete. Also, no mitigating measures had been put in place for changes in Government
institutions and policies, both of which occurred early on in the project. In addition, more work
had to be done to prepare the legislative framework for privatization, institutional reform and
autonomy of transport agencies, prepare plans for road maintenance work and processes for
bidding, contracting and procurement. The QEA3 rated readiness, risk management,
sustainability, and Bank inputs and processes as marginally satisfactory confirming that more
work should have been done to meet the conditions for implementation readiness. Hindsight
suggests that it would have been better to prepare a simpler project or to use different vehicles
such as program budget support to bring about the development of the sector and the execution of
sector-wide investments in infrastructure. The lesson from this experience is that the Bank must
ensure that all conditions for readiness have been met.

Summary of the Economic Evaluation

    1. The table below presents the EIRR calculated ex post for the four sub-sectors supported
        by the projects and the costs of each sub-sector at completion.

                                Roads             Railway             Port          Aviation

  Total cost (in                54.86              12.54              0.46             2.76
  US$ million)

    2. The overall EIRR for the project calculated as a weighted average of the EIRRs of the
        four sub-sectors is 16.82 percent.

(a) Roads Maintenance, Rehabilitation and Construction Subsector

    3. Summary of Benefits and Costs.             At appraisal, the Highway Development and
        Management Model (HDM-3) model was used for the economic evaluation. The model
        enabled initially forecasted project-related capital and maintenance costs to be compared
        with the economic benefits that would result from savings in vehicle operating costs
        (VOC), by calculating deteriorations in road roughness resulting from traffic and
        forecasted maintenance activities. The ex-post economic analysis was performed using
        the same method, with a new version of the software (HDM-4). The new version next to
        calculating the benefits from savings in VOC has the possibility to calculate benefits
        derived from savings in travel times which was done. This results in a more accurate
        assessment of costs and benefits.

    4. Assumptions.      The following assumptions were made: (i) adoption of two alternatives
        (without project / with IDA-funded components of the project); (ii) simulation over a 20-
        year period; and (iii) a discount rate of 12 percent.    The capital costs were based on
        actual expenditure in US dollars for the project, excluding VAT and inflation. Road
        traffic data from three different campaigns (1996, 2002 and 2006) were used. The
        situation at the beginning of the project was estimated through an extrapolation based on
        the first campaign.

    5. Non-quantifiable Benefits. Besides the economic benefits, other benefits have been
        derived from the project including: (i) an increase in economic activity; (ii) benefits in
        employment (2923 jobs during the lifetime of the project); (iii) the opening up of many
        rural areas. However, these have not been quantified in economic terms.

    6. Results. The results obtained indicate a Net Present Value (NPV) equal to US$0.121
        million and an EIRR of 13.1 percent.

(b)   Railway Sub-sector

   7. Summary of Benefits and Costs. The main quantifiable benefits for the railway sector
       include: (i) the increase in freight and passenger traffic; and, (ii) the reduction of public
       payroll due to savings in staff costs.

   8. Assumptions. The increase in passenger and freight traffic (measured by turnover), and
       the reduction of public payroll were based on forecasts by TRANSRAIL for the period
       from 2008 to 2017. These were compared to traffic and payroll data from 2007. Despite
       a reduction in the number of employees, TRANSRAIL forecasted no decrease in staff
       costs. Instead TRANSRAIL projects a small increase. However, this increase is largely
       compensated by the increase in traffic. The analysis was performed over a twenty-year
       period.

   9. Non-quantifiable Benefits.           Non-quantifiable benefits include: (i) efficiency
      improvements; (ii) positive impact on employment (creation of indirect jobs); (iii)
      positive impact on GNP due to regional integration with Mali; and (iv) savings from
      reduced derailments due to improvements in signalization and telecommunication, as
      well as, rehabilitation and reconstruction of both track and equipment.

   10. Results. Based on the cost-benefits analysis below, the EIRR was calculated to be 27.8
       percent.

(c)    Port Sub-sector

   11. Summary of Benefits and Costs.            The main quantifiable benefits comprise: (i)
      substantial reduction of handling costs at the port; (ii) reduction of public payroll with the
      privatization of the container port; (iii) GNP value-added resulting from increased traffic
      volume; and (iv) savings in container ship in-port efficiency (measured by average
       waiting time).

   12. Assumptions. Due to lack of data, reduction in public payroll was not considered in the
      analysis, and reduction in handling costs was based on estimates made before the
      beginning of the project.        As shown by the indicators, efficiency savings were
      disappointing (there was no reduction in the length of stay for goods in the Port). As a
      result, benefits in terms of efficiency savings were considered inexistent. The estimate of
      benefits from GNP growth was based on the turnover at the port of Dakar from 2000 to
      2007. To determine which part of the turnover increase was derived from the project and
      which was due to changes in traffic in the region, data from the port of Tema (Ghana)
      was used. This was a natural choice since Dakar and Tema are the two main transit ports
      for Mali. It should be noted that the port of Tema also benefited from a World Bank
      project which was implemented during the same time as PST2. This was taken into
      account in the analysis. The analysis was performed over a twenty-year period, with the
      assumption that the turnover at the port of Dakar compared to that of the port of Tema
      and would remain constant over the next 20 years.

(d) Civil aviation Sub-sector

    14. Summary of Benefits and Costs. The main benefits include: (i) savings in terms of
        reduced public payroll due to transfer of airport management and airport security to
        autonomous agencies; (ii) increased passenger and take-off and landing volume due to
        compliance to US certification. Other benefits forecasted at appraisal such as savings in
        terminal and runway maintenance have not been achieved since the Civil Aviation
        component was amended during implementation.

    15. Assumptions.       Data of passenger traffic volume between Dakar and New
        York/Washington (and reverse), as well as, data on the different taxes collected by the
        Leopold Sedar Senghor airport authority (for both passengers and planes) made it
        possible to calculate benefits from traffic increases. On the other hand, due to lack of
        data, the savings in terms of reduced public payroll could not be quantified, so only the
        first benefit was considered in the analysis. The analysis was done over a twenty-year
        period, with the assumption that the taxes received by Dakar airport would remain
        constant over the next years (which seems quite likely and is possibly an
        underestimation).

                          Summary of the December 2007 Workshop
                                                with
                          Private Sector Partners/Construction Firms

Introduction.    The meeting was held in the Novotel Hotel in Dakar and attended by 20
representatives from construction or consulting firms which had executed works under the project,
two representatives from donors, and two from the project coordination unit. It was presided over
by the PST2-TTL. The stated purpose was to draw lessons from the contractor's experiences
with the bidding, tendering, contracting, and supervision and hand-over processes for future
transport projects.

Problems encountered by the Contractors. The firms expressed concerns about short listing,
the poor quality of the bidding documents, payment delays, competition from international
bidders, and packaging. The criteria for short listing were considered to constrictive and likely to
exclude small firms from bidding. The bidding documents were often based on old and outdated
technical studies. Several contained incorrect or invalid specifications of the condition of the
roads to be repaired. These errors resulted in cost-increases on a number of contracts. In addition,
the firms said that there was a tendency among bidders to inflate the bids up to the estimated cost
in the bidding documents. Delays of payment for work done caused by billing errors had been
both difficult to avoid and remedy. Competition is unfavorably affected by the fact that the
capacity statements of international bidders were difficult to verify. Finally, the size of the
packaging of works often exceeded the financial capacity of the smaller local firms.

Suggestions and solutions presented by the Project staff. Staff suggested that contractors
regularly consult the information made available about bidding and procurement rules. Such
information would help contractors to meet the criteria for short listing. To address the problems
with technical studies and specifications the staff said that bidding documents will be modified to
ensure that consultants have the necessary capacity to do the studies and that funds are allocated
in a timely manner. Payment delays have been reduced, but the staff will continue to review the
procedures to address this issue. The size of work packages is under review and donors have
agreed to a minimum size of work packages that would enable companies to account for
depreciation.   As to foreign competition, the staff suggested that national contractors and
consultants should partner with overseas ones to augment their capability.

Conclusion. The meeting concluded with agreements to: hold these types of meetings more
often; change the guidelines to avoid the problems encountered with short listing and payments;
assist consulting firms with improving their technical capabilities; increase the effectiveness and
relevance of future selection criteria; and, enable contractors to consult guidelines and bidding
information regularly.

1. Context at Preparation

The Transport Sector Adjustment Program (PAST) which was closed at the time of the
preparation of the Project had brought about institutional, policy, and management changes,
particularly private sector management of roads maintenance. However, substantial weaknesses
remained in planning and programming of the road subsector; resources of the road fund
remained insufficient; the management of the core road infrastructure was inefficient; institutions
in the maritime, port, rail, and air subsectors continued to have weak operational capacities, as
well as, financial and human resources; and, a policy for improving rural transport and mobility
was missing. Plans for reforming the transport sector, in particular the Medium Term Strategy
Paper for the Transport Sector (MTSTS-June 1997) and the second Letter of Sector Policy
(LSP2), had been prepared to address these weaknesses.

Initial Objectives   The Project development objective was to obtain a sustainable improvement
in the supply and performance of transport infrastructure, in order to create an environment for
improved economic growth through expanded access and reduced transport costs. The specific
objectives to achieve the PDO included strengthening the transport sector agencies; more direct
private sector involvement in investment and management; stabilize and improve the condition of
the priority road network, reduce the long-run economic costs for road maintenance and
rehabilitation and achieve sectoral financial sustainability; increase the number of district capitals
with access to all-weather roads; and reduce transport cost for the poor. The objectives were not
changed during implementation.

3. Project Components

Initial Components. The components and activities were listed in the Development Credit
Agreement of May 13, 1999. Changes in Components The components were not changed, but
investment activities for the rehabilitation and consolidation of infrastructure and equipment of
the LSS airport and the port of Dakar were dropped as a result of a change in government after
the 2000 elections. The new government decided to build a new airport. In addition, SONAPAD
invested in the extension of the container terminal instead of the BOT initially planned. These
and other changes were reflected in the Agreement Providing for Amendment and Restatement of
the Development Credit Agreement dated March 10, 2005.

4. Evaluation of the Project Objectives

The objectives were in line with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of December 29, 1997.
The PDO appeared ambitious and unrealistic in expecting to lower transport costs. It was well
known that transports tariffs were generally lower than the cost of transport services. Also, the
large number of privatizations planned to be implemented were likely to be difficult in view of
the experience with earlier privatizations.

5. Achievement of Objectives and Project Outcomes

Overall Achievement of the Objectives. The principle objective has been achieved which will
have positive impacts on the economy. The institutional development objectives have also been
achieved.    Both capacity and operational efficiency of transport agencies has improved
substantially and private sector involvement in the management of transport services in the
maritime, rail transport has been expanded. However, several potential opportunities for private
sector investments in, for example, toll roads, and concessions for maintenance and testing
services which were studied under the project may only be realized in the near future. Access of
communities to all-weather roads has undoubtedly contributed to poverty reduction. The core
road infrastructure is much better thanks to rehabilitation and periodic maintenance.

Specific Achievements in institutional capacity, finance and efficiency of transport agencies.
Highly satisfactory sector wide results in this area include the creation of autonomous agencies in
civil aviation and roads, the privatization of railway and maritime transport, and the strategic
capacity of DTP and DTT. Achievements in private sector participation in investment and
management include the privatization of Air Senegal, CEREEQ and the railways, as well as, the
management of drivers licenses, vehicle registration, road maintenance, and potentially the
Dakar-Diamniadio toll road. Contribution to Poverty Reduction includes the improvement of
540 km of paved roads per year and 760 km of gravel roads per year which have created new
economic opportunities for rural people. Improvements in the Core Road Network due to
rehabilitation and periodic maintenance. This has had a positive impact on the economy which
has not yet been measured. The political dialogue as part of the Project has helped to create
PERA and secured the financing for road maintenance and the allocation of increased resources.
The access of district capitals to all weather roads has also been accomplished under the
Project.

6. Factors that have affected Project Implementation

The increased cost of road work has led to a reduction in the amount of road work under the
Project. Despite the change in policy to build a new airport the work planned under the Project to
rehabilitate the airport is actually being done. Implementation was also delayed by the 8 changes
in Ministers and Ministries and transport personnel.

7. Performance of the Bank and the Government

The contributions by the Bank during identification and preparation were highly satisfactory,
particularly the support for studies, policy discussions and strategy development. Seventeen
supervision missions by Bank staff including several with other Donors have helped to solve
implementation and financing problems.         Overall the performance of the Bank was highly
satisfactory. Identification and preparation by the government was highly satisfactory. Although
some policy changes led to delays overall the performance of the government and the project
coordination unit was satisfactory.

8. Lessons Learned

The training of government staff and the improvements in the working conditions and equipment
of transport agencies has contributed significantly to the success of the Project. In addition,
project staff benefited from consultation with specialists and from participation in regional and
international meetings about transport policies and regulations. On the other hand, the financial
problems that have developed with the privatization of Air Senegal raises questions concerning
the conditions of the negotiations, the quality of the financial audits, the government's
management of the private-public partnership and the capacity of the government's delegation.
This experience should be subjected to an audit.

            Annex 8. Comments of Co-financiers and Other Partners/Stakeholders


                          Contribution from Nordic Development Fund

Summary of the Nordic Development Fund concerning the financing and implementation of
                        Part C: Social and Environmental Sustainability.

1.       Introduction. A Social and Environmental Management Plan (SEMP) was prepared in
1998 as part of the preparation of PST2 to identify the institutional, legislative and judicial
measures necessary to control the environmental impact of the proposed transport sector works,
as well as, propose an environmental information and training program for people in the roads,
maritime, rail and air traffic sectors affected by the project.

2.       Initial objectives of the SEMP. The initial objectives comprised: (1) strengthening the
capacity of policymakers and partners to manage potential environmental impacts of the project;
(2) promote best practices; and (3) establish sustainable measures to deal with potentially
undesirable environmental impact issues. An environmental expert was recruited and assigned to
CELCO to help set-up environmental units at the transport agencies, establish a coordinating
committee, and develop environmental impact mitigation capacity at the agencies. The NDF
allocated 2.1 million FCFA for these activities. A detailed strategy and plan of operation across
the transport agencies and projects was developed to implement the SEMP. In addition, an action
plan, estimated to cost 350 million FCFA, to address the potential impact of HIVAIDS in the
transport sector was also prepared. Changes in the SEMP - the initial objectives of the plan were
amended by a adding a unit (CARCHEM) to manage the redundancies at the former SNCS, and
an action plan to combat HIVAIDS in the transport sector.

3.       Assessment of Outcomes. A new environmental code was adopted in January 2001 and
permanent environmental mitigation measures are now applied for every transport sector project
that is undertaken. The overall outcome rating of the social and environmental activities is
satisfactory for the: (i) capacity development; (ii) institutional development; (iii) regulatory and
legislative framework; (iv) HIVAIDS action plan; and, (v) CARCHEM. Capacity was developed
through workshops, and training programs for the staff of the environmental units established at
the transport agencies. In addition CELCO and AATR developed a guide for the management of
the environment in transport projects, and specific guides to analyze the environmental impact in
each of the subsectors and for DEEC. An environmental expert was made available to CELCO
for two years and environmental units were established at each transport subsector agency.
CELCO also provided financial and technical assistance for HIVAIDS activities across the
transport sector agencies. Finally, CARCHEM assisted some 300 redundant workers with small
enterprise training and financing. A number of setbacks were encountered such as the delay with
the signing of the NDF credit agreement. This delayed the initiation of activities to the end of
2000 and the provision of technical assistance to 2003. Also, changes in policy and restructuring
of transport ministries and agencies delayed the setting up of environmental units and activities.

5.       Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance.                The Bank and NDF assisted
CELCO effectively throughout the life of the project with the environmental and social activities
under PST2.      The Canadian Agency for Industrial Development assisted financially and
technically with the environmental activities at the PAD and DAC.            CELCO and AART
efficiently managed the implementation of the EMP across the transport agencies. Also, the
consultants and the enterprises who executed road work made substantial contributions to the
mitigation of the environmental impact under PST2.

                                              64

6.       Lessons Learned. The involvement of high level staff at the transport ministries
contributed to the successful establishment of environmental units and programs at the transport
agencies. The adoption of the SEMP substantially strengthened environmental impact mitigation
in the transport sector.
