outcomes were\n            satisfactory; the risk to development outcome was moderate;\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory; and the Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: The benefits of comprehensive sector-wide\n            institutional reforms. Attempts in earlier transport\n            projects to reform transport institutions had limited\n            success and at effectiveness the third quality at entry\n            assessment (QEA3) expressed concern about the ambitious\n            reform program. However, the project took on, among others,\n            the objective of increasing private sector involvement in\n            investment and management of the sector and achieved this\n            objective fully. PST2 also provided ample resources to\n            strengthen the institutions and brought about an improvement\n            in the regulatory framework for transport institutions.\n            Sustained commitment and partnership as a condition for\n            effective implementation and completion of a complex\n            project. The QEA3 noted the complexity of project design and\n            the implementation risks attached to that. PST2 did face\n            serious implementation difficulties and delays, but achieved\n            its objectives, albeit with three extensions. Conditions for\n            readiness for implementation are met. The project was\n            initially not fully ready for implementation because of the\n            marginally satisfactory preparation and the great complexity\n            of its design. The overly complex design obscured the fact\n            that conditions for reform, procurement, and privatization\n            had not been put in place and that implementation and policy\n            risks had not been adequately identified or mitigated. Not\n            only effectiveness require two additional preparation\n            missions, but it became clear early on that the preparation\n            of the arrangements for institutional and regulatory reforms\n            and for procurement and monitoring were not complete."}, "docdt": "2008-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
