The environmental assessment examines the\n            impact on the environment caused by the construction of\n            roads, railways, ports, and airports, envisaged to affect\n            natural habitats due to deforestation, river flows\n            disturbance, and landscape degradation, and, because of\n            abusive exploitation of construction materials, and mining\n            of phosphates and iron ore. Improper disposal of airplane\n            parts may induce radioactive hazards, which will further\n            threaten water, air, and noise pollution. These factors,\n            will affect rural and urban environments, due to water/soil\n            degradation, and, disturbances caused by gas emissions due\n            to increased traffic, respectively. Mitigating measures\n            re-enforce regulation of vehicle technical controls,\n            including the use of lead-free gas, and safety measures.\n            Hydrocarbon and oil spillage should be regulated in\n            accordance to established exploration measures, and\n            likewise, domestic and industrial wastes should be also\n            monitored, and analyzed. Wastes should be disposed of in\n            accordance with ecological trash collection, and disposal\n            regulations. Adequate site selection will maximize social\n            protection, as it will avoid disturbance on rural land, and\n            relocation of affected populations, and, public hygiene will\n            benefit from improved sanitation measures. A public\n            awareness campaign is recommended."}, "docdt": "1998-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
