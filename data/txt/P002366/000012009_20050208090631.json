and, b) Decision to use resources from bonds on the\n            local market for construction of a third berth of the\n            container terminal in the port, whereas private financing\n            was initially foreseen through Build Operate Transfer (BOT).\n            In addition, the implementation of the Civil Aviation and\n            Land Transport Administration components has been lagging;\n            some measures have been under way for one year without being\n            finalized, thereby preventing achievement of the\n            components' objectives, and, two new executing agencies\n            (Railway Concessionaire and Road Agency) were created, thus,\n            there is a need to take into account the transfer of\n            responsibilities to these agencies. Amendment to the\n            Development Credit Agreement (DCA) is justified based on the\n            need to: 1) reallocate funds; 2) take into account the new\n            executing agencies - the Railway Concessionaire for the\n            Railway Component and the Road Agency for the Road\n            Maintenance Component; 3) close the two Project Agreements\n            with the port authority and the former public railway\n            company; 4) close the Port, the Land Transport\n            Administration, and the Civil Aviation components; and, 5)\n            extend the Credit closing date. These suggested changes are\n            relevant to the project activities, and consistent with the\n            project development objectives."}, "docdt": "2005-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
