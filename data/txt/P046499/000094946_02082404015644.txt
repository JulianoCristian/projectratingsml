3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The Health Reform Project was part of the Government's Health Program, the objective of which was to
achieve a sustainable, performance-oriented health system, through: (a) modernization and improvement of
the quality and efficiency of the health system at the national level; and (b) (i) implementation of integrated
health reforrn; (ii) strengthening of the quality and cost-effectiveness of primary health care (PHC) and (iii)
improvement of financing and management capacity at service delivery level in East Kazakhstan (EKO)
and Almaty oblasts.
3.2 Revised Objective:
The original objectives of the project were not revised.
3.3 Original Components:
The Project comprised of four national and three regional components. The national components included:
(I) tuberculosis control, (2) health promotion, (3) health policy and evaluation, and (4) clinical training
centers for General Practitioners (GPs). The regional components were: (5) primary health care, (6) facility
rationalization, (7) financial and management strengthening. In addition, the project supported a project
management structure at the national and regional levels to coordinate program activities and manage the
project.
Tuberculosis (TB) Control: This component supported the Government's efforts at TB control. In
conjunction with USAID and WHO, the component financed nation wide activities to improve the diagnosis
and treatment of TB, and the adoption of WHO's recommended system for case management. The
component was to have financed: (i) initial and continuous training for TB and PHC staff at the oblast and
rayon levels; (ii) supply of anti-TB drugs for TB health facilities and PHC centers; (iii) basic tuberculosis
laboratory equipment relevant for diagnosis of TB; (iv) improvement of TB surveillance; (v) medical and
other supplies; and (vi) local and foreign technical assistance.
Health Promotion: With the technical assistance of WHO, this component supported five key areas: (i)
further development, publication and dissemination of a national health promotion action plan; (ii) baseline
and follow-up surveys on health lifestyle indicators among adult and children populations; (iii) professional
development and institution building for health and communication professionals; (iv) public education and
communication through an extensive health promotion campaign using print and broadcast media; (v)
design and implementation of national action plans on alcohol and tobacco.
Health Policy and Evaluation: The goal of this component was to strengthen the capacity of the health
care system to follow modem trends in health care and implement them in practice. The project provided
funding for: (i) monitoring and evaluating specific indicators; (ii) training of oblast staff and facility
directors in measuring indicators for project evaluation; (iii) training of oblast and health facility directors
in the use of indicators for their own management of facilities; (iv) developing capacity at the national and
local levels to evaluate interventions in the health sector; (v) carrying out operational research activities;
(vi) purchasing recent medical literature and materials at selected sites, and (vii) developing a framework
for evaluating and adapting medical protocols.
Clinical Training Centers for General Practitioners (GPs). The purpose of this component was to
develop a cadre of general practitioners to provide primary care throughout the country. This component
was implemented in collaboration with DFID, and was designed to help establish clinical training centers at
the medical higher education institutes (Almaty, Aktubinsk Astana, Karaganda, Semipalatinsk, and
- 2 -



Shymkent) and post-graduate medical institutes (Almaty and Pavlodar) to create an appropriate training
environment and improve the quality of training. The project was to support: (i) the rehabilitation of
appropriate facilities; (ii) the provision of medical equipment and supplies; (iii) teaching and office
equipment; and (iv) minibuses.
Primary Health Care (PHC): The project supported the Government's strategy to establish new PHC
centers. This included the reorganization of existing FAPs and SVAs, creation of urban family group
practices, training of GPs capable of providing basic services, and upgrading the facilities in which they
function. The focus during Phase I was on improving urban and rural PHC services in two oblasts. Based
on the experience in two oblasts, during subsequent phases of the project, PHC services would be
established throughout the country. The project financed: (i) initial and continuous training for PHC staff;
(ii) limited physical upgrading of facilities; (iii) supply of emergency drugs for urban and rural PHC
centers; (iv) basic equipment packages for urban and rural PHC centers including laboratory equipment;
(v) medical and other supplies; and (vi) vehicles, on a selected basis.
Financial and Management Strengthening: The objective of this component was to support the
development of new financing and management arrangements for PHC. The two pilot oblasts included in
the project had already initiated the process of health care financing reforms in rural and urban areas. The
project supported the continuation of health care financing reforms and in addition, strengthened financial
management mechanisms and supported oblast-wide training centers for managers and providers. With
financial support from USAID, the component financed: (a) technical assistance; (b) training; and (c)
computer and related equipment for MIS.
Facility Rationalization and Rehabilitation: The component supported and expanded the Government's
efforts in facility rationalization by promoting the merging of urban and smaller specialized facilities under
one roof to improve quality of care and efficiency. Specific rationalization plans were to be designed and
agreed upon annually during the course of implementation. The component provided assistance to: (i)
upgrade rayon hospitals, which, by their location, were not subject to any consolidation program; (ii) assist
efforts to evaluate options for consolidating facilities; (iii) manage the consolidation phase; (iv) physically
upgrade facilities where necessary to integrate functions. This component also supported reforms within
institutions to improve their financial and clinical outcomes.
3.4 Revised Components:
The project components were not revised
3.5 Quality at Entrv:
The project underwent a Quality Assurance Group (QAG) assessment and was given an overall assessment
of satisfactory. The QAG panel's report matches the review of quality at entry by the ICR team, i.e., that
the technical and economic aspects of the project were satisfactory. However, readiness for implementation
and risk assessment and sustainability were marginal.
At the time the project was developed, Kazakhstan was facing many of the problems faced by transition
countries. In the immediate years after transition, the Kazakhstan economy went into recession. This
contributed to a decline in the amounts of resources available for the health sector. The health system was
facing severe problems and there was an urgent need to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public
spending on health care. The health system, as in the other transition countries, was heavily biased towards
specialized care in hospitals and polyclinics, the primary health care system was weak, and the way the
system was organized, managed and financed did not create any incentives for facilities to deliver efficient,
high quality and consumer-oriented services. Health sector reform was badly needed. Therefore, project
identification was consistent with the needs of the country and the 1997 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
- 3 -



for Kazakhstan. The CAS stated that there was need for reorienting health services away from hospitals
towards outpatient-based primary health care, closing hospitals and/or reducing hospital beds and
modemizing health care treatment protocols.
Project preparation was carried out through a PHRD grant managed by the Government of Kazakhstan
(GOK) through the project coordination unit (PCU). The grant was used to fund foreign technical
assistance (University of York) for project preparation. The technical and economic work undertaken by
York was of good quality and the York team did coordinate with the government and donors. However,
York did not undertake a risk analysis that could have helped identify whether there was adequate
cofmmittment for the reforms at the republican and oblast levels.
Project appraisal was satisfactory. The appraisal team included an adequate mix of technical (primary
health care training, health care financing, TB specialist) and operations people. However, the institutional
capacity assessment carried out during the appraisal mission did not adequately assess the institutional
capacity needed to implement a large and complex project such as this one. It also perhaps overestimated
the level of govermnent ownership and commitment to the types of reforms supported through the project,
and did not identify this as a potential risk that would have to be actively managed by the project team
post-appraisal, and throughout the implementation process.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
Since the loan was cancelled at mid-term, it is not appropriate to judge whether the development objectives
of the project have been achieved. However, it is possible to judge whether at mid-term, the project is on
track towards achieving these objectives, and whether the objectives will be achieved if the government
continues to support the project through its own resources as it claims it will.
(a) Modemization and improvement of the quality and efficiency of the health care system at the national
level
DO Rating: Satisfactory
*   The process of revising clinical protocols has been initiated.
(b) (i) implementation of integrated health sector reform, (ii) strengthening of the quality and
cost-effectiveness of primary health care (PHC), (iii) improvement of financing and management capacity
at service delivery level in East Kazakhstan and Almaty oblast.
DO Rating: Satisfactory
*   Health reforms are being coordinated by the oblasts
*   Performance-based payment schemes have been implemented in East Kazakhstan oblast and are being
refined.
4.2 Outputs by conmponents:
Tuberculosis Control (Rating: Satisfactory)
Since the nation-wide introduction of Direct Observable Treatment (DOT) in 1998, the situation
regarding control of tuberculosis across the country is improving with a 42% reduction in mortality, a
decrease in incidence, and a cure rate reaching 83% although this needs to be confirmed through a
laboratory assessment. It is quite evident that the introduction of the internationally accepted DOTS
-4 -



approach has contributed to these successes. However, changes in leadership of the National Tuberculosis
Program (NTB) and Ministry of Health in 2000 has led to shifts in the overall strategy, which they feel
now more closely accords to the reality of the situation in the country.
Improving the capacity of diagnostic services through the supply of laboratory equipment at the
oblast and raion levels was fulfilled close to project closure. Some equipment has been delivered only
recently and awaits installation. While steps have been taken by NTB to enhance the quality of laboratory
services through the appointment of two staff to monitor and assist in quality improvements, more effort is
required in this direction. Training about DOTS has been undertaken, but considerable misdiagnosis of
tuberculosis is still prevalent. There has been no evaluation of behavior change among those trained. The
Government has financed anti-TB drugs from its own budget rather than project funds. The TB drug
component was added to ensure a supply of drugs in the case of an inability of the Government to finance
them. The Government has extended financing to second-line drugs for the treatment of multiple drug
resistant (MDR) cases whose prevalence is probably overestimated.
Project preparation and early supervision of this component was conducted by World Health
Organization (WHO) staff (Geneva), but this support was unfortunately dropped in the early stages of
project implementation. Close collaboration was sustained with USAID supported programs, especially
Project HOPE and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Their activities, in parallel with those of the
Bank supported project, have significantly contributed to successes in curbing TB to date. Their continued
support to the NTB, much of it through training, may be expected to continue to contribute to TB control.
Health Promotion (Rating: Unsatisfactory)
A staff member of WHO (Copenhagen) prepared this activity but, again unfortunately, availability
of the individual to assist ceased soon after implementation commenced. The project design entailed
considerable technical assistance. The latter fell foul of the desire by the Government to eliminate all
technical assistance from the project and so little has been achieved. The National Center for Health
Promotion, set up in 1998, has now morphed into the Center for Health Lifestyle. This center has benefited
from a study tour, some office equipment and computers supplied through the project and some workshops
were supported in 2001 but in the words of the current director, Dr. Aiken Akanov "There is virtually no
trace here of the Bank supported project". However, the Center for Healthy Lifestyle appears to be active
in addressing many of the concerns of staff at the time of project preparation, especially related to
cardiovascular diseases associated with tobacco use and alcohol abuse. The current set of programs is
assisted by interested donors and may be expected to be boosted by the declaration of 2002 as the "Year of
Health" by the President.
Health Policy and Evaluation (rating: Unsatisfactory)
The frequent changes in health sector leadership during the short life of this project was marked by
a diminishing commitment and even understanding of the reform agenda. This trend spelt the death knell of
any substantial policy development and evaluation activity through the project, or for that matter,
otherwise. Soon after implementation commenced, there was further discussion within Government about
how these activities were to be organized and managed, and it took some time to settle this issue. Again, the
foreign technical assistance so badly needed became embroiled in the overall rejection by the Government
of any intellectual inputs under the project on financial grounds. Project support was limited to some office
equipment, translation of materials and in a small sub-component, books for the National Medical Library.
The latter needed a major overhaul but that was not part of the project. York University, the contractor
responsible for preparing the project for the Government, correctly identified the need to ensure access to
- 5 -



modem medical information, but paid less attention to the complex needs for doing so.
Clinical Training Centers (CTC): (Rating: Satisfactory)
Early in preparation, only three CTCs were considered but, at the request of the Government
following appraisal, CTCs were to be established at all medical and post-graduate medical institutes. Later,
after consultation with DFID and the Agency for Health Affairs, the number of CTCs to be developed was
reduced to accommodate the limited capacity of the DFID to train at multiple sites. Finally, five sites were
agreed upon, two in Almaty, and one each at Semipalatinsk, Astana and Aktubinsk. Ultimately, only two
were completely renovated although all five locations were supplied with office and training equipment.
Renovations were conducted at Polyclinic 12 in Almaty, associated with the Family Medicine Chair of the
Kazak State Medical University, and at SVA 12, associated with the Medical Academy at Semipalatinsk.
These were two of the original three under the Bank project. Various fates affected the remaining three.
When finally agreement was reached between Almaty City Health Department and the Post-graduate
Medical Institute to use Polyclinic 2, time had run out. However, using resources made available through
USAID and the American Intemational Health Alliance (AIHA) some resources were made available to
conduct partial renovation. The facilities at polyclinic 2 in Almaty are now in use and offering a number of
family medicine related training courses. . At Astana, a new Rector stalled construction of a CTC at the
medical institute and took six months before approving all the plans that had been developed. By then it
was too late. Similarly, affairs at Aktubinsk moved too slowly. At a meeting with Dr. Doskaliev, Minister
for Health on December 2001, he advised the mid-term review mission that the Government would
undertake the necessary work at these institutions. To date, nothing has happened despite the fact that the
PCU had finalized and approved sets of documentation and drawings to enable the proposed renovations at
Astana and Aktubinsk to proceed.
Primary Health Care (PHC): (Rating: Satisfactory)
This component mainly involved training of general practitioners (GP) and paramedicals,
development of treatment protocols, rehabilitation and equipping of rural health facilities in Almaty and
East Kazakhstan oblasts and provision of emergency drugs to rural health facilities.
GP Training  The GP training was conducted in association with DFID and aimed to train a core of GP
trainers for the chairs of Family Practice who would then commence to re-train existing rural health
physicians as GPs. DFID wanted to await the completion of the clinical training centers prior to starting
their training programs. However, agreement was reached that they would make a start before the training
centers were completed, but a DFID commitment to a three-year program of training had to wait a year
and it was not until the fall of 2000 that the program started. With project assistance, the first group of 28
trainers from five centers have been or are being trained under DFID both locally and in the U.K. and
re-training of GPs has commenced. The first group of trainers is now engaged in training colleagues from
their respective institute and SVA doctors about family medicine. The general lack of support for
development of general practice at Ministry of Health level makes it difficult both for the rectors and
trainees. Enough of this crucial work may have been started so that it may not be turned back, but as
someone put it - "the baby is alive but cannot walk on its own yet".
The initial decision by the PCU not to purchase additional equipment to facilitate publication of
Family Doctor, the only such joumal in Central Asia, was reversed but too late for procurement purposes.
Paramedical Training  A similar program to the GPs was undertaken for paramedicals through three
medical colleges, at Almaty, Taldykorgan and Ust Kamenogorsk. The project has provided training
- 6 -



equipment, and supported a workshop to develop trainers who have started re-training existing staff. The
heads of these medical schools expressed a determination to continue the program using their own and other
mobilized resources.
East Kazakhstan PHC Facilities In East Kazakhstan oblast, rehabilitation of facilities began in 2001 when
49 (18%) out of a total of 268 such facilities in the oblast had work performed. Despite geographical
difficulties, this work has been conducted to a good standard through good management by the RCU at Ust
Kamenogorsk. All 268 facilities have received medical equipment based on a reduced list of 20 items, a
number dictated by the limitations of UNICEF's list, through which medical equipment was purchased.
Unfortunately, several pieces of one item of equipment was inadvertently sent to Almaty oblast but
negotiations are underway to rectify the situation. In cooperation with Almaty oblast and scientific
authorities in Almaty, some basic treatment protocols were developed and approved by the Ministry of
Health.
Almaty PHC Facilities: In Almaty oblast, rehabilitation also began in 2001 and 50 out of a total of 265
SVA's have been refurbished. However less control over the contractors was exhibited by the RCU and as
a consequence has led to mixed results with some refurbishment of good quality but some of very low
standard with no redress. It appears that some contractors were overpaid for the work accomplished.
Again, medical equipment has been distributed similarly to East Kazakhstan. Undoubtedly the move in
2001 of the Almaty oblast headquarters from Almaty to Taldykorgan while the RCU remained in Almaty
affected the RCU's performance.
Despite some problems in Almaty oblast, both staff and the communities in both oblasts are
pleased with the work undertaken and the re-equipping, the first in most staff's memory. Although a tender
for emergency drugs was approved it was not carried out due to loan cancellation.
Information Center  An Information and Medical Center was established in Ust Kamenogorsk under
the project and is a thriving activity. Although not formally established, a similar center is in operation at
Taldykorgan for Almaty oblast .
Financial and Management Strengthening: (Rating: Satisfactory)
East Kazakhstan oblast has built upon the health care financing reforms introduced at project
initiation and supported through the project. All rural ambulatories (SVA) in EKO have been granted legal
status and autonomy to manage their own resources, and are receiving a capitation payment from the oblast
of 36 Kazakh Tenge per person per month. This capitation payment is adjusted for demographics. The
Oblast Health Department is contracting with SVAs, and a range of performance indicators have been
defined to hold the providers accountable. A Management Information System (MIS) has been developed,
an open enrollment campaign has been carried out, and data from the enrollment campaign is currently
being compiled in this database. There is interest on the part of EKO to continue the reforms initiated under
the project, and to encourage the development of partial fund holding. In Almaty oblast, all facilities are
legally independent entities, but financing reforms for primary care have not been introduced as yet, and
facilities are paid according to the old system of line items.
Financial management training seminars have been carried out in both oblasts. The activities under
this component have been implemented in a generally weakening envirorment for the type of health care
financing reforms supported through the project. For example, in December 1998, the pooling of funds was
threatened by the conversion of the Mandatory Health Insurance Fund into the Center for Health
Purchasing, and the laws on state procurement and treasury create barriers for full autonomy in resource
-7 -



allocation and use at the facility level. The type of reformns supported through the project need
considerable technical support and assistance before their full benefits in terms of improved provider
performnance and accountability can be achieved. In addition, there is scope for improving the indicators on
the basis of which the contracts are made, with more attention being paid to the referral patterns under a
capitation-based system, rather than infant and maternal mortality rates. The technical assistance provided
by the USAID-fmanced ZdravReform Project (now called ZdravPlus Project) has been key to the
implementation of activities financed under this component.
Facility Rationalization and Rehabilitation: (Rating: Unsatisfactory)
Intended to assist the Government increase efficiency in the hospital sector, there were no
achievements despite considerable discussion during supervision missions and no disbursements under this
activity. Progress was hampered by the inability to acquire the essential technical assistance necessary for
progress to be made.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:

4.4 Financial rate of return:
N/A
4.5 Institutional development impact:
The project has assisted in GP training, and the continuation of these training efforts is likely to have an
institutional development impact, and contribute to strong local capacity in GP training. In addition, the
project has supported inputs for other institutions (e.g. Centers for Health Lifestyle) which has contributed
to existing institutional capacity. In EKO, the capacity of the RCU, which has now been integrated into the
Oblast Health Department, has been built on primary health care reforms.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
S. 1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
The anticipation of improvement in economic conditions from oil revenues was a factor in the cancellation
of the loan by the Government of Kazakhstan (GOK) since it is now believed that the Government will
have enough resources to finance project inputs.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
There were several factors within government control that negatively affected project implementation and
outcome. The most important was the frequent changes in individuals responsible for the health sector in
the country; a lack of a health sector strategy and vision that had been discussed, debated and accepted by
key stakeholders at the republican and oblast levels; and a declining commitment to the health sector as
evidenced by the fact that between 1998 and late 2001, Kazakhstan did not have a Ministry of Health.
Between 1998 and 2000, there were four new persons responsible for the health sector. In 1998, the
Ministry of Health was merged into the Ministry of Health, Education and Sports. Subsequently, in 1999,
the functions of the health section of the Ministry of Health, Education and Sports were entrusted to an
Agency for Healthcare. The Agency, which reported to the First Deputy Prime Minister, had less status
than a ministry since the Chair of the Agency did not have representation in the Cabinet of Ministers. The
reluctance of GOK to use existing loan funds for technical assistance and training also played a role.
Another key factor was the limited understanding among key policy makers in the health and other sectors
(e.g. Ministry of Finance) of how the type of primary health care reforms supported through the project
could benefit the country. Finally, suspicion regarding the role, functioning and activities of the PCU led to
- 8 -



considerable delays in implementation. For example, in 2000, the Government launched an investigation
into procurement activities of the PCU. No evidence was found of any mis-procurement, but it delayed the
work of the PCU by six months.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
It was recognized quite early in the implementation process, that the implementation agency needed more
staff to adequately manage the needs of the project and ensure quality. However, no action was taken on
this front. The Crown Agents representatives initially assigned to the PCU were not suited for the position
and there was rapid turn over in consultants unless one suited to the job was identified and placed. After
this the quality of technical assistance provided by Crown Agents improved significantly. Between 1998 -
2000 (completion of project preparation and first year of project implementation), leadership of the health
sector at the Republican level changed four times. In this politically unstable environment, the PCU
continued to work on the project, and there are indications that the PCU increasingly-began to operate as an
independent unit in charge of implementing the Bank project, but not as a cohesive a part of key
governmental agencies responsible for the health sector at the Republican level. The premature departure
of the project director did not help matters.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
There were no significant cost changes in the project
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationalefor sustainability rating:
The prospects for sustainability are unlikely. The policy environment for the implementation of the type of
primary health care reforms supported through the project does not currently exist at the highest levels of
the government in Kazakhstan. The current Ministry of Health has even issued a letter to all city health
centers abolishing family group practices (FGP). In the absence of sustained national leadership and
technical support, major structural changes in the health care system cannot be continued nor sustained. At
the Republican level, there is little indication that financial resources are available to finance project inputs
at the national and/or regional levels. In the East Kazakhstan oblast there is political commitment for
implementing primary health care reforms and continuation of project activities. Nonetheless, the
successful implementation of these reforms will have to coincide with the rehabilitation of facilities,
provision of medical equipment, and technical assistance for further refining and strengthening the reforms.
It is unlikely that EKO and Almaty oblasts will have additional resources to support project investments.
Evaluation of facility-level financing provides indication that the amounts currently available for facilities
does not cover operations and maintenance.- For example, in the East Kazakhstan oblast, it is estimated that
55 Kazakh Tenge per capita per month (approximately 35 cents) is adequate for covering the recurrent
costs of the facilities. However, the oblast administration can only finance 36 Kazakh Tenge. Facilities
admitted that their first priority is to pay doctors and purchase medical supplies and drugs. This leaves
little for remaining recurrent expenditures, including building and medical equipment maintenance and
repair. This is a concern with regards to the sustainability of project investments.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
The foundation on which the project was based, i.e., government interest and commitment in implementing
primary health care based on international models of family medicine/general practice has been deeply
eroded. In this context, there is little anticipation of transition of project activities to regular operations.
The only place where some commitment to reform exists is in East Kazakhstan oblast. If there are no
changes in leadership in this oblast, and provided funds and technical support are available, it may be
expected that project activities will be transitioned into regular operations.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
Satisfactory. There was continuity in the project team that developed the project and the Bank worked in
partnership with other donors such as USAID, WHO and DFID. The Bank was responsive to the
Govemrnment's concems, while at the same time ensuring that the project did not become too large and
complex. For example, the Government wanted to implement the project on a national scale, and the Bank
made good technical arguments that piloting was critical, and the expansion of the pilots should be
supported through a follow-on operation. The Bank could have been more proactive and sensitive to the
rapidly changing political environment and its implications for the design of the project. For example, in
between project appraisal and negotiation (December 1998), an important change in the health care
financing area occurred, and the system of pooling public funding for the health sector was revoked. The
merging of the oblasts created additional issues for the Bank to consider in terms of project design. Even
before the project became effective, it was becoming clear to several people working on the ground (e.g.
ZdravReform) that govenmment commitment towards the type of reforms supported by the project was
weakening. Further changes in the political environment in between 1999-2000 and the fact that the new
leaders in the health sector at the republican level did not understand the reforms proposed under the project
added to existing problems. Although there was no predicting the outcome, i.e., cancellation of the loan, the
Bank could have been more proactive about identifying project risks and ensuring that the design of the
project mitigated these risks through enhancing stakeholder participation and ownership.
7.2 Supervision:
Satisfactory. There was continuity in the Bank supervision team, and even when the task teaxn leader for
the team changed, other key team members remained. The Bank adequately flagged issues and concems.
However, the supervision mission perhaps did not pay adequate attention to the achievement of the
development objectives of the project, since the political environment for reform began to change soon after
the project became effective and there was a growing rift between the Ministry of Health and the PCU. For
example, it was clear to many people working here that the PCU, in response to the frequent changes in
Ministers was beginning to act independently. It did not help that the Ministry perceived the PCU as acting
independently from the Ministry of Health. Bank supervision mission could have perhaps been more active
in the mitigation of these risks.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
Satisfactory. The situation in the country was complex, and there was some indication of govemment
interest in borrowing for the types of reforms supported through this project. At the same time, there
existed a group at the republican level of government that was not entirely convinced that the proposed
project was what the country needed at that time. This group was developing their own health sector
strategy, which at the conceptual level (primary care, health promotion) was similar to the Bank project,
but very unclear about the path and approach that it expected to take in achieving these goals. This
contributed to the complexity of the political environment within which the project was finalized and
became effective.
The Bank was correct in its diagnosis that given the country demands and needs (implementation
throughout the country) and the complexity of reforms supported through the project, an APL was the
correct instrument. An APL allowed the Bank the flexibility to quickly process the loan, and remain
flexible in its approach while continuing to be responsive to client needs. However, the fact that there were
rifts in the health policy approach and direction within different groups in the government, and there was
not overwhelming support for the reforms supported by the project, provided an opportunity for the Bank
10 -



to continue the policy dialogue on primary health care reform in the country. This opportunity was not fully
exploited by the Bank.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
Unsatisfactory. The MOH represented by the PCU was involved in project preparation. However, key
governmental bodies and personnel at the republican and oblast levels were not necessarily involved. At the
time the Bank was working with the Government to prepare this project, there was a separate high level
group working on a health policy for Kazakhstan and little was done by the Government to ensure that the
two activities were coordinated.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
Unsatisfactory. The Government has done little to support project implementation, and in fact actively
created barriers for the implementation agency. For example, in October 2000, it initiated a detailed
intemal audit investigation into PCU activities , which delayed implementation by several months.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
Unsatisfactory. Given the constraints under which it operated, PCU performance was satisfactory.
Not only was this the first time that the PCU was implementing a Bank project, but ever since
implementation was initiated, it has faced numerous problems (problems with the first Crown
Agents consultant, Government investigation).
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Unsatisfactory. For the reasons already stated, Borrower performance during project preparation and
supervision has been unsatisfactory.
8. Lessons Learned
The Need for Country Ownership and Support: One of the key lessons from this project is the need for
strong country ownership and support of reforms. As has been highlighted in the ICR, the political
environment within which the project was prepared, negotiated and subsequently implemented became
increasingly uncertain and fragile. In the early stages, key persons supported the reforms. For example,
around the time the project was appraised, the GOK passed a far reaching Prikaz (decree) on primary
health care reforms that would be supported and implemented in the country. However, more recently
every time there was a new person in-charge of the health sector the original concepts of primary health
care were eroded. The fact that there was no health sector policy that had been widely discussed, debated
and accepted at the republican and oblast levels had an adverse effect on development of family medicine.
The present ministry is moving the organization of health service delivery back to older models of patient
care.
Identification and Proactive Management of Risks: Health sector reform of the nature supported through
this project is inherently political, and the success of these reforms depends on the careful marrying of the
political dimensions of reforms with its technical aspects. Identification of project risks based on an
assessment of the political environment for reform (for example through a political mapping exercise and
social assessment) is needed for the Bank to adequately identify risks. In addition, once these risks are
identified, the Bank needs to work proactively to manage these risks by careful leveraging of the Bank's
resources.
Actively Enzaee Partners: Others donors with an on-the-ground presence can play a very important role
in keeping abreast of developments within the country that could influence the implementation of Bank
- 11 -



projects. Close coordination with donors, based on a relationship of mutual trust, is an important ingredient
in project success. _
Improving knowledge and understanding of Bank operations and the project among clients: Among
new borrowers such as Kazakhstan, there is often a great deal of misunderstanding and confusion regarding
how the Bank functions, the role of the PCU vis-a-vis the Government, and the roles and responsibilities of
various agencies involved in implementation. It would be useful for the Bank to have frequent meetings and
workshops during missions to inform a wide range of stakeholders about the Bank project, implementation
arrangements and roles and responsibilities. This can greatly help in making the implementation of Bank
project transparent and clarifying accountability mechanisms.
