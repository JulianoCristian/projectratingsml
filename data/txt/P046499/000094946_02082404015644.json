Among the\n            lessons learned, it is reinforced that strong country\n            ownership is essential to support reforms. As it so\n            happened, the political environment in the country was\n            fragile, and increasingly uncertain, which hampered reforms,\n            and eroded new concepts, originally established for primary\n            health care. In fact, the absence of a health sector policy\n            (though widely discussed, debated, and accepted at the\n            republican, and oblast (local) levels early on), had adverse\n            effects on the development of family medicine care. The\n            nature of health sector reforms, as supported by this\n            project, is inherently political, and its success depends on\n            the careful integration of the political dimensions of\n            reform with health technical aspects. Thus, identification\n            of project risks, based on assessment of the political\n            environment for reform - through a political mapping\n            exercise and social assessment - is needed, and the Bank\n            should identify risks, and focus on a proactive risk\n            management approach, leveraging the Bank's resources.\n            Additionally, an important element for project success, is\n            to maintain close coordination with donors."}, "docdt": "2002-06-14T00:00:00Z"}
