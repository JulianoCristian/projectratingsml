Lessons address: 1) Project design, to\n            be limited, and realistic, to clearly define development\n            objectives. Performance indicators should be identified to\n            clarify the linkages between objectives, and interventions,\n            and, the design of the project, and its institutional\n            implementation arrangements be carefully adapted to the\n            specific institutional capacity, and overall institutional\n            environment. 2) Adaptability in project implementation, to\n            allow flexible adjustment during project implementation in\n            accordance with changing circumstances and needs. 3)\n            Institutional arrangements, particularly the right use of a\n            project implementation unit (PIU), as a means to solve\n            weaknesses in the executing agency, through explicit\n            assessment of institutional tradeoffs, and risks, at the\n            outset, clearly defining collaborative arrangements between\n            the line agency, and the PIU. 4) Community participation,\n            which despite not being anticipated in this project design,\n            it evolved naturally during implementation, and became most\n            effective during supervision, through active collaboration\n            among the local community, parents, and teachers. 5)\n            Communication strategy, is highlighted as a needed tool\n            within this project, for although active participation was\n            evident, the communication strategy could have enhanced a\n            steady flow of information to stakeholders."}, "docdt": "2000-11-29T00:00:00Z"}
