Re:
Credit No. 2443-BO (Environmental Technical Assistance Project)
Third Amendment to the Development Credit Agreement
 Dear Sirs:
Please refer to the Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of Bolivia 
(the Borrower) and the International Development Association (the Association) dated 
December 21, 1992, as amended on January 11, 1994 and December 16, 1994.
Pursuant to our discussion on the matter, we are pleased to inform you that the 
Association hereby agrees to amend the Development Credit Agreement as follows:
1.
Schedule 1:
 
(a)
Category (5) in the table in paragraph 1 is hereby amended to read as set 
forth in the Annex to this amendment letter.
(b)
A new paragraph is added after paragraph 3 to read as follows:
 
"4.  The Association may require withdrawals from the Credit Account to 
be made on the basis of statements of expenditure for expenditures under: (a) 
contracts for goods to be awarded under Part A.2 of Section I of Schedule 3 to 
this 
Agreement; (b) contracts for the employment of consulting firms costing 
less 
than $50,000 equivalent; (c) contracts for the employment of individual 
consultants costing less than $25,000 equivalent; and (d) Categories (3), (4) 
and 
(5) set forth in the table in paragraph 1 of this Schedule, all under such 
terms 
and conditions as the Association shall specify by notice to the 
Borrower.".
2.
Schedule 3:
 
Section II is hereby amended to read as follows:
"1.   Consultants' services shall be procured under contracts awarded in 
accordance with the provisions of the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants 
by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency" published 
by the Bank in August 1981 (the Consultant Guidelines).  For complex, 
time-based assignments, such contracts shall be based on the standard form of 
contract for consultants' services issued by the Bank, with such modifications 
as 
shall have been agreed by the Association.  Where no relevant standard 
contract documents have been issued by the Bank, other standard forms 
acceptable to the Association shall be used.
2.    Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Section, the 
provisions of the Consultant Guidelines requiring prior Association review or 
approval of budgets, short lists, selection procedures, letters of invitation, 
proposals, evaluation reports and contracts shall not apply to: (a) contracts 
for 
the employment of consulting firms estimated to cost less than $50,000 
equivalent each; or (b) contracts for the employment of individual consultants 
estimated to cost less than $25,000 equivalent each.  However, said exceptions 
to 
prior Association review shall not apply to: (a) the terms of reference for 
such 
contracts; (b) single-source selection of consulting firms; (c) 
assignments of a critical nature, as reasonably determined by the Association; 
(d) 
amendments to contracts for the employment of consulting firms raising the 
Page  2
contract value to $50,000 equivalent or above; (e) amendments to contracts for 
the 
employment of individual consultants raising the contract value to $25,000 
equivalent or above.".
This amendment letter shall be executed in two counterparts each of which shall 
be an original and shall become effective on the date the Association has received one 
fully executed original of this amendment letter. Please confirm your agreement to the 
foregoing amendment by signing and dating the two counterparts of this amendment 
letter. Upon your confirmation, please return one fully executed original to us.
Sincerely,
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
