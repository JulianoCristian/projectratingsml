The project was\n            substantially changed by the cancellation of investment and\n            core infrastructure activities and a revised objective\n            focusing on providing technical assistance and strengthening\n            the institutional capacity of Border States.  Lessons\n            learned, including the following, were in the areas of\n            project design and implementation, administrative\n            procedures, procurement procedures, and financial resources.\n            The project preparation phase should consider possible\n            changes financial and economic conditions over the duration\n            of the project.  Both project design and implementation need\n            to be sufficiently flexible to accommodate changes in\n            priorities.  Second tier institutions can be more effective\n            in carrying out environmental management activities. Future\n            operations should emphasize technical assistance and the\n            increased probability of program sustainability associated\n            with the Bank's participation.  The project design\n            phase should pay attention to the flow of funds to the\n            implementing agencies.  A detailed analysis of the\n            administrative procedures should be carried out during\n            project preparation.  The Operations Manual should\n            explicitly describe procedures, including eligible\n            expenditures and procurement.  Before effectiveness, details\n            of procurement procedures and a project procurement plan\n            must be agreed upon.  Capacity building and technical\n            assistance on procurement procedures should be made\n            accessible throughout project implementation.  The flow of\n            financial resources needs to be more agile and direct."}, "docdt": "2004-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
