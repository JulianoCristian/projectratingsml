 About this Report
      The Operations EvaluationDepartmentassesses the programsand activitiesof the World Bank for two
 purposes:first, to ensurethe integrityof the Bank'sself-evaluation process andto verify that the Bank'swork is
 producingthe expected results, and second, to helpdevelop improveddirections, policies, and proceduresthrough
 the dissemination of lessonsdrawnfrom experience.As part of this work, OED annuallyassesses about 25 percentof
the Bank's lendingoperations. Inselectingoperationsfor assessment, preferenceis givento those that are
 innovative, large, or complex; thosethat are relevantto upcomingstudiesor country evaluations; those for which
 Executive Directors or Bank managementhaverequestedassessments;and those that are likelyto generate
 important lessons.The projects,topics, and analytical approachesselectedfor assessmentsupport larger evaluation
studies.
      A ProjectPerformanceAssessment Report(PPAR) is basedon a review of the ImplementationCompletion
 Report(a self-evaluationby the responsibleBank department)and fieldwork conducted by OED. To prepare
 PPARs, OED staff examine projectfiles and other documents, interviewoperationalstaff, and in most casesvisit
the borrowingcountryfor onsitediscussions with projectstaff and beneficiaries.The PPARtherebyseeks to
validate and augment the informationprovidedinthe ICR, as well as examine issuesof special interestto broader
OED studies.
      Each PPAR is subjectto a peer review process and OED managementapproval. Once clearedinternally,the
?PAR is reviewedby the responsibleBank department and amendedas necessary. The completed PPAR is then
sent to the borrowerfor review; the borrowers' comments are attachedto the document that is sent to the Bank's
Boardof ExecutiveDirectors.After an assessment report has been sent to the Board,it is disclosedto the public.


About the OED RatingSystem
      The time-testedevaluationmethods used by OED are suited to the broad rangeof the World Bank's work.
The methodsoffer bothrigor and a necessary levelof flexibilityto adapt to lendinginstrument, projectdesign, or
sectoralapproach. OED evaluators all applythe same basic method to arrive at their project ratings. Followingis
the definitionand ratingscale usedfor each evaluationcriterion (more informationis availableon the OED website:
http://worldbank.org/oed/eta-mainpage.html).
      Relevanceof Objectives: The extent to whichthe project's objectivesare consistentwith the country's
currentdevelopmentprioritiesandwith current Bank countryand sectoral assistancestrategiesand corporate
goals (expressedin PovertyReduction StrategyPapers, CountryAssistanceStrategies,Sector Strategy Papers,
OperationalPolicies).Possibleratings: High, Substantial,Modest, Negligible.
      Efficacy: The extent to which the project's objectiveswere achieved, or expectedto beachieved,taking into
accounttheir relativeimportance. Possibleratings: High, Substantial,Modest, Negligible.
      Efficiency: The extent to whichthe projectachieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higherthan the
opportunitycost of capitaland benefits at leastcost comparedto alternatives.Possibleratings: High, Substantial,
Modest, Negligible.This rating is not generallyappliedto adjustmentoperations.
      SustainaMity: The resilienceto risk of net benefitsflows over time. Possibleratings: HighlyLikely, Likely,
Unlikely,HighlyUnlikely, Not Evaluable.
      InstitutionalDevelopmentImpact: The extent to which a project improvesthe abilityof a countryor region
to make more efficient,equitableand sustainableuse of its human, financial,and natural resourcesthrough: (a)
betterdefinition,stability, transparency, enforceability,and predictabilityof institutionalarrangementsand/or (b)
better alignment of the missionand capacityof an organizationwith its mandate, which derives from these
institutionalarrangements. InstitutionalDevelopmentImpactincludesboth intendedand unintendedeffects of a
project. Possibleratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
      Outcome: The extent to whichthe project's majorrelevantobjectiveswere achieved, or are expectedto be
achieved, efficiently.Possibleratings: HighlySatisfactory,Satisfactory,ModeratelySatisfactory,Moderately

Preface

This is aProjectPerformance Assessment Report (PPAR) preparedbythe
Operations EvaluationDepartment (OED) on two environment projects inMexico: the
NorthernBorder Environment Project (NBEP, LoanNo. 3750) andthe programmatic
Environmental Structural Adjustment Loan (EnvSALI).

The NBEPwas approved inJune 1994 for a Bank loan o f US$368 million equivalent.
After amajor restructuring in1998 due to the Mexicanfinancial crisis, the project closed
on September 29,2003, with atwo-year extension andthe cancellation of US$332.9
millionequivalent. The EnvSAL Iwas approved inAugust 2002, for a Bank loan o f
US$202 million equivalent. The project closed after a two-month extension on December
31,2003, andwas fblly disbursed.

The NBEPwas selected for an OED assessment because it was a unique operationwith
the highprofile objective o f assisting Mexico inimproving the environmental
performance ofborder states within the context o f the NorthAmerican Free Trade
Association (NAFTA). The EnvSAL Iwas selected for evaluationbecause it i s the first
World Bankprogrammatic loan dedicated to the environment, and lessons from it maybe

 Summary

          The Northem Border Environment Project (NBEP) and the Environmental Structural Adjustment
 Loan (EnvSAL I)are the second and thirdprojects, respectively, that the Bank has supported inMexico
 for environmental improvement and the strengthening o f environmental management and institutions.
 The first project was the Mexico Environmental Project (MEP), on which OED prepared a Project
 Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) inApril 2000.

          The original objectives o f the NBEP, which was approved in 1994, were to improve
 environmental conditions inMexico's northernborder area by assisting the Govemment o f Mexico
 (GOM) andthe border region states andmunicipalitiesin: (a) strengthening their environmentalplanning,
 management and enforcement capabilities; and @) carrying out priority investments and action plans to
preserve the environment, reverse past environmental degradation andreduce healthrisks from
 environmental contamination. Owing to the 1995 financial crisis, the GOMcancelled the investment
 components and thus the bulk o f the loan. In 1998 the objectives were revised and the legal documents
 were amended to focus essentially o n strengthening the environmental institutions at the federal, state and
municipallevels of government.

          The project's outcome is ratedmoderately unsatisfactory overall. The NBEPwas progressing
unsatisfactorily inachieving its objectives inthe pre-1998 period when most of the non-cancelled portion
of the loan was disbursed, butit didaccomplish its restructured objectives once the project was scaled
 down, hence the PPAR's higher rating. Through training, technical assistance and other inputs,the NBEP
developed the capacities o f federal agencies and subnational institutions along the borderin
environmental management and enforcing compliance with environmental legislation. Significant
achievements were also made for the protection ofbiodiversity. The restructured project's sustainability
i s rated likely, as the GOM has expanded the size of the national agencies, and some state and municipal
institutions are now receiving financing from their respective state budgets. The NBEP's institutional
development impact is ratedhigh, given that the environmental agencies, which hardly existed at the
municipal level before the project, are now able to fulfill their responsibilities at high standards. Bank
performance is rated unsatisfactory due to the overambitious design o f the original project and the
adverse effect that the several changes of Team Leader during supervision had on country stakeholders.
Borrowerperformance is rated unsatisfactory owingto the consistently inadequate and delayed
disbursements, and the major institutionalrestructuring that disrupted the project.

          The Environmental Structural Adjustment Loan (EnvSAL I),approved inFY2002and completed
inFY2004,isthe first ina series o fthreeprogrammatic structural adjustment loans. The mainobjectives
o f EnvSAL Iwere to support the Government's efforts to (i)    mainstreamenvironmental concems inthe
development agenda ofkey sectors, and (ii)    improve the efficiency and effectiveness of local
environmental management processes inMexico.

          The outcome of EnvSAL Iis rated satisfactory, since it fully achieved its objective o f
mainstreaming environmental concerns inthe water, tourism, energy and forestry sectors, as well as
between these agencies and the Secretariat o f Environment (SEMAFWAT);           italso facilitated greater
effectiveness of policies and efficiency ofpractices within each of the sectors. The project's institutional
development impact is rated high, given that the project created a forum for consultation, stakeholder
participation and inter-sectoral coordination that didnot exist effectively prior to the project. The
EnvSAL 1's sustainabilityis ratedlike&, as the institutional mechanisms established have been integrated
into the sector agencies and are being expanded; moreover, the project's actions are based on the new
environmental legislation. Bankperformance is ratedsatisfactory owingto the highquality of project
preparation and extensive supervision by a senior multidisciplinary team. The Borrower's performance is
rated satisfactory, as the Government and the four targeted sectors displayed commitment to inter-

institutional cooperationdespite the necessityto trimtheir other programs inorder to implement EnvSAL
Iactions(theloanwasnotadditionaltothesectoragencies'budgets).

         The NBEP and EnvSALItogether offer the Bank some important lessons for its future assistance
instrengtheningthe capacityofenvironmentalinstitutions andas ittries new lending instruments (such as
Development Policy Loans) to achieve this goal. These lessons, which also take into account the lessons
o f the earlier PPARofthe MEP, are as follows:

     0   Quickly capitalizing onnarrow windows o fpolitical opportunity to accelerate the Bank's
         processing o f large environmental infrastructure operations canbe highlyrisky, since it can lead,
         as it didunder the NBEP, to over-ambitious design, inadequately preparedimplementing agencies
         andpoor overall quality at entry, especially when political considerations are allowed to drive the
         preparation and appraisal timetable.


     0   Targeting project support for local agencies inmore direct ways helps them assume more
         responsibilities and contribute inmore measurable ways to environmental sustainability. This
         support needs to be concrete and under their control. Incontrast, "top-down" approaches tend to
         focus on the broader enabling environment, but may neglect the lack o f skills andresources at
         local levels, which hampers subnational agencies from delivering on their responsibilities.


     0   Incaseswhere theprocessingtriggers for the programmatic loans are different from interim
         results and final outcomes, these triggers should be clearly distinguishedinthe simplifiedICRs.
         Final outcomes and impacts uponProgramcompletion have to be keyed to measurable
         improvements inambient environmental conditions. Otherwise, the whole programcould remain
         "process-oriented", its benefits hardto measure and its value-added too ill-defined to garner
         broad-based support.


     0   Prior Government commitment and formal policies as well as a time-based plan are crucial pre-
         requisites for the successful implementationof Environmental Development Policy Loans.
         Desiredpolicy outcomes and practical constraintsneedto be clear inorder to enhance dialogue
         and promote synergies. Where these conditions are present, the Bank can play an effective role by
         forging the cross-sectoral coordination and consultationmechanisms, jointly defining actions,
         monitoring delivery timetables, andproviding analytical and advisory assistance to deliver the
         Government's own environmental program.

 1.      Background

 THEENVIRONMENT MEXICO IN


Environmental Issues


 1.      Inthe 1980s, whenMexicobeganto addressits environmentalproblems, the
 environment was suffering considerably due to air andwater pollution, water scarcity,
poor hazardous waste disposal, soil erosion andbiodiversity loss. Industrializationwas
pursuedwithlittle attentionto its environmental costs, andinrural areas, support was
 givento agricultural policies and subsidies that caused excessive naturalresource use and
increasedrural-urbanmigration. Mexico's predicament is that its environmental
 degradation is the direct result o f its main drivers of growth. The energy sector, for
 example, has been a principal source o fnational income, yet it generates considerable
pollution, negatively affecting air andwater quality andpublic health. These impacts will
no doubt increase as Mexico's growth continues. Tourism as well has been an important
source o f growth, but it i s now threatening the country's marinebiodiversity. The high
deforestation rate, due to weak forestry sector management, is causing not only
significantbiodiversity loss, but also adverse effects on the country's poorest groups.
Similarly, problems exist inthe water sector, which have resultedininadequate water
quantity andquality for a large segment o fthe population.

2.       The northernborder region, inparticular, has had severe environmentalproblems
due to its rapid industrialization andpopulationgrowth. The adverse environmental
impacts ii-ominternationaltrade andinvestment inthis areahad increased.' Today, the
environmental degradation has worsened to a levelwhere it threatens future economic
growth and social welfare inMexico. While public environmentalmanagement capacity
has improved to addressthe various problems, serious challenges remain for the
Government, particularly inthe areao f investments inenvironmental infrastructure,
removal o f subsidies that encourage irrationalresource use, andthe applicationo f
innovative, market-based instrumentsfor environmentalmanagement that go beyondthe
traditional command- and-control mechanisms.


Strategies, Legal Framework, and Institutions

3.      Based on a solid foundation o f environmental legislation, the Mexican
Government inthe late 1980s began takingvarious steps to strengthen its capacity in
environmental management and governance, signaling increased attention to
environmental issues. With a strategy essentially o f consolidating its environmental
institutions to better define the responsibilities o f each level o f government and to more
effectively address the various issues, the government in 1985 created the Secretariat for
UrbanDevelopment andEcology (Secretaria deDesarollo Urbanoy Ecologia, or
SEDUE). SEDUE was to be responsible for addressing most o f the environmental issues

'OECDReporton    the State of Mexico's Environment, 2003.

                                                2


 underthe federal domain, air andwater quality monitoring and control, hazardous wastes
 andprotectedareamanagement.

 4.      Specific management guidelines were lacking, however, so the government in
 1988passedthe Ley General del Equilibrio Ecolbgicoy la Proteccidn a1Ambiente
 (General Ecology Law), the country's principal environmentalframework law. A key
 element o fthe Government's strategy andthe goalbehindthe new legislationwas to
 create a framework for sustainable development through intersectoral cooperation,
 increased social participation, andnew and stronger environmental standards. Yet despite
 the progress achieved indeveloping a regulatory framework, numerous gaps and
 weaknesses remained. SEDUE faced serious limitations incarrying out its functions due
 to insufficient technical standards and criteria for environmentalenforcement and
 assessments, andinadequate staff and infrastructure. This prevented it from fully
 enforcing pollution standards and conducting all the necessary environmental impact
 assessments at a highlevel o f quality.

 5.      The Government's vision o f environmental management andenforcement also
 placedsignificant importance on decentralization. The 1988 law infact definedthe
 respective roles o fthe federal, state and local governments inenvironmentalprotection
 andgave greater responsibility to states andmunicipalities. Bythe early 1990s,most
 states hadpromulgated their own environmentallaws. However, considerable work still
remained for SEDUE to decentralize many o f its functions, and for the states to establish
their own standards andmonitoring systems.

 6.      To adopt a more proactive approach for environmentalprotectionand sustainable
development, Mexico continuedto experiment with changingthe structure o f its
environmentalinstitutions. In 1992, the government fundamentally reorganized its
environmentalagencies. The bulk o f SEDUE's responsibilitieswere divided amongtwo
new institutions, the National Institute o f Ecology (InstitutoNacional de Ecologia, or
NE), incharge o fpolicy development on environmentalregulations andimpact
assessment, and the Office o f the Attorney General for EnvironmentalProtection
(ProcuraduriaFederal deProteccidn alAnzbiente, or PROFEPA), a new authority for
regulatory enforcement. The agencieswere part o f a new Secretariat for Social
Development (Secretaria deDesarollo Social, or SEDESOL). Recognizingthe need for
greater coordination, the Government in 1995revised the institutional structure once
againby abolishing SEDUE andbringingtogether the programs andpolicies ofthe
different agencies -- including INE,PROFEPA, and the National Water Commission
(Comisibn Nacional deAgua, or CNA) -- andvarious additional functions, under a single
Secretariat for Environment and Natural Resources (Secretaria deMedioAmbientey
Recursos Naturales ,or SEMARNAT).

7.      The country's entry inNAFTA andthe OECD inthe early 1990salso helpedto
spur the Government's move to a sustainable development agenda as Mexico hadto meet
new and higher commitments on environmentalstandards andcompliance mechanisms,
andgained abetter appreciation ofthe economic opportunitiesthat tourism and foreign
investments offered. This was sustained by Mexico's subsequent entry into the Kyoto
Protocol.

                                                3


  8.      Environmentallegislation continuedto progress inthe late 1990s, and in 1996the
  General Ecology Law was strengthened with amendments to cover integratedpollution
  control for air, water and wastes, and to introduce a single environmental license for
`industries andnaturalresource use. In2001, public participation andpublic accessto
  environmentalinformationemerged as important goals inthe Government's
  environmental strategy, as amendments for these were passed. Bythis time, all o f the
  stateshad developed their own environmentallegislation as well.

  9.      Confronted bythe country's increasing environmental problems and the threat
 they posed to future growth and social welfare, the Government formulated an agenda for
  environmentalmainstreaming and environmentalmanagement improvement and
 incorporated it into the NationalDevelopmentPlan2001-2006 (NDP), whose maingoals
 are to enhance growth and competitiveness. The NDP is based on a conception o f
  environment ina new way as a cross-cutting issue -or transversalidad -- as opposed to
 one that i s sector-specific or linkedonly to social policy. Itrecognizes the links between
 environment and growth that would allow Mexico to utilize its natural resource
 endowment as a comparative advantage. Inaddition to the earlier environmental goals,
 the agenda calls for inter-ministerial cooperation for integrated environmental
 management and growth, incentives, resource valuation, and social participation. T h s
 laid the groundwork for the Bank's involvement inthe programmatic Environment
 Structural Adjustment Loan.



 THEBANK'SINVOLVEMENT

 10.      The following paragraphs trace the evolution o fthe Bank's support for
 strengthening environmental performance andmanagement inMexico. Over the almost
 15-year period, there have been major shifts inthe GOM's environment strategy andthe
 Bank's lending approach, as well as significant restructuringo fMexico's environmental
 institutions.


 TheEnvironmental Project's ComprehensiveApproach: TooMuch, Too Soon?

 11.     Inthe early-1990s the Bank expanded significantly its support for physical assets
 andinstitutionalcapacity-buildingfor environmentalmanagement. The Bank's
 environmental assistancewas designed to improve resource use andproductivity, and
 ensure the assessment o f the social and environmentalcosts o fpotential investments. In
 1992, the Bank approved the Mexico EnvironmentalProject (MEP). OED conducted a
 field assessmento fthe project in2000. The objectives o f the MEPwere to support the
 government`s ability to carry out key environmentalprotectionandmanagement
 functions inthe short term and to strengthen the institutional andpolicy framework in
 order for these functions to be carriedout ina more efficient anddecentralized manner in
 the future. Through its activities, the project targeted air pollution, water and sanitation,
 solid wastes, natural resources development, biodiversity protection, ozone protection,
 and other areas.

                                              4


 12.     However, with the restructuringo f environmental institutions inMay 1992 (just
 one month after the MEP began its implementation), it was necessary to redirect the
 MEP's activities to the newly created agencies. This resulted ina scaling-down o fthe
 project's objectives, and the amendment o fthe LoanAgreement in 1993.

 13.     Despite the institutionalrestructuringandMexico's 1994 financial crisis, the
 MEPcontributedinsome important ways. Butthese achievements were short o fthe
 already scaled-down goals o f the project. The institutionaldevelopment impact o fthe
project was modest, important objectives like water pollution control were not achieved,
 and decentralization was delayed. Rather thanused to tackle major environmental
problems, OED's PPAR for the project pointedout that the project's resources were spent
mostly on the salaries and operational costs o f INEandPROFEPA. Weak performance
was due to an unrealistic andinefficient project design -- comprising o f a large collection
 o funrelated components -- that tried to addresstoo manyissues andlacked focus. As the
PPARpointedout (see the mainlessonsinAnnex B), the MEP's failures illustratedthe
need, expressed inthe Bank's 1999 Mexico Country Assistance Strategy, for Bank's
 lendingto Mexico to move from carrying out activities to acheving goals.

 TheNorthern Border Environment Project: Some Successes, but Serious Pollution
Problems Remain

 14.     Giventhe delay indecentralization activities under the MEP, the Bank approved
the NorthernBorder Environment Project (NBEP) in 1994 to help address the
environmental problems that were particularly acute inthe northern border region, by
developing state-level capacity for environmental protection. Between 1988 and 1994, a
large number o f states had developed legislationto support environmental protection
activities, but by 1994 none o fthe border states hadyet developed a complete legal
fi-amework. State and local agencies were weak because they lacked legislative
instruments, trained staff, equipment, and financial resources. At the federal level,
PROFEPArequiredsubstantial investments andtechnical assistanceto enforce the
regulations since rates o f infractionwere muchhigher inthe border area compared to the
country average. As discussed inthe evaluation section, NBEP remedied these
institutionalweaknesses to a considerable extentby providing PROFEPAand the local
agencieswith the resources they needed.

15.     Mexico's increased attentionto environmental protection inthe 1990s led to
notable progress insome areas, such as biodiversity conservation and air pollution
control. Yet the magnitude o fthe problems remained large at the beginningo f the present
decade. Exposure to air pollutionremained a severe threat to public health. Water
supply, sanitation service andwaste water treatment needs hadnot beenmet inrural
areas. Water use remainedunsustainable at the national level. Proper municipal-level
hazardous waste management i s yet to be developed. Biodiversity is still seriously
threatened (ina country that ranks fourth globally inmegadiversity). Infact, the
persistent environmentaldegradation i s estimated to have ledto losses inwelfare and
growth opportunities o f about 10percent o f GDP, andthreatens to further reduce social
welfare and increase poverty ifnot addressed.*Underlyingthese environmental problems

 were also subsidies andlack o fresource valuation that encouraged their unsustainable
 use.

 TheEnvironmental Structural Adjustment Loan: Moving Awayfrom Project Activities
 to Policy Goals

 16.     In2002, theBankapprovedtheprogrammaticEnvironmentStructural
 Adjustment Loan (ENVSAL) to assist the Mexican Government inits agenda for
 environmentalmainstreaming andimproving environmentalmanagement, insupport o f
 the larger NDP. I t also sought to enhancethe efficiency and effectiveness o f
 environmentalmanagement processesinorder to enable a strong pace o f growth. The
 environmental agendao f the NDP has targeted for mainstreaming four sectors, tourism,
 energy, forestry andwater giventheir key roles for growth andtheir potentialto constrain
 both growth and development basedonthe level o fdegradation within them. Inthese
 sectors, the Government aims to addressthe lack o f a regulatory framework for
 decentralizingenvironmental management, inadequate financing for buildingcapacity
 andimprovingmanagement, the absenceofpublic participationandthe lack o f
transparency.



2.       NorthernBorderEnvironmentProject

 17.     The original objectives o f the NBEP were to improve environmentalconditions in
Mexico's NorthernBorder areaby assisting the federal government as well as the border
states andmunicipalitiesin:(i)      strengthening their environmentalplanning, management
andenforcement capabilities; and(ii)         carrying out priority investments and actionplans
to preserve the environment, reverse past environmentaldegradation andreduce health
risks from environmentalcontamination. The project consisted o f five components: (a)
institutional strengthening; (b) hazardous wastes; (c) biological diversity and ecological
areas; (d) street paving; and (e) infrastructure investment lines o f credit. The loan
amount at appraisal was for $US 368 millionequivalent, but due to several cancellations,
the actual amount disbursed was only $US 35.1 million.

IMPLEMENTATION           ISSUES

18.      The NBEP was approved inJune 1994. Shortly afier it became effective inJune
1995, Mexico experienced a financial crisis. Since the Bankwas already financing
projects with similar components to NBEP (e.g., paving, solid waste management, water
supply andsanitation), the Government between 1995 and 1996requestedcancellations
o f these activities inthe NBEPamounting to US$273.4 million. The loan amount
decreased from the originalUS$ 368.0 to US$ 94.6 million.

19.      In1998, theprojectobjectives were revisedinanAmendment to the Loan
Agreement, to reflect these changes and consolidate the numerous cancellation^.^ The

3Although the loan cancellations occurred in 1995-96, it was not until 1998 that action was taken to revise
the project's objectives.

restructured objectives, which replaced the original ones, were to improve environmental
 andsocial conditionsintheborder statesby: (i) the government, as well as the
                                                                  assisting
border states andtheir municipalities, instrengthening their environmentalmanagement
 capabilities, including their capabilities for enforcing environmental legislationand
regulations; and (ii)      assisting the border states andtheir municipalities instrengthening
their administrative, financial andother management capabilities ineducation, health,
 andwater supply and sanitation. The hazardous waste, streetpaving andinfrastructure
 investment lines o f credit components were cancelled, andthe focus o fthe project
became institutional strengthening. Further loan cancellations totaling US$ 54.6 million
occurred inOctober 1999, July 2000 andDecember 2001due to the Government o f
Mexico's budgetary constraints. Two other changes regardingthe objectives were made
 after 1998. The biological diversity component was cancelled in2001 when
responsibility for protected areaswas transferred from TNE to the Comisidn Nacional de
Areas Naturales Protegidas (National Comissionfor ProtectedAreas, or CONANP) and
the latter chose not to participateinthe NBEP4,andthe objective o f strengthening the
administrative, financial and management efficiency o fthe states andmunicipalities was
cancelled. The loan closing date was also extendedby two years to September 2003. At
closing, the loan disbursed US$35.1 million or 9.53 percent o fthe original appraisal
amount.


RESULTS

20.        NBEP's performance before the revisiono f the project objectives in 1998 was
weak. Duringthis period, US$29.3 million hadbeen disbursed. However, inthe period
from 1998 to closing, the project succeededinachievingthe first restructuredobjective.
Insome cases, theproject surpassedits targets for this objective. The original set of
objectives for the project was overambitious, supported by a large number o f activities in
several sectors, much like the Bank's 1992 Mexico EnvironmentalProject. The scaling-
down o fthe project permittedit to focus on the strengthening o fMexico's environmental
institutions andon one area--biodiversity andendangered species conservation.

21.        The NBEP supported a wide variety o fmethods and specific activities to achieve
its restructured objectives. These consisted of: capacity buildingfor staff at the federal,
state andmunicipal levels o fgovernment, and for the private sector and NCOs;
specialized studies indiverse areas; technical assistancefor the preparation o fplans and
manuals; the creation o fhumanresource systems; andprovision o f equipment and
facilities.

22.        Regardingthe project's objectives o f assisting the government, the border states
andtheir municipalities instrengthening their environmentalmanagement capabilities,
includingthose for enforcing environmentallegislationandregulations, the project
achieved several significant outcomes. Owingto the resources NBEP provided to
PROFEPAandbuildingon the results under the MEP(see para. 13), the agency's


  The ICRrefers to CONANP'sdecision in2001 to cancel its participation inthe NBEPas the cancellation o fthe
component. Becausethe component was cancelledrather late inthe project-2        years before closing-many o fthe
activities hadalready been carried out with the allocations that hadbeen disbursed, andhadproduced fairly significant
outputs.

                                                   7


capacity for environmental enforcement at the federal and state levels was enhanced
significantly as a result o f its increased ability to carry out audits andinspections, andthe
creation o f an integrated informationmanagement system, which assists the agency in
monitoring compliance anddecision-making. The agency i s now recognizedfor its high-
quality work both inMexico and abroad. The project also enabled the states and
municipalitiesto conduct their responsibilities underthe decentralized framework o f
Mexicanenvironmental law and engage actively inenvironmentaland socio-economic
planning.Other environmentalmanagement capabilities o fthe border stateswere
improved as well, as plans for the protection o fbiodiversity and endangered speciesin
protected areas o fthe regionwere developed. The main achievements o fNBEP are
presented indetail inAnnex C. As mentionedearlier, the second objective, strengthening
the administrative, financial andmanagement efficiency ofthe states andmunicipalities,
was cancelled.


23.       With respect to the objective o fdecentralizing environmentalmanagement and
legislation enforcement to the states andmunicipalities, the outcomes ofNBEPwere
more significant compared to those o fMEP, while EnvSAL Ifocused more on legislation
andthe chargingofuser fees. The table below compares the outcomes for
decentralization ofthe three projects:

24.      The experience o f the NBEP demonstrates that for countries with some
environmental legislation inplace, but with undeveloped environmentalinstitutions and
capacities, the provision o fbasic support, such as equipment, infrastructure, training, and
technical assistancecan have significant positive impacts on the capacity o fthe
institutions for environmental management and enforcement.

25.      The NBEP achieved most o f its targets andinsome areas, such as plant
inspections, exceededthem. Yet insome cases, targets were not met: 23 studies for state
andmunicipal institutiondevelopment and31for biodiversity conservation were not
conducted. Determiningwhether allthe numerous targets were met remains challenging
due to differences betweenthe format usedto present the project targets andthat
employedto recordthe outputs. It should also be notedthat OED could findno evidence
to support the statement inthe ICRthat environmental and social conditions inthe border
states have improved.

26.      At the broader level, NBEP's success was inhelpingto raisethe importanceof
the environment at the federal, state andmunicipal levels and focusing the new
institutional capacities that it was developing on a specific geographic area o f the
country. Although the project initially tried to achieve too much, as it was proposed inthe
context o f the NAFTAnegotiations, the political support for it played a large role inits
outcomes. Based onwhat the NBEP achieved andthe overall assessments o fthe project
byMexicanenvironmentalofficials, the NBEPplayed animportantrole indeveloping
the capacities o f the borrower's environmentalagencies. However, the need for
significant work along the northernborder remains. OECD's 2003 assessmentconcluded
that environmentalconditions there were worse thanthey hadbeen five years earlier.

27.      Notwithstandingthe positiveresults o fthe project, an issue arises relatedto the
large number o f studies andtraining activities that were intendedto provide the
knowledge or skills necessary for taking future actions. What remains unclear, however,
i s the extent to which they were utilizedand their direct impact on (i) performance of
                                                                         the
the environmental agencies and(ii)       improvements inenvironmentalmanagement and
enforcement inMexico. As the OED assessment found for the MEP, w h c h the NBEP
came to resemble inits large number o f sub-components, many o fthe studies conducted
were never applied or added little value to institutionalperformance.

OUTCOME

28.       Based onits substantial relevance, modest efficacy, andmodest efficiency, the
project outcome is ratedmoderately unsatisfactory, which is a higher ratingthanthe
unsatisfactory ratingo f the ICR and OED's ICRReview. (The moderately unsatisfactory
rating i s not available inthe region's 4-point scale inpreparing the ICR, per OP13.55 on
ImplementationCompletionReporting. OED has a 6-point scale.) The PPARratingis
based on an assessment o fthe project's results against bothits original andrevised
objectives and on the ratings for relevance, efficacy, and efficiency discussed below.
Separate outcome ratings (against original andrevisedproject objectives) were weighted
according to the share o fthe actual loadcredit disbursements made inthe periods before
andafter approvalo fthe revision. The major shareo fthe US $35.1 millionloan, U S
$29.24 million(83 percent), was disbursed before 1998, when the project objectives were
revised. The remainingUS $5.85 millionwas provided after the revision. Although the
outcome o fthe project's post-1998 periodmerits a rating o f Satisfactory, the project's
outcome during the periodwhen the bulk o fthe loanwas disbursed is ratedModerately
Unsatisfactory. OED's ratings for relevance, efficacy, and efficiency, andits overall
project rating is presented and discussed below.

Relevance

29.      The rating for the relevance o fthe project's objectives overall and for each period,
before and after the revision o fthe project objectives, i s substantial. Inthe pre- andpost-
1998 periods, the goals o fthe project were ingeneral accord with the Bank's Country
Assistance Strategy o f improvingthe environment andwith the Mexican government's
long-term efforts to improve the effectiveness o f its environmentalinstitutions.
However, the Government's decision to cancel the investment components, andthus the
bulkofthe loan, andpursue the goals ofthese components through other ongoingBank
projects5signaled that the project didnot entirely matchthe Government's priorities for
Mexico's environment. It also meant that for the municipalities, for whichthe investment
components were largelyintended, the project no longer hadthe same degree o f
relevance as before. Partlybecausethe NBEP grew to a significant degree out o fthe
political atmosphere around the NAFTAnegotiations, it was too ambitious: a large
numberof activities distributedacross several sectorswere involvedwhile the capacities
o fthe agencies andinter-institutional coordinationfor project execution were low. The
project's sector focus also lacked adequate rationale: the environmentalproblems were
not prioritizedand the energy sector, a major source o fpollution, was not among those
targeted. Though project documents statedthat the NBEPwas relevantto the fulfillment
o f "Mexico's obligations under NAFTA", there were no obligations under NAFTA as
such, except that the participatingcountries do not relax their environmental standards to
attract increased foreign investments. The scaling-downo fthe project though made the
new objectives more focused andrelevant.




30.      The project's efficacy inachievingits objectives is ratedmodest overall. For the
periodbefore the project objectives were revisedas well, project efficacy is ratedmodest.
Although the project was makinggoodprogress towards achieving the objective o f
strengthening the environmentalmanagement and enforcement capabilities o fthe
Government ando fthe border states andmunicipalities, it was takingno action on the
second objective o f carrying out priority investments for environmental protection, the
reversal o fpast degradation andthe reduction o fhealthrisks from environmental
contamination. The rating for efficacy inthe period after 1998 i s modest. As discussed
under"Results" above, the project achieved the first revisedobjective (a slightly
modified version o fthe first original objective) substantially. Efficacy inreachingthe
secondrevised objective though was negligible, as the decision was taken to no longer
pursueit.


Efficiency

31.      The project's efficiency overall and for the periodsbefore andafter 1998 is rated
modest. Inthe pre-1998 period, althoughimplementationprogress onthe first objective
was good, little actionwas taken on the investments for the second one to generate


 SecondWater Supply and Sanitation Project; Second Solid Waste Management Project; and Medium-Size
Cities UrbanTransport Project.

                                                 11


 benefits. After the project was revised, the story was similar: the project's efficiency in
 achieving the objective for strengthening the environmentalmanagement and
 enforcement capacities was substantial, as the newly-created capacities were at a high
 level andwere utilized as they were developed. Inthe case o fthe second revised
 objective, however, efficiency was poor since the objective was initiated but thenlater
 dropped, which resulted ina waste o f resources. The modest ratingo fthe project overall
 i s also supported bythe fact that the loancancellations were delayed and incremental,
 which meant that the Government continued to pay commitment fees on the undisbursed
 amount untilthe cancellations were made.


 INSTITUTIONAL     DEVELOPMENT       IMPACT

 32.      The rating for the project's institutionaldevelopment impact i s high. NBEP
 contributed significantly to the ability o fthe federal, state andmunicipal environmental
 agencies to carry out environmental management and enforcement activities inthe border
'states andthose inother areaso fthe country. Itshouldbenotedthat the activities the
 project undertook or funded for institutionaldevelopment were rather basic inthat they
 enabled the agencies to conduct their most essential activities, such as audits, inspections,
 testing, and informationmanagement. Through studies, the project also generated the
 primaryknowledgethe agenciesneededto take management andpolicy steps inthe
 future. This was particularlytrue for institutions at the municipal level, w h c h were
 incipient or non-existent. But giventhe relatively low level o f capacity o f all the
 environmental agenciesbefore the project, NBEP's contributionwas significant. The
 training, technical assistance, equipment andbasic infkastructure supplied, and
 knowledge generated under the project led to the creationo f environmental institutions at
 all three levels o f government that were able to carry out the activities for which they
 were responsible ina more effective and efficient manner.

 SUSTAINABILITY

 33.      The sustainability o fthe NBEP's benefits is ratedlikely. The various benefits the
project generated are expected to continue due to the public recognitionthe
environmentalagencies have received for their functions, the capacity strengthening the
project achieved, andthe increasedpublic awareness o f environmentalproblems inthe
border region. PROFEPAandthe agencies at the state andmunicipal levels are now
recognized for the important functions they perform andthe highquality o ftheir work.
Since project closing, these agencieshave beenperforming well andhave received
resources that have allowed them to expand. Whereas earlier PROFEPAwas dependent
on financing from the NBEP, its budget i s now derived entirely from its operations.
Additionally, some state andmunicipal institutions along the border now receive
financing from their respective state budgets and are no longer dependent on external
funding. The commitment that the Government at all levelshas shownsince theproject
ended to developingthese institutions is the basis for changingthe Sustainabilityrating
from "non-evaluable" inthe ICR Review to "likely". One consequence o fPROFEPA's
greater independence shouldbenoted though. The agency's dependence on its operations
has led to a somewhat tight budget andthe result o fthis has been the absence o fnew
studies or equipment.

                                              12


 34.     Capacity development has also played a strong factor insustainability. Training
 on environmental management andregulation, which occurred inthe NBEP through the
 agencies anduniversities, andhas been carried out by these universities as an integral
part o ftheir curriculum afier the project, hasproduced a large body o ftechnically trained
 staff inthe environmentalagencies andindividuals who can assumepositions inthe
 futureinthese agenciesandnon-governmental institutions. Finally, the increasedpublic
 understanding,together with the improvedcapacity o fNGOsandother institutionswill
 serve to maintainpressure onthe Government to continue financing public efforts to
 addressthe environmental problems inthe border region andinstates outside it.

 BANKPERFORMANCE

 35.     The rating for BankPerformance i s unsatisfactory. The project designwas
 oversized as it sought to achieve major targets inseveral sectors that had serious
 environmental impacts (this resulted from the Bank's adoptiono f a multi-sectoral
 approach inone region-the     northemborder). Like the MEP that was initiated only three
years earlier, the NBEP consisted o f a large number o f looselyrelated sub-components,
the management o fwhich would have.been difficult. The Bank also addressed safeguard
issues inadequately. Only a few EnvironmentalImpact Assessments (EIAs) for
subprojects were completed; moreover, as stipulated inthe Bank's guidelines covering
heavy industrialpollution andhazardous wastes, an EIA for the project as a whole should
have been completed prior to appraisal but was not conducted. Quality at Entrywas
therefore unsatisfactory. The Bank's performance duringsupervisionwas satisfactory,
especially giventhe challenges posedbythe project's restructuringandmajor
institutionalchanges inthe environmentalagencies. However, the changes inTask
Managers (ie., five team leaders from preparation to closing) and a lack o f knowledge o f
Mexico on the part o f some team leaders had an adverse effect on relations with country
stakeholders.


BORROWERPERFORMANCE

36.     Borrower Performance i s ratedunsatisfactory overall. Duringproject design, the
Government gave significant political support to, andworked closely with the Bank for
the project due inlarge part to its association with the NAFTAnegotiations andbecause
it was seenas an effort to mitigatethe environmentalharmfrom increasedtrade and
investment inthe region. Further, the performance o f the implementing agencies-BA
NOBRAS, SEDESOL, INE,PROFEPAAND SEMARNAT-was satisfactoryowing to
their commitment andthe support their managementprovidedfor the achievement o f
quality outputs.

37.     Nevertheless, throughout the project, the Secretaria deHacienday Crkdito
Publico (Secretariat for Finance andPublic Credit, or SHCP) didnot disburse allocations
to the implementingagencies ina timely manneror follow the annual budget allocations
to which it had agreed. The staff o fthe implementing agencies worked effectively with
the Bank to try to overcome this problem and implement activities inthe fiscal year that
remained, butbecause o f the SHCP's weak performance andthe Government's delay in
signing the Amendment to the LoanAgreement duringthe project's last phase, which

                                              13


 also heldup disbursements, project implementationwas nearly unsatisfactory, the
 project's closing date hadto be extendedby two years, and an additionalundisbursed
 amount ofUS$ 4.9 million hadto be cancelled at project closing. Finally, in2001, the
 Government reorganized the Environment Secretariat, transferringresponsibility for the
 strengthening o f state andmunicipal environmental agencies from INEto the
 Secretariat's Regional and Sectoral EnvironmentalUnit. While this change was not
 nearly as great as the restructuringin 1992, which forced a major reorganizationo fMEP
 that hadjust started, it did disrupt the NBEP's implementation andindicated a lack o f
 strong Government commitment to the project.



 3.      EnvironmentalStructuralAdjustment LoanI

 38.     The mainobjectives o fthe First Environmental StructuralAdjustment Loan
 (EnvSAL I) to support the Government's efforts to (i)mainstreamenvironmental
              were
 concerns inthe development agenda o fkey sectors, namely water, energy, tourism and
 forestry, and (ii)improve the efficiency and effectiveness of local environmental
 management processesinMexico. EnvSALIwas approved in2002 for a loan o f
US$202million equivalent and closed on December 31,2003. Itwas planned as the first
 ina seriesofthree environmentalprogrammatic structural adjustment loans to be
disbursed over a five-year period (the second loan now under preparationi s called a
DevelopmentPolicy Loan inaccordance with the Bank's OperationalPolicy 8.60 on
DevelopmentPolicy Lending [DPL] issued in2005). The goal o f the EnvSALProgram
 as a whole i s to support the Government's efforts, as outlined inits National
DevelopmentPlan2001-2006 (NDP), to balance socioeconomic development with
environmental protectionandimprovement. The EnvSAL Iloan consisted o ftwo
tranches, with the second one conditioneduponthe ability of the Government to meet
certain triggers. The most salient features o f the operation (tranche conditions and
waivers) are presented inAnnex D.

DESIGNAND IMPLEMENTATIONISSUES

39.     At the ICRReview stage for this project, OEDraised several questions related to
the content ofthe operation andthe appropriateness o fthe SAL instrument. The
evaluation mission's findings are discussed below.

40.      Why aprogrammatic adjustment operation and not other lending instruments?
An environmental management investment loanwas considered, butthe two previous
projects (MEP andNBEP) were not successful with this type o f instrument. A single
environmental SAL, or SAL plus technical assistance (TA) loanwere also considered,
butthere would not be enoughtime under a SAL to carry out the rangeof actions that
comprise the whole Program, which follows the NDP's 2001-2006 timetable. Moreover,
the timingbetween a fast-disbursing S A L and a longer TA would be mismatched, andthe
leverage diminishedas the TA continues to disburse while the SAL is already closed. An
environmental Sectoral Adjustment Loan (SECAL) was not selected, becausethis would
involve a legal agreement only with SEMARNAT, and thus would not be suited to

                                              14


 mainstreamingenvironment into other sectors. A programmatic SAL linkedto the
 environmental milestones o f (i) 2001-2006 NDP and(ii) parallel Environment and
                                  the                           the
NaturalResources Program2001-2006, was deemed bythe Bank as the most appropriate
 lendingvehicle.

 41.     How adequatelydo theProgram and thefirst loan address Mexico's
 environmental priorities? Does theProgram need to be revised? Based on informationin
 Bankdocuments andreports byother multilateralorganizations (such as the OECD) on
 Mexico's environment, the EnvSALProgram and its first loan substantially addressthe
 country's environmentalpriorities. Two o fthe most important activities that the Program
 i s supporting are municipalwastewater treatment and establishing water user fees. There
 are, however, some critical issues that the Program does not cover, such as agricultural
 expansion's threat to biodiversity and air pollution from the energy sector. It should also
be notedthat the issuesinthe energy and forestry sectors that do came under EnvSAL I
 are not addresseduntilthe second or third operation. However, these features do not
warrant arevisiono fthe Program; moreover, focusing on committed sectors is an
important lessonthat shouldbe learned from the failed examples o fthe overambitious
MEP andNBEP, which triedto address all environmentalissuesacrossnearly all sectors.

42.      why were enforcement orpollutionfines andfees not included in designing the
policy package of EnvSALI?The Program does to some extent include enforcement and
the levying o f fines for unsustainable resource use. Under the EnvSAL program's
plannedsecond andthird operations, pilot schemeswill be createdinthe water sector for
identifyingandfining(i) users usingwater inexcess o ftheir rights, and (ii)
                           water
dischargers who exceed their limits. Inthe forestry sector, EnvSAL Isought to address
the issue o f low enforcement (which enables heavy illegal logging) by separating
regulatory from enforcement functions. Actions inthe energy sector, however, are
conspicuously absent, althoughthe issue o f subsidies is being addressedinanother loan
(see paragraph45).

43.     Is the de-linking of the independent certlJication of states for carving out
environmental permittingfunctions) from the decentralization process an important
departurefrom theproject's developmentobjective? DuringEnvSAL 1's second tranche
release, the Government requested a waiver o fthe conditionrelated to the independent
certificationo f environmental functions to be decentralized to the state level. (A full
backgroundi s presented inAnnex Don Tranche Conditions and Waivers.) Basedon the
OED mission's interviews, thispartialwaiver o f a second tranche conditiondoes not
seem to be a material deviation for two mainreasons. First, the earlier tranche condition
was based on a "supermarket" approach to permitting functions, whereby states canpick
andchoose whichpermittingfunctions they want to assumevia certification. However,
this results inan anomalous situation where the least desirable functions are left to the
federal government, and the states take over only the easy or popular ones. Thus, it i s
importantto ask whether thesepermitsmake sense inthe first place(there used to be 128,
now trimmeddown to 92), after which it may be morepracticableand least-cost to
cluster permits andtransfer them as a "package" rather than "retail" them one by one.
Second, the various approacheswith different incentives also needto be tried, e.g., "fast-
tracking" o f some permits (e.g., the TrumiteAmbiental Unico); promoting programs o f
continuous improvement inaddition to or inlieu o f IS09001and I S 014000 certification;

                                              15


and electronic EnvironmentalImpact Assessments, which obviates the needto
decentralize this particular function. Insum, the reasonsprovidedby the Simplified ICR
seemedvalid, andwhich agency obtains certificationfor which particular function would
bebest decided after the review and streamliningo fvarious approaches to granting
permits hasbeen completed.

44.     Was thepolicy package too "thin "for thesize of the loan? Being the first o fits
kindfinancedbythe Bank,there areno other operations withwhich to compare
EnvSAL's policy content. As discussed earlier, EnvSAL Isought to address many o f
Mexico's environmental priorities by supporting the Government inits efforts to
mainstream the environment inseveral important sectors, which i s a challenging and
novel approach for the country. Infact, for programmatic SALS,this questionmaynot be
fullyrelevant. Importantprerequisites for these loans are the development o fthepolicy
reform agendaby the borrower accompanied by Government commitment. Inthe case o f
EnvSAL, the Mexicangovernment formulated the environmentalpolicy development
goals and initiated actions for them prior to the Bank's entry. For the EnvSAL Iitselfto
haveproposed andpursued anew policy package would have beenunrealistic, as the
loanperiodwould allow too little time for formulating and legislatingpolicy reforms.
Borrower ownership, moreover, maynot have been as strong. OED assessments o f
adjustment loans often refer to the need for a sound policy package and Government
ownership (ideally evidenced by significant actions already havingbeentaken) as
important prerequisites to receivingBank support.

45.     Why was the issue of subsidies in thefuel, power, water and agricultural sectors
not addressed? It appears that EnvSAL Iandthe Program as awhole have not sought to
addressthe subsidies inthese sectors for two reasons. First, other Bankprojects in
Mexico, from the late 1980s to the present, sought or are seeking to do so. Two projects,
Agricultural Sector Adjustment Project Iand I1(1988), andthe IntegratedIrrigation
ModernizationProject (2003) addressed subsidies for water inthe agricultural sector. The
first one supported the Government inits efforts to reduce subsidies for water and other
agricultural inputs, andpromote a system o fwater user fees. Inthe second project, based
on a process begunin2001 o f transferringthe responsibilityfor operation and
maintenance o f irrigation infrastructureto water users' associations, one o fthe aims has
beento improve on-farm irrigation systems andwater use efficiency. Regardingthe fuel
andpower sector, the Transmission andDistributionProject(1990) sought to reduce
government subsidies to the petroleum industry andthe cross subsidies to consumers to
improve end-user efficiency. The second reason is that while subsidy issues remain, the
first operation and the Programhave aimed to support an agendathat the Government has
outlined as achievable rather than a very broad one that includes all o fthe country's
environmentalissues.

46.     WeretheBank's environmental safeguard policies addressed adequately?
According to the EnvSALProgramDocument (PD), the Bankproject preparation team
consulted a sizable body o f analyticalwork onMexico's environment carried out by the
Government o fMexico, the Bank, and other development institutions, including the
OECD, to review the current state o f environmentalpolicies. This seems more than
adequate to comply with the environmentalsafeguard policies for adjustment lendingthat
prevailedwhen the EnvSALprogram and the first operation were designed, i.e., that

                                                     16


 while "adjustment loans other thanSECALs are not subject to the requirements o f OP
 4.01[Environmental Assessment]", staff should (and did) review country environmental
 policies andpractices, take account o f any relevant findings and recommendations o f
 such reviews, and identify the linkages between the various reforms proposed andthe
 environment as goodpractice.6


 RESULTS

 47.      The objectives o f EnvSAL Iwere to support the Government's efforts to (i)
 mainstream environmentalconcems inthe development agenda o fkey sectors, and (ii)
 improve the efficiency and effectiveness o f local environmentalmanagement processes in
 Mexico. The results o fEnvSAL Ivis-&vis these objectives are discussed immediately
 below. The overall outcome o f EnvSALIi s satisfactory based on OED's assessment o f
 its relevance, efficacy and efficiency (as discussed indetail under the Outcome section).


 I nter-Sectoral

 48.      The main result o fEnvSALIis the cross-sectoral mainstreamingo f
 environmental considerations across four sector agencies (for energy, water, tourism and
 forestry), the Environment Ministry(SEMARNAT) andthe FinanceMinistry(SHCP).
 This is discussed indetail inthe InstitutionalDevelopment Impact section below.


 WaterSector

49.       The maintargets for the water sector were achieved, as follows:; (i)               the
 earmarking andreturn o fmunicipal user fees to the municipalities for financing
investments inwater infrastructureon a matching basis, and (ii)               modifications to the
Federal Law o fRightson Water inorder to incorporate the provision that up to 100%o f
municipal water fees collectedmay be retumedto municipalities so that they could invest
inwater resources managementprograms. Underthe EnvSALI,                        revenues from water
fees collected at the municipal level increased from 24% o f concgssional water use by
volume to 58% by the second tranche release. These revenues were returned to the
municipalities to finance water supply and sewerage systems on a matchingbasis.
Levyingofwater fees signifies an important behavioralchange under EnvSALI,                           since
the municipalitiesgenerally ignored this legalrequirement inthe past. EnvSAL 1's intent
was to generate funds and stimulate municipalinfrastructureinvestments, andnot so
muchto conserve water resources.




6 The new operational policies for Development Policy Lending in2004 have more stringent guidelines for
safeguarding the environment: "... for country policies with likely significant effects [on the environment],
the Bank assesses inthe ProgramDocument the borrower's systems for reducing such adverse effects and
enhancing positive effects, drawing on relevant country-level or sectoral environmental analysis. Ifthere
are significant gaps inthe analysis or shortcomings inthe borrower's systems, the Bank describes inthe
ProgramDocument how such gaps or shortcomings would be addressed before or during program
implementation, as appropriate."

                                               17


50.     Prior to Bank approval o f EnvSAL I,    the National Water Commission (CNA) had
already designed andinitiatedthe implementation o f a 2001-2006 National Hydraulic
Program (NHP) that established medium-term goals, set up the keybuildingblocks to
acheve those goals, strengthened coordination and consensus-building among
stakeholders, andmeasuredprogress andimpact systematically. Insupport o fthe
Government's program, EnvSAL Iincludedthe NHP inits matrix o f objectives, as well
as inthe Environment andNatural Resources Program.

51.     Interms ofspecific actions, EnvSALIestablished anIntersectoral Working
Group (ITWG) for the water sector, and supported legal reforms to (i) the increase
incentives for water conservation, and (ii)   mobilize resources for investments in
municipal water infrastructure byrationalizing and increasing the collection ofwater
fees. Two important EnvSALachievements inthe water sector include the following:

    0   Bypresidential decree, past debts to the federal government were exonerated for
        municipalitieswho agree to (i)     charge water fees inthe future and (ii)
                                                                                 forgo
        federal finding for water supply and sanitation inthe event o fnon-payment
    0   Through the passageo f a federal law,' up to 100%o fmunicipalwater fees
        collectedmybe returned to the municipalities for water supply and sanitation
        investments, to be matchedby an equal amount o f municipal funds.

52.     As a result, water users inmunicipalitieswith greater than 2,500 inhabitants and
intheFederalDistrictpaidfor water fees corresponding to 58% o fconcessionedwater
use by volume at the end o fthe third trimester o f 2003, compared to the baseline o f 24%
in2002. Moreover, the MinistryofFinance returnedover 95% ofwater feespaidto the
CNA for use bythe municipalities. The OED missionreviewedthe latest figures for
2004 andwas able to confirm that the rate o fpayments remained stable andthe transfers
are about the same as the previous year at 92%.


Energy Sector

53.     The main targets for the energy sector under EnvSALIwere achieved, which
involved mainly goal-setting andnetworking. Specific actions to implement policies and
strategies were still at the planningstages when EnvSAL Iclosed andwould bepursued
under the second loan. Under EnvSAL I,       the Government designed a programto
integrate environmentalconsiderations inthe energy sector, with medium-term goals and
the necessary buildingblocks. Mechanisms for coordinationand consensus-building
were also established, notably the ITWG.A monitoring and evaluation(M& E) system
to measure implementationprogress and environmentalimpacts was also designed and
would beput into operation once a program o f specific actions start to be implementedby
the end o fthe second operation, as follows:

    0   Develop an energy and environment policy
    0   Strengthen policies to promote clean fuels (e.g., lower the sulfur content in
        regular andpremium gasoline to 300 ppmand 50 ppmbyweight, respectively)

                                              18


     e  Ensure the sustainable operations o f energy facilities, and specifically to reduce
        contamination by PEMEX andthe Federal Electricity Commission (CFE)
     e  Promote regulatory compliance by energy businesses
     e  Increase the renewable energy generation capacity to 1700 MW
     e  Promote energy efficiency to capture energy savings o f2.5 % relative to total
        consumption
     e  Promote socially sustainable energy projects
     e  Mitigate greenhouse gases through carbon capture projects

 54.    Some initial steps have been taken in2004 to launchthe foregoing set o fconcrete
 actions that eventually could have measurable environmentalimpacts. These mainly
relate to renewable energy, as follows:

        Preparation and ongoing discussions inCongress o f a national law to promote
        renewable energy (including geothermal)
     e  Approval o f fiscal provisions for the accelerated depreciation o f capital costs for
        renewable energy infrastructure
     0  Preparation o f a study to develop a NationalFundfor RenewableEnergy
        Promotion, which will (i) incentives for independent power producers, and
                                   assess
        (ii) alternativepoliciesforpricingandpowertransmission
             evaluate
     e  ReductionbyPEMEX o f the sulfur content o fpremiumgasoline inthe Mexico
        City Metropolitan Area, anddrafiing o f legislationthat will legally bindthe
        Government inthe coming years to reduce the sulfur content o f all gasoline and
        diesel
        Implementationo f environmentalmanagement systems (EMS) inPEMEX and
        CFE, which is the public utility providing electricity to 90% o fthe population.

Note that duringthe preparation o fthe Second EnvSAL, the targeted sulfur content limits
that will be implementedduringthe second operation were revisedto 500 ppmand 300
ppmfor Magna(regular) gasoline andPremiumgasoline, respectively.

55.     Some measurable impactshave started to emerge from these interventions. The
EMShas ledto a 63% reductioninflarednatural gas, whose contribution to electricity
generation has increased from 22% to 37% by substitutingfor fuel oil. There havebeen
15% and 18% reductions inSO;! emissions from the electricity generationsubsector and
more generally from fossil fuel combustion, respectively. Finally, PEMEXhas reduced
its waste discharges to water bodies by 51%, and both PEMEX and CFE have made
significant reductions indischarges o fPCBs.

56.     It is unclear whether these actions will becompleted -andtheir measurable
environmentalimpacts achieved -- by the end o fthe 6-year National Development Plan
(NDP) periodo f2001-2006. The Bank andGOMwill track the progress on them. The
FY2006 second loan operationmay facilitate fwther progress on the above list, but is
unlikely to see their completion. Evenifthese actions are completedduringthe third
loan, that would represent a delay inimplementingthe Government's energy and
environment plans duringthe NDP period.

                                               19


 Tourism Sector

 57.    As inthe water andenergy sectors, EnvSALIsupportedthe definition o f
medium-term goals andbuildingblocks to achieve them, strengthened inter-agency
 coordinationand stakeholder consultation, and developed systems to measure impacts.
Also as inthe water and energy sectors, the tourism sector already had a 2001-2006
National Program for Tourism that preceded the FY2004EnvSAL, andwhich
 emphasized environmentalmainstreaming. An ITWGfor the tourism sector was also
 formed. Specifically, EnvSAL supported the following:

    0   Legalreforms to decreaseover-exploitation, improve operations andincrease
        investments innational tourism resources through direct andindirect charges
    0   Approval by Congress o f user fees to maritime activities, protectedareas and
        whale-watching, and earmarkingo fthe revenues for reinvestment inthe tourism
        resource that generated the revenue

58.     These reforms resulted ina 200-fold increase inmarinepark revenues, and inthe
re-channeling o fuser fees for the management o f marine protectedareas. The
Government publicly discloses information onthe amount o f funds collected, inorder to
maintaintransparency andimprove environmental management. The Governmenthas
also implementeda set o f indicators andbenchmarks for measuringgood environmental
performance intourism sector activities.


Forestry

59.     The targets for the forestry sector were achieved. These goals were to develop the
new legal framework for the sector, andto create the basis for an adequate valuationo f
the resources, including the payment for environmentalservices. EnvSAL Isupported the
medium-term priorities o fthe 2001-2006 NationalForest Programthrough regulatory and
policy reforms, creationo f a publicly accessible planningand information system,
increased employment andincome generation for forest dwellers, biodiversity
conservation while promoting sustainable exploitationof forest resources, improved
definition o fpropertyrights, anddecentralization o f forest management.

60.     A keycomponent ofthis process is the valuationofenvironmental services, and
the creation and development o fmarkets for such services (for which a studywas
recently concluded). To these ends, the Government promulgatedin2003 the General
Law for Sustainable Forestry Development, which sets national and subnational roles and
responsibilities for the conservation, protection, production, harvesting andmanagement
o fMexico's forest resources. To ensure that forested area changes yield positive results,
the Government also updated the legal and administrativeprocedures for changing land
use.

OUTCOME

61.       Based on the foregoing results andthe assessment o frelevance, efficacy, and
efficiency that follows, the overall outcome o f EnvSAL Ii s ratedsatisfactory as shown
below.

62.       Itisimportant to analyze what accounts for this outcome. OED's evaluations
often derive lessons onthe importance o f country commitment as a key factor o fgood
performance. Inthe case o f EnvSAL I,       which was disbursed inFY2003, country
ownership o fthe agenda significantlypreceded the loan inthat the Government already
had a National DevelopmentPlan2001-2006 (NDP). Inline with the NDP,
SEMARNAT also prepared an environmentalpolicy -the Environment andNatural
Resources Program 2001-2006 (ENRP)-which             emphasizes the mainstreamingo f
environmental sustainability principles inthe actions o fministries and other institutions
invarious economic sectors.A keycomponent o fENRPistheprogramdeveloped by
SEMARMAT -called the Programto Promote Sustainable Development inthe Federal
Government (PPSD) -which aims to improve the environmentalsustainability o f 16
ministries and agenciesbased on specific goals. The ENRPwas expanded in2004 to
include Public Policy Trans-sectoral Agendas for Sustainable Development, which
incorporate environmentalsustainability goals for 32 public institutions.

63.       Whde it is essential to have the country inthe leadership role, this presents
evaluationchallenges inthat it i s difficult to attribute outcomes directly to the Bank's
interventions. Indeed, many o fthe EnvSAL Iactions were already being initiatedin
2001 when the loan was beingdesigned. For example, in2001 (one year beforeEnvSAL
I),MinistryofEnergy(SENER)hadalreadyembarkedonanEnergySectorProgram,
    the
which includes objectives to increase energy efficiency, produce a higher percentage o f
energy from renewable resources, and implement environmentalmanagement programs
infacilities for oil andgas extractionandprocessing, aswell as electricityproduction,
transmission anddistribution. Then, in2002, SEMARNAT and SENERjointly
developed the EnvironmentProgram for the Energy Sector, which includes
environmental sustainability goals to be includedinthe energy sector's commitments
under the 2001-2006 NDP. Although the Bank andGOMjointly determinedwhich
sectors would be supported underthe Program, manyo fthe energy sector's
environmentalpolicies andplannedactions (described inthe preceding section on
Results), andthose o f other sectors were conceptualized or initiated prior to EnvSAL I.

                                               21


 64.    Itis important, therefore, to beclear whether performance isbeingassessedin
terms o fthe project having ledto (i)  results on the ground, or (ii) creation o f a "policy
                                                                    the
 space" or forum for coordination and consultation processes designed to leadto concrete
results later. GivenOED's objectives-based methodology, an important guide is the
EnvSAL's ProgramDocument, w h c h indicates that EnvSAL, even inits thirdoperation,
does not aim inits outcomes for measurablereductions inenvironmental degradation, but
rather for the establishment o f different hnds o f stakeholder processes. Consequently, for
the purposes o fthis evaluation, the objective framework i s keyedto processes, rather than
actual environmentalindicators.

65.     For future environmentalprogrammatic loans, however, final outcomes upon
Programcompletionshould bekeyed to measurable improvements inspecific geographic
areas. Moreover, for purpose o f assessingthe achievement o f objectives, it is best if
processing triggers are clearly distinguished fiom both final and interim outcomes. For
Development Policy Loans in general, triggers should not bepresented as outcomes in
the SimpllJiedICRsfor each interim operation. (For the Mexico EnvSAL I,        insome
cases, the final outcome indicators were identicalto the indicators associated with the
triggers.) Otherwise, a program can consist o f achievingonly processes, the benefits o f
which are hardto measure and for which broad-based support canbe difficult to sustain.

Relevance

66.     The relevance o fthe EnvSALprogramandthis first operationis ratedhigh. This
first loandirectly support actions that promote environmentalsustainability, which i s one
o fthe three pillars o fthe 2004-2007 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Mexico. The
loans also support the Government's Program for Promoting Sustainable Development in
the Federal Government.




67.     The efficacy o fEnvSAL Iinachievingits objectives i s ratedhigh. The operation
resulted directly inthe mainstreamingo f environmentalconsiderations across sector
agencies, as well as between these agencies and SEMARNAT andthe Finance Ministry.
This high-level inter-institutional coordination, consultation, stakeholder participation,
andthe resultingsynergies inenvironmentalpolicies andactionplans didnot exist
effectively prior to the project. But can the individual sector outcomes discussed above
under the Results section be attributedto EnvSALI?       Onlyindirectly. The sector-by-
sector environmental strategies pre-existed EnvSAL I,    andwhile the operation facilitated
their implementation andcross-sectoral coordination, many o fthe specific actions would
have proceeded insome form without the EnvSAL.

Efjcien cy

68.     Since this i s an adjustment operation with no physical components, the rate o f
return calculations that are required for regular investment projects do not apply andthus
efficiency is not rated. However, it shouldbe notedthat the EnvSAL's preparation and
appraisal costs were high. There were two preparationmissions conductedbynine

                                             22


specialists. Supervisionwas equally intensive -five were conducted duringthe one-year
disbursement period. Since this is the first programmatic loano f its kind, there are no
available comparators for cost efficiency. Such comparisons shouldbe possible once the
ICRs for similar operations become available.

INSTITUTIONAL     DEVELOPMENT     IMPACT

69.     The project's InstitutionalDevelopment Impact i s ratedhigh. EnvSAL I resulted
inthe establishment o fmechanisms for inter-institutionalcoordinationbetween
SEMARNAT andthe water, energy, tourism and forestry sectors. EnvSAL Icreated a
common forum where intersecting issuesor closely relatedareas o fwork couldbe
coordinated amongthese agencies, without necessarily imposing common approaches.
For the four sectors andthe Ministryo f Finance, EnvSAL Iset specific targets with clear
deadlines, several o fwhich were linkedto ongoing programs and some stemming fi-om
new discussions. Whereas before, each sectoral agency handled environmental problems
inisolation, EnvSALI initiatedthe consultativeprocess ofidentifyingpolicygaps and
developing comprehensive solutions that involve disciplined approaches to negotiations
among the sector agencies concerned. EnvSALI created the forum that allowed
permanent dialogue amongpowerful sector agencies at the time when environmental
policy guidelines were beingformulated. Fiscal instruments (e.g., water fees andcharges)
were jointly designed bythe sector agency andthe Ministryo fFinance. These EnvSAL I
processeshad the additional benefit o fpromoting transparency and accountability in
environmentaldecision-making that cuts across sectors. EnvSAL Ialso forced
SEMARNAT to dramatically update its operations to matchthe adjustment loan's
environmentalmainstreaming objectives.

SUSTAINABILITY

70.     The EnvSAL's sustainabilityis ratedlikely. The institutional mechanisms that
were put inplace are fully operational andhave been integrated ineach o fthe sector
agencies operations, staffing andbudgetingprocesses. The actions were not ad hoc but
were basedon the promulgationor amendment o frequisite laws andregulations, some o f
themrequiring approvalat the highest levels ofGovernment. The transfer o fresources to
municipalities fi-om user fees inthe water and forestry sectors continues andbackedup
byagreementsbetweenparticipatingmunicipalities andthe federal government. More
broadly, the EnvSAL 1's outcomes laidthe groundwork for further actions that will be
pursuedunder two further Banklendingoperations, under the umbrella o fthe
Government's 2001-2006 National DevelopmentPlan.

BANKPERFORMANCE

71.    The Bank's performance is ratedsatisfactory. The programandthe first loan
were prepared and supervised (albeit at highcosts) by a large multidisciplinary team,
which included specialists inenvironmental management, engineering, law and
economics; water resources management; energy economics; financial management;
urbanplanningandoperations. The Bank's approach also reflectedlearningfrompast
projects. As the MEP's PPARpointed out, the Bankmust realize that the institutions are

                                                  23


 likely to continue evolving, as governments try different approachesto environmental
management, andthat determiningthe direction andpace o f institutional development are
 largely the country`s management culture andcurrent political agenda. A 1999Bank
 studyonthe issue infact questions the ability o fthe Bank's project-by-project approach
to make a difference as the country leams and adapts its environmental management
 institutions over the long term.'

 72.       Mexico's EnvSALIwas the first programmatic environmental structural
 adjustment loan, but it would be important to compare its costs with other loans o fthis
kind(once completed) to determine whether the costs were excessive. One areawhere the
Bankcouldhave donebetterwas inits owninternalcoordinationamong sectors andunits
working on the environment. Portfolio andproject pipeline activities inthe water sector
 andunder the Global EnvironmentalFacility financing (particularly those onrenewable
energy) were not linked effectivelyvis-&vis the EnvSALprogram. More strategic
coordination and financial leveragingcould have resulted ina greater impact inachieving
the EnvSAL's matrix o fprogram objectives.


BORROWER        PERFORMANCE

73.        The Borrower's performance i s ratedsatisfactory. There was some resistance to
dialogue and cooperation initially, partlybecauseEnvSAL I(or any foreign loan) didnot
result inincreased fimdingfor the sector agencies. However, a major sign o f
Government commitment is the past and continuedinterest o fthe sector agencies to
participate inthe fillEnvSALprogramygdespite the fact that under the rules o f the
Secretariat o fFinance the loan finds are non-additional to their budgets, andthey have to
trimother programs to implementEnvSALactions. Collectingwater fees andcharges is a
difficult political issue, but this measure was presented bythe Ministryo f Finance and
approved by Congress. The partnership betweenthe Borrower andthe Bankwas evident.
Establishingdialogue across sectors, which didnot exist before, i s hardto establish and
requiredpolitical astutenessand a systematic approach, respectivelythe Government's
andthe Bank's role.

CONCLUSIONSAND LESSONSLEARNED

74.       To achieve a strategic perspective spanningalmost 15 years o f Bankinvolvement
inMexico's environment, theover-arching lessonspresentedbelowwere basedonthe
MEP, NBEPandEnvSALItakentogether. The project specific lessons o fthe MEP,
fkom the PPAR on the project, are providedinAnnex B. The mainlessons o fthis
assessment are:

    0     Quickly capitalizing on narrow windows o fpolitical opportunity to accelerate the
          Bank's processing o f large environmentalinfrastructureoperations canbe highly
          risky, since it can lead, as it didunder the NBEP, to over-ambitious design,

                                        24


  inadequately prepared implementingagencies andpoor overall quality at entry,
  especially when political expediency i s allowedto drive the preparationand
  appraisal timetable.


0 Targetingproject support for local agencies inmore direct ways helps them
  assume more responsibilities andcontribute inmore measurable ways to
  environmentalsustainability. This support needs to be concrete andunder their
  control. Incontrast, "top-down" approaches tendto focus on the broader enabling
  environment, butmay neglect the lack o f skills andresources at local levels,
  which hampers subnational agencies from delivering on their responsibilities.


0 Incaseswhere theprocessingtriggers for the programmatic loans are different
  from interimresults and final outcomes, these triggers shouldbe clearly
  distinguished inthe simplified ICRs. Final outcomes andimpacts uponProgram
  completion have to be keyedto measurable improvements inambient
  environmental conditions. Otherwise, the whole program could remain "process-
  oriented", its benefits hardto measure and its value-added too ill-defined to gamer
  broad-based support.


0 Prior Government commitment and formal policies as well as a time-based plan
  are crucial pre-requisites for the successful implementation o f Environmental
  DevelopmentPolicy Loans. Desiredpolicy outcomes andpractical constraints
  need to be clear inorder to enhancedialogue andpromote synergies. Where these
  conditions are present, the Bank canplay an effective role through environmental
  DevelopmentPolicy Loans by forging the cross-sectoral coordination and
  consultation mechanisms, jointly defining actions, monitoring delivery timetables,
  andproviding analytical andadvisoryassistanceto deliver the Government's own
  environmental program.

LESSONS MEXICOENVIRONMENTAL
        OF THE                                         PROJECT 1992


    Project designsneed to be focused. The MEPwas an extreme case o f tryingto
    cater to too manydemands. A design that has many deliverables andmany
    detailed activities i s a good sign o f a project lacking a core group o f objectives.
    Highlevelofcomplexity invitesmicromanagement andhnders the flexibility
   neededto accommodate changes duringthe project cycle.


 0 Expect surprises, particularly inthe environmental sector. Project risks are
   routinely treated as incrementalwithin a few percentage points around expected
   values. Few analyses face up to the risk o fmajor surprises. No one would blame
   the MEP for not anticipatingMexico's 1995 financial crisis, but it is difficult to
   understandhow it couldhave overlookedthe signs anddirections o fthe 1992 and
    1995 institutionalreforms inMexico's environmentalsector. The fact is that
   changes ininstitutional arrangements have been the norm for environmental
   institutions around the world duringthe past 20 years as governments try different
   approaches to handle this new area o f government. The chance o fmajor changes
   intheinstitutionalframework shouldbeacknowledged inthe designof
   institutional strengthening projects.


 0 Major changes in a sector need to be done intandem with adjustments to the
   nationalpolicy. The project ICR correctly points to the difficulty o f fostering
   decentralization o f one sectoral agency ifit does not makes part o f a general
   government decentralization policy.


 0 Move from financing activities to financing goals. The Bank's 1999 Country
   Assistance Strategy for Mexico makes the point that Bank lendingto the country
   shouldmove from activities to goals. Environmentalprojects usually encompass
   many small activities that are illsuited to traditional Bank procedures. Such
   projects would be good candidates for the Bank's Adaptive Program Lending
   (APL),whereby full slices oftheproject are clearedinadvance andthe emphasis
   moves to auditing the outcomes and away from trackingprogress inmyriad
   intermediate activities.


 0 Bank staff, and staff at the local agencies, should be better aware of their
   counterpart operationalframeworks. Conflicts andmisunderstandings between
   the country andthe Bank legal and administrative frameworks were a usual
   source o f friction anddelay throughout the project cycle. These difficulties were
   sometimes exacerbatedby highrotation o f the Bank staff assigned to the project.
   Complex projects shouldacknowledge the cost o f these problems and seek ways
   top address them. Inthese regardthe recently enlarged Bank country office in
   Mexico i s well positionedto help negotiate these situations infuture projects.

Annex C. KeyAchievements of the NBEP



 1. Theproject enhancedPROFEPA's capacity to enforce environmentalregulations
    for industry andthe naturalresources sector through the development o f auditing
    policies andpractices, and an expansion o f its ability to conduct audits and
    inspections ingreater number and o f improvedquality. The number o f industrial
    inspections, which focused on air quality andtoxic wastes, increased from 1,000
    per year before the NBEPto more than 12,000 per year for much of the project,
    totaling more than 99,000 by the NBEP's closure. Ofthese, more than21,000
    were conducted inthe border region. Inlater years, the inspections were o f higher
    quality, emphasizing critical compliance issues, which accounts for the decrease
    to roughly 7,000 per year. Follow-up actionplans were implemented for a large
    percentage o fthe inspections. Inthe area ofnatural resources (forestry, wildlife,
    marine, protectedareas and others) a total o f 108,000 inspections were carried
    out.

 2. NBEPhelpedto establish PROFEPA as an effective environmental enforcement
    institutionrecognized for its high-quality work. While private firms initially
    resisted audits, andthe project hadto finance them entirely inorder for this project
    activity to continue, they were later willing to pay as obtaining a Certificate for
    Clean Industrybecame an incentive. PROFEPA's audits are now internationally
    recognized. Brazilis basing its environmental auditing on Mexico's andU.S.-
    based multinational corporations are requesting their Mexican affiliates to have
    PROFEPAconduct anaudit to obtain CleanIndustryCertificates. The project's
    original design couldbe criticized for not havingtargeted the energy sector, a
    major polluter. Yet under NBEP's audit sub-component, PEMEX, the large
    parastatal Mexicanpetroleum company, has been brought under public
    environmental scrutiny.

 3. Contaminated site inventories for 15 states were completed, including the 6 along
    the border. Some o fthese sites were characterized for the development o f
    rehabilitationmeasures. (However, one shortcoming surfaced after 2000, when
    responsibilityover these sites was transferred from PROFEPAto INE.No hnds
    existed for clean-up andthe highcosts at times equaled PROFEPA's entire annual
    budget. Thus, no clean-up project was pursued.)

 4. The nationalEnvironmentalEmergencies Center was created, along with a
    network to respond to environmental disasters. The network involves industryand
    government agencies at all levels inemergency response planning. The Center's
    creation was a major NBEP success PROFEPA's capacity to respondto
    environmentalemergencies didnot exist earlier.

 5. The project resulted ina strengthened system to resolvepublic environmental
   complaints that are brought to the attentiono fPROFEPA. The system receiveda

                                           32                                 Annex C


   strong public response and i s resolving 85 percent o f complaints with the help of
   an informationmanagement system.

6. The project ledto the development o fanindustrialandnaturalresource inspection
   and surveillance informationsystem, andabroader informationmanagement
   system, the InstitutionalSystem for Strategic Information(Sistema Institucional
   de Informaci6nEstratCgica, or SIJE), under which all o fPROFEPA's 32
   informationsystems are integrated, to monitor regulatory compliance andenable
   improveddecision-making. SIIE has significantly reduced costs andtime for the
   500-800potential users among the inspectors andlawyers o fPROFEPA. The
   agency, infact, won prizes fiom INOVA andthe Mexican Government for the
   SIIE, and the Bankis now tryingto create such a system inCentralAmerica.
   Because it monitors enforcement activities, the system has significantly reduced
   corruptioninenvironmental enforcement inMexico.

7. NBEPresulted inthe demarcation o f 7 protectedareas along the border andthe
   development o fmanagement plans for 5 ofthese, for the protectiono f
   biodiversity and endangered species inthis region. Supportingthe management o f
   these areas are key studies, equipment andpermanent staff. The project also
   initiated activities for tourism, environmental education, sustainable resource use,
   andcommunity participation.

8. NBEP also strengthened the institutional capacity o f states andmunicipalities in
   the border regionto enable themto conduct their environmentalresponsibilities
   under Mexicanlaw. Technical assistance andtraining supported environmental
   departments inthe formulation and implementation o fregulations and standards,
   and infrastructure and equipment provision allowed quality testing for air, water
   andsoil to occur. All the border states and 16municipalitiesdeveloped
   environmentalaction plans and are participating actively inenvironmental and
   socio-economic planning.

Partialwaivers were requested for the following conditions:

1) Theestablishmentof Intersectorial Technical Working Groups (ITWGs) in thefour
sectors being composed of members with designatedtitles. The ITWGswere established
andare fully functional, yet arequest for apartialwaiver was due to the fact that a few of
the titles for the members o fthe ITWGsas described inthe EnvSAL changed during
implementation. These changes were either to ensure more appropriate representation in
the ITWGthanwas originally envisaged or due to reorganizationo f an agency.
Nevertheless, inall cases, the positions are at the same organizational level as envisaged
inthe EnvSAL, continueto bewiththe sameagencies specifiedintheProgram, and
perfomthe appropriate substantive functions.

state governmentsfrom that agency. The request for the partialwaiver was necessitated
bylegislative and staff changesconcerning SEMARNAT. The majority o fhnctions .
relatedto EIA review andapproval andpermits described inthe EnvSALwere certified
for the second tranche to be disbursed. The exceptions related to (a) forest fire detection
andcontrol, asthis was transferred out ofSEMARNAT to the ForestryCommission; and
(b) non-timber reporting, which was delayed due to a decision taken to reviewpermitting
procedures with the purpose o f combining some permits and changing the permit
issuance process. The review resulted inthe merging o f some permits andthe elimination
o f others. Interms o f certification, the Government decided to de-link certification from
the decentralization process. Certification i s considered important to promote "continuous
improvement" but i s seen as less important inthe process o f assuring the quality o f
decentralization. The timing for certificationwill also dependon the timetable for
consolidatingpermittingprocedures.

3) Public disclosure of processing information on EIA review and issuance of certain
permits by SEMARNAT. The majority o fprocessing informationo fpermits is disclosed
onpublic websites. As under (2) above, the partial waiver for public disclosure was
relatedto (a) forest fire detection and control, and non-timber reporting. It was deemed
sensible to await completion ofthe review o fpermitting procedures before a system was
set up to publicly disclose these procedures.

Annex E. Comments fromthe Borrower


Introduction


The objective o f Loans 3750-ME and 7136-ME was the improvemento fthe environment
through the strengthening o f federal, state, and municipal institutions in charge o f
managing all matters related to the environment.


The original objectives o f the Northern Border Environmental Project, which was
approved in 1994, were to improve environmental conditions in the border area o f
northern Mexico through support to the Federal Government and the states and
municipalities o f the border region; the objectives o f the Environmental Structural
Adjustment Loan, approved in2002, were aimed at supporting the efforts o f the Federal
Government to incorporate environmental aspects into the development programs o f key
sectors and improve the efficiency o f local environmental management processes in
Mexico.


Several agencies o f the Federal Government participated in the development o f these
projects, working ina coordinated manner with state and municipal authorities according
to their functions and responsibilities within the environmental sector, and as executing
agencies o f the loans, including SEMARNAT, PROFEPA, CONANP, SEDESOL,
SECTUR, CNA, and SENER.


The following comments were submitted by the executing agencies through
SEMARNAT-the        country's chief Secretariat on the environment-expressing       their
points o f view with regard to the development of each loan. Finally there are some
conclusions derived from the outcomes achieved, as well as the lessons learned during
the implementation o f these projects.

(NBEP)   .

SECRETARIAT OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES
(SEMARNAT) .


We consider that in the evaluation o f the NBEP it is important to mention the
economic and climatic conditions that prevailed during project implementation such
as sharp devaluations o f the peso and natural disasters that led to the reduction o f the
budgets assigned to the executing agencies. Also, there were structural changes in
public funds, mainly with reference to municipal transfers on the one hand, which
were channeled directly to the beneficiaries, thus preventing the Federal Government
from making investments in infrastructure; and on the other hand, resources from
foreign borrowing, which were no longer supplementary to the budget assigned to
the agencies.


With regard to the training receivedby the staff o f the agencies involved, the results
are evident, especially inthe States and Municipalities since most o f the trained staff
continued working in the agencies, applying the acquired knowledge, despite
changes inmanagement.


With respect to the studies financed with NBEP resources, for the most part they
were usefid as the basis for the development o f policies and programs to support the
decision-makingof environmentalauthorities.


LOAN 7136-ME. PROGRAMMATIC ENVIRONMENTAL STRUCTURAL
ADJUSTMENT LOAN.


SECRETARIAT OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES
(SEMARNAT).


This first stage o f the program allowed us to support the efforts o f the new federal
administration toward the modernization o f the environmental sector and the
integration o f environmental issues into the governmental sectors.


The adjustment loan included actions that were integrated into current Federal
Government programs aimed at creating, expanding, or complementing the process
o f including environmental issues inthe sectoral agendas inorder to achieve greater

                                                39                                Annex E


 impact in terms o f efficiency and effectiveness within a decentralized model o f
 environmental management. A hdamental part o f the Program i s to commit
 adequate financing for environmental management, thus optimizing the use o f
 financial resources and the synergies generated by the actions derived fi-om
 intersectoral coordination.
~




 Some o f the advantages o f continuing with this program and which i s part o f the
 experience gained would be: that the program acts as a catalyst for achieving goals in
 priority areas o f the Transversality" Agenda; greater probability that future
 administrations will maintain the program, particularly the Transversality Agenda;
 and, reducedrisk o fradical changesinpolicies.


 The priority actions comprising the program reflect the need for being selective,
 recognizing the extent o f the environmental challenges facing the country that has
 led us to adopt prioritized criteria, complementing those already defined in the
 National Program for the Environment andNaturalResources.


 NATIONALWATER COMMISSION (NWC)


 The experience gained through the Environmental Adjustment Loan for the water
 sector was beneficial because it provided the opportunity to establish a collaborative
 effort among the sectors involved allowing us to focus our actions toward a common
 objective: sustainable development and environmentalprotection.


 However, we consider that it would be advisable that the project leader designated by
 the World Bank be fluent in Spanish to avoid misunderstandings and waste o f time
 bybothparties. Itwould also bepositiveifthe project leader remainsinthe post until
 the end o fthe project to avoid misunderstandings on the same.


 We wish to reiterate that the actions contained inthe matrix o f commitments for the
 follow-on operation are indicative and will be specified or modified as appropriate
 once the negotiations on the following stage take place.

   1. Rotations of the working teams affected the performance o f the projects. In
      addition, it i s the opinion of the executing agencies that greater familiarity with
      the Mexican context by World Bank project leaders would have been
      advantageous.


   2. There is potential for improvement in the training provided to those responsible
      for project implementation with regard to World Bank standards applicable to
      these type o fprojects.


   3. The projects had a highlevel o f technical complexity and coordination o f actions

Lessons Learned


   1. In future loans involving more than one implementing agency, especially in
      structural adjustment loans, it would be advisable to have clear incentives for each
      o f the involved agencies to achieve the objectives o fthe project.


   2. It would be advisable to strengthen the institutional memory mechanisms to
      diminish the effect o f the rotationo f officials who makeup the worlung teams.


   3. Ensure that project components to be financed are not included in other federal or
      state environmental programs, in order to avoid duplication of financial efforts.
