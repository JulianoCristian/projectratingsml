The NBEP and EnvSAL\n            I together offer the Bank some important lessons for its\n            future assistance in strengthening the capacity of\n            environmental institutions and as it tries new lending\n            instruments (such as Development Policy Loans) to achieve\n            this goal. They are: 1) Quickly capitalizing on narrow\n            windows of political opportunity to accelerate the\n            Bank's processing o f large environmental\n            infrastructure operations can be highly risky, since it can\n            lead, as it did under the NBEP, to over-ambitious design,\n            inadequately prepared implementing agencies and poor overall\n            quality at entry, especially when political considerations\n            are allowed to drive the preparation and appraisal\n            timetable. 2) Targeting project support for local agencies\n            in more direct ways helps them assume more responsibilities\n            and contribute in more measurable ways to environmental\n            sustainability. This support needs to be concrete and under\n            their control. In contrast, \"top-down\" approaches\n            tend to focus on the broader enabling environment, but may\n            neglect the lack of skills and resources at local levels. 3)\n            In cases where the processing triggers for the programmatic\n            loans are different from interim results and final outcomes,\n            these triggers should be clearly distinguished in the\n            simplified Implementation Completion Reports. 4) Prior\n            Government commitment and formal policies as well as a\n            time-based plan are crucial prerequisites for the successful\n            implementation of Environmental Development Policy Loans.\n            Desired policy outcomes and practical constraints need to be\n            clear in order to enhance dialogue and promote synergies."}, "docdt": "2005-07-11T00:00:00Z"}
