It would\n            support the first year of ESF's program, which consists\n            of small scale employment and income generating sub-projects\n            (75% of funding) as well as social assistance sub projects\n            (25% of funding). The ESF program is targeted to those\n            suffering most from the effects of the crisis and the\n            economic adjustment process, such as short term\n            unemployment. The project would support the strengthening of\n            the ESF through the testing and elaboration of the\n            procedures and criteria for sub project selection\n            implementation. Finally, it would provide support for\n            planning the second and third years of ESF's program\n            and associated monitoring mechanisms."}, "docdt": "1987-06-04T00:00:00Z"}
