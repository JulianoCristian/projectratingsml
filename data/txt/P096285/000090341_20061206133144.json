The environmental issues involved in the\n            project are generally clear and insignificant and,\n            therefore, the environmental management of the project is\n            relatively simple, a totally separate environmental\n            management system is not necessary. An environmental\n            management system which is embedded in the project\n            management system and makes full use of existing project\n            management resources is to be established. China Development\n            Bank (CDB) will take necessary steps to ensure that\n            participating financial institutions (PFIs) put in place\n            environmentally sound policies and procedures to enable\n            credit officers and other staff to adhere to the pertinent\n            Chinese laws and regulations governing environmental\n            screening, assessment and reporting in the process of credit\n            appraisal and administration.
