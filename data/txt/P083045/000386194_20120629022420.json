This restructuring paper seeks approval of the\n            Executive Directors to restructure the project to trigger\n            the pest management operational policy. In addition, the\n            restructuring paper informs the Board that the involuntary\n            resettlement policy was applied under the project and\n            reflected in the grant agreement, but it was not reflected\n            in the project appraisal document. No restriction of access\n            to natural resources within protected areas has occurred,\n            and none is expected to occur. However, in the unlikely\n            event that activities under second component for the\n            implementation of management plans in protected areas were\n            to restrict access to natural resources, a process framework\n            is in place to address this issue. The project is currently\n            rated moderately satisfactory for progress towards\n            achievement of the Project Development Objective (PDO) and\n            Global Environmental Objective (GEO), and moderately\n            unsatisfactory for overall implementation progress. In the\n            first two years after effectiveness, the project suffered\n            severe delays. Since mid- 2010, project performance has been\n            mixed, with strong performance between mid- and end-2010.\n            The most recent project delay was caused by changes in key\n            leadership within the implementing agency, National\n            Authority of Environment (ANAM), in early 2011. The changes\n            consist of triggering the safeguard policy on pest\n            management to ensure that the project has the adequate\n            safeguard management framework to supervise that\n            agricultural pesticides are reaching target organisms, and\n            of appropriate classification consequently not posing an\n            environmental threat as well as protecting human health from\n            management and use of pesticides. A small use of acceptable\n            pesticides was envisaged for the implementation of the subprojects."}, "docdt": "2012-05-10T00:00:00Z"}
