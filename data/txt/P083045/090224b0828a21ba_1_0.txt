                         The Project Development Objective of the partially-blended Rural Productivity and Sustainable Development Project is to contribute to increased income and
                         employment of small-scale rural producers in Panama. The Global Environmental Objective is to conserve biodiversity of global importance and protect important
                         forest, mountain and marine-coastal ecosystems in Panama.

                         support mission carried out for the Rural Productivity Project, Loan 7439-PA. The Grant has closed on July 31, 2014, and the Loan will close on January 27, 2015. The activities
                         under component 3 (GEF/ANAM component) of Loan 7439-PA are almost completed with a disbursement of about 100%. The results indicators show the project is on track to
                         achieve its PDO. Most of the remaining activities under the Loan will focus on measuring progress and final impact, recording of fiduciary and safeguard measures, and preparation of
