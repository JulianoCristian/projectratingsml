                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Although there is no record of negative impact due to the use of pesticides, the mid-term review mission recommended a project restructuring to trigger the Pest Management Policy
                         (OP 4.09) The proposed restructuring offers the opportunity to develop and implement comprehensive management practices and specific measures to control the use and
                         application of pesticides in the environmental subprojects, particularly in those agricultural related, thereby, reducing runoff of water ecosystems and marine environment. A Pest
                         Management Plan was prepared and incorporated into the Operational Manual.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.

                         Related Projects
                         There are no related projects.
