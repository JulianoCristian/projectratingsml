                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation

                         The Grant closing date was extended from June 28, 2013 to July 31, 2014 to make it consistent with the Loan closing date. As partially-blended operations, the activities under the
                         Grant and the Loan are inextricably linked. Component 3 of the Loan is solely a co-financing of the GEF activities. The extension would permit (i) the continuation of the co-financed
                         activities, (ii) the completion of environmental subprojects and, (iii) the proper monitoring and evaluation to allow the PDO and GEO to be reached.

                         Next implementation support mission is scheduled for October/November 2013.
