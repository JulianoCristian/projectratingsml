      ATLANTIC MESOAMERICAN BIOLOGICAL CORRIDOR (GEF)

                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER


1.      The closing date for the Panama Rural Productivity and Consolidation of the
Atlantic Mesoamerican Biological Corridor Project (GEF), TF056628, P083045, will be
extended from June 28, 2013 until July 31, 2014. At the same time, Grant proceeds will
be reallocated among disbursement categories.

2.      The Project is implemented by the National Authority of Environment (ANAM)
and is financed with a GEF Grant (TF056628) and co-financed with an IBRD Loan (Loan
7439-PA). The Grant was approved by the Board on June 15, 2006 and became effective
on January 18, 2007. The current closing date of the Grant is June 28, 2013. The closing
date of the Loan was recently extended from January 31, 2013, to July 31, 2014.

3.     Project implementation in 2012 has improved significantly with respect to the
previous year due to the strong ownership demonstrated by ANAM, and the efforts of the
renewed Project Implementation Unit (PIU). As confirmed by the last supervision
mission in November 2012, the Project Development Objective continues to be
achievable. Currently, the Project has met its target of 350 environmental subprojects
under implementation, with 44% of women participation that exceeds its target of 40%,
and has incorporated 36,088 ha of forests to effective conservation and sustainable
management practices (72% of the target). The PIU has been considerably strengthened,
with 80 percent staff newly recruited in the past eight months.

4.     The Project is currently rated Moderately Satisfactory for Overall Implementation
Progress and Satisfactory for Progress towards achievement of GEO, and is in full
compliance with the Bank’s financial management and safeguards requirements. To
date, 96% of the total Grant amount has been disbursed (US$5.76 million), and 71%
(US$7.1 million) of the total Loan amount.

5.       The above-proposed extension is necessary to permit the Project to complete
successfully implementation of the activities that are blended with component 3 of Loan,
particularly the monitoring and evaluation of the environmental subprojects, and thereby
attain its PDO and GEO. All activities to be financed have been agreed with the Bank.

6.     This will be the first extension of the project closing date.

7.      In addition, the proposed reallocation would allow the PIU to distribute the
resources under Category 4, Unallocated, among the other three categories. Also,
allocation in Category 3 for Municipal Pilot Subprojects will be reduced in 33% in view
that only one municipal pilot subproject out of the two pilots originally planned will be
implemented, as agreed in the mid-term evaluation in June 2011, in view of the delays for
implementation of the decentralization law. This reduction will have no negative impact
in the achievement of the PDO and GEO.
