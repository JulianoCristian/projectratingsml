                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR is based on the findings of an implementation support mission conducted on February 21-28, 2014 in conjunction with the associated Loan 7439-PA on Rural Productivity.

                         Project implementation has almost been completed. All Grant funds have been disbursed, and most Project targets reached. The Project continues to advance, building on the
                         achievements already acknowledged during the previous supervision mission. The Project development indicators have shown progress towards achievement of the Project

                         development objective. Management effectiveness of protected areas as measured by the GEF Tracking tool has increased and shows improvement in local and institutional
                         capacity. As of February 28, 2014, the number of direct beneficiaries is 40,233 (56.67% men, and 43.33% women). The national system of information and monitoring of biodiversity
                         (SNMDB) has been implemented in three protected areas. To date, 2 national endemic species of flora and 4 of fauna have been found.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         A technical mission for the preparation of the Implementation Completion Report of the project is expected around July 2014. Preparation of the follow up operation (Sustainable
                         Production Systems and Conservation of Biodiversity Project) funded by GEF in the amount of US$9.59 million has continued. The Bank will seek endorsement from the new
                         administration of ANAM on the project design, and agree on next steps to finalize preparation.
