                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project Development Objective of the partially-blended Rural Productivity and Sustainable Development Project is to contribute to increased income and
                         employment of small-scale rural producers in Panama. The Global Environmental Objective is to conserve biodiversity of global importance and protect important
                         forest, mountain and marine-coastal ecosystems in Panama.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project performance continues to be satisfactory. Progress in achieving the PDO continues to be likely. Although most of the issues identified in earlier missions have been
                         addressed, implementation progress rating continues to be moderately satisfactory until further improvement is reached in component 2 with respect to co-management
                         arrangements and completion of municipal environmental plans.

                         Grant funds are now fully disbursed, with a remaining balance in the associated loan that will allow ANAM to complete all project activities by July 31, 2014.

                         The target of 350 subprojects has been now fully met reaching 10,726 direct beneficiaries (6,118 men, and 4,648 women), and 40,051 indirect beneficiaries. Protected Areas
                         management has further improved, as measured by the GEF Tracking Tool (with current score 67%, with baseline of 45%). Good progress has been reported with respect to the
