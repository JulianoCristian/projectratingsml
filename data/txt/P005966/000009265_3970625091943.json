It is intended to encourage\n            modernization and increase production and productivity of\n            SMIs. This will promote competitiveness as well as foster\n            employment and help develop SMIs outside the major urban\n            areas. It will also establish a medium to long term lending\n            system. This will operate through a permanent second tier\n            mechanism (the Development Fund for SMIs--FOPYME) which has\n            been set up within the National Development Bank (BANADE).\n            This will strengthen BANADE to enable it to act as a\n            rediscount institution for SMI lending by participating\n            banks. In addition the project will also establish a\n            coordinated technical assistance program for SMIs."}, "docdt": "1987-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
