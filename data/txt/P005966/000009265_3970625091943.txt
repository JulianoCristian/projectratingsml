MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO TEE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE ARGENTINE REPUBLIC
FOR A SHALL AND MEDIUM-SCALE INDUSTRY CREDIT PROJECT
1.        The following report, on a proposed loan for US$125 million equivalent
(Schedule A) to the Republic of Argentina, is submitted for approval. The
proposed loan would be on standard Bank terms, to be repaid over 15 years,
including three years of grace, at the Bank standard variable rate.
2.        Background.  In 1984, Small and Medium-Scale Industry (SMI) accounted
for 97%, 55%, and 44% of industrial firms, employment and output, respectively.
Lately, the sector is experiencing a modest revival as a result of the
Government's new economic policies and interest in SMI development, coupled with
some SMI advantages, such as operating flexibility, a capacity to cope with
uncertainties of the economy, and current low SKI indebtedness. The local market
offers substantial possibilities for further growth based upon these advantages,
provided that adequate credit and technical assistance (TA) are available. The
external market for direct and indirect exports presents additional opportunities
to SKIs in the medium to longer run. Exploitation of these opportunities will be
based upon far-reaching trade and industrial policy reforms already initiated by
the Government, and for which it has requested Bank support (para. 10).
3.        The Government has already initiated trade policy reform, by abolishing
export taxes on manufactures (which were levied mainly upon predominantly SKI
subsectors), taking a series of measures to encourage exports, and preparing a
draft law to initiate reforms of the industrial promotion regimes. It has also
started a program of financial sector reform with measures designed to reduce
forced investments and rediscounts, deregulate lending operations, restructure
financial intermediaries, and strengthen supervision of banks. In addition, it has
established a range for private sector wage settlements and would selectively
reduce price regulations for those sectors with a high degree of competition. At
present, the main constraint for SMI development is the shortage of credit on
suitable terLns. Since adequate progress is being achieved on trade and financial
sector reform, an operation to support SMIs will make a useful and needed
contribution to economic reactivation and employment while longer-term reforms are
being introduced. The proposed project will enable SMIs to start preparing
themselves to cope better with the changes to be produced by trade liberalization.
4.        Project Objectives.  The project will seek to encourage modernization
and increases in production and productivity of SMIs, enabling them to become more
competitive, as well as to foster employment and to help develop SMIs outside the
major urban areas. It will also establish a term-lending system, operating
through a permanent second-tier mechanism (the Development Fund for SMIs --
FOPYME) which has been set up within the National Development Bank (BANADE). It
will strenghten BANADE to enable it to act as a rediscount institution for SMI
lending by participating banks (PBs). The proposed project will also establish a
coordinated TA program for SKIs.
5.        Project Description.  (a) Financial assistance comDonent: the project
will provide credit for: fixed asset requirements and related and free-standing
working capital (FSWC) needs of SMIs; and TA to SMIs and related trading
companies; and (b) TA comnonent: the project will help to establish a focussed TA
program for SKIs, including support for institutional strengthening to
organizations providing credit and TA to SMIs. The total project cost is



-2-
estimated at US$250 million equivalent. A Bank loan of US$125 million equivalent,
would cover 95.5% of the estimated foreign exchange cost of the project. No more
than 25% of loan resources will be disbursed for FSWC. Counterpart resources to
the proposed loan will be provided by SMIs (approximately 25% of project cost,
including payments for TA services), and by FOPYME/BANADE (basically with BCRA's
resources), PBs, the National Institute of Industrial Technology (INTI), and the
Government (the other 25%). Small and medium-scale industries are defined as
those firms with fixed assets, excluding land and buildings, not exceeding
US$350,00 and US$3 million equivalent, respectively.
6.        Onlending arrangements. The Government, as the proposed borrower, will
transfer to BCRA, under the same terms as those of the Bank loan, US$124.2 million
equivalent of loan resources. BCRA will relend those resources to BANADE in
"Australes" adjusted by the combined (wholesale and consumer) price index,
applying an initial real interest rate of 5.5% per annum (weighted average --to be
reviewed every six months in consultation with the Bank -- para. 9) and the same
maturities of the Bank loan. As proposed by BCRA/BANADE, the former will assume
the foreign exchange risk. The Government would transfer US$0.4 million of loan
resources to the Subsecretariat for Small and Medium-Scale Enterprises (SSHE) for
the Regional Technical Assistance Centers (RTACs) and, on a grant basis, US$0.4
million to INTI, in both cases for the TA program to SMIs.
7.        National Development Bank (BANADE). BANADE's overall institutional
situation, including its management and financial performance, started to improve
since the new Government took office in 1983. Previously, BANADE was primarily a
channel for government subsidies to state-owned enterprises. Although at present,
BANADE relies mainly on BCRA's resources, it will have to reduce this dependence
as BCRA relaxes reserve requirements in a more market-oriented banking system.
Currently, the quality of BANADE's portfolio (most of it inherited from former
Governments) is acceptable. Improving the quality of the portion associated with
the largest enterprises (most of it guaranteed by the Government) is the major,
long-term task that the institution faces.
8.        In 1984, BANADE started a lending program to SMIs, and in 1986, it began
to operate also as an SMI second-tier institution. This function will be
strengthened by the proposed project through the establishment of FOPYHE. To
improve BANADE's standing as a first-tier lender and to help ensure smooth project
implementation, BANADE has established a unit exclusively to analyze and supervise
(as a direct lender) SMI subprojects. BANADE will also carry out several
activities to strengthen further its institutional and financial status as
specified in paragraph 11 below. In addition, it would analyze the feasibility of
shortening the interest billing period to improve its cash flow and would complete
a portfolio recovery plan focusing on its 50 largest borrowers. Both aspects
would be presented to the Bank prior to June 30, 1987. The above mentioned plan
would also support preparatory work for a possible industrial restructuring
project in Argentina. BANADE's debt/equity ratios will be brought within new
limits agreed with the Bank for 1987 and onwards of 8:1, 12:1 and 20:1 on
consolidated long-term unsecured debt, consolidated unsecured debt and
consolidated long-term debt to consolidated capital and surplus, respectively.
These ratios should encourage further capitalization and facilitate stable growth
of the institution. A Bank follow-up loan to BANADE would include a timetable for
phasing out its first-tier operations with SMIs.
9.        Interest rates to SMITs. The project will offer to SMIs credit in local
currency, adjusted by the combined price index, with initial interest rates of 8%



-3-
real per annum to finance fixed assets, and TA; and 12% for working capital.
Currently, these rates are higlher than average deposit rates. Taking into account
the experience with foreign exchange rates during the 1g80s, SMIs will be loath to
take foreign-exchange denominated obligations. However, since local currency
subloans will be adjusted according to the inflation rate and subborrowers will be
charged real interest rates, SKIs, in practice, would be covering the direct
foreign exchange risk, to the extent that BCRA exchange rate policy reflects
inflationary conditions. During the last 12 months, short-term lending rates have
been very high, about 3% on average per month, mainly as a result of high reserve
requirements and distorted market deposit rates, which made it impossible to tie
subproject lending rates to any representative domestic "market" rate. The
Government has, however, established some limited term- credit facilities, e.g.,
through BANADE, for industrial financing, with rates of 8% and 12% p.a. upon
Lndexed "australes" -denominated subloans. The proposed rates will be in line with
this approach. Financial intermediaries (which will bear the credit risk) will
have a spread of 3.75 percentage points. BANADE/BCRA would present to the Bank,
at least every six months a review of onlending rates and spreads.to ensure that
they remain adequate and that rates to enterprises are not lower than deposit
rates (provided that these rates are conducive to resource mobilization and do not
represent significant distortions). They would also carry out, in consultation
with the Bank, a mid-term review to determine the need and possibility of
adjusting the basis of lending (i.e., subloan currency, type of adjustment to
principal, subloan repayment system).
10.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Bank strategy for industrial sector
development in Argentina during FY87-89 will support required long-term policy
reform and the prompt revitalization of the economy. The Bank's agenda focuses
upon: (a) a Trade Policy and Export Diversification Loan, which has already been
appraised and for which Board presentation has been scheduled for the fourth
quarter of FY87, and an Export Promotion Project to increase the level of
international competitiveness of Argentine industry and exports; (b) Industrial
Sector Work to assess the impact of industrial policy and industrial promotion
regimes on the organization of industrial markets, the conduct of firms and their
economic performance, aimed at helping to revise, design and implement required
industrial policy measures; and (c) lines of credit for Industrial Restructuring
and SMI Development. It also includes support for Financial Sector Reform to
improve the ability of the financial system to serve the industrial and other
sectors. In addition, the Bank has advised the Government on the policy framework
for privatization and restructuring of major parastatal industries. The Bank is
also providing support to strengthen public sector administration through the
Public Sector Management Project (Loan 2712-AR), which is progressing
satisfactorily, and to increase efficiency of mainly medium-sized to large
industries through the Second Industrial Ciedit Project (Loan 2063-AR), which is
now expected to be committed by mid-year 1987. Bank involvement in the proposed
project would support the Government's efforts to provide scarce long-term
resources and TA for the needs of a sector that for many years has been neglected,
but that is vital to the recovery of the economy and to help achieve the expected
results of trade reform and export expansion. The proposed project will also
promote the strengthening of the private sector and make available to the
Government Bank experience in other LAC countries. Currently, no other
international institution is specifically involved in the development of SMIs in
Argentina.
11.       Agreed Actions: The Government agreed to cause SSME and INTI to carry
out their part of the project. BANADE will enter into agreements with PBs, on



-4-
terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank, for onlending project funds to SMIs,
and agreed to maintain its debt/equity ratios within the limits specified in
paragraph 8. Approval by BANADE's Board of Directors of FOPYME's Statement of
Policy and Operating Regulations, and approval by FOPYME of subproject appraisal
and supervision guidelines; presentation to the Bank of four or more signed
participation agreements between BANADE and PBs, covering at least 25% of the
proposed loan amount: submission by BANADE of satisfactory proposals on provisions
for bad debts, resource mobilization and improving the spreads on its foreign
currency operations; and signing of an agreement for transferring the loan
proceeds from the Government to BANADE through BCRA would be conditions of
effectiveness. Confirmation by INTI that its Board of Directors has approved its
TA program to SMIs would be a condition of disbursement for the INTI TA program.
12.       Justification and Risks.  The proposed project, in addition to assisting
in the recovery of the economy and complementing efforts with other
Government/Bank operations, is expected to provide financing for some 1400
subprojects, many of which are for modernization, replacement of equipment and
increase of p:oductivity, generating and helping to maintain about 12,500 jobs.
Both the expected employment impact and investments by small-scale enterprises
will contribute to poverty alleviation. The project will constitute a pioneering
effort in Argentina to set up a spec4alized SMI second-tier subloan delivery
system in coordination with TA. The project would also have substantial
institution-building impact upon public and private credit and TA organizations,
and would support training for about 250 professionals from such institutions.
Because most of the institutional arrangements will be new, possible risks include
slower than expected pace of PB's participation and some initial operational
soft-spots regarding the second-tier mechanism and the TA program to SMIs. To
minimize these risks, the project provides for contractual arrangements with a
sufficient number of financial intermediaries prior to effectiveness. TA and
project-related training would be provided to participating organizations to help
them carry out their responsibilities. To avoid excessive complexity In the TA
component, the project will concentrate upon five RTACs. High frequency of Bank
supervision missions during the initial stages of project implementation should
contribute to reduce the risks.
13.       Recommendations.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
