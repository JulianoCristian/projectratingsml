Technical Assistance Credit (SATAC) was satisfactory. The\n            Government was committed to a detailed program of\n            interventions, and accomplished most of the projects'\n            objectives. The Bank responded with a relevant technical\n            assistance to Armenia's needs and built management\n            capacity, enabling key reforms, for the transition to a\n            private sector based economy. The key lessons suggest that\n            countries undergoing transition, require broad technical\n            assistance, targeting prioritized areas of intervention,\n            preferably, through various operations so as to attain\n            sustainability. Technical assistance (TA) efficiency was\n            achieved, namely due to the country's policy reform\n            commitment, and the Government's selectivity and\n            ownership of TA. Although the inclusion of a tight timetable\n            carries the disadvantage of possible implementation delays,\n            with the further need for project extensions, it may\n            however, be helpful in providing the right focus for needed\n            reforms, precisely upon economic adversity, when mostly\n            needed. The flexibility on project components during\n            implementation, maximized the loan effectiveness, and\n            contributed to positive impacts under changing\n            circumstances, such as the funds reallocation for the Public\n            Sector Reform and commercial bank work-outs."}, "docdt": "1999-06-16T00:00:00Z"}
