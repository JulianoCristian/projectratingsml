resumption of growth and an\n            improvement in living standards. This will be achieved\n            through financing technical assistance necessary for the\n            implementation of the Government's reform program. The\n            project includes technical assistance in support of\n            privatization and post-privatization, strengthening of the\n            financial sector, civil service reform, and resource mobilization."}, "docdt": "1996-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
