This entails an\n            environmental screening, impact assessment, and mitigation\n            measures where necessary. Those subprojects under category\n            I, low risk with no environmental impacts, are largely\n            manufacturing of wood products, stone crafting, small scale\n            metal products, software development, and art and design.\n            Category II subprojects, requiring a pre- environmental\n            impact assessment (EIA), should be those subprojects related\n            with processing intermediate products, and production and\n            storage of chemicals, petroleum, petrochemicals, as well as\n            food and spirit industries, in addition to slaughterhouses,\n            production of animal or vegetable oils, of milk products, or\n            fresh water and marine products, among others. Subprojects\n            under Category III will require a full EIA, and are such\n            subprojects as refineries, gasification and liquefaction\n            facilities, petrochemical complex, tire producing factories,\n            or plant producing agricultural herbicides, or\n            pharmaceutical products, but mostly those factories where\n            flammable, and explosive compounds are produced. Finally,\n            Category IV entails a list of subprojects considered\n            ineligible for financing under the project, such as trade in\n            wildlife, or wildlife products, release of genetically\n            altered organisms into the natural environment, banned\n            pesticides and herbicides, radioactive products, hazardous\n            waste storage, treatment and disposal, including\n            manufacturing of asbestos-containing products, nuclear\n            reactors, and tobacco manufacturing."}, "docdt": "2003-10-01T16:47:04Z"}
