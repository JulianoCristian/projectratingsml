Proiect development obiective

    (i) Provisionofmediumandlong-termworkingcapitalandinvestmentfinancetoprivate
               exporters, and contribute to further facilitating export growth inTurkey; and
    (ii) Improvement in the quality, and safety of, and access to, finance through
               development o f financial intermediation in the Turkish private financial sector by
               banks and leasingcompanies.

Proiect description

The project will provide a credit line, backed by the Bank loan o f 16 years o f maturity, including
a 6-year grace period, and guaranteed by the Turkish government on behalf o f the Republic o f
Turkey, to TSKB, a private Turkish investment and development bank, for further on-lending to
eligible financial intermediaries - banks and leasing companies. The financial intermediaries will
further on-lendthe credit line finds to eligible exporters.

Which safeguard policies are triggered, if any?

         None. [Environmental issues for sub-borrowers, if any, will be addressed through the
sub-loan environmental eligibility criteriaprocess on a case by case basis]

Significant, non-standard conditions, if any, for:

         Boardpresentation:

                        At least two PFIs have been selected and have submitted an expression of
         interest inwriting for participation inEFIL 11.

                        The Operations Manual, including the environment guidelines for the sub-loans
         and leases, has been adopted.

         Loadcredit effectiveness:

                        At least 2 PFIs have undergone the qualification procedure and have signed
          subsidiary loan agreements.

          Covenants applicable to proiect implementation: None




* While iti s expected that both PFIs and sub-borrowersthemselveswill contributeto the financing of individual sub-projects, the
precise amount of such financing to be provided cannot be determined ex ante, as the loan design does not envisage the use of
predeterminedcofinancingrequirements. Instead,maximum exposureto individual sub-borrower limits for PFIs and debt equity
anddebt servicecoverage ratio requirementsfor sub-borrowers will drive the amountof cofinancingto be provided.

1.     Recent Macroeconomic Developments and their Impact on the Turkish Export
Sector. A combination o f natural disasters and macroeconomic volatility in Turkey during the
1999-2002 period created an unfavorable and uncertain environment for exporting companies.
In 1999,the massive destruction resulting from earthquakes impeded domestic production and
led to a contraction in domestic demand. In2000, the Government's IMF-backed stabilization
program initially led to an expansion in imports and a contraction in exports (Figure 1). The
current account worsened quickly, in part due to the anchoring o f the exchange rate which
eroded Turkey's competitiveness (Figure 2), but also as a result o f an increase in oil prices and
US$/Euroexchange rate developments which favored importers.

2.      The worsening fiscal and current account performance generated pressures on the fixed
exchange rate system, and incombination with longstandingunderlying structural banking sector
problems triggeredbanking crises inNovember 2000 and February 2001. InFebruary 2001, the
fixed exchange rate regime collapsed. The Turkish Lira was allowed to float and depreciated
sharply, improving the competitiveness o f Turkish exports (Figure 2). Many banks and local
businesses were caught up in foreign exchange short positions and suffered significant losses.
The magnitude and frequency o f exchange rate fluctuations in the period immediately following
the start o f the floating exchange rate regime added to business uncertainty. Besides Forex
mismatches, maturity mismatches between assets and liabilities o f many banks added to the
banking sector's distress. Non-performing loans increased, and it became increasingly difficult

                                                3

for many firms to finance their operations. Domestic demand dried up and the economy shrank
significantly during 2001.

3.      For a large number o f companies, especially for those with limitedexport sales, 2001 was
a period where they had to overcome difficulties in meeting working capital financing
requirements and generating sufficient funds to maintainprofitability and a sustainable financial
structure in a shrinking economy, and uncertain macroeconomic and political environment.
However, the depreciation o f the currency in 2001 did create incentives for exporting activities,
and some businesses could benefit from the price advantage. Firms, which could continue to
produce, and which faced a rather price-elastic international demand, increased their export
performance substantially, as some o fthe EFILbeneficiaries were able to.

4.      Inearly 2002, economic recovery started and continued throughout that year and during
the first half o f 2003. GNP growth reached 7.8 percent in 2002, due among other factors to the
strong growth in exports and tourism revenues following the 2001 exchange rate adjustment.
Export growth continued steadily throughout 2002-03, despite a subsequent appreciation o f the
real effective exchange rate reflecting increased confidence in the TL, due to a sharp fall inreal
private sector wages after the crisis.

5.      However, even though economic performance, mostly led by the export revival,
continued to improve during the latter half o f 2002 and the first half o f 2003, the pick up in
market sentiment has not ledto any significant increase inthe overall level o f bank credits to the
productive sectors (Figure 3). Although the banking sector was significantly restructured and
strengthenedinthe aftermath o f the crises, banks are still risk averse, and with real interest rates
continuing to hover inthe 20% range, the high level o f government debt continues to crowd out
private sector financing needs. While short term foreign currency bank financing is available to
the best exporters at affordable US$-based interest rates, medium and long-term working capital

                                                4

and investment finance is still very scarceinTurkey. Lease finance -which often is an important
source o f longer-term investment finance for exporters in other countries - also has remained
underdeveloped in Turkey, with the growth in lease receivables highly volatile and dependent
on macroeconomic performance. Both the banking and leasing sectors lack access to medium
and long term funds, which provides the principal rationale for the Bank's involvement and the
EFILI1(see Annex 1for a more detailed discussion).

6.      Following the recent financial crises and a subsequent downturn in the enterprise sector,
the Government o f Turkey has demonstrated its commitment to policies and strategies intended
to revitalize Turkey's real sector, and export-oriented industries in particular. The Government
is also continuing its efforts to implement banking sector reforms in cooperation with the
banking community, while trying to clearly convey the message that recovery from this deep
crisis will be a long term process highly dependent on real sector recovery and growth. This,
therefore, is one o fthe principle objectives o fthe Government for 2003 and beyond.

7.      The proposed project is consistent with the new FY04-06 CAS for the Republic o f
Turkey (CAS number R2003-0181, discussed by the Bank's Executive Board on November 6,
2003). As stated in the new CAS, an important part of the process o f recovery from the crises
will be revitalizing the real sector, which is currently suffering from a credit crunch as a result o f
the banks' increased awareness o f credit risks and tightened loan loss provisioning requirements
inthe wake oftheir re-capitalization, as well as a sharp post-crises decline in syndicated lending
by international banks to Turkish banks, reducing their foreign currency lending capacity. The
                                                      5

CAS'Skey priorities for the medium term include completing the banking and financial sector
reforms and revitalizing the real sector by filling the current gap in accessing credit facilities,
which will be also supported by this proposed project.

8.      The current credit squeeze is affecting both (i) demand side, where even the most
                                                          the
creditworthy private sector borrowers find it hard to tap international capital markets and are
reverting back to domestic credit markets, with the Government simultaneously experiencing
similar difficulties in rolling over its existing foreign currency debt, and (ii)the supply side,
where the domestic banking system i s reducing both the volume and maturity o f its real sector
lending in response to the reduced volume and maturity o f its own funding. Under these
circumstances, the Turkish authorities have requested the Bank for an export credit line, which
would be provided through the financial system and would support private sector exporters. The
project team supports this request and believes a financial intermediary loan for exporters i s a
product o f choice in the current circumstances (primarily a very thin supply o f longer-term
funds) facing Turkish financial intermediaries and private enterprises - large, medium, and small
alike. The success o f the predecessor EFIL project provides a good basis for such positive
consideration.

9.      The proposed EFIL I1project will substantially maintain the design o f its predecessor
EFILproject. Evenbefore its formal closure, the first EFILhas provedto be a successful project,
as it provided a timely and focused response to the unmet demand from banks and exporting
companies for medium- and long-term funding, both during the pre- and post-crisis periods. The
EFIL credit line was almost fully disbursed by the closing date o f end-August 2003. With
interest rate levels on Turkish Lira loans remaining prohibitively high, and loan maturities very
short, demand for affordable longer-term funds from the real and financial sectors in Turkey
remains strong. The Government's request for a successor EFIL I1credit line for exporters i s
thus welljustified and timely. The project will support the current upward momentum inexport
performance and, by extension, ingeneral economic improvement.

               c. HIGHER     LEVEL  OBJECTIVES TO WHICH THE PROJECTCONTRIBUTES

10.     One o fthe mainbenefits o fthe proposed project will be faster private sector recovery and
job creation, supported by a healthier and more developed financial system.            In general,
enterprise and financial sector performance i s expected to continue to improve in the short and
medium term. Inthe longer run, export growth supported by the proposed operation i s expected
to have an overall positive impact on poverty alleviation andprivate sector growth inTurkey.

                           11. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

                                       A. LENDING     INSTRUMENT

11.     The lendinginstrument proposed for this project is the Bank's Fixed Spread Loan (FSL)
with a 16 year maturity, including a 6 year grace period. The instrument is fixed spread as
compared to variable spread in the first EFIL, and is planned as a loan with a longer maturity
both for the Bank loan to the Borrower (TSKB), and for the subsidiary loans from the Borrower
to participating financial intermediaries. The longer maturity o f the credit line i s justified by the
fact that, with a revival o f demand, lower inflation and GDP growth picking up, the operational
and investment planning horizon o f private exporters is lengthening, and banks and other
financial intermediaries are willing to provide increasingly longer term foreign currency finds
(of which there is a clear shortage inthe market) to their well-performing clients.

                    B. PROJECTDEVELOPMENT          OBJECTIVE AND KEY INDICATORS


12.     Traditionally, credit to the real sector has been crowded out over the years by the large
and expanding demand for government borrowing. Even more so at this time, all firms, except
blue chip firms or dedicated exporters, are facing a credit crunch. This is due to the after-effects
o f the banking crisis in 2001, which resulted in the banks exercising increased caution in their
lending operations after their re-capitalization in 2002, and the simultaneous decline in
international syndicated lending to Turkish banks. The proposed project's main objective is to
follow through on the achievement o f the predecessor EFIL project and continue to serve as a
catalyst to support export and real sector growth in Turkey during the EFIL I1implementation
period (2004-2009), and beyond using the EFIL I1reflows. To this end, the project will provide
medium and long-term working capital and investment finance to Turkish private exporting
enterprises, at the time when the economy is showing strong signs o f rebounding from a recent
slump and export performance is on the rise-thus      increasing the demand for longer term credit,
while the financial sector is still unable to support these trends with very much needed longer
term finds at a reasonable cost.

13.     The secondary objective o f the loan is further improvement inthe ability o f the Turkish
financial sector to provide financial resources to the enterprise sector, through further
development o f intermediation by private financial institutions, including banks and leasing
companies. The project, through inclusion o f leasing companies inaddition to banks as PFIs, will
enable the Bank to start a dialogue with the leasing sector in Turkey, provide an opportunity to
gain more insight into the sector, and enable the Bank to support its development. It needs to be
noted that the inclusion o f leasing companies as financial intermediaries is an innovative aspect
o f the project, not previously used in World Bank credit line operations in the ECA Region. As
such, it contains a degree o f uncertainty in terms o f the ability o f the Turkish leasing sector to
successfully absorb the funds available for intermediation, and channel them to eligible
exporters. The Bank team has undertaken an initial assessment o f the leasing sector, including
determination o f the sector's size, main players, its legislative and regulatory foundation, and its
operational aspects (accounting, client base, average volumes, cost o f funds, etc.). Based on
these initial findings, the team believes that selected leasing companies can become solid project
counterparts with a strong operational experience and ability to successfully intermediate the
EFIL I1funds, mostly to smaller exporting companies typically not serviced by the banking
system.




                                                  7

14.     The first EFILproject financed mostly mediumand large exporters, with the average sub-
loan being close to US$2.5 million. The project team believes that by including leasing
companies as a new class o f financial intermediaries in the project, more small and medium-
sized exporters will be reached than if intermediation was done through the banks only. In fact,
the initial assessment o f the leasing industry revealed that the average size o f a financial lease
contract in Turkey i s around US$80,000. The expectation under the EFIL I1project is that the
selected leasing companies would be able to reach a significant amount o f smaller exporters, i.e.,
those with annual revenues typically not exceeding US$3 million, and provide financial sub-
leases inthe US$250,00O-1,000,000        range for acquisition o f productive assets (equipment and
machinery for manufacturing and/or service companies).

                                        C. PROJECTCOMPONENTS

15.     The proposed EFIL I1project will substantially maintain the design o f its predecessor
EFIL project that has been successfully implemented during FY99-04. The credit line will be
provided to TSKB, with a government guarantee, while TSKB will pass it on in the form o f
subsidiary finance to participating financial intermediaries for further on-lending to eligible
private exporters. The principal design changes inEFILI1will be as follows:

    -   TSKB, a privately owned Turkish investment and development bank, will replace Turk
        EXIMBank as the borrower and implementing agency. Turk EXIM has indicated that it
        currently i s strategically focused on activities related to overseas project finance and that
        TSKB therefore i s better suited at this time as the Borrower o f the Bank loan and for
        wholesaling it to financial intermediaries;
    -   Leasing companies, in addition to banks, will be allowed to become financial
        intermediaries under the project. This will support development o f the leasing industry
        and will allow World Bank funds to reach non-bank customers, primarily smaller
        exporting companies; and
    -   The loan finds will be provided to the Borrower on FSL terms with 16 year maturity
        (including a 6 year grace period). This would extend the maturity available to the
        financial intermediaries and borrowing companies and appropriately respond to the
        increasing stability o f the Turkish economy and lengthening o f the investment planning
        horizons inthe enterprise sector.

16.     The EFILI1will have a single component a credit line for exporters, and will provide the
mediumand long-tenn funds to exporters through two distinct channels, or sub-components: (i)
US$200 million through commercial banks inthe form of investment or working capital loans,
and (ii)US$lOO million through leasing companies inthe form o f lease finance for acquisition o f
productive assets (vehicles, machinery and/or equipment). No co-financing arrangements with
other international agencies are envisaged.

                  D. LESSONS      LEARNED REFLECTEDINTHEPROJECTDESIGN
                                            AND


17.     The main lesson learned duringthe last few years from Bank credit line operations inthe
ECA Region and elsewhere is that the project design should be kept as flexible as possible, with
a minimumnumber of, or no statutory requirements;e.g. avoiding constraints like minimumsub-
loan size, maturity, currency denomination, sub-borrower co-financing requirements, sectoral
lending focus, etc., but using sensible financial indicators for the selection o f both the PFIs and
the sub-borrowershb-projects inline with established marketpractices. Restrictive procurement
requirementsunsuitable for private sector borrowers, and the World Bank's previous currency
pool loan features have also proven to be a hindrance to expeditious project implementation, and
                                                   8

wherever commercial practices and SCLs were used, these factors ceased to be a bottleneck.
Another important lesson learned has been that the most successful formula for highquality and
expeditious project implementation i s to combine the Borrower and Implementing Agency
b c t i o n s in one and the same entity ifpossible. Finally, pre-committing financial intermediaries
to borrowing a certain part o f a credit line (which involves paying a commitment fee on the pre-
committed amount) provides a strong incentive to the intermediaries to be quick and effective in
finding and financing eligible sub-projects, and leads to quicker disbursement o fthe Bank loan.

18.       Lessons Learned from Previous Credit Line Operations in Turkey: The Implementation
Completion Reports (ICRs) for the previous World Bank credit line operations in Turkey
indicate that some o f these operations had to be restructured in mid-stream because the initial
project design tumed out to be too inflexible (e.g., too many requirements in terms o f minimum
sub-loan size, sub-loan maturity, sub-borrower cofinancing requirements, etc.). The ICRs
indicate that, after restructuring, project implementation generally proceeded well.

19.       The proposedproject design incorporates all o f these lessons learned, by usingTSKB as
the borrower and implementing agency for the loan, by the use o f a clear, market-based set o f
eligibility criteria for PFIs, sub-borrowers and sub-projects, by the use o f flexible loan terms and .
suitable private sector procurement practices, and also by use o f formal expressions of interest
from a minimum number o f the PFIs prior to Board Presentation to a specific portion o f the
credit line.

                      E. ALTERNATIVESCONSIDEREDANDREASONSFORREJECTION

20.       A search for alternative approaches to the project was not necessary inthis case, as the
EFIL I1is being undertaken as a repeater project, building on the success and structure o f the
first EFIL project. During the preparation o f the first EFIL, however, alternative borrower and
implementation arrangements (including using the Undersecretariat o f Treasury as the Borrower)
had already been considered and rejected as less suitable than using Turk EXIM Bank as the
Borrower and Implementing Agency for the project to ensure efficient project implementation.

21.       There are, however, some minor design changes inthe case o fEFILI1as compared to the
first EFIL. The borrower will be TSKB (Turkish Industrial Development Bank) rather than Turk
EXIMBank. This was the preferred alternative to usingTurk EXIMBank inEFIL I1because o f
EXIM's other operating preoccupations with country-to-country programs. Apart from a few
operational changes (terms o f the loan, different borrowerhmplementing agency, and inclusion
o f leasing companies as financial intermediaries) a similar set o f development objectives and
implementation arrangements will be maintained. Given the absence o f any material changes
from the first EFIL, EFIL I1qualifies as a repeater project, which will continue to serve the need
o f exporters and PFIs for mediumand long-term investment and working capital funds.

                                A. PARTNERSHIPARRANGEMENTS

22.     As part ofbothproject preparation and implementation, the Bank team has built, and will
continue to cultivate,      close relationships with both national and regional exporters'
organizations, the Turkish Bankers' Association, and the Turkish Association o f Leasing
Companies, with a view to opening and maintaining a dialogue with the project beneficiaries,
and to identify, where relevant, policy issues and constraints to further development o f exports as
well as o f the leasing industry. Inthe case o f exporters associations, this dialogue will build on
the relationships already developed in the context o f the first EFIL project. Relevant policy
issues will feed into the Bank's overall sectoral dialogue with the Turkish authorities.

                 B. INSTITUTIONALANDIMPLEMENTATIONARRANGEMENTS

23.     TSKB, a non-deposit taking private investment & development bank owned by local
conimercial banks and business groups, will be the borrower and the implementation agency for
the project. A separate project implementation unit (PIU) has been established by TSKB under
the supervision o f one o f its executive vice presidents to oversee the implementation of EFIL11.
The PIU i s staffed with experienced management and staff, and, as the primary project
counterpart for the Bank team, will provide the overall administration o f all aspects o f the credit
line and requiredreportingto the Bank.

                 c. MONITORINGEVALUATION OUTCOMES/RESULTS
                                    AND                 OF

24.     Inpursuingits major developmental objectives, the project will target an increase inthe
access to finance to exporters as measured through an increase in the amount o f aggregate
exports o f the financed exporting enterprises, and number o f exporting enterprises benefiting
from such improved access. An increase in the development o f financial intermediation in
Turkey i s an important second development objective, as measured through (i) increase in
                                                                                    the
the breadth and depth o f participating financial intermediaries, and (ii)      improvement o f the
quality o f credit portfolio management. Increase in the volume o f transactions o f the
participating leasing companies will also be an important target, as it would signal a growing
strength o f financial intermediation through leasing which has the potential to reach small
exporting enterprises at times overlooked by largerbanks.

25.     Progress inachieving the development objectives will be measured on the basis of:

            -   Increase in access to finance for exporters measured by the number o f enterprises
                andvolume of exports supported;
            -   Improved depth and breadth o f financial intermediation as measured by the
                number o f additional PFIs (banks and leasing companies) that participate inEFIL
                I1different from those inthe first EFIL; and
            -   Improvement o f quality o f credit portfolio management by measuring the level o f
                debt service and amortization performance o f sub-loans under EFIL I1 o f the
                participating banks and leasing firms.

26.     Progress will be monitored through regular reporting by the Borrower/Implementing
Agency, and through statutory project supervision missions. It i s envisaged that reporting under
the EFIL I1 will be done through quarterly progress reports, with the reports specifically

                                                  10

distinguishing project transactions o f the two classes o f financial intermediaries - commercial
banks and leasing companies. The Operations Manual describes the details o f the Project
reporting.

                                        D. SUSTAINABILITY

27.       Turkey's past export growth record, as well as the World Bank's own past experience
with credit line operations in Turkey, the first EFIL being the most recent one, indicate that the
private enterprise sector has the technical and managerial ability to successfully tap export
opportunities, provided they have access to appropriate financing (e.g., in terms o f pricing and
maturity). Thus, expansion o f existing and new export operations that will be financed by the
fundingto be provided bythe proposed EFILI1have a very highlikelihood of self-sustainability.

28.       Additionally, continued use by participating banks of high-quality loan and sub-
borrower analysis requirements under EFIL 11, as well as the development o f the leasing industry
as an important source o f longer-term investmentfinance for smaller exporters, will contribute to
strengthening the overall intermediation capacity o f the financial system, which i s likely to
sustain beyond the closing date o fEFIL.

29.       Finally, by using TSKB - an established investment & development bank - as the
Borrower and Implementing Agency for the project, TSKB's wholesale lendingfunction, already
well established today, is likely to become more sophisticated, and therefore more effective in

                                   However substantial macro economic and structural reform
                                   risks remain that can derail the economic stability and the

                              primary fiscal surpluses can not be ruled out, and they increase
                              the risk o fworsening inflation and government debt scenarios.

                              An additional risk is causedby the delay inthe privatization o f
                              the three state owned banks. Inherent liquidity pressures in the
                              state-owned banks have the potential to create monetary policy

                              pursued to mitigate these risks.

                              Similarly there are significant political risks derived from the
                              Iraq situation and any potential perception o f lack o f progress
                              inthe EUdialogue with Turkey. Bothofthese containinherent

33.      TSKB has worked with the World Bank before and i s very familiar with the Bank's
fiduciary requirements related to procurement, disbursements, and applicable safeguards (see
Environment in D.5). The Bank team has full confidence in TSKB's ability to diligently follow
these requirements.

34.      During the last few years, the Turkish authorities have demonstrated a strong
commitment to strengtheningthe financial system by establishing an independent, professional,
and highly capable banking supervision institution (BDDK). This commitment and related
efforts were encouraged and supported by the Bank through its policy advice and adjustment
loans. As a result, the BDDK has established itself as a solid independent regulator, capable o f
issuingand enforcingprudential regulations for the bankingsector. There is therefore, unlike the
first EFIL, no need for detailed prudential guidelines and eligibility criteria for EFIL 11; instead
these will be replaced by a single certification by a bank's external auditors that a bank i s in
general compliance with the Turkish prudential standards for bankingoperations, as established
and promulgated by the BDDK.' Therefore, monitoring o f participating bank eligibility will be
simplified and done through: (a) a prudential regulation compliance certificate; and (b) annual
audit reports.

35.      Leasing companies have not been financial intermediaries in World Bank projects in
Turkey inthe past, therefore rendering them an entirelynew financial intermediary class with a
separate set o f eligibility requirements. The following are proposed eligibility indicators to be
further specified duringappraisal, drawing largely on the requirements for the leasingcompanies
specified in the 1996 Financial Leasing Law No. 3226 and the Regulation Concerning the
Foundation and Activities o f Financial Leasing Companies:

              -     a lessor will be duly registered and licensed by the leasing regulator and
                    supervisor;
              - minimum equity capital o f a lessor will be no less than TL 1 trillion,
                    (approximately US$670,000 equivalent);
              - the total sum o f lease exposures will not exceed 30 times a lessor's equity capital,
                    while the total sum o f exposures to related parties will not exceed 15 times its
                    equity capital;
              -     a lessor will have been profitable for at least two out o f the last three years o f
                    operations; and


'In case o f the first EFIL ,duringproject implementation the requirement of these eligibility criteria were amended
to require compliance with the BDDKprudential guidelines duly certified by the extemal auditors of these banks.
Thus EFILI1criteria are consistent with the ongoing first EFILprudential criteria.

            -   the participating leasing company shall, at the time o f selection and for the
                duration o f its subsidiary loan agreement with TSKB, for each year-end beginning
                with year-end 2003, present an audit reportwhich:

                       Covers two full years o f operations;
                       I s prepared by an internationally recognized external audit firm in
                       accordance with International Auditing Standards and International
                       FinancialReporting Standards (IFRS); and
                      0Contains an unqualified audit opinion.

36.     Initial and ongoing compliance with the eligibility criteria for the leasing intermediaries
will be assessed based on reporting by TSKB to the Bank, including quarterly project
implementation reports prepared by TSKB and semi-annual external auditor compliance
certificates and annual external audit reports o fthe participating leasingcompanies.

38.     TSKB will be responsible for ensuring that sub-projects financed under the EFIL I1
undergo environmental screening to ensure their conformity with Turkish environmental
legislation and regulations and the World Bank's policies and procedures, as set forth in OPBP
4.01. The credit officers already appointed by TSKB to staff the PIU will perform this function.
The PIU Operations Manual detailing, inter alia, the World Bank's requirements in respect o f
environmentalassessment, will be preparedprior to loannegotiations.

39.     The PFIs, according to the procedures outlined inthe Operations Manual, will undertake
the environmental screening o f the sub-loan applications to determine the appropriate
environmental risk category for the sub-borrowedsub-projects. The sub-borrowers will be
responsible for carrying out any environmental analysis and for confirming that the proposed
sub-projects comply with national environmental guidelines, and for obtaining the necessary
clearance from the appropriate licensing authorities. Requirements in respect o f environmental
analysis will also be written into the sub-loan agreements.

A.1     Countrv and Sector Issues

1.      Macroeconomicindicatorshave been improving.Following the 2000-2001 enterprise
and financial sector crises and subsequent economic slump, the Turkish economy has registered
a marked improvement in its performance. By the end o f 2002, interest rates on Government
securities had fallen to the 55 percent range, compared with peaks duringthe post-crisis period o f
well over 100 percent. The economic recovery has been stronger than expected, with GDP
growth for 2002 o f 7.8 percent, well above the initial target o f 3 percent. Inparallel, inflation has
fallen substantially. End-2002 CPI inflation was just under 30 percent, below the 35 percent
target. The floating exchange rate regime has been successfully maintained, and an important
degree o f exchange rate stability achieved. The current account registered a small deficit o f 0.8
percent. The positive macroeconomic outcomes have improved the public debt dynamics, with
the stock o f net public debt falling by almost 14 percent of GNP in2002, to 80 percent of GNP.
Fiscal policy, however, was weaker than expected, with the primary surplus o f the consolidated
public sector reaching only 4.1 percent of GNP at end-2002, falling short of the 6.5 percent
target, largely due to increased spending and weaker than expected fiscal revenues. In 2003,
economic growth i s expected to reach 5%, in part due to the continued strong export
performance, while CPI inflation decelerates to about 20% by end year. Based on current trends,
the Government's target o f 6.5% primary surplus of the public sector i s likely to be achieved.

2.      Turkish exports have been a major contributor to macroeconomic performance.
Turkish exports (Table 1) have been an important economic success story in the recent years
growing at an average annual rate o f over 12 percent, from US$2.9 billion in 1980 to US$35.8
billion in 2002. The share o f exports in GNP increased in the same period from 4.2 percent to
nearly 20 percent. However, in the pre-crisis period exports were particularly hard hit by the
combinedimpact of: (i) slowdown in growth inTurkey's export markets from an average o f
                          the
8.9 percent in 1997 to 5.3 percent in 1998; (ii)    disruption in the previously rapidly growing
Russian and CIS markets; (iii)the sharp increase in domestic real interest rates which
undermined the competitiveness of Turkish export products in foreign markets; and (iv) the
severe credit and liquidity squeeze in Turkey due to non-availability o f reliable short and
medium term finance. Consequently, export growth dropped from 13.1 percent in 1997 to an
estimated 2.7 percent in 1998. The effect o fthe major earthquake in 1999 contributedto a further
1.4 percent decline inexports that year.

3.      However, starting in 2000, export growth got back on a positive track, reaching 4.5
percent despite the December financial market crisis, and then, ledby increased competitiveness
o f Turkish exports after the Lira devaluation in early 2001 and by increasing market confidence
in sustainability of the crisis resolution measures undertaken by the authorities, jumped to 12.8
percent in2001 and 14.1 percent in 2002. Post-crisis economic recovery has clearly been export-
led. Exports further grew over 30 percent in the first 6 months o f 2003, compared to the same
period in the previous year and have reached nearly $29.8 billion for the first half o f the year as
compared to $35.8 billion for the whole year in2002, thus demonstrating growth inboth volume
and absolute value o f exports (for more statistics on export growth, export loan availability, etc.
see Annex 9).

4.       In case of EFIL sub-borrowers, export performance data over the loan disbursement
period between 1999-2002 have been very positive. Export figures for the years 1999, 2000,
2001, and 2002 were, respectively, US$ 2, 2.8, 3.1, and 4 billion, much more than the projected
figures o f US$ 0.1, 1.2, 1.7 and 1.9 billion for the same period. This corresponded to annual
growth rates o f 40 percent, 11 percent, and 29 percent in the years 2000, 2001, and 2002,
respectively. The main reason for this better-than-expected performance was the fact that the
majority o f these companies were exporters with established markets. High export volume,
increased profit margins and a strong equity base allowed them to sustain and improve
profitable business activities, while maintaining a sound financial structure during both the pre-
and post-crisis periods. In a few cases o f unsatisfactory performance, the main culprits were:
(a) above-optimal financial leverage, (b) a relatively high percentage o f domestic sales within
total sales, which were negatively affected by contraction in domestic demand throughout the
economic crisis;(c) decreasing profit margins due to domestic competition, and/or decreasing
capacity utilization as a result o f problems faced inobtaining working capital financing.

5.       Overall, the financial performance o f the majority o f beneficiary EFIL enterprises during
the EFIL implementation period can be regarded as satisfactory. The EFIL facility, which was
small compared to the size o f the Turkish economy and export oriented enterprises, has
nevertheless been very successhl in helping exporting companies in a country suffering from a
severe crisis to continue and develop their export activities.

6.       Medium- and long-term finance to exporters is, however, still very scarce. The
banking sector has been restructured, but i s still dealing with the effects o f the crisis. In the
banking sector, the emphasis o f the Government's reform efforts during the 1990s was on the
development o f a basic legal and regulatory infrastructure to facilitate ease o f entry, and to
increase competition and growth. This triggered a rapid expansion o f banking system assets in
Turkey during the 1990s, and in spite o f the 1994-95 and 2000-01 banking crises, total system
assets in absolute terms rose 250 per cent from US$51.9 billion in 1994 to US$ 128.9 billion as
o f end 2002, and also increased substantially as a percentage o f GNP from 39.2 in 1994 to 71.67
in2002 signaling a deepening of financial intermediationcapacity. The rapidgrowth inthe size
o fthe banking sector, however, also had some negative consequences. Prudentialregulations and
enforcement capacity lagged behind, and there was a proliferation o f connected lending and
concentration o f exposure and default risks. Lenient loan loss provisioning rules and
enforcement allowed banks to understate their credit risks. Large FX open positions and
asset/liability mismatches also created foreign currency and interest rate/liquidity risks in
addition to credit risks. Additionally, growing public sector borrowing requirements during the
years 1994-2002 encouraged banks to shift resources into Government securities that were

                                                  18

generating a relatively high-risk free real return. As a result, banks' lending activity declined in
real terms.

7.      Starting in December 1999, the Government with the help o f the Bank initiated a
financial sector reform program to address the weaknesses. Despite successhl implementation
o f these reforms, however, in late November 2000, Turkey experienced a banking system
liquidity crisis, which was triggered by the need of a medium-size private bank (Demir) to
refinance an excessive stock o f Government securities. In early December, interest rates briefly
spiked to levels above 1,900 percent. InFebruary 2001, there was another, much more serious
crisis that was ignited by the public airing o f tensions between the President and Prime Minister.
This set off a new wave o f turbulence inthe financial sector as investors liquidated Turkish Lira
positions and fled to U S dollars inexpectation o f a full-fledged political crisis. Interest rates once
again spiked, this time as highas 6,200 percent, and with a rapid depletion o f the Central Bank
o f Turkey's (CBT's) foreign currency reserves apparent, the authorities were forced to float the
Lira leading to a sharp deterioration in its value. The combined effect of (i) rate losses;

sector distress resulting from the crises eroded the banking system's capital. Total banking
system assets also have shrunk from US$155.2 billion at the endofDecember 2000 to US$117.7
billion at the end 2001, a sharp reversal from the trend during 1994-2000, before recovering
somewhat to US$ 128.9 billion at end-2002. The symptoms o f the banking sector distress, as
well as its concomitant impact on the rest o fthe economy were still beingfelt inearly 2003.

8.      Leasing sector small and volatile*. Contrary to the predecessor EFILproject where only
banks were PFIs, leasing companies will be accepted as financial intermediaries in the EFIL I1
project. An opportunity will thus be created for the Bank to start a dialog with the leasing
industry  -  an important non-bank segment o f the financial market with financing options
particularly appealing to smaller companies.

9.      Inmid-2002, there were 107players inthe leasing market, ofwhich 11were non-deposit
taking investment & development banks, 5 special finance institutions, and 91 self-standing
leasing companies. O f the 91 leasing companies, 4 were state-owned, and 8 were owned by
foreigners. The industry i s rather small in size and highly concentrated. At end-2002, the total
assets o f the sector were just below US$2 billion, down from US$3.15 billion in 2000, o f which
the 10 largest companies held about 67 percent (the 10 largest also accounted for 78 percent o f
new leasing volume in 2002). Assets o f the top 10 group were in the range o f US$58-250
million. US$. The number o f new leasing transactions typically fluctuates with GDP growth.
Total equity in the sector was around US$400 million in 2002. The sector returned to
profitability inthe first three quarters o f 2002, with net profit of US$81 million, following a loss
o f US$ 6lmillion a year earlier. Leasing o f construction and textile machinery, tourism, office,
and telecom equipment, land transportation vehicles, and computers represented the lion's share
o fthe total new leasing volume duringthe last few years.

10.     The Turkish leasing sector is in an early stage o f development, with straightforward
financial leasing beingthe primary instrument offered. Infact, the existing 1996 Law on Leasing
pretty much discourages the other type - operational leasing -by setting a minimum lease term
o f 4 years. A new leasing law i s beingconsidered by the authorities, which should eliminate this
and other constraints, such as ambiguity regarding sale-and-leaseback, sub-leasing, and dispute
resolution, to allow faster development of leasinginTurkey.

11.     There are also some taxation issues applicable to leasing which warrant attention from
the authorities. The leasing companies when borrowing locally from domestic banks, are not
permitted to borrow directly in foreign currencies but only in Turkish Liras indexed to foreign
currency. Any downstream TL leasing intermediation thereby exposes the lessors to exchange
rate risk with the Resource Utilization Support FundPremium of 3 percent being charged on the
exchange differentials (on the principle and the accrued interest on lease payments). This acts as
a strong disincentive to leasing through local lines o f credit. The majority o f borrowings by
Turkish leasing companies, therefore, are in foreign currencies from foreign banks or foreign

branches o f Turkish banks overseas, in which case all the above restrictions and downstream
taxes do not apply and the intermediation playing field i s level with commercial banks.

12.      Both bankingand leasing sectors lack access to term funds...Access by the banking
system to medium and long-term funding sources has typically been limited during the past
several years due to unfavorable macro-economic circumstances, and became virtually non-
existent in the aftermath o f the 2000-01 crises. While market confidence has increased since,
there i s certainly no abundance yet o f mediumor long term money on the market. All o f the top
leasing companies are owned by banks, and suffer from the same hnding maturity limitations as
their parents. For instance, despite the legally prescribed minimum lease term o f 4 years, the
marketpractice is to frontload leasepayments into the first two years, and keeps the formal lease
contract idle for the remainder o f the term. Constant rollover of short term fundingby the banks
i s still the most popular way o f providing term finance to the enterprise sector     ..., which
provides the principal rationale for the Bank's involvement by providing medium and
long-term funds to exporters via the participating financial intermediaries under the
proposedEFIL 11.

1.      The proposed EFIL I1i s a repeater project o f the predecessor EFIL project. The EFIL
was implemented during 1999-2003 and was very successful indisbursing nearly the full amount
o f the Loan (US$ 252.5 million), reaching out to many different exporting industries all across
Turkey by financing close to 100 exporting sub-projects, and strengthening the financial sector
by having the project PFIs undergo a comprehensive risk management assessment and
implement resulting recommendations, evenbefore risk management became an integral part o f
the prudential requirementsfor the banks.

2.      Both the first EFIL and the proposed EFIL I1are part o f the Bank's multi-year financial
sector reform program for Turkey, which seeks to stabilize and support the further development
o f the Turkish financial system for the benefit o f the private sector and economic growth. This
program combines a series o f programmatic financial sector adjustment loans (some o f which
also encompass public sector reform measures) supporting top-down policy reform with
investmentloans like EFIL and EFIL 11, which facilitate bottom-up interaction with key players
inthe financial sector. The program is underpinnedby several pieces of Economic and Sector
Work, the most recent o f which (Report on Capital Markets and Non-Bank Financial
Institutions) has pointed out the importance o f diversifying and deepening the financial system
beyond banking. The inclusion o f leasing companies inthe proposed EFIL I1seeks to meet this
objective.

                                 Annex 4: Project Description

1.       The Second Export Finance Intermediation Loan (EFIL 11) consists o f a single
component - financing o f sub-loans and leases under the project in an aggregate amount o f
US$300,000,000. Details are givenbelow.

2.       Under the project, the EFIL I1will provide medium and long-term financing for the
procurement o f goods and works by private exporters. The inputs could be procured locally or
externally on commercially competitive terms and will, therefore, benefit both direct and indirect
exporters.

3.       Borrower and Implementing Anencv: The Borrower and ImplementingAgency for the
EFIL I1will be TSKB, a privately owned investment & development bank, with the Government
issuing a guarantee to the World Bank. It has been established by the World Bank team that
Turkishlaws allow the Government to issue guaranteesto private non-deposit taking investment
& development banks, although not to regular commercial banks. TSKB will act inthe capacity
o f a wholesale institution and will onlend the loan funds through a group o f 4-6 private banks
and 4-6 leasing companies which will be selected pursuant to criteria agreed between the
Borrower and the World Bank (see Annex 6). TSKB will take the credit risk on the banks and
leasing companies selected for participation. The participating financial intermediaries in turn
will make sub-loans and leases to private exporting enterprises for procurement o f goods and
works inorder to expand their current export volumes, or inexceptional circumstances to enable
them to retain and maintain their current level o f exports. The onlending banks and leasing
companies will take the credit risks on the borrowing enterprises.

4.       Due Diligence o f TSKB: TSKB was one o f the PFIs inthe first EFILproject, therefore it
i s well known to the World Bank team through regular exchange o f views on the implementation
o f the EFIL and through reviews o f TSKB's audited reports and other financial reporting
requiredunder the EFIL.A review o f TSKB's IFRS annual and audit reports for the years 2000-
2002 indicates that TSKB exceeds the minimum BIS risk weighted capital adequacy ratio o f 8
percent and maintains an overall sound financial and operational structure, and is fit to undertake
the financial liability o fthe Loan and operational commitments to act as a PIU for the project.

5.       Loan Terms: TSKB, based on its own funding mix and anticipated demandof exporters,
has indicated a preference for a U S dollar Fixed Spread Loan (FSL), which it will thenon lendto
participating banks and leasing companies for a period o f up to 7 years which will include a
grace period o f up to 5 years. In order to offset its administrative and implementation costs as
well as the credit risks involved, TSKB will charge an on-lending margin to the participating
banks and leasing companies o f between 200-400 basis points over its cost o f funds under the
World Bank loan, depending on the risk profile o f the borrowing intermediary. The subsidiary
loans made by TSKB to the participating banks and leasing companies will be denominated and
repayable in US dollars. The participating banks and leasing companies are expected to price
their sub-loans and leaseswhich maybe denominated andrepayable inany foreign currency on a
commercialbasis.

6.       Selection o f Participating Financial Intermediaries: A preliminary list o f 14 banks and 9
leasing companies has been compiled from the universe o f around 20 private commercial


                                                  24

Turkish banks and around 100 private leasing companies using the following pre-screening
criteria:

                For the banks - (i) assets during the last two years to exceed a minimum o f
                                    total
                US$500 million equivalent on average; and (ii)     export loans-to-total loans ratios
                during each o f the last two years (for which data is available) to exceed a
                minimumo f 10percent on average.


            1   For the leasing companies - (i) lease receivables during the last two years
                                                    total
                (for which data are available) to exceed a minimum o f US$50 million equivalent
                on average; and (ii)  new lease volume during the last two years (for which data
                are available) to exceed a minimum o fUS$30 million equivalent on average.

7.       These criteria ensure that only financial intermediaries with an operational history, a
viable asset base and an export sector lendingfocus are selected for hrther screening. From this
group o f banks and leasing companies, a smaller group o f 4-6 banks and 4-6 leasing companies
will be selected as final participating financial intermediaries for the EFILI1by TSKB based on:
(i) acceptance by TSKB o f their credit risk, (ii) expression o f interest inparticipation inthe
                                                    their
project, and (iii)the following eligibility criteria:


            1   For the banks - (i) general compliance with all legal and regulatory requirements
                applicable to the banking industry, including but not limited to such prudential
                regulations as minimum BIS risk-weighted capital adequacy ratio, maximum
                foreign currency exposure limits, maximum large exposure to single and
                connected clients and maximum insider lending limits, etc., duly certified by the
                banks' auditors every six months, and (ii) financial statements audited in
                                                              IFRS
                accordance with International Standards o f Auditing (ISA) (see Appendix 4.3 -
                LikelyProfile o fPFIs, Pre-QualificationandFinalEligibilityCriteria).


            1   For the leasing companies - (i) compliance with all legal and regulatory
                                                    general
                requirements applicable to the leasing industry, including but not limited to such
                regulations as minimumequity capital o f a lessor o f no less than TL 1trillion, the
                total sum o f lease exposures not exceeding 30 times a lessor's equity capital, and
                the total sum o f exposures to related parties not exceeding 15 times the equity
                capital, duly certified by the leasing companies' external auditors every six
                months, (ii)  IFRS financial statements audited in accordance with International
                Standards o f Auditing (ISA) (see Appendix 4.3 - Likely Profile o f PFIs, Pre-
                Qualification and Final Eligibility Criteria), and (iii) the leasing company should
                have beenprofitable for at least two out o f the last three years o f operations.

8.       Eligible sub-borrowers: All private (private ownership more than 50 percent) exporters
with foreign exchange earnings, irrespective o f their sector, will be eligible for participation as
sub-borrowers on a commercial basis. The prospective sub-borrowers will have to prepare and
present a complete sub-loan package consisting o f TSKB credit application form and such other
information which TSKB and the Bank could reasonably request, as well as satisfy the
procurement and environmental rules stated as part o f the World Bank loan conditions. The
creditworthiness o f the sub- borrowers will be assessed by the PFIs, subject to the minimum
requirement that the sub-borrowers maintain a maximum debt equity ratio o f 80:20 and

                                                   25

minimumdebt service coverage ratio of 1.2:l (both after receipt of the sub-loan and/or lease).
The World Bank, in coordination with TSKB, will carry out a prior review of the first two sub-
loan applications of each o f the participating banks and leasing companies to satisfy itself about
the credit analysis process carried out bythese financial intermediaries.

Project Implementation Unit (PIU) under the EFIL I1 Loan, was one of the PFTs in the first EFIL
project. As such, it i s well known to the World Bank team through regular exchange o f views on
the implementation o f the EFIL, and through reviews o f TSKB's audited reports and other
financial reporting required under the EFIL. A review o f TSKB's IFRS annual and audit reports
for the years 2000-2002 indicates that TSKB exceeds the minimum BIS risk weighted capital
adequacy ratio o f 8 percent and maintains an overall sound financial and operational structure,
and is fit to undertake the financial liability o f the Loan and operational commitments to act as
the PTU for the project.

2.      Since its foundation in 1950, TSKB has played an active role in every stage o f Turkey's
economic development, facilitating a number o f "firsts" in the manufacturing industry and the
financial sector. TSKB - through its support and extension o f medium-term loans for more than
3500 investment projects - has significantly contributed to the progress and development o f the
private sector. Over the past 35 years, the bank also provided financing by way o f participating
inthe sharecapitalofmore than 100companies.

3. TSKB was established in 1950 with the support of the World Bank and the cooperation of the
Govemment       the Central Bank and the leading commercial banks o f Turkey. TSKB was
founded for the purpose o f meeting the following objectives: (i)  to provide assistance to private
sector enterprises in all sectors o f the economy, with a primary focus on the industrial sector, (ii)
to encourage and assist the participation of private and foreign capital incorporations established
and to be established in Turkey, and (iii)     to assist the development o f the capital market in
Turkey. TSKB i s the first investment and development bank o f Turkey, and currently one o f
several such banks, and enjoys the special status granted to such banks which, among other
things, allows the banks to receive Government guarantees on their borrowings, and to provide
lease finance from their own sources. TSKB i s a majority privately owned bank. As an
investment & development bank, TSKB does not accept retail deposits. The activities o f TSKB
are regulated by the Banks Act o f Turkey and the bank i s supervised by the BDDK.

4.      Board of Directors. The Board o f Directors o f TSKB is responsible for all decisions
affecting TSKB's operations. It comprises 12 members, including the Chairman and one Vice-
Chairman, 8 members, and 2 auditors. The Board includes TSKB's president as one of its
members,andrepresents the current set of shareholders:



I s Bank Group,              55.30%                GarantiBank,          3.09%

6.      Lending. TSKB, as an investment & development bank, maintains the objective to
provide the market with medium and long term loans, mostly for the purpose o f investment.In
fact, foreign currency denominated long-term loans dominate the asset side of TSKB's balance
sheet. Such long term credit relations require a comprehensive analysis o f the borrowing
companies besides a close cooperation with the clients. While providing medium and long term
loans to entrepreneurs for their domestic and foreign investments, TSKB also extends short-term
working capital loans to meet their financing requirement in the operating period. Furthermore,
the bank provides to its clients all banking services in relation with foreign trade financing.
Finally, TSKB also offers financial lease facilities.

7.      Over the past several years, TSKB has been consistently providing significant amounts o f
medium and long-term lending (Figure 6 - the large increase in 2001 i s partially due to
retroactiverestatement o f TSKB's financials to include SYB which merged with TSKB inMarch
2002).

IPOs, valuations, M&As, privatization consultations, and research, (ii) treasury operations, and
(iii)capitalmarket operations and portfolio management. Lending, however, is TSKB's core
business product - in2002, net fee and commission income accounted for only around 20 percent
o fnet interest income.

9.      Funding. TSKB's main sources o f funding are foreign development and commercial
bank loans, loans from international financial institutions (IFIs), and small-scale borrowing in
international capital markets. As o f end-2002, the funds borrowed include borrowings from the
European Investment Bank, the Japanese Bank for International Cooperation, Akbank, the World
Bank, KfW, Dresdner Bank and other international and local banks and IFIs. Securities issued
include a Japanese yen-denominated bond and a small amount o f promissory notes. Funding
composition in2002 was as follows:

10.     FWmaturity exposure. TSKB has been in constant compliance with the BDDK
regulations regarding foreign exchange exposure, and generally maintains a prudentlybalanced
asset/liability mix in terms o f maturity structure. During the last two years, its net FX position
went down from US$14.2 million to US$4.2 million (on a balance sheet o f roughly US$1
billion). As for maturity structure, TSKB's mediumand long-term lendingi s funded primarily by
medium and long-term borrowings from the international commercial and development banks
and IFIs, providing for a proper maturity match. In addition, TSKB has strong overall risk
management procedures inplace and holds a portfolio o f liquid assets as part o f its liquidity risk
management strategy.


                            F. Asset CompositionandCreditPolicies

11.     Duringthe last few years, TSKB increased its share of loans in total assets from 45-48
percent to close to 60 percent, which i s much higher than the banking system's average 22-25
per cent in 2001-2002. Medium and long-term loans make up the bulk o f TSKB's lending. The
asset composition o f TSKB i s provided below:

CreditPolicies

12.     TSKB extends long, medium and short-term loans within the framework o f principles
and limits determined by the Board o f Directors. The Board o f Directors approve the credit line
and project-financing packages recommendedby the Credit Committee. The Credit Committee,
formed by the President and the Executive Vice Presidents and attended by the Department
Heads o f Loans, Financial Analysis, Economics and Research, Engineering and Operations
discussesthe loan application on the basis o f the credit report prepared by TSKB's research team
generally formed by an engineer, an economist and a financial analyst from the TSKB staff.


                                                 41

13.     The credit report aims at estimating the cost and benefit o f the investment project under
evaluation with respect to profitability, economic benefit and undertaker risk. Basically the
investmentproject is evaluated under economic, technical and financial sub-topics, within a time
perspective o f roughly five years. Technical and economic analysis is carried out by the
specialized staff within these fields. The credit report i s therefore composed o f these three
different analysis integrated and interpreted ina single text by the financial analyst. All decisions
regarding lendingand collateral are givenon the basis o fthe credit report.

14.     TSKB extends loans against collateral. The basic policy concerningcollateral is to obtain
a mortgage o f first degree on the plant to be set up or to obtain a bank letter o f guarantee. When
deemed necessary TSKB resorts to other types o f collateral such as mortgage onproperty outside
the plant, bank letter o f guarantee and personal guarantee. In case joint financing with other
financial institutions, a mortgage may be established jointly in favour o f the institutions
concemed or a pool sharing agreement providing for proportional claim on the proceeds o f the
existing mortgage may be concluded. Sometimes Treasury Bills or Govemment Bonds issuedby
the Turkish Republic may also be deposited as collateral. Because o fbeing regarded as the most
liquid type o f collateral these Bonds have a positive effect on the capital adequacy ratio
requirement just like the bank letter o f guaranteeand the mortgage o f first degree.

15.     One o f the main objectives of TSKB is to ensure the proper use o f its loans. With this
objective inview: inthe case o f loans to be used for the importation o f goods, disbursements are
made exclusively by TSKB; inexport and import financing, transactions have been concluded in
a manner acceptable to TSKB and in the case o f local currency loans, disbursement will depend
on the realization o f conditions laid down previously. Within this framework Loans, Operations,
Treasury and Technical Services Departments co-operate to observe the proper implementation
o f disbursementand collection.

16.     The companies financed by TSKB and the sectors they belong to are followed up
periodically. The purpose o f the follow-up i s to ensure that the investments are completed intime
and conditions set forth are satisfied as well as to identify the problems arising during the
implementation and operation stage so as to be able to render assistance to the companies in
solving their problems.

17.     As an independent evaluation, inthe credit contracts it is stated that the annual financial
statements and accounting records o f the company should be audited by an auditing firm
acceptable to TSKB inaccordance with the International Auditing Procedures and Principles and
results should be delivered to TSKB duringthe lifetime o fthe loan.

18.     It has been a common practice in TSKB to evaluate periodically (once in three or six
months) the financial statements o f the companies in which there's TSKB involvement. Within
this framework the credit limits once approved have been revised, raised or cancelled by the
Credit Committee especially when the original approval date i s earlier than two years.

                     G. CapitalAdequacy, Asset Quality and CapitalBase

19.     TSKB maintains a policy o f requiringbank guarantees for part o f its loans to non-bank
borrowers. Having bank risk versus company risk on its loan book reduces the capital
requirement for TSKB, as exposure to OECD-zone banks is risk-weighted at only 20%,
compared to 100% for non-bank borrowers, in calculating its capital adequacy ratio (CAR). At
six-monthly intervals starting at end-2000, TSKB has kept its CAR in the range o f 19.3-34.09

                                                  42

percent. The CAR as o f September 30, 2003 and the projected year end-2003 CAR are both
around 31percent.

20.    Non-performing loans (NpLs) held by TSKB increased from virtually zero in 1999 to 5
percent in 2001 and 7 percent in 2002. This is a reflection o f the combination o f tougher loan
loss provisioning standards following the 2000/01 financial crises, and an actual increase in
delinquencies byborrowers affected by the crises.

21.    The TSKB loan book (currently approximately $600 million on a total balance sheet o f
around $1.1 billion), with the EFIL I1loan o f $300 million, i s expected to increase to nearly
US$$900 million on an approximate asset base o f $1.4 billion. Besides, there are likely to be
additional lines o f credit from IFIs including IBRD. TSKB's CAR as a result i s projected to
decrease from the current 31 percent to approximately 20 to 25 percent, still comfortably above
the minimumrequirement o f 8 percent. Nevertheless, during the project implementation period,
the Bank will monitor TSKB's balance sheet and capital base growth to avoid over-exposure.

22.    TSKB also has an additional constraint o f a single borrower exposure. It has existing
banking or equity links/exposures with a number o f banks in the system. Thus the amount o f
additional wholesale TSKB loan exposures on each such retail bank inlight o f EFIL I1will need
to be monitored to avoid excessive single borrower exposure. Inpractical terms it will mean that
TSKB will need to wholesale EFIL I1to a more diverse group o f PFIs. This actually will be a
desirable outcome and i s consistent with the project objective o f broadening and deepening
financial intermediation.

                                  H. EarningsandLiquidity

23.    TSKB has been profitable for the last few years with the exception o f 2001. In2001, the
bank incurred significant losses as a result o fthe T L devaluationinthat year resulting innegative
net operating income and a net loss for the ear. The results have improved considerably in2002.

24.     The impact o f the crises i s also visible in the banks return-on-assets and return on equity
ratios, which both turned negative in2001, but recovered in2002. This experience is inline with
the experience of other Turkishbanks, which also incurred losses during 2001 as a result o f the
crisis in that year and the associated extraordinary exchange rate and interest rate volatility,
which imposed sizeable losses on almost all banks, both directly and indirectly through the
concomitant deterioration inthe banks' loan books.

                               A. TypicalParticipatingBankProfile

1.     There were 51 banks in the Turkish banking system at end-September, 2003. These
include private commercial banks, state owned banks, foreign banks, and non-deposit taking
investment & development banks. Out o f this universe, TSKB has active working wholesaling
and other types o frelationship with 36 Turkish banks. Inorder to determine the extent o f credit
exposure it should take on any one o f these banks, TSKB carries out on a semi-annual basis a
risk assessment o f these banks by analyzing their financial information including capital
adequacy, profitability, and liquidityratios. However, inthe interest o f efficient implementation
o f EFIL 11, and following the successful approach used in the first EFIL, it was agreed that the
number o f participating banks should be limited to about 4-6 banks. This would enable an
amount o f approximately $30-50 million to be intermediated by each bank and allow the World
Bank and TSKB to create the right incentives for the selected banks to focus their management
time and effort on timely and efficient implementation o f the EFIL11.

2.     A secondary objective o f EFIL I1is to continue a dialogue with the leading private sector
commercial banks and encourage them to improve their financial intermediation skills and
volume, by maintaining prudent and rigorous credit appraisal standards and expanding their
operations towards increasingthe share o f credit to the private sector intheir balance sheets.

3.     Inorder to achieve these objectives, the selected banks should have (i)a proven track
record o f lending to exporters, and (ii)  a certain `critical mass' in terms o f their balance sheets
and, though not as critical, their branch networks. Finally, the participating banks have to
demonstrate full and continuous compliance with the technical and prudential standards
applicable to their activities, and a clear drive towards increasing lendingto the private sector as
a share o ftheir total assets.

4.     The selection o f the participating banks is therefore being undertaken in two stages: (i)
pre-qualification, and (ii) eligibility and selection. The pre-qualification criteria are listed
                             final
below:


    0  The banksshouldbe privately owned, domestically incorporatedcommercialbanks;
    0  Minimum total asset size should be at least US$500 million equivalent, and the banks
       should have maintained this minimum asset size for each o f the last two years . This
       would establish that the pre-qualified banks have at least a minimum size of operations
       on a consistent basis for two years running; and
    0  The pre-qualified banks (as determined by information compiled by TSKB) should have
       a minimum export loans/total loans ratio o f 10 percent for the last two years on average
       for which data i s available. This would establish that the pre-qualified banks have a
       proven export orientation in their lending operations and maintained this orientation
       consistently for the last two years.

6.      Final selection of participating banks. The banks to be selected for participation will
have to meet the final eligibility criteria mentioned below, be an acceptable credit risk to TSKB,
andhave expressed interest inparticipationinthe credit line. All the capital based criteria would
have to be certified bythe banks' extemal auditors as o fthe latest available half-year period.

                                         C. General Criteria

7.      The participating bank shall remain in general compliance with all legal and
regulatory requirements applicable to its operations, including but not limited to BDDK-
promulgated prudential regulations regarding capital adequacy, large exposures, related lending,
and foreign currency exposures, as (re)confimed by the bank's auditors in writing on a semi-
annual basis.

                                             D. Audit Criteria

8.      The participating bank shall, at the time o f selection and for the duration o f its subsidiary
loan agreement with TSKB, for each year-end beginningwith year-end 2003, present an audit
reportwhich:

     0  Covers two full years o f operations;
     0  I s prepared by an internationally recognized external audit firm in accordance with
        IntemationalAuditing Standards and Intemational Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS);
        and
     0  Contains an unqualified audit opinion.

                         E. TypicalParticipatingLeasingCompanyProfile

9.      There were 107 leasing companies in Turkey in mid-2002. These included 91 private
self-standing companies, among them several state-owned and foreign-owned firms,                             5
specialized finance houses, and 11investment & development banks allowed by law to engage in
leasing transactions.

10.     The total asset size o f the leasing industry was US$1.96 billion as o f end 2002, but
increased to US$2.41 billionby end-June, 20033, o f which lease receivables made 75 percent. At
the end o f first half o f 2003, business volume (new leases) o f the industry had reached US$1
billion, compared to US$1.29 billion for the entire year 2002, suggesting a strong pickup in
interest from the real sector in leasing products. Total shareholders' equity on June 30, 2003 was
US$300 million. The total assets of the ten largest companies range from US$50-250 million,
and together they account for over 60 percent o f the overall industry's assets and 75 percent o f
new business volume (during first half o f 2003), suggesting the presence o f a large number o f
marginalplayers.

11.     It was agreed between the Bank and TSKB that the number o f participating leasing
companies should be limited to about 4-6 enable the EFIL I1 funds to be intermediated most
effectively by the strongest industry players. This would allow an amount o f approximately
US$15-25 million to be intermediatedby each leasing company and enable the World Bank and
TSKB to create the right incentives in the selected companies to focus their management time
andeffort ontimely andefficient implementationo fthe EFIL11.

12.     A secondary objective o f EFIL I1is to establish and move forward a dialogue with the
leading private sector leasing companies and build a consensus with them on the best way to
improve the leasing environment and the prospects for further development o f the leasing
industryinTurkey.

13.     Inorder to achieve these objectives, the selected pre-qualified companies should have (i)
a certain `critical mass' in terms o f their lease receivables, and (ii)proven ability to generate
                                                                                a
new leasing volume. Finally, the leasing companies selected to participate have to demonstrate
full and continuous compliancewith the laws andregulations applicable to their activities.



 The 23 percent increase inU S dollar terms inthe first 6 months of2003 was due mostly to appreciation ofthe
TurkishLira. Innominal TL terms, the increase was around 9 percent.
                                                        47

14.    The selection o f the participating leasing companies has therefore been planned in two
stages: (i)pre-qualification, and (ii) eligibility and selection. The pre-qualification criteria
                                         final
used are listedbelow:


    0  The leasingcompanies should be privately owned;
   0   Minimum leasereceivables should be at least US$50 million equivalent, and the leasing
       companies should have maintained this size on average for the last two years . This
       would establish that the pre-qualified leasing companies have at least a minimum size o f
       operations; and
   0   The pre-qualified leasing companies should have a minimum new leasing volume o f
       US$30 million on average for the last two years. This would establish that the pre-
       qualified leasing companies have a proven track record o f active operations.

                                     F. Pre-qualified Short List

15.    The pre-qualificationprocess has ledto a preliminary list o f 9 leasing companies.

Country Issues

3.       A Country Financial Accountability Assessment for Turkey was carried out in2001. The
CFAA report identified some weaknesses inthe Turkish financial accountability, inboth the
public and the private sector. Main findings inthe public sector accountability covered issues
like failure to define and control the entirety o fpublic funds, incomplete audit coverage, weak
forces o fpublic accountability, narrow accounting model and procurement risks. Main findings
intheprivate sector accountingandauditingarethe existence o faregulatory approach where
specialized agencies each devise and enforce their and different obligations without adequate
coordination and where there i s no common general platform.

4.       US$200 million o f EFIL I1i s envisaged to be disbursed through banks. The 1999Banks
Law established the Banking Regulation and SupervisionAgency, and among its powers is the
power to determine the accounting and auditing requirements applicable to the banks under its
supervision. Banks must submit non-audited monthly prudentialretums to the BRSA, and
publishaudited annual financial statements. Only auditors approved bythe BRSA may carry out
such audits. All changes inauditor must also be approved, and a change can be imposedwhere
there i s dissatisfaction with the performance o f the auditor. The external auditor i s requiredto
report to the BRSA on banks' internal control and risk management systems, as well as being
obliged to report direct to the BRSA with respect to certainissues which may threaten the going
concem nature o f a bank.


                                                   50

5.        Untilthe 1999bankinglaw reforms, the Council ofMinisters rather thanbanking
supervisors, were responsible for promulgatingrequirements inareas such as loan loss
provisioning, and these rules were relaxedtwice inresponse to the Asian and Russianfinancial
crises (inFebruary 1998 and August 1999). Requirements with respect to the calculation o f
capital adequacy on a consolidated basis, and to disclosures inthe areas o f large exposures,
connected lending, foreign exchange exposures, interest rate risk exposures, and maturity risk
exposures also fell short o fthe relevant EU, Base1Committee and IFRS norms. This served to
undermine the quality and relevance o f informationprovided to regulators and to the market, and
has ledto weakening the early-warning signals provided by financial statements and to
understating the extent o fproblems which exist. Since December 1999,efforts were made to
strengthen significantly the regulatory and institutional infrastructurefor banking regulation
(including the creation o fthe BRSA), including upgrading o fthe relevant financial reporting
obligations. InJune 2000, the Treasury issued an instruction which brought disclosure rules for
bankscloser to InternationalAccounting Standards, andinJune 2001, the BRSA issued a new
Regulationon Chartering and Operations o fBanks, which further enhances public disclosure
requirements.

6.        The Bank in 1999 has extended an "Export Finance IntermediationLoan" to Eximbank
where Treasury acted as the guarantor. Eximbank acted as an APEX bank and extended credit
lines to ParticipatingFinancial Institutions (PFI) for on lending to beneficiary enterprises. At the
inception o f EFILthe PFIswere obliged under the terms o f SLAs to remainincompliance with
"prudential" ratios which were stricter than those imposedon the banking system by the Turkish
bank regulatory authorities (at the time the TurkishTreasury and the Central Bank). As
conditionality for FSAL andlater PFPSAL the prudentialregulations for the Turkishbanking
systemwere tightenedand inMay 2001, the SLAs were amended to replace the original
"prudential" ratios with those set forth inthe (new) banking law andregulations issuedby
BRSA.

7.        The BRSAissued a new comprehensive regulation on accountingstandards for banks in
July 2002, which brings these standards inline with IFRS.However, the BRSA regulation does
not require full application o f IFRS 27 (consolidation o f subsidiaries), as banks only have to
consolidate their financial subsidiaries, while for nonfinancial subsidiaries separate financial
statement disclosure i s mandated. The statements o f such non-financial subsidiaries are not
IFRS-based4, however, and thus their disclosure will not allow the user to consolidate these with
the IFRS-based consolidated statements o fthe parent bankandits financial subsidiaries. Also, as
the IFRS are subject to change, any such change will necessitate an adjustment o fthe BRSA
regulation.

8.        The BRSA also issues rules governing the external audit o fbank financial statements,
and only auditors approved by the BRSA may carry out such audits. The "Regulation on
Principles for Independent Auditing" and the "Regulation on Authorization o f the Auditing
Institutions and Permanent or Temporary Withdrawal oftheir Authorities", bothpublishedinthe
Official Gazette Nr.24657 on January 31,2002; these regulationsare broadly inline with ISA.

9.        TSKB has been assessed for compliance with BRSA prudential regulations by the project
team and found to be incompliance. The participating banks are not yet determined however



6         Only if all non-financialsubsidiariesof a bank are listed or publicly held, and only ifthe CMB requiresthe use of full
IFRS for all listed or publicly held entities, will the financial statements for such non-financial subsidiaries be IFRS-basedand
allow full consolidationwith the IFRS-basedfinancial statements of the parentbank and its financialsubsidiaries.
                                                                  51

their compliance with BRSAprudentialregulations is a conditionalityfor initialandcontinued
eligibility.

10.      US$lOO million o f EFIL I1is envisaged to be disbursedthrough financial leasing
companies inTurkey. Leasingcompanies inTurkey are subject to Financial Leasing Law
enacted in 1985 and the Regulations Dealing with the Establishment and Activities o fFinancial
Leasing Companies were last amended in 1992. Leasing companies are regulatedand supervised
bythe Bankingand ForeignExchange Department o fthe Treasury. According to the leasing law,
the leasing companies shouldbejoint stock companies with a minimumpaid incapital o fUS$2
million. Total leasetransactions o fthe companies could not exceed 30 times a leasingcompanies
net worth (15 times for transactions with connected parties). There i s not a limit on single party
exposure and there i s no active supervision by the Treasury.

11.     Inadditionto the lack ofsupervision inthe leasing industryinTurkey, there is also not
very reliable data dissemination to the markets. Quoted leasing companies are subject to the
accounting principles publishedby Capital Markets Board. The changed regulations requiring
the application o f IFRS 17, became applicable after July 1,2003. Therefore due to different
accounting policies applied the financial statements o f leasing companies are far from reflecting
the real financial positions o fthese entities. However due to these inconsistent application o f
accounting principles, it is common practice for leasingcompanies to have financial statements
prepared inaccordance with IFRS and audited inaccordance with ISA.Eightypercent ofthe
transaction volume inthe leasing industryi s handledby 10 large leasing companies inthe sector,
andwe havebeeninformedthat theywould all have IFRSfinancial statements available for the
last three years. Therefore our criteria o f initial and continued eligibility will be based on
calculations derivedfrom IFRS financial statements.

Risk Mitigation Strategy

13.     Country financial management risk - the CFAA has identified major weaknesses in the
Turkish financial accountability, inboth the public, private and the banking sector. These risks
together with the developments inthe sector after the preparationo f CFAA has beenexplained in
detail in the "Country Issues" section. The project teams assessment o f the banks` compliance
with the BRSA prudential regulations showed that the bank is in compliance with the BRSA
prudential regulations.

14.     The accounting standards applicable to the banks differ with respect to consolidation
from International Financial reporting Standards (IFRS). The financial intermediaries which will
manage the credit lines to export companies will submit their IFRS based audited financial
statements to the Bank in addition to their audited financial statements prepared in accordance
with the BRSA accounting standards. TSKB will bear the credit risk for the loans it extends to
the PFIsandthe PFIs will bear the credit risk onthe credits made available to export companies.

Strengthsand Weaknesses

15.     The significant strengths that provide the basis for reliance on the project financial
management system include (a) the disbursements to the export companies will be made by
submission o f invoices and TSKB will be responsible for the control o f these invoices inaddition
to the PFIs; (b) funds will be disbursed through PFIs which will be selected for their financial
strength and capacity to appraise and supervise sub-projects; and (c) experience o f TSKB and
expected PFIs, several o fwhich have participatedinEFILI.

16.     There are no significant weaknesses inthe project financial management system.


                                               53

Implementing Entity

17.     The loan is a credit line and the borrower and the implementingentity of the o f the loan
will be TSKB. TSKB will then on-lend to PFIs for lending to exporters. Treasury will be the
guarantor o fthe loan.

18.     TSKB was established in 1950 with the support o f the World Bank and the cooperation
o f the Government o f the Republic o f Turkey, Central Bank of Turkey and leading commercial
banks o f Turkey. TSKB has been founded for the purpose o f (i)       providing assistance to private
sector enterprises inall sectors o f the economy primarilyinthe industrial sector (ii) encourage
                                                                                        to
and assist the participation o f private and foreign capital incorporations established and to be
established inTurkey (iii) assist the development o fthe capital market inTurkey.
                             to

19.     TSKB's largest shareholder is the I s Bank Group by 55.3 %. Consolidated financial
statements are prepared for Is Bankasi and therefore there i s not a consolidation requirement for
TSKB. TSKB has internal regulations and manuals for internal control and risk management in
compliance with the banking law.

20.     A separate project implementation unit (PIU) has been established at TSKB under the
supervision o f one o f its executive vice presidents to oversee the implementation o f EFIL 11.The
PIUis staffed with experienced management and staff, and as the primary project counterpart for
the Bank team will provide the overall administration o f all aspects o f the credit line andrequired
reporting to the Bank.

21.     The PFIs are not known at this stage. Signing subsidiary loan agreements with two PFIs,
which have undergone the qualification process i s an effectiveness condition for the loan.
Compliance with the prudential regulations set out by Banking Regulatory Supervisory
Authority (BRSA) i s required for continuing eligibility o f TSKB and the PFIs. This will be
monitored through (a) prudential regulation compliance certificate and (b) annual audit reports.
This certification will be issued by the banks' external auditors. Leasing companies have not
been financial intermediaries in World Bank projects in Turkey before. Eligibility indicators
have been identified and agreed with TSKB for the leasing companies and TSKB will be
responsible from monitoring the continuing compliance o f the leasing companies with the
eligibility criteria.

Funds Flow

22.     There will be special account in the name o f TSKB for the project. Funds from the loan
will be made available to PFIs following submission o f payment documents (invoices for the
goods and works purchased by the export companies) to TSKB. This information will be given
to TSKB inelectronic form and TSKB will be responsible from controlling these invoices.

Staffing

23.     TSKB has given the names o f personnel assigned to the project. The qualifications and
experience o f the nominated staff are satisfactory to the Bank. However controlling the invoioes
will result with and additional workload and TSKB will assign two more staff to the project who
will be solely responsible from controlling the invoices.

Accounting Policies and Procedures

                                                  54

24.     The financial management capacity at TSKB i s satisfactory. The Bank has qualified
personnel, adequate manuals and guidelines to conduct efficient financial management. The
accounting and reporting systems at the bank are geared toward producing statements and
information as required by Turkish law and regulations as well as International Accounting
Standards.

25.     Considering that the bank has adequate accounting and reporting systems the main
transactions that i s the movements in the special account, credit lines made available to the PFIs
will be inthe bank`s main accounting systems. The main accounting system will be supported by
a sub-system (MIS) for project accounting and reporting purposes. The follow-up o f
documentation submitted by the export companies to withdraw loan funds will be made in this
system. The systemwill also be capable o fproducingthe FMRs.

Internal Audit.

26.     TSJSJ3 has internal auditing department staffed with qualified audit professionals who are
capable o f producing basic audit tasks. Transactions under the loan will be subject to internal
audit as a part o fbanks' credit portfolio audits.

I nformation Systems.

27.     The main transactions that is the movements o f the special account, credit lines made
available to PFIs andwithdrawals from the credit lines will be inthe main accounting system o f
TSKB. The main accounting system will be supplementedby a Management Information System
(MIS).

Supervision Plan

28.     During project implementation, the Bank will supervise the project's financial
management arrangements in two main ways: (i)review the project's quarterly financial
management reports as well as the banks` and project's annual audited financial statements and
auditor's management letter; and (ii)during the Bank's supervision missions, review the
project's financial management and disbursement arrangements (including a review o f a sample
of SOEs and movements on the Special Account) to ensure compliance with the Bank`s
minimum requirements. As required, a Bank-accredited Financial Management Specialist will
assist inthe supervision process.

                                             B. Audit

29.     Annual and six-monthly (limited review) audits o f TSKB i s undertaken on an
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) basis in accordance with Intemational
Auditing Standards by a reputed international auditing firm. The current auditors o f TSKB are
Deloitte and Touche's member firm inTurkey. The last three years' audit reports (in accordance
with IFRS) are reviewed and all were unqualified. In order to ensure that the project accounts
andthe special account would be audited inaccordance with the World Bank audit guidelines the
mission discussed and agreed with TSKB that the auditors o f TSKB's annual financial
statements will also carry the audit o f the project audit as the preparation o f project financial
statements i s TSKB's responsibility. The audited project accounts will include; project balance
sheet, sources and uses o f funds and the special account statement. The auditors terms of
reference will also cover whether the SOEs submitted during the fiscal year, together with the
procedures and internal controls involved in their preparation can be relied upon to support the
related withdrawal applications. TSKB has been engaging the services o f international auditors
for several years and therefore the engagement o f an auditor will not be a specific Board
condition andwill not be financed out o fthe loan.

30.     The PFIs will also submit annual audited accounts to TSKB. It is common practice for
the expected PFIs to have their accounts prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) and audited in accordance with ISA. As the PFIs are not known at
this stage the engagement o fauditors for PFIswill not be a specific board condition.


                                 C. DisbursementArrangements

31.     The Disbursement Categories and Percentage o f Expenditures to be financed, and
projected disbursements are shown inTable 6 below. The total loan i s expected to be disbursed
over four years and nine months from the date o f effectiveness, expected to be inMarch 2004.

32.     The EFIL I1is expected to achieve full credit line utilization rate within this period as a
result o f incorporating the following features in loan design: (i) utilization parameters are
                                                                   loan
flexible - both short and medium term working capital loans by themselves or in combination
with investmentloans will be available; (ii) use o f TSIU3, rather than the Government, as the
                                             the
Borrower and Implementing Agency, creating positive incentives (onlending margin) for
efficient loan utilization; (iii)
                               pre-allocating an amount of subsidiary loans (and the commitment

                                                 56

fee burden) to participating banks and leasing companies upon subsidiary loan signing, and
therefore creating downstream positive incentives for the PFIs in terms o f higher returns by
quicker utilization, and the negative incentive o f commitment fee payments in the absence o f
such utilization; (iv) the inflexibility o f previous credit lines in Turkey has been avoided (e.g.,
too many requirements in terms o f minimum sub-loan maturity, sub-borrower co-financing
requirements, etc.) which performedmuchbetter whenrestructured to rectify such inflexibility.

33.    Retroactive financing o f expenditures incurred between September 30, 2003 and the date
o f Loan signing, will be allowed up to an amount o fUS$30 million.


                                         D. SpecialAccount

34.    To facilitate timely project implementation, TSKB will establish, maintain and operate, a
separate Special Account in US$ in itself under terms and conditions satisfactory to the World
Bank. The Special Account would have an Authorized Allocation o f up to US$20 million
representing the expected advance payments on contracts duringthe peak quarter o f expenditures
ifmade exclusivelythroughthe Special Account. At the start ofthe project, the Special Account
deposits would be limited to half o f the Authorized Allocation (US$lO million), and the
remaining portion o f the Authorized Allocation would be disbursed upon TSKB's request when
the aggregate amount o f withdrawals from the Loan Account plus the total amount o f all
outstanding Special Commitments entered into by the World Bank shall be equal to or exceed
the equivalent o f US$40 million. Replenishment applications would be submitted at least every
three months, and would include reconciled bank statements as well as other appropriate
supporting documents. The minimum application size for payments directly from the Loan
Account for issuance o f Special Commitments and direct payments i s 10 percent o f the Special
Account authorized allocation.

                          Annex 8: ProcurementArrangements


1. The procurement o f goods (including related services) and works will be carried out in
accordance with the World Bank's Guidelines:Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits
(issued in January 1995,RevisedJanuary andAugust 1996,September 1997 and January 1999).
The procurement arrangements are described below. The project estimated cost andprocurement
methods are summarized in Table 8.1 o f this Annex. The World Bank's review process i s also
presented inTable 8.2.

2. Incase o f procurement under sub-loans and leases, the ParticipatingFinancial Intermediaries
(PFIs) will be responsible for ensuring that the procurement rules for sub-loans and leases
specified below are followed by the sub-borrowers. TSKB will be responsible for reviewing and
monitoring the compliance with the procurement rules by the intermediary banks and leasing
companies, and their sub-borrowers (beneficiary enterprises). A specialist assigned for the
procurement arrangements within the TSKB PIU will be responsible for all procurement
oversight for the management o f the project. Ifneeded, the assigned procurement staff will be
trained through World Bank seminars to be conducted inTurkey in order to be familiar with the
World Bank's procurement rules and practice. The Bank also encourage TSKB for the
employment o f one specialist who has experience in the Bank's procurement procedures. The
PIUwill keep the records and copies o f the documents o f the procurements handledthrough the
intermediary banks and leasing companies. The World Bank will conduct regular post reviews o f
the sub-projects not requiring a prior review. The PIU will be responsible for assembling the
documentation related to specific procurement transactions from the PFIs and sub-borrowers in
order to facilitate the Bank's reviews.

3. Private Sector Procurement Practice in Turkey. Inthe Country Procurement Assessment
Report (CPAR) dated June 2001, it was determined that there are well established commercial
practices for the procurement o f goods, works and services by the private sector enterprises,
autonomous commercial enterprises and individuals. In case o f goods, the local practice i s to
prepare the technical specifications and solicit quotations from the local and/or international
market. Incase o f medium and large works, the technical specifications are usually prepared by
consultant companies and bids are collected from qualified contractors.         Minor works are
generally tendered on a lump sum basis by collecting bids from a number o f local contractors.
When equipment and machinery i s needed for expansion o f existing facilities, the purchasers
usually prefer proprietary goods from a single source for the sake o f standardization and
minimization o f the operation and maintenance cost. Therefore, the local private sector or
commercial practices can be considered to be consistent with the World Bank's criteria with
respect to economy and efficiency. The general rule in the sector i s to procure the least cost
goods, works and services consistent with minimumquality requirements.

4. Procurement of Goods and Related Services.                Based on the assessment above,
procurement o f goods and related services (installation and maintenance) financed under the
proposed project will be according to the World Bank Procurement Guidelines. For contracts
below US$5.O million equivalent, established local private sector commercial practices will be
followed inaccordance with paragraph 3.12 of the Procurement Guidelines. Care has to be taken
o f other relevant factors such as time o f delivery, efficiency and reliability o f the goods and
availability o f maintenance facilities and spare parts thereof, and in case o f non-consultant
services, of the quality and competence o f the parties rendering them. Advertising in the local
and international press will not be mandatory. However, International Competitive Bidding

                                                58

(ICB) would be required for individual contracts o f US$ 5.0 million equivalent and above for
goods and related services. All procurement o f goods and related services under contracts equal
to or above US$ 5.0 million equivalent will be subject to prior review. Contracts placed by sub-
borrowers on their subsidiary or affiliated companies will not be eligible for financing out o f the
Loan. The procurement o fthe second handgoods are not eligible for financing out o fthe Loan.

5. Procurement of Works. Procurement o f works financed under the proposed project will be
according to the World Bank Procurement Guidelines. For civil works estimated to cost less than
US$1.O million equivalent per contract, established local private sector commercialpractices will
be followed in accordance with paragraph 3.12 o f the Procurement Guidelines. For contracts
above U S $ l.O million equivalent but less than US$5.0 million equivalent, National Competitive
Bidding(NCB) procedures satisfactory to the World Bank would beused. For contracts US$5.0
million equivalent and above, International Competitive Bidding (ICB) would be required for
individual contracts. All ICB contracts and the first two N C B contracts for works shall be subject
to prior review by the World Bank.

6. Review Procedures

The Bank will review the procurement arrangements proposedperformed by TSKB in every
year, including contract packaging, applicable procedures, and the scheduling o fthe procurement
processes, for its conformity with Bank Procurement Guidelines, the proposed implementation
program and disbursement schedule.

(a) Prior Review: The following procurement action and documentation would be subject to
Prior Review by the Bank in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraphs 2 and 3 of
Appendix 1to the Procurement Guidelines.

        Goods and Works: For ICB and the first two NCB Contracts for each PFI; prior review
        o f all BiddingDocuments, BidEvaluation Reports, Recommendations o f Contract Award
        and draft Contract will be conducted.

        For Contracts awarded through Commercial Practices; prior review o f first two
        contracts will be conducted for each PFI.

 (b) Post Review: The procurement documents for all other contracts shall be subject to the
Bank's post review in accordance with the procedures set forth inparagraph 4 o f Appendix 1to
the Procurement Guidelines on a random basis, one in five contracts. Post review o f the
procurement documents will normally be undertaken during the Bank supervision mission or as
the Bank may request to review any particular contracts at any time. In such cases, the TSKB
shall provide the Bank for its review the relevant documentation. The post review shall be
conducted by the Bank's Procurement Specialist. The outcome o f the post review will be
communicated bythe Bank at the earliest time.

   Annex 9: Turkey's Export Growth, Export Loans and General FX Loan
                                    Availability Analysis


1.     GDP Growth. GDP (in constant 1987 prices) has fluctuated widely, due to the global
crisis o f 1997/1998, and the crises Turkey experienced during the 2000/2001 period. While
economic recovery was significant last year, GDP in 2002 was just a bit above the 1998 level.
The current global economic downturn i s limitingTurkey's export-led growth potential.

2.     Exports as percent of GDP. Even with the erratic GDP (in constant 1987 prices)
performance during the last 4 years, exports as percent o f GDP have grown continuously since
1995, with the exception of 1999 as a result of the meltdown of the Russian economy - an
important destination for Turkish exports. Nevertheless, among the top 30 exporters globally,
Turkey ranks only 21"         in terms of export share in GDP (see Table 8 below).

     Note: The difference inthe level o f Turkish exports as percent o f GDP inthe graph above and the table below is due
     to the difference inthe starting base for constant price level calculation (1987 for the data in the graph, and 1995 for

3.      Export Growth. Turkish exports grew from the US$26-28 billion range in the pre-crisis
period to US$36 billion in2002, and continued to grow at a fast pace inthe first months o f 2003.
Such a spurt was caused by a sharp depreciation o f the Turkish Lira, for a while increasing the
competitiveness of Turkey's exports on the global market. However, the recent appreciation o f
the Lira, coupled with an economic slowdown in Turkey's main export destination, Germany,
and other trading partners signals a likelihood o f a slowdown o f the rate o f export growth inthe
period ahead.

4.     Export Credit Costs. The cost o f Turk EXIM's Bank's short-term benchmark credits to
exporters has gone down from the highs o f the crisis period, yet has not achieved the pre-1998
level, despite the low interest rate environment globally, and even edged upwards during the last
few observed months. The cost o flocally obtainable mediumand long-term credit to exporters, if
available at all, i s prohibitive.

5.     Ex~ortand total lending;. In TL terms, banking system loans have grown over the last
three years. However, due to the devaluation of the Lira, the US$ equivalent of the loan stock
shrunk dramatically in 2001 and remained virtually unchanged in 2002. Medium and long-term
loans (in US$ equivalent) have somewhat recovered in 2002 compared to 2000, but short-term
export and longer-term export-guaranteed investment loans have not.

6.      During the last three years, the banking system has reduced its direct lending
exposure to the public sector. However, the other side o f the picture i s Treasury securities
owned by the banks: they have increased continuously from 2000, almost doubling in US$
terms by 2002, and proving to be the favorite destination for the banks' free funds. Total
securities owned by the banks, the majority o f which was Treasury paper, increased as
percent o f total loans from 58 percent in2000 to 180percent in2002.

                            Annex 10: SafeguardPolicy Issues

1.      Environmental Assessment policies o f the Bank will apply to EFIL 11. Environmental
issues o f sub-borrowers and their sub-projects will be addressed through the sub-loan
environmental eligibility assessment. TSKB will be responsible for ensuring that sub-borrowers
and sub-projects financed under the EFIL I1undergo environmental screening to ensure their
conformance with Turkish environmental legislation and regulations and the World Bank's
policies and procedures, as set forth in OP/BP 4.01. The credit officers already appointed by
TSKB to staff the PIU will perform this function. The PIU Operations Manual detailing, inter
alia, the World Bank's requirements in respect o f environmental assessment, will be prepared
prior to loannegotiations.

2.      All sub-loans to be financed under the EFIL I1 should be subjected by PFIs to an
environmental review process incorporating the procedures described in section VI o f the
project's Operations Manual. The PFIs should use these procedures inreviewing and appraising
sub-borrowers/sub-projects, and to       inform Beneficiary Enterprises          o f environmental
requirements for sub-loan appraisal, so that sub-projects can be implemented in an
environmentally sound manner.

3.      The procedures essentially consist o f Environmental Screening, Environmental Impact
Assessment, and Environmental Mitigationwhere necessary. The Environmental Screening will
be carried out by the PFIs at an early stage intheir sub-loan review procedures to determine the
appropriate environmental risk category for the sub-borrowedsub-projects, and may require the
contracting o f external expertise. Following screening, an Environmental Impact Assessment
(EIA) in line with the environmental classification o f the sub-borrowedsub-project will be
recommended. The sub-borrowers will be responsible for carrying out any environmental
analysis and for confirming that the proposed sub-projects comply with national environmental
guidelines, and for obtaining the necessary clearance from the appropriate licensing authorities.
Once the analysis i s performed and recommendations incorporated into the sub-project, the PFI
will appraise the proposed sub-loan package which would include, where appropriate, an
environmental mitigation plan. The implementation of the mitigation planwill be monitored by
the PFI. The overall review process will bemonitoredbythe Project Implementation Unit (PIU).

4.      All sub-borrowedsub-projects will follow the environmental review process presented
schematically below.

STEP 1: The sub-borrower prepares an initial sub-project concept.              Following informal
discussion with the PFI, in which the PFI alerts the sub-borrower o f its environmental
assessment requirements,the sub-borrower prepares Part A o f the environmental screening form
and includes this with the initial sub-project concept. At this time, it is the responsibility of the
sub-borrower to initiate discussions with the local environmental authorities (LEA) in order to
fulfill any local and national environmental review requirements (such as investment incentive
certificate and/or other official approval/permits). It will be the responsibility o f the
sub-borrower to obtain the appropriate permits and licenses as required by national law in order
to facilitate the clearance process with the local LEA. These requirements are considered
separate, but parallel, to those presented here and satisfying them is the responsibility o f the
sub-borrower.




                                                66

STEP 2: The PFI screens the sub-project and informs the sub-borrower o fthe EIA category prior
to appraisal and subsequent follow-up requirements for sub-loan processing.
STEP 3: The sub-borrower, or its consultants, submits the environmental analysis (ifapplicable).
The sub-borrower will obtain a positive EIA report, given by the relevant LEA, in conformity
with applicable EnvironmentalRegulations for the activities listedinCategories I1and 111.
STEP 4: The PFI reviews the environmental analysis that has been submitted and reports its
findings to the sub-borrower. The PFI provides its clearance once the analysis is judged to be
satisfactory.

sub-project design and implementationplan, including associated estimated costs.
STEP 6: The sub-borrower finalizes the sub-loan application package, including the relevant
environmental documentation, and submits it to the PFIfor its appraisal.
STEP 7: The sub-loan becomes effective upon verification o f the LEA approval and clearance,
which can be obtained at any step inthe sub-project preparationcycle.
STEP 8: The sub-borrower submits the clearance letter o fthe LEA to the PFI.
STEP 9: The PFImonitors the implementation o f the EIA mitigation plan and informs the PIU.

5.       Prior and Post-Review-IBRD/PIU. Environmental evaluations andreview procedures
will be subject to ad-hoc review by the PIU and IBRD supervision missions. The review o f
evaluations will ensure that: the work was o f satisfactory quality, community participation took
place when appropriate, the appropriate recommendations were made, all documentation was
properly filed and recorded, and that the conditions o f approval by the local LEA were met.
DuringEFILI1implementation, IBRDmissions will supervise the overall screening process and
implementation o f environmental recommendations for selected sub-bon-owershub-projects.
The IBRD supervision team will also review, ad-hoc, environmental documentation. Therefore,
all this documentation shouldbe kept on file with the PFIs and forwarded to the PIU as needed.
