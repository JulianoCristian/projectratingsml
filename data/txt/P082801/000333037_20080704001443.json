"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Second Export Finance\n            Intermediation Loan Project for Turkey were as follows:\n            outcomes were highly satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was highly\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also highly\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: onerous\n            environmental, procurement, and other project requirements\n            tend to lead to funds being allocated to larger businesses\n            rather than reaching those that need them most. The fixed\n            costs incurred by these requirements make it relatively more\n            attractive for Participating Financial Intermediaries (PFIs)\n            to lend the loan funds to larger customers with greater loan\n            sizes. PFIs indicated that project requirements made it\n            uneconomical to cater to the smallest borrowers. For leasing\n            companies, loan sizes under the project were roughly twice\n            what they were for the leasing companies' entire\n            portfolio indicating that bigger firms are targeted in the\n            project. Reevaluating safeguard requirements in the context\n            of credit lines and carefully designing information\n            requirements to minimize compliance costs while serving the\n            safeguard objectives will help ensure successful\n            implementation and better achievement of the development\n            objectives. During the project, loan funds for two banks in\n            the project became uncompetitive and prompt reallocation to\n            other PFIs ensured that the overall project was not delayed\n            as a result."}, "docdt": "2008-01-04T00:00:00Z"}
