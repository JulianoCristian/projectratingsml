1.  Country and Sector Background 
 
Recent Macroeconomic Developments and their Impact on the Turkish Export Sector
.  
A combination of natural disasters and macroeconomic volatility in Turkey during the 1999-
2002 period created an unfavorable and uncertain environment for exporting companies.  In 
1999, the massive destruction resulting from earthquakes impeded domestic production and led 
to a contraction in domestic demand.  In 2000, the Government’s IMF-backed stabilization 
program initially led to an expansion in imports and a contraction in exports (Figure 1).  The 
current account worsened quickly, in part due to the anchoring of the exchange rate which 
eroded Turkey’s competitiveness (Figure 2), but also as a result of an increase in oil prices and 
US$/Euro exchange rate developments which favored importers.

The worsening fiscal and current account performance generated pressures on the fixed 
exchange rate system, and in combination with longstanding underlying structural banking sector 
problems triggered banking crises in November 2000 and February 2001.  In February 2001, the 
fixed exchange rate regime collapsed. The Turkish Lira was allowed to float and depreciated 
sharply, improving the competitiveness of Turkish exports (Figure 2).  Many banks and local 
businesses were caught up in foreign exchange short positions and suffered significant losses. 
The magnitude and frequency of exchange rate fluctuations in the period immediately following 
the start of the floating exchange rate regime added to business uncertainty.  Besides Forex 
mismatches, maturity mismatches between assets and liabilities of many banks added to the 
banking sector’s distress. Non-performing loans increased, and it became increasingly difficult 
for many firms to finance their operations. Domestic demand dried up and the economy shrank 
significantly during 2001.  
 
For a large number of companies, especially for those with limited export sales, 2001 was 
a period where they had to overcome difficulties in meeting working capital financing 
requirements and generating sufficient funds to maintain profitability and a sustainable financial 
structure in a shrinking economy, and uncertain macroeconomic and political environment. 
However, the depreciation of the currency in 2001 did create incentives for exporting activities, 
and some businesses could benefit from the price advantage. Firms, which could continue to 
produce, and which faced a rather price-elastic international demand, increased their export 
performance substantially, as some of the EFIL beneficiaries were able to.

Export Credits (US$ million)
Total Bank Credits (US$ million)
In early 2002, economic recovery started and continued throughout that year and during 
the first half of 2003. GNP growth reached 7.8 percent in 2002, due among other factors to the 
strong growth in exports and tourism revenues following the 2001 exchange rate adjustment. 
Export growth continued steadily throughout 2002-03, despite a subsequent appreciation of the 
real effective exchange rate reflecting increased confidence in the TL, due to a sharp fall in real 
private sector wages after the crisis. 
 
However, even though economic performance, mostly led by the export revival, 
continued to improve during the latter half of 2002 and the first half of 2003, the pick up in 
market sentiment has not led to any significant increase in the overall level of bank credits to the 
productive sectors (Figure 3). Although the banking sector was significantly restructured and 
strengthened in the aftermath of the crises, banks are still risk averse, and with real interest rates 
continuing to hover around 20-30%, the high level of government debt continues to crowd out 
private sector financing needs. While short term foreign currency bank financing is available to 
the best exporters at affordable US$-based interest rates, medium and long-term working capital 
and investment finance is still very scarce in Turkey. Lease finance – which often is an important 
source of longer-term investment finance for exporters in other countries - also has remained 
underdeveloped in Turkey, with the  growth in lease receivables highly volatile and dependent 
on macroeconomic performance. Both the banking and leasing sectors lack access to medium 
and long term funds, which provides the principal rationale for the Bank’s involvement and the 
EFIL II (see Annex 1 for a more detailed discussion).

2. Objectives 
 
One of the main benefits of the proposed project will be faster private sector recovery and job 
creation, supported by a healthier and more developed financial system.  In general, enterprise 
and financial sector performance is expected to continue to improve in the short and medium 
term. In the longer run, export growth supported by the proposed operation is expected to have 
an overall positive impact on poverty alleviation and private sector growth in Turkey. 
 
Traditionally, credit to the real sector has been crowded out over the years by the large and 
expanding demand for government borrowing. Even more so at this time, all firms, except blue 
chip firms or dedicated exporters, are facing a credit crunch. This is due to the after-effects of the 
banking crisis in 2001, which resulted in the  banks exercising increased caution in their lending 
operations after their re-capitalization in 2002, and the simultaneous decline in international 
syndicated lending to Turkish banks. The proposed project’s 
main objective
 is to follow through 
on the achievement of the predecessor EFIL project and continue to serve as a catalyst to support 
export and real sector growth in Turkey during the EFIL II implementation period (2004-2009), 
and beyond using the EFIL II reflows. To this end, the project will provide medium and long-
term working capital and investment finance to Turkish private exporting enterprises, at the time 
when the economy is showing strong signs of rebounding from a recent slump and export 
performance is on the rise—thus increasing the demand for longer term credit, while the 
financial sector is still unable to support these trends with very much needed longer term funds at 
a reasonable cost.  
 
The 
secondary objective
 of the loan is further improvement in the ability of the Turkish 
financial sector to provide financial resources to the enterprise sector, through further 
development of intermediation by private financial institutions, including banks and leasing 
companies. The project, through inclusion of leasing companies in addition to banks as PFIs, will 
enable the Bank to start a dialogue with the leasing sector in Turkey, provide an opportunity to 
gain more insight into the sector, and enable the Bank to support its development. It needs to be 
noted that the inclusion of leasing companies as financial intermediaries is an innovative aspect 
of the project, not previously used in World Bank credit line operations in the ECA Region. As 
such, it contains a degree of uncertainty in terms of the ability of the Turkish leasing sector to 
successfully absorb the funds available for intermediation, and channel them to eligible 
exporters. The Bank team has undertaken an initial assessment of the leasing sector, including 
determination of the sector’s size, main players, its legislative and regulatory foundation, and its 
operational aspects (accounting, client base, average volumes, cost of funds, etc.). Based on 
these initial findings, the team believes that selected leasing companies can become solid project 
counterparts with a strong operational experience and ability to successfully intermediate the 
EFIL II funds, mostly to smaller exporting companies typically not serviced by the banking 
system. 
 
 
3.  Rationale for Bank Involvement 
 
Following the recent financial crises and a subsequent downturn in the enterprise sector, the 
Government of Turkey has demonstrated, through its close collaboration with the Bank in 
Page  5
 
 
preparing the new Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), its commitment to policies and strategies 
intended to revitalize Turkey’s real sector, and export-oriented industries in particular.  The 
Government is also continuing its efforts to implement banking sector reforms in cooperation 
with the banking community, while trying to clearly convey the message that recovery from this 
deep crisis will be a long term process highly dependent on real sector recovery and growth.  
This, therefore, is one of the principle objectives of the Government for 2003 and beyond.   
 
The proposed project is consistent with the new draft FY03-05 CAS for the Republic of 
Turkey. As stated in the new CAS, an important part of the process of recovery from the crises 
will be revitalizing the real sector, which is currently suffering from a credit crunch as a result of 
the banks’ increased awareness of credit risks and tightened loan loss provisioning requirements 
in the wake of their re-capitalization, as well as a sharp post-crises decline in  syndicated lending 
by international banks to Turkish banks, reducing their foreign currency lending capacity. The 
CAS’s key priorities for the medium term include completing the banking and financial sector 
reforms and revitalizing the real sector by filling the current gap in accessing credit facilities, 
which will be also supported by this proposed project.  
 
The current credit squeeze is affecting both (i) the demand side, where even the most 
creditworthy private sector borrowers find it hard to tap international capital markets and are 
reverting back to domestic credit markets, with  the Government simultaneously experiencing 
similar difficulties in rolling over its existing foreign currency debt, and (ii) the supply side, 
where the domestic banking system is reducing both the volume and maturity of its real sector 
lending in response to the reduced volume and maturity of its own funding. Under these 
circumstances, the Turkish authorities have requested the Bank for an export credit line, which 
would be provided through the financial system and would support private sector exporters. The 
project team supports this request and believes a financial intermediary loan for exporters is a 
product of choice in the current circumstances (primarily a very thin supply of longer-term 
funds) facing Turkish financial intermediaries and private enterprises - large, medium, and small 
alike. The success of the predecessor EFIL project provides a good basis for such positive 
consideration.  
 
The proposed EFIL II project will substantially maintain the design of its predecessor EFIL 
project. Even before its formal closure, the first EFIL has proved to be a successful project, as it 
provided a timely and focused response to the unmet demand from banks and exporting 
companies for medium- and long-term funding, both during the pre- and post-crisis periods. The 
EFIL credit line was almost fully disbursed by the closing date of end-August 2003. With 
interest rate levels on Turkish Lira loans remaining prohibitively high, and loan maturities very 
short, demand for affordable longer-term funds from the real and financial sectors in Turkey 
remains strong. The Government’s request for a successor EFIL II credit line for exporters is 
thus well justified and timely. The project will support the current upward momentum in export 
performance and, by extension, in general economic improvement.

4. Description 
 
The proposed EFIL II project will substantially maintain the design of its predecessor EFIL 
project that has been successfully implemented during FY99-04. The credit line will be provided 
to TSKB, with a government guarantee, while TSKB will pass it on in the form of subsidiary 
finance to participating financial intermediaries for further on-lending to eligible private 
exporters. The credit line for exporters will be the only component of the EFIL II, and will 
provide the medium and long-term funds to exporters through two distinct channels, or sub-
components: (i) US$200 million through commercial banks in the form of investment or  
working capital loans, and (ii) US$100 million through leasing companies in the form of lease 
finance for acquisition of productive assets (equipment and machinery).

6. Implementation 
 
TSKB, a non-deposit taking private investment & development bank owned by local 
commercial banks and business groups, will be the borrower and the implementation agency for 
the project. A separate project implementation unit (PIU) has been established by TSKB under 
the supervision of one of its executive vice presidents to oversee the implementation of EFIL II. 
The PIU is staffed with experienced management and staff, and, as the primary project 
counterpart for the Bank team, will provide the overall administration of all aspects of the credit 
line and required reporting to the Bank.  
 
 
7. Sustainability 
 
 
Turkey's past export growth record, as well as the World Bank's own past experience 
with credit line operations in Turkey, the first EFIL being the most recent one, indicate that the 
private enterprise sector has the technical and managerial ability to successfully tap export 
opportunities, provided they have access to appropriate financing (e.g., in terms of pricing and 
maturity). Thus, expansion of existing and new export operations that will be financed by the 
funding to be provided by the proposed EFIL II have a very high likelihood of self-sustainability. 
 
 
Additionally, continued use by participating banks of high-quality loan and sub-
borrower analysis requirements under EFIL II, as well as the development of the leasing industry 
as an important source of longer-term investment finance for smaller exporters, will contribute to 
Page  7
 
 
strengthening the overall intermediation capacity of the financial system, which is likely to 
sustain beyond the closing date of EFIL. 
 
 
Finally, by using TSKB - an established investment & development bank - as the 
Borrower and Implementing Agency for the project, TSKB’s wholesale lending function, already 
well established today, is likely to become more sophisticated, and therefore more effective in 
future in intermediating international bilateral and multilateral funding from a multitude of 
sources, to the benefit of the overall Turkish private sector.  
 
 
8.  Lessons Learned from Past Operations in the Country/Sector 
 
The main lesson learned during the last few years from Bank credit line operations in the 
ECA Region and elsewhere is that the project design should be kept as flexible as possible, with 
a minimum number of, or no statutory requirements; e.g. avoiding constraints like minimum sub-
loan size, maturity, currency denomination, sub-borrower co-financing requirements, sectoral 
lending focus, etc., but using sensible financial indicators for the selection of both the PFIs and 
the sub-borrowers/sub-projects in line with established market practices. Restrictive procurement 
requirements unsuitable for private sector borrowers, and the World Bank’s previous currency 
pool loan features have also proven to be a hindrance to expeditious project implementation, and 
wherever commercial practices and SCLs were used, these factors ceased to be a bottleneck. 
Another important lesson learned has been that the most successful formula for high quality and 
expeditious project implementation is to combine the Borrower and Implementing Agency 
functions in one and the same entity if possible. Finally, pre-committing financial intermediaries 
to borrowing a certain part of a credit line (which involves paying a commitment fee on the pre-
committed amount) provides a strong incentive to the intermediaries to be quick and effective in 
finding and financing eligible sub-projects, and leads to quicker disbursement of the Bank loan. 
 
Lessons Learned from Previous Credit Line Operations in Turkey:
 The Implementation 
Completion Reports (ICRs) for the previous World Bank credit line operations in Turkey 
indicate that some of these operations had to be restructured in mid-stream because the initial 
project design turned out to be too inflexible (e.g., too many requirements in terms of minimum 
sub-loan size, sub-loan maturity, sub-borrower cofinancing requirements, etc.). The ICRs 
indicate that, after restructuring, project implementation generally proceeded well. 
1.  The proposed project design incorporates all of these lessons learned by using TSKB as the 
borrower and implementing agency for the loan, by the use of a clear, market-based set of 
eligibility criteria for PFIs, sub-borrowers and sub-projects, by the use of SCL terms and suitable 
private sector procurement practices, and also by use of pre-commitment of the PFIs to a certain 
part of the credit line.
