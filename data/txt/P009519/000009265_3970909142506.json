Some lessons learned included: stakeholders\n            (including beneficiaries) should be involved from the\n            identification stage of the project. Mechanisms for cost\n            recovery and/or sharing should be agreed with all concerned\n            during project preparation. The beneficiaries of the\n            floodplain component should have been made aware of cost\n            recovery from the start. In fact, they should have been\n            involved in developing mechanisms for progressively taking\n            over operation and maintenance (O&M) responsibilities\n            and designing required cost recovery arrangements.\n            Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are more effective\n            than public sector agencies in motivation and formation of\n            beneficiary groups. Involvement of NGOs, particularly local\n            NGOs, for the floodplain component generally proved to be a\n            very effective way of mobilizing and organizing the\n            beneficiaries into groups to help them take advantage of\n            increased value of a common property resource. Untested\n            concepts, such as stocking open water bodies and other\n            fisheries programs, should be tried out first at a pilot level."}, "docdt": "1997-06-12T00:00:00Z"}
