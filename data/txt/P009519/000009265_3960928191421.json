support a sectoral development process aimed at : a)\n            increasing incomes and fish production for domestic\n            consumption and export; b) supporting the fisheries\n            development program in the west, with emphasis on private\n            sector participation; c) accelerating the expanison of fish\n            production in floodplains; and d) strengthening sectoral\n            institutions. The project has 6 components : 1) floodplain\n            fisheries, involving stocking 100,000 ha of floodplains; b)\n            coastal shrimp culture, making improvements in public\n            infrastructure on 13,000 ha of poldered land already under\n            shrimp culture; c) other fisheries; d) institutional\n            support, including financing facilities and incremental\n            operational costs of DOF and BWDB related to the above\n            investments; e) research related to the project; and f)\n            technical assistance for project management and for\n            technical and social support."}, "docdt": "1990-05-02T00:00:00Z"}
