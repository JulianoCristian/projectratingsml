MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INrERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CPEDIT TO
THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH
FOR A THIRD FISHERIES PROJECT
1.      The following memorandum and recommendations on a proposed development
credit to the People's Republic of Bangladesh for SDR 34,6 million (US$44.6
million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on
standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years, and help finance a Third
Fisheries Project. Parallel grant financing for the project would be provided
by the Government of the United Kingdom througb the Overseas Development
Administration (ODA) for technical assistance and training in project management
(US$4.3 million equivalent) and by the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP) for technical and social project support (US$4.2 million equivalent).
2.      Background.   With a per capita income of US$170, Bangladesh remains one
of the poorest countries of the world and over 70? of its population of 110
million continues to live in absolute poverty. Fisheries is important because
of its contribution to income, employment, nutrition and foreign exchange
earnings. Although the fisheries sector generates oniy about 3.5? of total GDP,
it employs about 1.5 million full-time professional fishermen, or 5? of the
country's labour force, and about 11 million part-time fishermen. Women are
increasingly active in fisheries. As population has grown faster than fish
production, per capita consumption of fish has decreased from 11.7 kg in FY72 to
7.5 kg in FY88. Nevertheless, fish remains an integral part of the traditional
diet, providing most of the animal protein in the basic diet, particularly among
the low-income group. Seafood exports earned about US$140 million in FY89, or
11Z of total export earnings. Shrimp represented about 851 of these exports.
3.      Fish production declined between FY72 and FY80, from 824,000 tons to
646,000 tons, due to over-exploitation of fish resources and the adverse effect
of flood control structures on fish habitat. The de:line occurred primarily in
rivers and floodplains which together provide over 50Z of all fish landings and
over 701 of the inland fish catch. Production began to pick up again during the
1980s as a result of increased coastal fishing and increases in fish and shrimp
grown in ponds and was about 825,000 tons in FY89. Domestic.demand for fish is
expected to increase considerably with population growth. Fish marketing is
almost exclusively in the private sector; it is competitive and reasonably
efficient, and can handle increased volume.
4.      The Government of Bangladesh (GOB) gives high priority to fish and
shrimp production for consumption, income improvement and export. The country
has a vast potential for increasing fish and shrimp production. As coastal fish
resources are exploited to their maximum level, future production increases must
come from inland fisheries. Substantial production increases can be achieved by
introducing aquaculture techniques into the country's inland floodplains and by
intensifying shrimp culture. Government has requested, and IDA agreed, that
future IDA lending to the fisheries sector would concentrate on the western part
of the country and the Asian Development Bank on the eastern part.
5.      Simple stocking of suitable floodplains with fish fingerlings of
selected species can increase present yields of 100 kglha by about 300 kg/ha.
Areas suitable for such measures total some 1.3 million ha in the country and
600,000 ha in the project area. The actual and potential production differ
because fish stocks are depleted and their species composition is unbalanced



- 2-
because of over-fishing and infrastructure development which interferes with the
symbiotic exchange between rivers and floodplains. Artificial stocking improves
the composition and densities of the fish population, and conversion of the
abundant aquatic mi.cro-organisms and phytoplankton is made more efficient. The
project is designed to apply this technology on a broader scale and generate
management approaches that can be replicated.
6.      Shrimp culture will remain profitable because of the country's
compa.ative advantage in producing shrimp; the advantage is based on available
cheap natural food for shrimp, low-cost water on extensive areas within the
tidal range of saline water and cheap labour. Present shrimp production is of
low intensity with yields averaging about 100 kglha of exportable shrimp.
Because of deficient water supply and drainage infrastructure it reaches only
about one third of yields achievable with available natural food.  The project
will intensify production through construction of infrastructure for improved
water supply and drainage.
7.      Although the fisheries sector has great developament potential, its
public sector institutions are weak. The fisheries administration suffers from
common deficiencies such as lack of staff accountability and motivation, partly
because of low salaries. Development activities suffer from poorly formulated
policies and programs; programs often neglect the private sector which catches
most of the fish and shrimp, produces 95Z of the fish seed and plays a major
role in disseminating technology. Development activities also suffer from weak
procurement and delegation of authority to field staff. The major structural
problem of the Department of Fisheries (DOF) is the dichotomy between the large
but under-funded staff working under the GOB revenue budget and the smaller,
well-funded and donor-supported staff handling development projects. NGOs are
active in the fisheries sector and can be employed advantageously in fisheries
projects for undertaking socio-economic surveys, handling extension and farmer
organization and assisting the disadvantaged.
8.      Rationale for IDA Involvement.  IDA projects and sector work have
contributed significantly to fisheries development in Bangladesh. IDA
involvement began in the mid-1970s with a fishery component in a flood control
and irrigation project (Cr. 605-BD). The FY79 Oxbow Lakes Fisheries Project
(Cr. 890-BD) demonstrated the viability of stocking large water bodies. The
Shrimp Culture Project (Cr. 1651-BD) has operated from FY86. IDA's projects
faced substantial institutional constraints, but with close monitoring they have
proceeded satisfactorily. The main lessons learned from these projects were
that stocking large water bodies and improvements in shrimp culture through
infrastructure development are viable and that future projects needed to address
institutional issues; these lessons have been incorporated into the project.
9.      IDA reviewed the fisheries sector in FY83.  The report summarizing the
review findings drew GOB's attention to inland fisheries development and the
institutional problems of the fisheries administration.  In 1985, a report on
DOF's institutional strengthening intensified IDA's dialogue with GOB on the
fisheries sector. A new IDA review of the fisheries sector is at an advanced
stage. It is due for completion in FY90 and stresses the need for accelerated
fisheries development. The preliminary findings of this review have been taken
into account in the design of the project.
10.      The rationale for continued IDA involvement rests on three arguments.
First, fisheries development is a priority in the GOB's development program and



in IDA's lending strategy because of its high potential for growth and poverty
alleviation. Second, IDA has developed experience and a capability to assist
the sector's development through projects and sector work; the time has come to
accelerate investments on a larger scale, using the experience gained from the
past studies and smaller projects. Third, IDA is a major source of funding and
plays an important role in mobilizing donor resources; its interest in the
sector is likely to help reverse a past trend of stagnation and decline.
11.     Project Obiectives.   The proposed project is designed to support a
sectoral development process aimed at: (a) increasing incomes, particularly of
the poor, and fish production for domestic consumption and export; (b)
supporting GOB's fisheries development program in the western part of the
country with emphasis on private sector participation; (c) accelerating the
expansion of fish production in floodplains; and td) strengthening sectoral
institutions.
12.     Project Description.   The proposed project, which builds on work
undartaken under earlier projects, is designed to be the first of a series of
sector-wide fisheries projects planned for IDA support in the western part of
the country. The project would, within agreed criteria, support all types of
viable fisheries development activities. The project has six components: (a)
floodplain fisheries; (b) coastal shrimp culture; (c) other fisheries; (d)
institutional support; (e) research ; and (f) technical assistance. The
floodplain fisheries component would stock major floodplains with fingerlings
procured from the private sector; the area stocked increases to about 100,000 ha
in project year five and six. The coastal shrimp culture component would
improve water control infrastructure on about 13,000 ha of poldered land already
under shrimp culture. The other fisheries component includes 55 finance
packages for Upazila- and District-level programs of intensified study and
extension activities; among others, the packages will assist in developing
fisheries in freshwater fish and shrimp ponds, minor floodplains and riverine
waters and in supporting women involved in fisheries. The institutional support
component would provide incremental facilities, operating costs and staff of
DOF, Upazila fishery offices and Bangladesh Water Development Board. The
research component would provide funds to the Fisheries Research Institute to
carry out applied research related to the project. Technical Assistance
includes two packages -- one for project management and one for technical and
social support. The project would be carried out over a period of six years.
It provides funds for fingerlings, civil works, incremental staff and operation
costs, local and expatriate services, equipment and vehicles. The pi ject's
total cost is estimated at US$62.7 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange
component of US$15.8 million (25 Z). A breakdown of costs and the financing
plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and
disbursements, and the disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in
Bangladesh are given in schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also
attached. The staff appraisal report, No 8392-BD, dated May 2. 1990, is being
distributed separately.
13.     Agreed Actions.   The Government has agreed on the following actions:
(a) observation of agreed selection criteria for small scale project activities;
(b) submission for IDA clearance of plans for improvements in training
institutes, certain administrative units and a research station; (c) dated
transfer to the project of staff of the Shrimp Culture Project in Khulna
Division; (d) dated formation of an inter-ministerial committee on divestment of



- 4-
hatcheries, release of policy statements on and divestment of public hatcheries;
(e) dated creation of units and staffing in the Department of Fisheries
according to plans satisfactory to IDA; (f) dated transfer of one hatchery from
the Department of Fisheries to the Bangladesh Fisheries Research Institute; (g)
provision of adequate office space to technical assistance staff; (h)
implementation and improvement of a dated cost recovery program in shrimp
culture: (i) presentation of a draft policy paper on cost recovery in
floodplains and implementation of the policy agreed with IDA; and (j)
establishment of an inter-ministerial committee on cost recovery. Credit
effectiveness conditions would be (a) allocation of adequate runds in the FY91
Annual Development Program; (b) creation of four inter-departmental coordinating
committees; (c) appointment or designation of the project's key personnel; and
(d) effectiveness of the co-financing agreements between GOB and ODA, and
between GOB and UNDP.  The submission of a staffing plan satisfactory to IDA               t
will be a condition of disbursement for incremental staff aud operating costs.
14.     Benefits.  The project will result in ircremental annual production of
about 42,000 tons of fish and about 1,800 tons of exportable shrimp. This will
result in increased incomes to about 130,000 families of professional and part-
time fishermen, shrimp farmers, pond owners, and nursery and hatchery operators.
The exportation of shrimp will generate annual foreign exchange earnings of
close to US$ 8.3 million. Additional benefits include: (a) the development of
managerial routines for exploiting unused flood '.ains; (b) a revitalized
fisheries administration; (c) improvements in s,.ctoral policies; (d) further
mobilization of the private fish seed enterprises; (e) increased services to
special groups, particularly women, through the creation of special service
points within the fisheries administration; and (f) improvements in income
distribution. The project redresses eavironmental problems created earlier; in
floodplains, depletion of fish stocks caused by over-fishing and obstruction of
fish migration is met by artificial stocking and, in coastal shrimp culture,
conflicts between shrimp culture and agriculture are aidressed thr' 1gh improved
water exchange and farmer participation.  The project's economic   .e of return
is estimated at 312 and its environmental assessment rating is B
15.          Risks.  The main project risks are (a) delayed or inadequate
implementation which may arise from management failures which is addressed
through the provision of substantial technical assistance and rel.z-nce on the
private sector reduce these risks; (b) lower-than-planned fish retrieval rates
as well as disease and seasonal glutting of markets; however, analysis indicates
that these are not likely to reach critical levels; and (c) unsustainable public
stocking operations, if GOB would not be able to sustain financing and recover
the cost of stocking; intensive monitoring and studies enable viable cost
recovery policy and appropriate legal undertakings minimize that risk.
16.          Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
