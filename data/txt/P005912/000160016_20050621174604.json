AND\n            EMPLOYMENT PROJECT", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Project ratings are as follows: Project\n            outcome is moderately unsatisfactory; sustainability is\n            likely; institutional development impact is modest; Bank\n            performance is unsatisfactory; and Borrower performance is\n            unsatisfactory.   Experience with the assessed project\n            confirms a number of OED lessons from the\n            vocational-technical education sub-sector: 1)  The\n            establishment of functional training facilities is necessary\n            but insufficient for producing skilled workers.  Publicly\n            financed vocational training centers are only viable when\n            the government and the private sector establish a joint and\n            effective strategic framework that sets priorities and\n            allocates resources to those priorities.2)  Many vocational\n            training facilities were built when the Bank's strategy\n            was oriented toward that sub-sector. Because o f the expense\n            involved in technological renewal, it may be cheaper to\n            abandon or rebuild some facilities than to rehabilitate\n            them. However, it may be wise for the Bank to reinvest\n            periodically in the renewal o f older facilities in order to\n            extend the life o f earlier investments. 3)  Governments may\n            view vocational training as a means o f helping school\n            dropouts get jobs and alleviate their poverty. However,\n            vocational training centers may select the better-educated\n            students who are ultimately less likely to perform the type\n            o f tasks for which they were trained. Admission criteria\n            might be adapted to suit the needs o f less educated\n            persons, who may have limited training opportunities. 4)  A\n            series o f shorter vocational courses taught in the evenings\n            or weekends may be more suitable to the work schedules o f\n            the poor. 5)  For vocational education projects to succeed,\n            potential trainees and the private sector must be consulted\n            on project components, outcomes, and targets. A dialogue\n            held exclusively with governments risks creating projects\n            for which there is relatively limited demand and commitment.\n            6) The complexities of projects must match implementation\n            capacity. 7)  Management information systems and tracer\n            studies are important tools to monitor the needs of\n            beneficiaries. These activities must be given priority in\n            programming project activities."}, "docdt": "2005-06-14T00:00:00Z"}
