SCHEDULE 1
Description of Technical Assistance
The objective of the Technical Assistance is to assist the Recipient in the 
preparation of a proposed vocational training project which would strengthen the 
Recipient's capacity to train skilled manpower. This would be achieved by enhancing 
the quality and expanding the provision of Vocational Training (VT) with special 
attention to female employment and training; strength-ening sector management and 
financing in close cooperation with private enter-prises and local authorities; and 
developing the institutional capacity to plan, manage and coordinate policy and 
programs.
The Technical Assistance consists of the following parts, subject to such 
modifications thereof as the Recipient and the Administrator may agree upon from time 
to time to achieve the objective of the Technical Assistance:
Provision of Technical Assistance to: (a) delineate the role and functions of 
the Vocational Training Corporation (VTC) in coordinating and managing VT in close 
cooperation with industry; (b) assess existing and future skilled manpower needs by 
major occupa-tional categories; (c) prepare a phased program for expansion of VT with 
special attention to training of women in appropriate occupa-tions; and (d) develop a 
detailed proposal for quality improvement of VT programs, including new initiatives in 
the areas of instructor training, curriculum development, skill assessment, 
cooperation with industry and physical facilities.
(1)
Workshops. Carrying out workshops and national and regional studies, including a 
review of the VT system and of labor market needs. Workshops will include one national 
workshop for the femal labor force and six local workshops held in major towns: 
workshops would be expected to help prepare strategies for improving the quality of 
VT, and would also include employer participation
(2)
National Policy for VT. The Technical Assistance would assist the Project 
Preparation Working Group with elements of the new policy framework for VT. A Cost and 
Financing Specialist would review the unit costs of training, the rationale for 
subsidies currently given to each student, sources of funding for the VT system, and 
prospects for financing it in cooperation with industry. A Skills Assessment and 
Certification Specialist would help prepare a policy framework for establishing skills 
standards for trained manpower that are relevant to local conditions, together with a 
detailed plan to introduce skills certification. A Management Information System (MIS) 
Specialist would help design a MIS that would support policy decision-making on the 
development of skilled manpower in line with existing and emerging needs.
(3)
Management of VT. Recommendations will be made con-cerning measures to alleviate 
the currently fragmented management of the VT system and make proposals for improved 
cooperation with industry in system manage-ment. An Industry/School Interaction 
Specialist would work with the private sector to develop specific recommen-dations for 
participation of industry in skilled manpower training: the specialist would also make 
recommendations for strengthening the VTC's capacity to manage training provided by 
Ministries and agen-cies, and would design an appropriate organizational structure for 
administration of the system. A VT Management Specialist would develop norms and 
stan-dards for facilities, teacher qualifications, and the extent of functional 
autonomy to be devolved to VT centers.
Page  8
(4)
Labor-Market Needs Assessment. Studies would be con-ducted that are designed to 
improve the relevance of VT to labor market needs. A Needs Assessment Special-ist 
would study labor market needs in the Recipient -- both national and for selected 
regions -- identifying pro- files of skilled manpower and estimat-ing present and 
future demands for skilled manpower by major occupa- tional categories; the study 
would pay special attention to identifying culturally acceptable employ-ment oppor- 
tunities for women. A Labor Market Special-ist would review the Recipient's policies 
and regu-latory mechanisms concerning wages and employment. Both stud-ies would be 
conducted in cooperation with chambers of commerce and industries.
(5)
Quality Improvement in VT. Quality enhancement initia-tives would be identified 
for incorporation into VT programs, by specialists in Curriculum, Equipment and 
Facilities, and Teacher Training. These specialists' scope of work would include: (i) 
curriculum develop-ment, competency assessment, and strategies for pro-gram delivery 
to improve productivity among existing labor force participants as well as new 
entrants; (ii) evaluation of the learning resources needed for im-proving quality, and 
preparation of a plan to procure them locally; assessment of equipment and furniture 
needs for refurbishing existing facilities and equip-ping new ones; determination of 
technical assistance requirements; and delineation of the role of industry in 
enhancing the quality of VT; and (iii) design of pre- and in-service training for VT 
instructor train-ing, including a phased plan for implementing the instructor training 
program.
