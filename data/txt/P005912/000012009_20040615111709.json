A number of\n            lessons are summarized as follows. First addressed, is the\n            need to secure private sector participation amidst major\n            reforms, through specific project activities to engage the\n            private sector in the governance and financing of the\n            sector, which requires technical assistance, and incentives\n            to promote its participation. Furthermore, in the context of\n            weak implementation capacity, sequencing of reforms is\n            paramount, which should be addressed in project design,\n            prioritizing issues as agreed by the Government and\n            stakeholders. This project design should have focused on\n            major labor market needs, in this case, agriculture,\n            commerce, and trade skills. The apparent lack of government\n            commitment weakened project outcomes; instead, ensuring\n            commitment to strengthen financial management, to\n            counterpart funding, and to play a substantial role in\n            ensuring private sector involvement, would have resulted in\n            satisfactory outcomes. This would have fostered relevant\n            cofinancing, efficient vocational training financing, and\n            realistic goals for institutional reforms."}, "docdt": "2004-06-02T00:00:00Z"}
