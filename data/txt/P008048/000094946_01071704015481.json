Lessons address: 1) on the technical\n            aspect, the integrated health services model represents a\n            major contribution to health reform, for the operational\n            side of preventive integrated care, and the Ministry of\n            Health should ensure the strengthening of central, and\n            regional planning capability, with special attention on\n            morbidity, and mortality reductions. Promotion of health,\n            and nutrition practices still require substantial\n            development, while social marketing of health services,\n            should focus on a larger role within information, education\n            and communication programs, including community health work,\n            within an organized supportive system. Similarly, local\n            nongovernmental organizations can play a supporting role to\n            the health sector by strengthening community health, and,\n            training should be relevant to public sector management;\n            and, 2) on the implementation aspect, sustainability\n            planning should be strengthened, with more regional\n            decision-making in project design; greater focus on\n            strengthening regional management capacity is needed; and,\n            legal approvals for operating under a pilot project\n            framework should be enacted. Although implementation\n            contracting (third-party) was effective, rigid terms of\n            reference caused pitfalls; rather, a team of specialists\n            could be contracted at a set price, with specific products,\n            negotiated as needed."}, "docdt": "2001-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
