To this end the  project\n            will include the first phase (2 x 30 MW gas turbines) of a\n            90 MW combined-cycle power station at Bintulu and 185 km of\n            double-circuit 275 kV transmission line from Bintulu to\n            Simbu with associated substations inluding a regional load\n            dispatch centre at Bintulu. The loan will also provide\n            consulting services for engineering in the power station,\n            transmission line and substations and architectural\n            engineering for minor civil works. Finally a gas utilization\n            study, upgrading of SESCO's (Sarawak Electricity Supply\n            Corporation) system planning and design capabilities and\n            strengthening of accounting and office practices will also\n            be financed."}, "docdt": "1988-04-28T00:00:00Z"}
