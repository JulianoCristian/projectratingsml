MEMORAND'JM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCrION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED %.OAN
TO SARAWAK ELECTRICITY SUPPLY CORPORAIION FOR A SARAWAK POWER PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
Sarawak Electricity Supply Corporation with the guarantee of Malaysia for
US$56 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would
be extended on Bank's standard variable interest rate with 15 years maturity
including 3 years of grace and would help finance a power generation and
transmission project.
2.       Background.  The Fifth Development Plan prepared by the Government in
L984-85 proposed a diversification strategy in the energy sector through a
"Four Fuel Policy', basing future development on a mix of oil, gas, hydro and
coal. This strategy translated into plans to: (a) construct the 2,400 MW
Bakun hydroelectric project costing about US$6 billion; (b) utilize imported
coal to supply part of the energy requirements of the industrial sector and to
fuel 1,200 MW of new power plants at Port Klarg; and (c) develop gas resources
for power and industrial use by early 19qos. In 1986 the Bank was asked by
the Economic Planning Unit (EPU) to undertake a com)rehensive review of the
Malaysian power sector. The Bank's study (Report No 6466-MA) concluded that:
(a) the economic cost of gas would be only about US$1.32/MMCF, substantially
lower than earlier assumptions; (b) such low-cost gas would render the Bakun
hydro project and power plants burning imported coal economically unviable;
and (c) the least-cost power development during the next 15 years would
principally be the addition of gas-based generation. The sector study also
made recommendations on pricing of gas to the power sector. The Government
and concerned entities accepted the recommendations of the sector report and
took decisions to postpone the Bakun project and cancel plans for addition of
coal fired units at Port Klang. SESCO, which would have been the host utility
for the Bakun project, adopted the Bank's advice to extend its transmission
grid from Sibu to Bintulu and to base its generation expansion on natural gas
at Bintulu. SESCO also agreed to investigate the feasibility of utilizing gas
being flared at Miri to generate power for Sarawak and possibly also Sabah.
3.       Project Objective and Description.  This project aims at utilizing
Sarawak's natural gas resources to meet its electricity demands, to enhance
operational efficiency through system integration, and to strengthen the
institutional capabilities of SESCO in the areas of system planning,
engineering design and accounting. The project would consist of: (a) the
first stage (2 x 30 MW gas turbines) of a 90 MW combined cycle power plant in
Bintulu; (b) 185 km double circuit, 275 kV transmission line from Bintulu to
Sibu with the associated substations; (c) a load dispatch center in Bintulu;
(d) consulting services for engineering, architectural services and
accounting; and (e) upgrading of SESCO's capabilities in systems planning and
engineering design.

A.  Amounti. anid niwthods of procurement and disbursement and the disbursement

e'er,ts aind the stit.us of Bank operations in Malaysia are given in schedules c
and D respectlvely.  A map showing project locations is also attached.  The
statf appraisai Report No. 7082 is being distributed separately.
5.      'Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Pursuing the recommendations of the
Bank's bectcr report, Malaysia's power sector will be oriented towards utiliz-
ing natural ga; for electricity generation. A major challenge in this transi-
tion is the strengthening of the coordination role of the various government
agenzies and the activation of dialogue between the gas and power sectors to
ensure efficient allocation of resources. The Bank's input has been and will
le essential to: (a) assist the core entities such as the EPU, the Ministry cf
Energy and the Federal Treasury to play the needed coordinating roles; and
assist. the dialogue between the gas and the power entities on majo: issues
saRh as pricing of gas and timing of gas projects. In addition, this project
arising directly from the sector study places the Bank in a unique position to
contribute to the dialogue among the concerned parties and will assist in
strengthening the institutional capabilities of SESCO and improving its
operational efficiency.
tD.      Agreed Actions.  SESCO and PETRONAS have agreed on a price of
M$ -..//'21BTU of natural gas based on its economic :ost of production and
tranbmission.  This price would be applicable until the end of 1996.  The
,.rice escalation factor for the period beyond 1996 is presently being
discussed. However, at negotiations assurances were obtained that the basic
gas contract will be finalized by October 1988 prior to SESCO's entering into
commitments for purchase of equipment for the power plant and that the
G<vernment would ensure that sufficient gas at a reasonable price would be
available for the proposed plant. Agreements were also obtained from SESCO to
(i) implement an action plan to reduce its account receivables from 90 to 75
days by 1989 and 60 days by 1991; (ii) implement upon its completion the
recommendations of an ongoing study on the sources and magnitude of
distribution losses and the level of inventories; and (iii) prepare a program
to upgrade SESCO's systems planning capabilities and to train SESCO's staff in
account maintenance. The main financial covenants agreed upon are: (i) a rate
of return of not less than 8 p.a. on SESCO's revalued average net fixed
assets in operation; (ii) a debt/equity ratio of not greater than 60:40; and
(iii) a debt service coverage of not less than 1.3.
Justification and Risks.  Economic benefits that would result from
the project are: (a) energy cost savings through the substitution of low-cost
gas-based electricity for more costly energy sources; (b) capital cost savings
due to the integration of the SESCO grid with consequent reduction in reserve
capacity; and (c) improved resource allocation through utilization of the gas

resources of Sarawak. The project faces no substantial risk. The only risk
foreseen is that a delay in obtaining right of way for the transmission line
could postpone the full utilization of the power station. However, the
likelihood of this delay is small as there is some slack built into the
transmission line schedule. Further, the p:oject's rate of return is
sufficiently high to tolerate partial utilization of the power plant for up t,
two years.
8.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
