outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included:  consultation with the\n            stakeholders was a recipe for success. Indeed, as explained\n            above, reforms have been undertaken after a process of close\n            and continuous consultation with all stakeholders. This\n            ensured a clear understanding of the multiple issues at\n            stake from all parties involved (including representatives\n            of civil society) and also an adherence to the overarching\n            goals of the Development Policy Loan, or DPL. Ultimately, it\n            helped mitigate skepticism or even opposition to certain\n            reforms. The reforms engaged in the financial sector through\n            this program would not have been achieved without support\n            from all stakeholders. Clear objectives and realistic\n            development indicators are also critical to success. The DPL\n            contained achievable policy actions that were very focused\n            and easy to measure. Also, choosing only actions critical\n            for achieving results as conditions for disbursement proved\n            to be pertinent. The policy actions were maintained at a\n            modest number but with sufficient critical mass, focusing on\n            those that are considered crucial in improving household and\n            Small and Medium Enterprise, or SME access, strengthening\n            financial stability arrangements and developing capital markets."}, "docdt": "2012-09-27T00:00:00Z"}
