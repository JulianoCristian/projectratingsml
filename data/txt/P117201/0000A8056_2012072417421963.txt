                         Program Development Objectives
                         Program Development Objective (from Program Document)

                         While the financial system has grown significantly, access remains an issue and
                         new risks have emerged. The rapid growth of financial institutions in recent
                         years has contributed to Moroccos growth performance and expanded the frontiers
                         of finance. However, it is also apparent that, despite significant
                         improvements, the financial system is not yet providing services to large
                         segments of low income households and SMEs. Moreover, this rapid growth has
                         also generated new risks in the banking, insurance and microcredit sectors that
                         need to be effectively managed. The global financial crisis added importance to
                         further reforms.
                         The Government has launched a four pillar reform program that addresses
                         effectively the dual objectives of access and stability. The first pillar
                         contains measures that promote access to individuals while the second pillar
                         comprises measures to enhance access to small and medium enterprises. The third
                         pillar strengthens the resiliency of the financial system through further and
                         important improvements in financial regulation and supervision. The fourth
                         pillar, capital market development, contributes both to access and stability, by
                         promoting competition to banks, and introducing better instruments of risk

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Sustainable Access to Finance DPL is a two tranche operation approved by the Board in January 2010
                         All of the second tranche conditions covered by the Sustainable Access to Finance DPL have been fully met by August 2011. However, after a new Constitution was adopted and
                         elections were held in 2011, the new Government formed in early 2012 decided to send back all pending draft laws for Ministerial review to ensure they were consistent with the new

                         Constitution and governmental priorities. As a result, two disbursement conditions were no more met: the draft law setting up a new capital market authority the AMMC, (which the
                         Council of Government adopted again with some limited modifications on 19 April 2012) and that creating a new insurance and pension supervisory authority, the ACAPS (which
                         revised version has not yet been adopted by the Council of Government).
                         Additional actions have been initiated to promote further gains in access for individuals and SMEs while preserving financial stability
