The following\n            memorandum notes that all prior actions required for the\n            release of the second tranche have been met by the borrower\n            as outlined in the loan agreement. Compliance with all prior\n            actions was verified by World Bank supervision missions and\n            collection of supporting evidence. The memo describes the\n            macroeconomic policy framework of the Borrower, and ensures\n            that it is appropriate and is consistent with the objectives\n            of the program."}, "docdt": "2011-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
