           SUSTAINABLE ACCESS TO FINANCE DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN


Borrower              Kingdom of Morocco

                      Ministry o f Economy and Finance

                      IBRD loan in the amount of 133.1 million EUR (US $200 million
                      equivalent).
                      Two tranche Development Policy Loan. The first tranche (88.6 million
                      EUR) will be disbursed following Board approval, which will be
                      conditional on the realization o f specific reforms and the second tranche
                      (44.1 million EUR) upon the fulfillment o f a detailed set of measures.
Main Policy Areas        Individuals' access to finance
                         SME access to finance
                         Financial regulation and supervision
                         Capital market development

                           Progress in expanding access to households: increase in the number of
output/outcome             accounts, higher number o f consultations on households in the credit
indicators                 bureau and reduced non performing loans in the microcredit industry,
                       9   Increase in SME access to credit: higher number o f consultations on
                           enterprises in the credit bureau,
                           Progress in strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework:
                           higher average capital adequacy ratios in the banking system,
                           Progress in developing capital markets: improvements in the functioning
                           o f the government debt market (e.g. reduced number o f lines o f Treasury
                           bills).



                      While the financial system has grown significantly, access remains an issue
                      and new risks have emerged. The rapid growth o f financial institutions in
Contribution to CPS   recent years has contributed to Morocco's growth performance and
                      expanded the frontiers o f finance. However, it i s also apparent that, despite
                      significant improvements, the financial system i s not yet providing services
                      to large segments o f low income households and SMEs. Moreover, this
                      rapid growth has also generated new risks in the banking, insurance and
                      microcredit sectors that need to be effectively managed. The global
                      financial crisis added importance to further reforms.
                      The Government has launched a four pillar reform program that addresses
                      effectively the dual objectives of access and stability. The first pillar
                      contains measures that promote access to individuals while the second pillar
                      comprises measures to enhance access to small and medium enterprises.
                      The third pillar strengthens the resiliency of the financial system through
                      further and important improvements in financial regulation and supervision.
                      The fourth pillar, capital market development, contributes both to access
                      and stability, by promoting competition to banks, and introducing better
                      instruments o f risk management.
                      The Morocco CPS i s currently being finalized for presentation to the Board
                                               i
                             in January 2010. The Financial Sector DPL i s a key element o f the CPS
                             and contributes to the objectives o f the CPS pillar o f Growth,
                             Competitiveness and Employment by supporting (i) improvements in
                             financial intermediation to enhance competition and growth, (ii)increased
                             household and SME access to finance, and (iii) strengthened financial
                             regulation and supervision to ensure sustainable gains in access. In addition,
                             further enhancements o f corporate and bank governance are covered by the
                             DPL program which thus contributes to the cross-cutting objective of the
                             CPS as regards strengthening governance.
Risks and risk                0 In the short term, Morocco i s confronted with uncertainties on the timing

mitigation                       and speed o f the recovery from the global crisis. Risks are mitigated
                                through continued strong macroeconomic management and Morocco's
                                track record suggests that it i s well placed to face the current
                                 uncertainties.
                              0 A deterioration o f the credit portfolios of some institutions could

                                jeopardize expected improvements in access. Although non-performing
                                 loans seem to be leveling off in the microcredit industry, further
                                 deterioration cannot be ruled out. The Government has proved its
                                resolve to handle the situation and has taken measures to strengthen the
                                 capacity o f the microcredit institutions to grow in a sustainable way.
                                 Likewise, the slowdown o f non-agriculture output may put some stress
                                 in bank portfolios, but the government has also taken measures to
                                 strengthen the banks' solvency and their capacity to manage new risks.

                                development, may imply some increase in the reference rate for existing
                                floating rate mortgage holders. However, low income mortgage holders
                                only have fixed rate mortgages (floating rate mortgages are not eligible
                                to the housing subsidy scheme) and the impact would remain limited for
                                other households.
                              0 In the wake of the global crisis, some initiatives may be received with

                                more caution and text approval may prove more difficult (e.g. on
                                securitization or regulated future market). The Government i s addressing
                                this risk by proposing only simple and tested instruments which bring
                                clear benefits to the country, by setting up appropriate regulations to
                                reduce risks and by reaching out to all concerned parties.

      INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
     PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A SUSTAINABLE ACCESS TO FINANCE LOAN
                          TO THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO


                                I.     INTRODUCTION
1.      Morocco has made substantial progress in developing its financial sector.
The total assets o f Moroccan financial institutions have grown significantly and exceed
200 per cent o f GDP, a ratio that i s well above the level predicted by Morocco's per
capita income. This progress in financial development has been the result o f sound
macroeconomic policies and important financial sector reforms earlier in the decade,
which positioned Morocco to take advantage o f favorable conditions (e.g. abundant
liquidity and global economic growth). These financial reforms were supported by the
Bank through a Financial Sector Development Policy Loan in 2005, and included the
restructuring o f state-owned financial institutions, the strengthening o f the regulatory
framework and the improvement o f financial infrastructure.
2.      While the financial system has grown significantly, access remains
insufficient and new risks have emerged. The rapid growth o f financial institutions has
expanded the frontiers o f finance and contributed to Morocco's growth performance.
However, despite significant improvements, the financial system i s not yet providing
services to segments o f l o w income individuals and SMEs. Moreover, this rapid growth
has also generated new risks in the banking and insurance sectors that need to be
effectively managed. In the microcredit sector, an industry characterized by very l o w
default rates, the rapid growth combined with inadequate governance and risk
management resulted in portfolio problems. The global financial crisis added importance
to further reforms, for having produced a credit slowdown that typically affects the most
vulnerable sectors. Moreover, the global crisis has also shown the need to strengthen
financial infrastructure and regulation to ensure that further access gains are sustainable.
3.       The Government has launched a new financial reform program that
addresses effectively the dual objectives of access and stability. I t includes four
mutually reinforcing pillars which build on major improvements in the soundness and
risk management capacity o f financial institutions. The first pillar contains measures that
promote access to households while the second pillar comprises measures to enhance
access to small and medium enterprises. The launch o f a credit bureau and revised partial
credit guarantee mechanisms will allow further progress in access and improved risk
management. The third pillar strengthens the resiliency o f the financial system through
further improvements in financial regulation and supervision. I t will allow an early
identification o f risks and will avoid a repeat o f the difficulties experienced b y the
microcredit sector. The fourth pillar, capital market development, contributes both to
access and stability. I t promotes competition to banks which will encourage them to go
down market, and will make new information and instruments available therefore making
further gains in long term financing (e.g. mortgage loans or investment credits) possible.
4.      Against this background, the Government requested World Bank support to
its financial reform program through a Development Policy Loan. The proposed

                                             1
Sustainable Access to Finance Loan would contribute to Morocco's reform efforts, both
financially and technically. First, it would contribute to a balanced financing package,
helping the Government meet i t s larger borrowing requirements resulting from the global
crisis, while avoiding excessive pressures on the domestic financial market. Second, it
would support an important reform that will contribute to growth and poverty alleviation.
Third, it would allow the Bank to remain engaged in the design o f more challenging
reform components, contributing to their quality. Finally, the Moroccan reform provides
important lessons for other countries, for recognizing explicitly the need to combine the
objectives o f access and stability.
5.      Based on its program, the Government has requested a two tranche loan. The
program supported under the proposed operation would be implemented by the Ministry
o f Economy and Finance. As requested by the Government, the proposed operation is
undertaken in parallel to one from the African Development Bank; these two operations
are being structured in two tranches around a largely common policy matrix.

                A.      IMPRESSIVE MACROECONOMIC PERFORMANCE
                                   IN THE DECADE

6.     Morocco's economic performance improved significantly during the decade,
as indicated by higher and sustained output growth, falling unemployment, rising
investment ratios, and low inflation. As shown in Figure 1 and Table 1, economic
growth rates averaged 5.1 percent over the period 2001-08, almost twice as high as the
average o f the previous decade. Per capita income almost doubled over the decade to
reach US$2,850 in 2008. Growth became less volatile and less dependent on agriculture,
although the primary' sector s t i l l accounts for 15 percent o f GDP. Unemployment
declined from 14 to 9.6 percent. The investment rate increased sharply from 25 percent
o f GDP to more than 35 percent o f GDP, improving the prospects o f sustained strong
performance. Inflation remained subdued at 2 percent p.a. Finally, Morocco became
more integrated in the global economy, although the share o f trade i s s t i l l l o w (76 percent
o f GDP), and exports remain undiversified, revealing room for improvements.
7.      Morocco's improved performance was largely due to sound macroeconomic
policies and structural reforms. The Government ran fiscal deficits in the first half o f
the decade but was s t i l l able to reduce moderately the debt ratio from 67 to 62 percent o f
GDP. After 2005 the Government maintained very sound fiscal policies, as indicated by
budget surpluses in 2007 and 2008. These surpluses resulted in a steady decline in the
debt ratio to 47 percent o f GDP. Moreover, prudent public debt management entailed an
increasing share o f long-term issues and the increasing duration o f domestic debt.
Financial sector reforms entailed inter alia the restructuring o f state banks, stronger
financial regulation and supervision, and improved financial infrastructure. Furthermore,

the government deepened the integration into the world economy through the signing o f
free trade agreements and the adoption o f the advanced status program with the EU.'

                 B.       THE IMPACT OF THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS

8.      Morocco has not been spared from the effects o f the global financial crisis,
but has been able to manage its effects well and to preserve a reasonable growth
performance. Morocco, like all other emerging countries, suffered from the sharp
reduction in risk tolerance and the overall retrenchment o f capital flows. As shown in
Figure 2 depicting the impact o f the financial crisis in the world, following the collapse o f
Lehman Brothers in September 2008, stock prices fell, Credit Default Swap (CDS)
spreads increased and borrowing spreads increased as well. In Morocco, the movements
in prices and spreads were less pronounced than those in most other countries, reflecting
a sound macroeconomic management, but prices and spreads have not yet returned to the
pre-crisis levels. The current account o f the balance o f payments shifted into a deficit o f
                                                               due
about 5.4 percent o f GDP in 2008 (Figure 1 and Table l), to the impact o f the crisis
on workers' remittances and tourism, as well as the drop in exports. The poor export
performance reflects the contraction o f export markets, the l o w diversification o f exports
and an underlying problem o f lack o f competitiveness.
9.      The banking system has proved resilient to the crisis, but the rapid pace of
deposit mobilization decreased, leading to a slowdown o f lending activity. The direct
impact o f the crisis on Moroccan banks was very limited, as the banks did not hold toxic
assets and had not resorted to wholesale external resources to find their lending.
However, the fast growth o f deposits observed in previous years (driven largely b y
demand deposits) was interrupted, as shown in Figure 2. This is to some extent related to
the reduction in workers' remittances, tourism, and other external inflows in the same
period (Table 1). The banks eventually reduced the pace o f lending to contain the loan to
deposit ratio below 100 percent. The slowdown o f credit also reflects a decrease on the
demand side, driven by the slowdown o f non-agriculture output. In the MENA region, the
credit slowdown was somewhat sharper than the one in other non-GCC countries, as
Moroccan banks had been expanding faster, but milder than the one observed in GCC
countries, which were over-extended and directly affected.
 10.     The credit slowdown i s welcome, given the high growth o f the recent years
and the need for banks to adapt to a less liquid environment and tighten risk
management. Banks have financed infrastructure and housing, expanded finance to
MFIs, and expanded finance to SMEs as well, especially medium enterprises. However,
the fast credit growth has generated new risks that need to be addressed, including credit,
liquidity and interest rate risks. The Central Bank allowed credit growth to cool down
while implementing countercyclical policies in 2009 to prevent tensions. This included
lowering of reserve requirements in steps from 15 percent in December 2008 to 8 percent

  On the basis o f these achievements Morocco gained investment grade rating in 2007 from one rating
agency. Other agencies acknowledged Morocco's good macroeconomic management and performance,
while also indicating the need for further debt reductions, further export and output diversification, and
further decline in unemployment and poverty.

           in October 2009. At the same time, the Central Bank has also taken steps t o ensure the
           resiliency o f the banking system. This has included a first increase in minimum capital
           requirements from 8 to 10 percent in 2008. T h e Government's program includes further
           measures designed to ensure the resiliency o f the banking system (Section 111).

11.      The Government has implemented a stimulus package to support the income
o f the population and help the most affected sectors. The income support package
includes an increase o f 10 percent in the wages o f civil servants at the lower end o f the
salary scale and the Minimum Wage for private sector employees. Direct support
measures for affected firms included financial r e l i e f (guarantees on loans; rescheduling o f
debt; help with export insurance). One additional measure, effective January 2009,
entailed a cut in the marginal income tax from 42 percent to 40 percent, and the upper
end o f the exempt income bracket was extended.
12.     Public finances continue to be well managed, despite the impact o f the global
crisis and the stimulus package. The effective expenditure and tax management over
the last few years have been critical in maintaining public finances on a sustainable path.
After two years o f surpluses (2007 and 2008), the budget shifted into a deficit in 2009,
due to falling revenues impacted by the global crisis and the introduction o f the stimulus
package to respond to the crisis. However, the deficit has been contained at a reasonable
level, enabling a further decline in the ratio o f debt to GDP to an estimated 46.5 percent,
down from 53.5 percent in 2007 and 47.3 percent in 2008. The inclusion o f the four
public pension funds in the definition o f the general government would entail smaller
deficits and lower net debt ratios, as these institutions s t i l l run surpluses and have
accumulated assets that exceed 20 percent o f GDP. This i s a positive aspect o f the
overall fiscal situation that i s not sufficiently highlighted2.

13. The Government made tactical debt decisions that involved a decline in average
duration, but plans to resume long-term issues with the return to stability. The share
o f long-term public debt declined from 87 to 76 percent in recent years, resulting in a
decrease in average duration to 5.8 years. This was due to a tactical decision by the
Treasury to avoid issuing higher cost long-term debt (in the aftermath o f the crisis, interest
rates increased3). However, the average duration remains at a reasonable level - the
median durations o f countries rated as BBB and BB by Fitch are 5.0 and 3.1, respectively4.
Moreover, the resumption o f long-term issues and the build-up o f a reliable and liquid
yield curve i s part o f the Government's program, as noted in Section 111.

14.     Morocco's growth performance has been remarkably good, in light o f the
global crisis and its effects on the economy. GDP growth reached 5.6 percent in 2008
and i s expected to be 5 percent in 2009, compared with only 2.7 percent in 2007.
This performance is mainly due to a good agricultural output in both years, largely
offsetting the slowdown o f non-agriculture GDP growth since 2007 (Table 1). This i s a
positive outcome overall, although it also reveals the dependency on agriculture and
weather conditions (albeit with less intensity than in the past). The unemployment rate
continued to decline to around 9 percent in the first half o f 2009 down from 9.6 percent


* In the absence o f reform, two public pension funds are projected to run deficits in the 2010s and deplete
their assets before 2020, while the third and largest pension fund should run deficits early in the 2020s and
deplete i t s assets during that decade. While this actuarial imbalance must be addressed, the fact i s that in
many countries the social security system i s already in deficit and has no assets to back future obligations.

  In the world, investors also demanded higher spreads on long-term emerging sovereign debt.

  Morocco i s rated BBB- by Fitch, BB+ by Standard & Poor's and B a l by Moody's.

                   participation, and in urban areas unemployment remains high (13.4 percent). Finally, the
                   central bank showed i t s commitment to price stability, as indicated by the reduction in the
                   annual inflation rate to 1.5 percent during the first 8 months o f the year , down from 3.9
                   percent over the same period in 2008.

              C.         MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

   15.     Sound macroeconomic policies and the efforts to improve competitiveness
  will allow Morocco to manage effectively the global crisis and benefit from the
  recovery of the world economy. It i s assumed that the government w i l l maintain a
  prudent fiscal stance and sustain the reform momentum o f recent years, continuing to
  implement the main sector strategies, including financial sector reforms. This will
  consolidate investment levels and generate fkrther efficiency gains, enabling a sound
  growth performance. Moreover, the world economy i s expected to slowly recover from
  the current crisis, allowing the on-going export promotion strategies to bear fruit.
   16.    The external position deteriorated but i s expected to remain sustainable over
  the medium term. After 2008 and 2009, during which the current account deteriorated ,
  the improvement should be gradual in the following years, as the impact o f the sector
  strategies take hold. In 2009, the trade deficit should improve (around 20.5 percent o f
  GDP), with falling imported commodity prices compensating for lower exports. The
  balance o f payments i s expected to progressively improve, with lower trade and current

account deficits, which would benefit from improved export potential and a recovery o f
tourism and workers' remittances. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) i s expected to
recover gradually to the 2008 levels. This i s rather conservative assumption given the
higher FDI ratios before the crisis. However, these FDI levels would contribute to the
projected gradual decline in the ratios o f external debt to GDP and exports.
17.     This scenario assumes that Morocco would reap the fruits o f its continued
reform efforts, its sound macroeconomic and fiscal policies, and targeted sector
strategies.     These policies would entail sustaining large public investment in
infrastructure, which would increase the return o f private investments and induce an
increase in their volumes, including FDIs, leading in turn to progressive gains in export
competitiveness and key service sectors such as tourism.

 18.     After a temporary higher deficit in 2010, the fiscal stance should remain
 sound, with fiscal deficits under the targeted threshold o f 3 percent o f GDP over the
 medium term, and debt ratios should decline further. The budget deficit i s expected
to edge up to 4.5 percent o f GDP in 2010, before improving to around 2.2 percent by
2013. Reaching this outcome assumes success in ongoing tax reform to broaden the tax
base, improve the efficiency o f the Value Added Tax, strengthen tax administration, and
remove tax exemptions in order to reduce tax expenditures. These measures would offset
the reduced top rates on income taxes. Under these assumptions, tax revenue is projected
to stabilize at around 25 percent o f GDP. O n the expenditure side, the consolidation o f
public finances relies on achievement o f oil and food subsidies reform and tight control
o f the wage bill. Under these conditions, public debt will stabilize in 20 10 at almost the
same level as that o f 2008 before following a downward trend to decline to less than 44
percent o f GDP in 2013. The average duration o f the debt i s expected to stabilize and
gradually increase in later years as the Treasury resumes long-term issues.
19.    The projected budget deficits and amortizations should be comfortably
financed from the domestic market and increased recourse to external loans in 2010.
As shown in Table 3, domestic financing would remain the main source, although

                                                         8
external financing would increase i t s contribution. Indeed, since 2006, net external
financing reversed i t s long negative trend to turn positive, reflecting the government's
strategy to slightly change the debt composition in favor o f external borrowing. This
financing strategy i s more balanced and would avoid excessive pressure o n domestic
financial markets, now that the money market i s less liquid than in recent years. It is also
consistent with the intention to maintain a comfortable level o f foreign reserves.
20.    A comprehensive analysis o f public debt sustainability shows that the fiscal
framework i s robust to downside risk in the medium term (Figure 3). The
sustainability o f the fiscal framework i s robust to shocks: under alternative scenarios,
several shocks to the baseline scenario are simulated5, and public debt sustainability i s
preserved in all o f them. In the medium term, the external accounts are also expected to
remain manageable, with ample foreign reserves (corresponding to an average 6.2
months of imports) and declining current account deficits in 20 10- 13.

              A.       OVERVIEW OF THE MOROCCAN FINANCIAL                                SYSTEM^
21.     The total assets of Moroccan financial institutions exceed 200 per cent of
GDP, reflecting the country's progress in financial development. As shown in Table
4, the assets o f banking and non-banking institutions (NBFIs) have grown significantly
and amount to 114 and 91 percent o f GDP, respectively. These ratios are well above the
levels that would be predicted by Morocco's per capita income, size, and other
characteristics. Morocco has made more progress than other M E N A countries in
developing NBFIs7 (in most other MENA countries the combined assets o f insurance
companies, pension funds, and mutual funds range between 10 and 15 percent o f GDP
only).
22.     Banks still dominate the financial sector and are licensed as universal banks,
except for offshore banks. The banking system i s dominated by private banks - public
banks account for only 15 percent o f total bank assets, or 33 percent if the large CPM
group (Cre'dit Populaire du Maroc) i s defined as a public bank.' There are thirteen
private banks and five public banks. These banks are also licensed as universal banks.
Some maintain a sector focus due to their history, such as the C I H (Cre'dit Immobilier et
Hotelier) which i s primarily involved in housing finance, and the C A M (Cre'dit Agricole
du Maroc) which i s primarily focused on agriculture. For i t s part, the CPM s t i l l leads
SME finance.
23.     The banking system has performed well and the Central Bank has been
tightening regulations to address new risks. Non-performing Loans (NPLs) are
historically low (5.5 percent o f total loans in June 2009) and well provisioned, with no
signs o f deterioration due to the credit expansion o f recent years. The increase in medium
and long t e r m credits such as mortgage and investment loans (half o f all credits in 2008)
has generated a maturity mismatch but the banks have enjoyed a stable deposit base.
Moreover, many banks issued subordinated debt in 2008 to reduce their reliance on short
term deposits and bolster solvency ratios. After a marked decline in 2007 due to rapid
credit growth and new Basel 2 capital charges, solvency improved in 2008 as the Central
Bank raised the minimum capital adequacy ratio (CAR) to 10 percent (1 1.2 percent on
average in 2008 compared to 10.6 percent in 2007). The Central Bank has issued new
regulations to ensure that banks manage effectively the new risks that have emerged.

  Annexes 111 through V provide more detailed analyses o f the banking, insurance, and microcredit sectors.

  The assets o f NBFIs are somewhat inflated by double counting, as more than half o f insurance assets and
part o f pension assets consist o f quotas o f mutual funds.
  This group has a specific ownership structure, including, Banque Centrale Populaire (BCP), a bank with
subsidiaries, which i s the apex o f the CPM group which and i s 5 1 percent owned by the state, and eleven
regional banks legally structured as cooperatives.

24.     Morocco i s one o f the few MENA countries that has been able to develop the
insurance sector to a significant extent, but this growth has also created risk
management challenges. Insurance premia increased from 2.4 to 2.9 percent o f GDP in
recent years and are among the top ones in the MENA region. The life sector accounts
for one third o f the premium and i s one o f the largest in the region. The assets o f the
insurance sector have not grown recently, but this i s largely due to the drop in equity
prices. The growth o f the sector i s a very positive development, but the providers will
need to manage the associated risks, especially in the fast growing l i f e sector.
25.      Morocco has become a recognized leader in microcredit in the region, but the
industry has recently experienced portfolio problems. MFIs serve 1.3 million clients
and their credit portfolio reached almost one percent o f GDP in 2007. MFIs are primarily
regulated by the Ministry o f Finance (MOF) and supervised by the Central Bank.
Funding primarily comes from commercial banks. The rapid gain in outreach was a
positive development, but shortcomings in governance and internal control did not make
the management o f this rapid growth possible and the accumulation o f portfolio problems
started creating financial stress. This to tighten regulation and supervision. In this
environment, two large MFIs decided to join forces, which permitted to alleviate the
difficulties of one of them; the authorities supported this decision.
26.     The stock market has grown rapidly but i s concentrated on a handful o f
large companies, and private fixed income instruments remain undeveloped. Market
capitalization i s high by regional standards (77 percent o f GDP in 2008), but the free float
i s small (26 percent), only 77 companies are listed, and the market remains very
concentrated, as indicated by the high share o f the ten largest companies in market
capitalization (70 percent) and turnover (74 percent). Traded value improved but remains
below emerging countries' benchmarks largely due to a limited float. The market for
private fixed income instruments remains modest, despite some recent bank issues.
27.    Despite the growth o f the financial system in recent years, the scope for
further improvements in access remains substantial. As shown in Figure 4 and Annex

                                                   11
V , Morocco i s above the international benchmark regarding financial depth, measured
either by the ratio of deposits to GDP or credits to GDP. However, Morocco has much
lower ratios o f deposits and loans per population than would be expected given the depth
indicators. This difference suggests the potential for further and substantive gains in
access. Enterprise surveys show a similar picture. Despite the remarkable progress in
recent years, a larger share o f enterprises in Morocco reports access to finance as a major
constraint than the equivalent averages in MENA and l o w middle income countries. This
i s especially true for smaller enterprises (Figure 4).
28.    All in all, these outcomes indicate that Moroccan policy-makers face the
challenge of expanding further the frontiers of finance to households and
enterprises, while also ensuring that further access gains are sustained. The
expansion o f infrastructure and housing finance has contributed to output growth and
social objectives, but opened a maturity gap that needs to be effectively managed.
Expanding further SME finance will require better tools to identify and manage credit
risk The growth o f the insurance sector i s positive, but the industry needs to strengthen
risk management capacity and also have access to better risk management tools. The
NPLs in microcredit institutions deriving from rapid credit growth reveal the need to
strengthen governance and risk management at that level as well. These are the
challenges that are being addressed by the Government in i t s reform program.

                    B.     EARLIER FINANCIAL REFORM EFFORTS

29.      Morocco's continued progress in financial development has been the result of
important reforms earlier in the decade. In 2004-2005, Morocco launched an
important reform package that was supported by a Financial Sector Development Policy
Loan (discussed in detail in Section IV C ) and that included substantive policy measures
in three main areas, namely: (i)     Restructuring o f specialized state-owned financial
institutions (ii)Strengthening o f the regulatory framework in banking, insurance and
capital markets; and (iii)
                         Enhancement o f the financial sector's infrastructure.
30.      The restructuring of state-owned financial institutions addressed the dire
financial and operational conditions of three key institutions. The liquidation o f the
former National Development Bank (Banque Nationale de Development kconornique -
BNDE) has been initiated and i t s major assets already sold. The C I H and the C A M were
financially and operationally restructured. These actions have resulted in a substantive
improvement in their capital positions and N P L ratios.

31.     The strengthening o f the regulatory framework for banking, insurance and
capital markets contributed to the positive results in recent years. The banking
regulatory reforms included revised Central Bank Statutes and Banking L a w that inter
alia strengthened the autonomy o f bank supervision, introduced consolidated supervision,
and contributed to a well functioning banking system. The insurance reforms included a
revised insurance Code, the liberalization o f price setting in insurance premia, and
generalization o f insurance on work-related accidents, which contributed to the growth of
the insurance sector. The laws on the stock exchange and the capital market regulator
were amended to improve transparency and regulatory powers.

                                                                                          13
32.      The enhancements in financial infrastructure included inter alia
improvements in the payments system and upgrading of accounting and auditing
standards. The improvements in payments systems included the introduction o f an
RTGS system to handle large value payments, and the replacement o f paper-based
methods in retail payments. These changes reduced the cost, time, and risk in processing
payments. The upgrading o f accounting and auditing standards included the development
o f a financial information registry and the adoption o f IFRS standards, with initial focus
on companies making public offerings.

                   C.      THE GOVERNMENT'S REFORM PROGRAM

33.      While the financial system has grown significantly in recent years, the
Government i s aware that additional reforms are necessary to expand further
access to underserved sectors while containing the risks that have emerged. The
credit growth in recent years has contributed to Morocco's growth performance and
expanded the frontiers o f finance. However, it i s also apparent that the financial system
i s not yet providing services to large segments o f l o w income households and SMEs.
Moreover, this rapid growth has also generated new risks in the banking and insurance
sectors, and even in the microcredit sector - an industry generally characterized by very
l o w default rates - the lack o f proper risk management and internal controls resulted in
portfolio problems. The global financial crisis added importance to the reform, not only
for having produced a credit slowdown that typically affects the most vulnerable sectors,
but also for having shown the need to strengthen financial infrastructure and financial
regulation to ensure that any further access gains are sustainable.
34.     The Government's reform program addresses the two main challenges in the
financial sector - expanding access further while preserving stability - and consists
of four major components o r pillars. The first pillar contains measures designed to
ensure sustainable improvements in individuals' access to finance. The second pillar
consists o f measures to ensure sustainable improvements in SME access to finance. The
third pillar aims at ensuring the resiliency and stability o f the financial system by
strengthening further the regulatory and supervisory framework for banking, insurance,
and capital markets. Finally, the fourth pillar promotes the further development o f capital
markets, with focus on the introduction o f long-term funding instruments and risk
management tools, thus contributing both to access and stability.

1.     First Pillar: Improving Individuals' Access to Finance

Creation o a Postal Bank with broad geographical presence to expand access
          f
35.      The Government i s creating a Postal Bank building on the existing strengths
of the Post Office. The post office already provides some basic services (savings
passbooks and checking accounts) to a large customer base (4.3 million people). In recent
years, it has successfully leveraged on the large postal network (1,762 branches in 2008)
to attract a significant number o f unbanked customers (14 percent o f the Moroccan
population have postal accounts in 2008, up from 10 percent in 2005). I t i s often the only
institution serving the low income population, including the rural population, the self-
employed, and people with irregular incomes, which do not have access to banking

                                            14
services because of cost or branch locations. The amount o f resources collected i s s t i l l
modest, amounting to only 3 percent o f bank deposits. The Post office has a good track
record in terms o f governance and has proven i t s ability to finance i t s operations without
significant financial support for the Government.
36.     T h e Postal Bank i s expected to play a significant access role, by offering a
wider range o f banking services to underserved categories o f the population. The
design o f the Moroccan Postal bank draws on successful international experiences (e.g.
French "Banque Postale"). The Postal Bank, a subsidiary o f the Post Office, will target
individuals with a monthly income below 3,000 MAD with an objective o f 5.4 million
clients by 2015 (a 26 percent increase compared to 2009). These customers are not yet
targeted by commercial banks. N e w services (transfers, payments, debit cards, overdrafts,
mortgage loans) will be introduced, with riskier services (lending) only introduced in a
later stage. Existing services will be upgraded to better serve existing customers and
attract new ones. The separation o f postal and financial activities should improve the
quality o f services, while outreach should be improved with the specialization o f
branches and staff, as well as the opening o f new branches (550 new branches b y 2018)
and distribution channels (1 00 mobile branches and 50 cash points by 2018).
37.       T h e Central B a n k granted the license to the Postal Bank in July 2009, As the
new institution ventures into new territories, risk management and internal controls will
need to be strengthened. In recent years, the Post Office has improved i t s financial
operations with the assistance o f consultants (IT systems, branches, back offices, audit),
including improvements in internal controls required by the Central Bank during the two
year licensing process. The Postal Bank will also take a very progressive approach to roll
over i t s business plan, to ensure that risks are always adequately addressed. For instance,
mortgage products will only be offered as o f 201 1. An agreement was signed in July
2009 with the group's trade unions illustrating their complete adherence, as well as that
o f the staff, to the project o f creating a Postal bank.
38.     T h e Postal B a n k i s expected to start i t s operation in 2010, without material
distortion o f competition w i t h commercial banks. A draft law i s with the Parliament
which will allow the Post Office to transfer its financial activities to a subsidiary, allow
overdrafts and modernize the regime o f postal checking accounts, which dates back to the
1920s. Interests on postal savings passbooks (which will be offered by the postal bank)
are not taxed contrary to those on products offered by commercial banks. However, due
to different types o f index for these two types o f products, their after tax yield i s
curRently comparable. The Postal Bank will be subject to the supervision o f the Central
Bank, like other commercial banks.
                                 f
Ensuring the sustainable growth o the microcredit industry

39.     Morocco i s a regional leader in microcredit, with 40 percent o f MENA's
client outreach. The sector scored well until recently on all performance metrics
including growth, depth o f outreach, asset quality, and profitability. It experienced very
rapid growth between 2004 and 2007, as shown in Table 5. At the end o f 2007 it had 1.3
million customers accounting for 7 percent o f the working age population and 17 percent
of the population below the poverty line. It had assets o f 5.6 billion MAD, accounting
for about 3.6 percent o f household credits, and managed by 13 microcredit associations


                                              15
(MFIs), with five o f them controlling three quarters o f the sector's assets. The Ministry o f
Finance has primary responsibility over the sector, but the 2006 new Banking law
delegated supervisory responsibilities to the Central bank. The microcredit law (1999)
prohibits microcredit associations from taking deposits and limits individual credit to
50,000 MAD.

                        Table 5.                                            -

43.     The Government and the Central Bank are strengthening the regulatory
framework of the microcredit sector. The Ministry o f Finance and the Central Bank
have recently issued new and detailed rules on loan classification and provisioning. This
will enable the authorities to measure the problem with accuracy, require adequate
provisions and take additional measures. The Central Bank also issued in September
2009 a new directive on governance, risk management and internal control for MFIs.
Moreover, the FedCration Nationale des Associations de Microcredit (the microcredit
industry association) i s putting together a code o f ethics. Finally, the Central bank already
carried out extensive on-site inspections in the sector and intends to maintain a close
monitoring o f the different MFIs
44.      The government i s also reviewing the overall legal and regulatory framework
of the sector to determine if more structural changes are required. This review,
which i s being conducted with external assistance, should be completed by mid-2010. In
the short term, small and medium MFIs are planning to share resources such as back
office systems or merge. The authorities are encouraging l i n k s with banks, so as to
ensure liquidity (over two third o f the sector funding comes from local banks) and allow
increased cross-selling which would benefit customers. These efforts are slowly paying
o f f and a recovery i s expected for the first semester o f 20 10, even if some MFIs are likely
to have to be restructured.
Increasing availability o housingjinance
                        f

45.     The FOGARIM partial credit guarantee (PCG) scheme improved access to
housing finance for the poor. Created in 2004, it provides guarantees covering 70
percent of mortgage loans made to people with l o w or irregular incomes who buy
properties up to 200,000 MAD. It has been successful with 7.5 billion MAD worth o f
credit guaranteed as o f August 2009 (7 percent o f the mortgage loan portfolio) and a l o w
delinquency rate (less than 2 percent). Moreover, it fostered the entry o f new banks in
this market, with eight active banks in 2008 compared to two public banks before i t s
creation.
46.     A new fund (Damane Assakane) was set up in 2009, taking over FOGARIM
with increased resources to expand further access to housing finance for the poor. It
benefits from increased resources thanks to the merger o f F O G A R I M (600 million MAD
endowment) and FOGALOGE-public (350 million MAD), whose resources were
underutilized. Although eligible beneficiaries include middle class households, poor
people are expected to remain the main beneficiaries o f this scheme. Moreover, the
system i s now better managed and i t s self-sustainability will be ensured over the medium
term, thanks to the introduction o f risk-based premiums linked to the share o f the loan
guaranteed and the loan to value ratio.
Improving low income banking
47.     The government wants to leverage the increasing importance of the retail
segment for commercial banks and expand further banking services to the low
income population. Banks have rapidly grown their branch networks (a 55 percent
increase relative to 2005) to collect additional deposits. Retail credits increased
considerably as well, amounting to 26 percent o f total credit. The authorities have
encouraged banks to explore profitable l o w income banking (LIB) strategies. The four

                                              17
major banks which control about 70 percent o f banking assets have prepared such
strategies, which are at an early stage o f implementation.

2.      Second Pillar: Ensuring Sustainable Improvements in SME Access to Finance

48.    SME finance improved over the past years, but some segments remain
underserved. The large Credit Populaire du Maroc (CPM) group has been traditionally
involved in SME lending and accounts for a large share o f this market. Two private
banks have entered the market in recent years, and one o f them (Attijariwafa bank) has
made particular progress, through dedicated teams and branches. Despite the absence o f
key pieces o f infrastructure such as a credit bureau, credit to SMEs represents almost 20
percent o f corporate loan portfolios which i s a remarkable achievement. However, it
seems that other banks finance SMEs to a lesser extent, key segments remain
underserved, such as start ups, smaller enterprises, and long term finance.
49.     The government program addresses constraints identified both by banks and
SMEs. O n the bank side, the main constraints relate to governance weaknesses, lack o f
financial transparency, limited capital and the weakness o f the projects, while SMEs
report too demanding conditions to access credit, especially in terms o f collateral and
interest rates. The government's strategy includes five components: (i)       improving the
reliability and availability o f credit information through a new credit bureau, (ii)
                                                                                    improve
the SME partial credit guarantee scheme, (iii)       assist SMEs in the preparation o f their
projects, (iv) improve SME governance and financial transparency, and (v) assist SMEs'
modernization to improve their competitiveness.
Introduction o a modern credit bureau
              f
50.      The banking law was amended in 2006 to allow the Central Bank to
introduce one or more credit bureaus managed by private operators and replace its
old credit registry. The credit registry had been set up in 1978. It provided valuable
support to bank supervision by recording large individual credits, but did not report
information on households and small enterprises and failed to facilitate their access to
credit. The law establishes all the conditions o f a modern credit reporting system. As
shown in Table 6, the law stipulates that all credit institutions need to provide negative
and positive information to the Central Bank, which will transfer this information to the
credit bureau(s). This includes all banks and finance companies (including leasing and
factoring companies). These credit institutions are mandated to consult the credit(s)
bureau(s) before grating a loan. Moreover, the credit bureau(s) will have to observe
governance, confidentiality and information security rules. Borrowers can access and
dispute their credit information. Some Microcredit institutions report , on a voluntary
basis, information to the credit bureau(s).
5 1.    I n 2008, a first license to operate a credit bureau was granted to the private
firm Experian through an open tender. The conditions for the license include a lower
fee for MFIs (half o f the fee charged from the credit institutions) in order to encourage
them to take part to this process. The lower fee i s however sufficient to cover the costs o f
operating with MFIs (which are lower due to the simpler credit files). The license
conditions also include the obligation for Experian to develop credit scores in a second         .
phase, after the databases are consolidated.

54.      T h e Central Bank could consider the provision o f a second license to enhance
competition, after the consolidation o f the first credit bureau. The Central Bank will
monitor the performance o f the new credit bureau and has indicated that it could consider
the concession o f a second license to enhance competition and promote quality services
at a l o w cost. However, it has also indicated that the priority in 2010 i s to ensure the
consolidation o f credit databases and the adequate functioning o f the first credit bureau.

Reform o the partial credit guarantee scheme for SMEs
        f
55.     The program includes the reform of the partial credit guarantee scheme
(PCG), enabling it to provide access to credit to a larger number o f SMEs with
better loan origination incentives. A review by Deloitte in 2007 concluded that the
potential o f the guarantee system was underutilized in light o f both SME needs and the
banks' strengthened capacities to allocate credit in a sound manner. I t also highlighted
that Morocco had a mixed experience, with both successful experiences which could be
replicated (specific funds with a clear mandate and ex ante risk coverage) and failed
experiences in the 1990s due to poor risk management capacities and governance
(allocation o f guarantees without initial risk identification, adequate coverage, and early
remedial measures). Despite a first round o f reforms in the 2000s, further reform
appeared necessary before committing more fiscal support. In particular, the system: (i)
remained complex, with three institutions involved (Caisse Centrale de Garantie, CCG,
Dar Ad-Damane, and Caisse Marocaine des Marche`s, C M M ) and different rules for each
guarantee; (ii)had cumbersome and time consuming application and approval
procedures; (iii)  was not well focused on SMEs and their financing needs, (iv) had a
governance structure with poor representation o f the sector; (v) did not provide sufficient
incentives for banks to recover delinquent loans, and (vi) did not allocate well funds to
cover risks, which limited i t s ability to effectively manage i t s portfolio. This study also
suggested improvements based on international best practice.
56.      The new guarantee system has been designed so as to improve governance,
simplify application and approval procedures, strengthen the focus on SMEs, and
provide support to their lifecycle needs. As shown in Table 7, the CCG, a public
institution licensed and supervised by the Central Bank, i s now the reference operator o f
the PCG, while solutions are being defined for the Dar Ad Damane, a smaller private
credit institution which i s s t i l l plagued by old and large losses, and which activity i s now
limited.. SMEs and banks have more representation in the Board o f the CCG. Important
improvements have also been achieved through the simplification and harmonization o f
eligibility criteria related to the decision making process o f the CCG. New guarantees
introduced in February 2009 are focused on SMEs (no guarantee can exceed 10 million
MAD and combined guarantees on a single borrower cannot exceed 15 million MAD,
which ensure that guarantees are used for SMEs) and better match SMEs' financial needs
according to their life cycle (investment, working capital, restructuring, and private
equity).
57.     Changes in the CCG's operating rules should improve the incentives at loan
origination, leading to a better selection of borrowers and an increase in the overall
effectiveness of the scheme. First, the CCG will have access to the databases o f the
credit bureau and will be able to screen new applicants. The coverage ratios are roughly
similar to those in other countries. However, some o f the new rules provide more
incentives for the banks to screen their applicants and recover loans in default. Under
the old rules, banks received 100 percent o f the guaranteed amount upon default. Under
the new rules, banks will receive only 50 percent o f the amount after a credit becomes
delinquent. They will receive another 50 percent after three years or earlier upon proven
efforts to recover the delinquent loan (and subject to a maximum equal to the losses
covered b y the guarantee). Moreover, the guarantee will not cover accrued interest and

                                               20
penalties. This should provide better incentives for banks to recover guaranteed loans
and indeed to screen better the applicants in the origination phase.
58.     The reform o f the CCG was accompanied by a significant increase o f its
resources, so that it can develop its activities in a sound manner (Le. ex ante
coverage o f risk). While it received 45 million MAD per year from 1998 to 2008
(roughly US$6 million at the current exchange rate), it was granted 130 million MAD in
2009 (US$17 million) and expects an equivalent annual amount until 2012. This will
help the CCG cover a larger SME portfolio. Between January and September 2009, 1.8
billion MAD o f credit were guaranteed, s t i l l a small percent o f total credit, but a
significant increase relative to the 1.3 billion MAD guaranteed in 2007. This increase in
volume i s expected to be accompanied by an increase in efficiency, due to the greater
focus on SMEs, better lifecycle support, and better incentives at loan origination.

Development ofprivate equity for SMEs
59.     New mechanisms will be introduced to support the development o f growth
and mature SMEs through improved availability o f private equity. In recent years,
private equity quickly grew in size (assets worth 8 billion MAD in 2008, four times
greater than 2005), number of players (20 funds, often tied to banks) and types o f
products. Factors which underpinned this success should remain supportive, both in terms
o f supply (assets represent 1.2% o f GDP compared to 3-4% in mature markets and half
are not yet invested) and o f demand (Le. firms' capital needs to improve competitiveness,
retirement o f CEOs etc.). The government intends to introduce new mechanisms to foster
private equity investments in SMEs: a dedicated public private venture capital fund and a
new guarantee fmd, managed by the CCG, to partially cover the risks o f such

                                                       21
investments. The government also intends to revisit the private equity law to facilitate the
development o f this industry.

3.      Third Pillar: Strengthening the regulatory and supervisory architecture

Strengthening o crisis preparedness arrangements
               f

60.     With the support of the World Bank, Morocco was the first MENA country
to carry out a crisis preparedness and crisis management exercise in April 2009.
This i s a recognized best practice in the field o f financial stability. A realistic crisis
scenario was run to test interactions among the main policy makers and regulatory
authorities, the adequacy o f their powers and public communication. A few areas for
operational improvements were identified, which the authorities decided to address in the
coming months, through the development o f shared procedures for effective crisis
management and response.
Further strengthening o bank regulation and supervision
                       f
61.     Key reforms of bank regulation and supervision have been undertaken in
recent years to meet international best practices and foster the modernization o f the
banking industry. After the enactment o f the banking law (2006), the Central Bank
promptly revised its regulations, introducing in particular the Basel 2 standardized
approach for credit risk, new capital charges for market and operational risks, and new
detailed requirements on internal control and risk management (including for liquidity
and interest rate risks). Moreover, it reacted to rapid credit growth and declining capital
adequacy ratios, by raising the minimum ratio to 10 percent in 2008.
62.    An independent bank governance review will be conducted with Bank
support to assess the banks' capacity to address the risks they currently face. After a
major modernization o f the banking industry and o f its regulation, this review will assess
the design and implementation o f governance arrangements established to measure,
monitor and manage such risks. The authorities intend to prepare an action plan to
address identified weaknesses, where appropriate.
63.      As real estate exposures have significantly increased, the Central Bank i s
developing additional approaches to monitor this risk, including a new real estate
price index. Commercial banks' exposures to the real estate sector represent almost a
third o f credit portfolios (of which one third related to developers and the other two thirds
comprising mortgage loans). The Central Bank i s developing additional tools to monitor
such a risk, taking into account a new real estate price index developed in cooperation
with the National Property Registry Agency. I t intends to regularly publish the index
starting in the first quarter 20 10.
64.      The implementation of Basel 2 remains high on the agenda of the Central
Bank with a short term emphasis on Pillar 2 (the supervisory review). Standardized
credit risk approaches (Pillar 1) were introduced in 2006 and the Central bank intends to
authorize advanced approaches over the medium term. I t has also been implementing
Pillar 2 to ensure that banks have adequate capital to address the risks in their business. I t
i s working on improved methodologies to link the assessment o f banks' risk profiles with



                                             22
their interest, liquidity and concentration risks. The outcomes o f such assessments could
result in higher capital charges.
Strengthening the independence and en                  f
                                     forcement powers o the capital market
supervisor
65.     The creation o f a fully independent Capital Market Authority (CMA) will
complete recent improvements in the supervisory process. Following the
strengthening o f i t s powers in 2004, the capital market supervisor (Conseil
DPontologique des Valeurs Mobili6res, C D V M ) initiated a transition from compliance- to
risk-based supervision (introduction o f individual risk assessments and new inspection
techniques) and stepped up enforcement (e.g. 2008 sanctions against four brokers
following a mismanaged IPO, including the withdrawal o f a custodian license). A draft
law was submitted to the General Secretariat o f Government (SGG) in September 2009 to
create a C M A , institutionalizing and strengthening supervisory independence and
enforcement powers. This authority will be chaired by an independent person, have i t s
own budget and a Sanction council solely responsible for making objective and
independent decisions o n sanctions.
66.      The stock exchange's governance structure i s being strengthened as well. The
stock exchange recently upgraded i t s trading and transaction monitoring systems and
revised its rule book (``rdglement gkneral") to improve i t s performance and integrity. The
simplification o f i t s governance structure has been initiated and a draft law has been
prepared to allow the opening o f i t s capital beyond stock brokers. This i s expected to
instill more transparency and allow capital ties with institutionals.
                                                       f
Strengthening the independence and enforcement powers o the insurance supervisor
67.      A new and independent insurance authority will have statutory control over
insurance, pension (subject to any specific laws) and annuity providers. A draft law
was transmitted to the SGG to create a new authority independent both from the Ministry
of Finance (while it currently i s one o f i t s departments) and from the insurance industry
(which currently has the power to reject licensing applications). Powers to impose
sanctions and issue. regulations will be increased and advisory bodies involved in the
decision making. Regulatory initiatives will follow directions set in the "contrat-
programme" and include interim measures where final outcomes are too distant. In the
short term, the introduction o f an investment regime consistent with an evolution towards
risk based capital requirements i s contemplated to avoid excessive exposures to specific
asset classes (e.g. equity).
68.     Further modernization o f insurance regulation i s anchored on a "contrat-
programme" (roadmap) negotiated between the authorities and the industry. The
relative success o f the Moroccan insurance sector can in part be attributed to the close
coordination that has existed between the government and the sector. A new
comprehensive "contrat-programme" i s being negotiated for the period 2009-20 14,
covering product development, compulsory classes, prudential controls, investment rules,
internal controls and risk management, internationalization and implementation.

4.       Further strengtheningthe development o f capital markets

Building a liquid and reliable Government yield curve
69.      The domestic market has proven its ability to meet the Treasury's funding
needs, but it has stopped issuing medium and long term debt since 2007. Domestic
debt accounted for 80 percent o f the total public debt stock as o f December 2008 (up
from 50 percent in 1998). The Treasury had made progress in issuing long term debt and
increasing i t s average duration but has not issued Treasury bills with maturities above 5
years since the first quarter o f 2007 (securities up to 52 weeks accounted for 95 percent
o f issuances in 2008). This tactical move was motivated by two factors. First, the focus
o n short term issues allowed the Government to borrow at lower interest rates and contain
interest expenses. Second, the Government also avoided long-term issues to prevent a
possible negative impact o f higher rates on the cost o f floating-rate mortgage loans,
which are indexed to long-term Treasury bills rate.
70.     The normalization o f market conditions i s allowing the Treasury to resume
its long-run focus in public debt management. The current approach o f only issuing
short-term paper i s clearly not sustainable over a long period o f time, and has also
interrupted the previous progress in building a yield curve. The lack o f continued
issuance at different segments o f the yield curve has stimulated buy-and-hold behavior in
an already shallow market. The absence o f reliable price references and market making
activity has discouraged secondary trades, affecting the quality o f portfolio valuation.
However, the normalization o f market conditions, reflected in declining long-term
                         I has
                           ,
interest rates (Section I ) allowed the Treasury to resume i t s long-run focus.
71.     Recent changes on the rules and remuneration o f the Treasury current
account and the launch o f an electronic auction platform promote the
implementation o f a sound debt management strategy. The remuneration o f the
Treasury current account at the Central Bank and the flexibility to invest or borrow cash
directly in the market will enhance the Treasury's capacity to implement cost-effective
cash management practices. This in turn will facilitate the issuance o f benchmark
securities and buybacks o f less liquid instruments, allowing the Treasury to reduce debt
fragmentation and build a liquid yield curve. Moreover, a new electronic auction platform
removes uncertainty to market participants on sales and prices, a key prerequisite to build
efficient primary and secondary markets.
72.     A modification o f the reference rate for new floating long-term loans will
facilitate the issuance o f long term Treasury bills. The Ministry o f Finance will soon
change the reference rate of the variability o f interest rates for new floating rate loans,
from Treasury bills to a reference to short term instruments. This i s consistent with
international practice and will also allow the Treasury to follow a consistent issuance
policy, primarily based o n public debt management objectives. I t will also prove
beneficial for capital market development and the banks' asset and liability management
(by improving the predictability o f loan repricing).
73   I The government i s considering approaches to address remaining bottlenecks
and build a more liquid and reliable yield curve while keeping funding costs
affordable. There i s no single measure to reach such a goal and a set o f policy measures


                                            24
needs to be mapped. The government i s considering the design and implementation o f an
action plan to tackle different areas in an orderly and effective way, exploiting synergies
among them. This action plan could encompass, among others: a review o f primary
dealers' rules, a strategy for liability management transactions (buybacks and switches)
and several measures to improve price dissemination.
                     f
Further development o private f l e d income instruments
74.     A revised securitization law passed in December 2008 creates better
incentives for a sound development o f this market, but still lacks critical
implementing regulations. Only one bank used the securitization framework created in
1999 as plenty o f cheap funding was available and cost proved a deterrent. In an
environment o f scarcer liquidity and growing banks' needs for long t e r m funding, a new
law was passed in December 2008. It allows more eligible assets and flexible structuring
(multi-sellers, rechargeable assets, tranching). However, it will only become effective
after key implementing regulations are passed.
75.    The government will prepare the ground for the introduction o f covered
bonds, to facilitate a reduction o f banks' maturity mismatch and provide funding
for housing loans at lower rates. Covered bonds are the most common instrument used
for funding mortgage loans in several EU countries. It allows the banks to match the
duration o f their assets, while also providing funding at lower interest rates due the
additional security provided to investors (covered bondholders have priority rights on the
flows o f income from housing loans). With this objective the M O F will prepare a draft
law on covered bonds.
                     f
Further development o stock markets
76.     The government wants to attract more investors to the market, increase the
number o f listed firms, and position the Moroccan market as a regional player. The
authorities see the future o f the Moroccan market as a regional player with close l i n k s to
the EU, and consider a gradual convergence o f regulations towards EU standards as the
best approach to achieve this.
77.     Improved investor protection i s at the core o f the government's program.
Despite supervisory efforts, there i s s t i l l a perception that the market i s not a level playing
field and that insiders do not always adhere to the highest ethical standards. The
government intends to broaden i t s recent efforts by establishing comprehensive rules on
the distribution o f financial instruments, enhancing the professionalism o f key
individuals, introducing business conduct rules, further strengthening corporate
governance standards, and enhancing internal control and risk management requirements
for, market intermediaries. Analysis o f existing gaps (including a corporate governance
ROSC which the World Bank will carry out) are being prepared.
78.     The government wants to improve incentives for companies to list. Beyond
existing measures, the government expects that enhanced market integrity, marketing vis-
a-vis large private firms and improved conditions o f access to the market will draw new
companies to the market. Over the medium term, the listing o f foreign firms could also
help market development (e.g. companies from MENA and African countries which do
not have stock exchanges).


                                                25
Introduction ojsound and liquid listed derivatives markets
79.     The government i s introducing an organized future market to help Moroccan
firms better hedge their risks, A draft law creating the key legal underpinnings to set up
such an exchange was adopted by the Council o f Government in July 2009. Key
decisions on the implementation o f these provisions will be taken once the law i s enacted
(e.g. types o f contracts, market firms, clearing house). To ensure the success o f the
market, contracts will only be offered on standardized and liquid instruments and trading
i s only expected when this prerequisite o f liquidity has been fulfilled. Financial
supervisors aim at working on specific regulatory measures to avoid any excessive risk-
taking by financial and non-financial f i r m s once the market i s launched.


          IV.    BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT STRATEGY

                                      A.     LINKTOCPS

80.     The Bank's support to the implementation of financial sector reform i s
detailed in the FY10-13 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) that will be discussed
by the Board o f the Bank in January 2010, prior to the submission of this operation
for approval. The new CPS builds on the successful experience o f the 2005 CAS and
retains financial sector reform as one o f the cornerstones o f the Bank's partnership
strategy. I t i s organized around three main pillars: (i)
                                                         enhancing growth, competitiveness
and employment, (ii)     improving the access and quality o f services, and (iii)
                                                                                ensuring that
Morocco's development is sustainable and meets natural resource and climate change
challenges. In addition, the CPS places a strong emphasis on governance.
8 1.     The new Sustainable Access to Finance DPL i s fully consistent with the first
pillar of the CPS of growth, competitiveness and employment. More specifically, the
proposed DPL contributes to the first pillar's objectives through the following areas o f
focus: (i) improvements in financial intermediation to enhance competition and growth,
(ii) increased individuals and SME access to finance, and (iii)      strengthened financial
regulation and supervision to ensure financial stability and sustainable gains in access. In
addition, further enhancements o f corporate and bank governance are covered by the
program and will contribute to the CPS goal o f strengthening the governance reform
agenda. The FYlO lending program envisaged in the CPS encompasses the proposed
DPL operation.

          B.      COLLABORATION W I T H THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

82.     The World Bank and the IMF maintain close collaboration in Morocco.
Regular contacts between the IMF and World Bank country teams are customary, with
discussions focused on the respective work programs, country priorities, recent
developments and prospects. Collaboration between the Fund and the Bank in Morocco
has been seamless, with a shared assessment o f the critical macroeconomic challenges
facing the country. The Fund regularly participates in Bank project review meetings


                                            26
where relevant. Similarly, Bank staff contributed to the IMF's 2008 and 2009 Article I V
consultation missions to Morocco. The IMF conducted i t s 2009 Article I V consultations
in November 2009 with a view to submit it to their management by January 2010.
83.    Collaboration with the African Development Bank (AfDB) i s an integral
component of this operation. At the request o f the Government, this operation i s being
prepared jointly with AfDB. The proposed D P L and the AfDB operation have the same
two tranche structure and support jointly the Government's reform program through the
common policy matrix. This has benefited the client b y building credibility for the
reform, but also by focusing the attention and expertise from multilateral donors on a
comprehensive reform program.
84.      The Bank i s also collaborating closely with the IFC which has a long-term
engagement in the financial sector in Morocco, particularly as regards support to the
development o f SMEs and financial services to the poorer segment o f the population.
Over the past several years, IFC has been active in supporting investment funds bringing
much needed capital and expertise to over 25 high-growth small and medium companies
in Morocco. I t has also worked with leading Moroccan banks to help them develop
profitable SME banking operations. IFC also undertook various initiatives to develop the
country's financial and credit information infrastructure, and helped establish jointly with
the Central Bank a best practice private credit bureau. IFC's support to the microcredit
sector has helped over 500,000 small borrowers' access much needed financial services.
O n the Treasury front, IFC issued a bond in Morocco denominated in dirhams - a
transaction that was the first domestic bond offering by a multilateral institution in Africa
as well as in the Middle East - thus contributing to the broadening o f the financial
markets in the country. This D P L operation draws on the depth o f IFC's experience and
addresses areas where progress has not been sufficient or where new risks are emerging.
I t aims at increasing both breadth and depth, while enhancing financial stability.



                C.      RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

 This operation builds on the positive experience of the Bank's past engagement in
 the financial sector, particularly the 2005 Financial Sector DPL. The CAS
 Completion Report assesses that Morocco's strong commitment to carrying out financial
 sector reform and the Bank Group's support to the financial sector during the period o f
the last CAS was overall satisfactory. The I C R o f the Financial Sector D P L noted that
the operation helped strengthen the legal and institutional environment for financial
intermediation and risk management, and increase the private sector's participation in the
provision o f financial services. Three key state-owned institutions in dire financial and
operational conditions were restructured, the regulatory framework for banking,
insurance and capital markets was strengthened and financial infrastructures were
upgraded (e.g. payments and settlement system, accounting and auditing standards). All
targets o f the D P L were met and the operation was rated satisfactory for Development
Objectives and highly satisfactory for Implementation Progress. The I C R concluded that
the Government's performance was Highly Satisfactory. The Ministry o f Finance was
simultaneously the champion o f reforms, the ministry responsible for i t s implementation


                                            27
and the direct beneficiary o f the D P L funds to the national budget. This created a more
conducive environment for effective implementation and hence success.

                                 D.      LESSONS LEARNED

85.     The recent financial crisis has highlighted the need to pay as much attention
to stability as to access. The global expansion o f credit in recent years improved access
o f households and enterprises to finance, but was not always accompanied by effective
regulation and supervision in many countries. Morocco's supervisory authorities have
managed effectively the expansion o f the banking system, but are aware o f the need to
strengthen regulation further to prevent the problems that emerged in other countries.
Moreover, the increase in the NPLs o f MFIs in Morocco illustrates well the problems that
may be generated by rapid credit growth and inadequate risk management capacity. As
noted in the I C R o f the Financial Sector D P L and the CAS Completion Report, the
Government had strong ownership and exercised good leadership o f the reform program
supported by the I C R and its performance was rated highly satisfactory.
86.      Strong ownership and strengthened capacity o f the institutions involved in
the reform are key factors o f success. Ensuring ownership at the highest levels o f
government as well as at the technical levels i s essential for increasing commitment to the
project development objectives and facilitating implementation. Moreover, technical
assistance to implement the program and build capacity are essential, as well as high
level o f consultation during the drafting o f regulations reflected in the policy matrix.
87.    Partnership with the client and donor coordination play a major role in
program success. The shift from assistance to partnership with the Moroccan
Government introduced with the 2005-2009 CAS has allowed for greater flexibility and
adaptation o f the program to client needs. In other operations (e.g. the P A R L series),
coordination with different organizations (AfDB, EU) based on the same programmatic
framework have benefited the client by building credibility for the reforms, and ensuring
an effective combination o f the technical expertise from multilateral donors in support to
a complex program o f reform.

                          E.     ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

88.    The Financial Sector Assessment Program Update o f 2008 and other
diagnostic work provided strong analytical underpinning to the design o f the
proposed operation. The preparation o f this DPL benefited from the detailed analysis
and recommendations o f the FSAP on banking, insurance and capital markets, as well as
on access to finance in Morocco. The Financial Sector Stability Assessment which
includes a detailed presentation of the outcomes o f the FSAP was published in October
2008 (following authorization by the Moroccan authorities). Other diagnostic work also
contributed to the design o f the operation, including Reports on the Observance o f
Standards and Codes (ROSCs) on Insolvency and Creditor Rights (2006), and Payments
and Securities Clearance and Settlement Systems (2007). Investment Climate
Assessments (ICAs) conducted in 2003 and 2007 also contributed to the design o f sub-
components o f the proposed operation.



                                            28
      V.       THE PROPOSED SUSTAINABLE ACCESS T O FINANCE LOAN
The objective o f the proposed operation i s to support the Government's efforts to
expand further the access o f households and enterprises to finance, while ensuring
the stability o f the financial system. Expanded access o f individuals and enterprises to
finance will contribute to a sound growth performance and further reductions in poverty,
but sustained improvements in access require further strengthening o f financial regulation
and supervision, and effective management o f all the risks involved. Unlike other
countries, Morocco has been able to preserve financial stability since the start o f the
international crisis, but needs to ensure that further gains in access are well managed and
sustainable.
89.        The Government's program addresses effectively the dual objectives o f
access and stability and merits the Bank's support. I t s first two pillars contain
measures that promote access to individuals and enterprises to finance, while the third
pillar contains measures designed to strengthen further financial regulation and
supervision. The fourth pillar - capital market development - contributes both to access
and stability, by promoting competition to banks and introducing better instruments o f
risk management. The program i s coherent and balanced, provides lessons to other
countries, and merits the Bank's support.
90.     The Bank has supported Morocco in its past financial reform efforts and
should be present in this important phase o f financial reform as well. The 2005 D P L
focused on the restructuring o f state banks, banking regulation and supervision, and
elements o f financial infrastructure. One o f the major objectives was the restoration o f
solvency o f state banks and the promotion o f competition. The current D P L focuses more
closely on access, while strengthening further the regulatory and supervisory framework
o f banking, insurance, and capital markets, to ensure the sustainability o f access gains.
The current operation i s a joint operation with the AfDB, which i s also supporting
Morocco weather the effects o f the financial crisis.
91.     The proposed operation contributes to Morocco's efforts, both financially
and technically. First, it contributes to a balanced financing package, helping the
Government meet i t s larger borrowing requirements resulting from the impact o f the
crisis, while avoiding excessive pressures on the domestic financial market. Second, it
provides support to an important reform that will contribute to growth and poverty
alleviation. Third, i t will allow the'Bank to remain engaged in the design o f more
challenging reform components, contributing to their quality. Fourth, the Moroccan
reform provides important lessons for other countries, for recognizing explicitly the need
to combine the objectives o f access and stability.

                 A.     OPERATION DESCRIPTION AND POLICY AREAS

92.      The proposed operation supports the Government's current financial reform
program. As shown in Section 111, this program has four major pillars and the operation
i s structured accordingly. Therefore, the operation supports key policy actions designed
to: (i)  ensure sustainable improvements in household access to finance; (ii)      ensure
sustainable improvements in SME access to finance; (iii)   strengthen financial regulation
and supervision; and (iv) develop further capital markets and instruments. Box 1

                                           29
summarizes the overall reform program in order to emphasize i t s internal coherence and
cohesiveness. The key policy actions supported by the operation are bolded and
described in further detail below.
93.      The operation i s structured in two tranches. The government considered the
two tranche structure appropriate, as the key steps o f the reform agenda have been well
discussed in Morocco and are well advanced, and the construction was deemed to
facilitate the coordinated oversight with the AfDB. The first tranche consists o f policy
actions implemented prior to Board approval, while the second tranche comprises policy
actionsg required for i t s release, planned for the last quarter o f calendar year 2010. The
operation has been prepared in close coordination with the AfDB, ensuring a very high
degree o f convergence between the two operations.

Pillar 1: Ensuring Sustainable Improvements in IndividualsAccessto Finance

94.      Introduction of a Postal Bank with wide penetration inside the country and
able to offer a wide range o f services to the low income population. The creation o f a
Postal Bank i s considered a key policy action due to i t s potential for enhancing access to
finance for households. For the first tranche, the operation supports the issue o f a license
for the new Postal Bank, which will be legally and operationally separate from the post
office, but will utilize i t s infrastructure. The second tranche o f the operation will support
the initiation o f operations o f the new Postal Bank.
95.     Strengthening the regulatory framework o f the microcredit sector. The
operation focuses on the regulatory improvements that will critically enhance the future
effectiveness and performance o f the whole industry. Therefore, the first tranche supports
the issue by the Ministry o f Economy and Finance o f loan classification and provisioning
rules to measure accurately the portfolio problems and ensure adequate provisions, as
well as a the issue by the Central bank on governance, risk management, and internal
controls to avoid the problems observed in recent years.
96.      Set up o f the new housing guarantee fund Damane Assakane to facilitate
sustainable access o f low and middle income households to housing finance. The
first tranche supports the set up o f the new guarantee fund Darnane Assakane, which
benefits from the resources o f a previously under-utilized fund, and operates with risk-
based premiums designed to improve incentives and sustainability. This i s an important
reform component that should contribute to sustainable improvements in access to
housing finance for the poor.

  In Morocco, draft laws are examined in chronological order: (1) by the General Secretariat o f Government
(SGG), an administrative body which assesses the legal compliance and quality o f the text, (2) by the
Council o f Government which regularly gathers all Ministers, and chaired by the Prime Minister (3) by the
Council o f Ministers, which i s chaired by the King; and (4) by the Par1iament:Previous operations showed
that the timelag between the adoption by the Council o f Government and the transmission to Parliament
were relatively short in practice.

                                                   30
Pillar 2: Ensuring Sustainable Improvements in SME access to Finance

97.      Improvements in credit information through introduction of a credit bureau
managed by a private operator. This i s one o f the most important components o f the
reform program, as it will contribute both to enhanced access and more effective risk
management by all credit institutions and MFIs. The first tranche supports the start o f
operations o f the new credit bureau, which took place in October 2009, after a period o f
collection and testing o f databases, including the receipt o f data from 5 MFIs accounting
for at least 33 percent o f all MFI loans. The second tranche supports the broadening of
the credit bureau, the receipt o f data from MFIs accounting for at least 50 percent o f all
MFI loans.
98.      Reform of the Partial Credit Guarantee (PCG) Scheme to improve access of
SME to finance while preserving sound incentives for banks and borrowers. The
first tranche supports the reform o f the PCG scheme and new governance rules for the
CCG. These actions enhance sustainable access by removing obstacles in guarantee
application and approval procedures and focusing on SMEs rather than sectors, while
also improving incentives for good loan origination by granting access o f the CCG to the
credit bureau and conditioning full payment of the guarantee to the banks' efforts in
collecting their debts. The second tranche would support the verification inter alia o f the
internal control and risk management framework through an on-site inspection by the
Central Bank.

Pillar 3: StrengtheningFinancial Regulation and Supervision

99.                                                                          1,
        Strengthening of bank governance. As mentioned in Section 1 1 the Central
Bank i s addressing the risks that have emerged as a result o f the recent credit expansion.
This includes further strengthening o f risk management rules, and the introduction o f new
supervisory tools based o n new information such as a real estate price index. A key
policy action supported by the operation entails an in-depth bank governance review to
assess the architecture and practice o f governance in the main individual banks.
Therefore, under the first tranche, the Central Bank will commit to a comprehensive
review o f the quality o f bank governance following best international practice and
conducted jointly with World Bank staff. The second tranche supports the completion o f
the governance review and the elaboration o f an action plan by the Central Bank to
address the weaknesses identified by the review.
 100. Strengthening of insurance regulation and supervision. The creation o f a new
and independent insurance supervisor addresses a critical weakness in the regulatory and
supervisory architecture. This measure will ensure that the fast growing insurance sector
i s effectively regulated and supervised, thus also ensuring i t s sound future growth. The
first tranche supports the submission to the general General Secretariat o f the
Government (SGG) o f a draft law creating a new and independent insurance supervisor,
while the second tranche would support the adoption by the Council o f Government o f
the draft law establishing the new and independent insurance supervisor.
101. Strengthening of capital market regulation and supervision. The first tranche
supports the submission to the General Secretariat o f Government o f a draft law creating


                                            31
a Capital Market Authority         with strengthened legal, operational and financial
independence. The second tranche supports the adoption by the Council o f Government
o f this draft law. As in the case o f the insurance sector, the aim o f this key policy action
i s to establish a supervisor which i s capable o f addressing the main regulatory
weaknesses and enforcing prudential and investor protection regulations, thus driving the
sound growth o f the market.

Pillar 4: Further Development o f Capital Markets

102. Build up o f a reliable and liquid Treasury bill yield curve that serves as
benchmark for private fixed income instruments and promotes capital market
development. As noted before, the Government i s resuming i t s efforts to build a reliable
and liquid yield curve. This has already included a recent M O U between the Treasury
and the Central Bank that allows for more active cash management and facilitates debt
management, and the introduction o f an electronic auction system that reduces
operational risks and enhances price transparency. Further measures are envisaged for the
future. The proposed operation would support - in the second tranche - the issue o f a
key regulation by the MOF changing the reference rate for the variability o f interest rates
on floating rate credits from Treasury bills to a reference to short term instruments. This
would ensure consistency with best international practice and remove one o f the main
obstacles for issuing long term bonds and building a yield curve.
 103. Introduction of long-term private financial instruments that provide funding
while addressing balance sheet risks. The government's program includes maintained
efforts for the issue o f regulation essential to the entry in force o f the new securitization
law and the submission for comments to relevant stakeholders o f a draft law introducing
covered bonds, thereby enabling more effective funding and risk management o f the
banks' exposures. Covered bonds, an instrument which does not yet exist in Morocco,
are the preferred instrument used to finance housing in several EU countries, as it retains
the incentives for good loan origination, reduces maturity mismatches and reduces credit
risk for investors, thus allowing the financing o f housing at lower rates than ordinary
bonds. With this objective, the second tranche would support the elaboration o f a draft
law by the M O F creating covered bonds to fund housing loans.
 104. Introduction o f a new future market that provides risk management tools for
financial institutions and enterprises. The first tranche would support the adoption by
the Council of Government o f a draft law on the future market establishing a sound
derivatives market that focuses on standardized instruments and follows best practices,
enabling more effective risk management while avoiding the mistakes observed in the
recent crisis.

                  B.     EXPECTED OUTCOMES OF THE OPERATION

105. The operation aims at achieving sustained improvements in access to finance
to individuals and SMEs, while ensuring a resilient and stable financial system.
Capital market development i s an important objective as well, as it contributes both to
access and stability. Evaluating the contribution o f the operation to the achievement o f
i t s long-run objectives requires the selection o f a number o f indicators, including some
indicators measuring the achievement o f intermediate outcomes. The period o f program
evaluation begins in mid-2009, when most figures are available by the time o f appraisal,
and ends in mid-20 11, which i s the expected date o f ICR preparation.
106. By the end of the program, progress in expanding access to individuals would
be reflected in a number of indicators, including increases in the number of
accounts and branches relative to the population (aggregating data from
commercial banks and the Post office).
107. The increase in individuals' access to credit would be reflected in the number
of consultations on individuals in the new credit bureau, as well as the number of
MFI clients. The increase in consultations would provide evidence that banks, MFIs,
and finance companies are using the credit bureau to evaluate the creditworthiness o f a
larger universe o f households. The reduction o f the IMFs' NPL ratio i s an important
intermediate outcome indicator that w i l l also be monitored.
108. Increase in SME access to credit would also be reflected in the number of
consultations on companies in the new credit bureau. Again, this would provide
evidence that banks and finance companies such as leasing companies are using the new
system to evaluate the creditworthiness o f a larger segment o f SMEs. Expanded access
o f SME to finance would also be reflected in an increase in SMEs" share o f banks' total
corporate credit portfolio.
109. Progress in strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework for the
financial system would be reflected in improvements in performance indicators and
measures of institutional development. B y the end o f the program, average capital
adequacy ratios in the banking system should be higher, including the capital ratios o f
public banks, reflecting the regulatory and supervisory actions being implemented by the
Central Bank. The publication o f the new real estate price index i s another important
outcome, as it would prove an important tool o f supervision and market discipline.
 110. Progress in developing further the capital market would first be reflected in
improvements in the functioning of the government debt market. Progress in
building a reliable Treasury bill yield curve, in turn, would be first reflected in the
resumption of medium- and long-term debt issues and the reduced fragmentation o f
Treasury bill debt issues. The increase in the outstanding value o f private fixed income
instruments (with an initial maturity over a year) to GDP (including bank issues).

                                VI.        OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

                                      A.         POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT

111. I n line with OP 8.60, the Bank advised the Moroccan authorities on the need
to undertake consultations on the reform program with the various stakeholders.
The authorities confirmed that the Moroccan Government had been conducting
consultations with the various stakeholders. They also indicated that further consultations
on the reform program underpinning this proposed operation will take place.
112. Consultations on key aspects of Morocco's reform program supported by the
Bank were conducted with key stakeholders (financial institutions, donors, public
authorities, industry associations etc.) throughout the process of preparing the DPL.


                                                                  35
A formal consultation also took place on 8 December 2009 with representatives o f civil
society (microcredit associations, associations representing customers, young
entrepreneurs etc.). Moreover, this D P L which i s fully aligned with the CPS benefit from
the extensive consultations held with civil society and private sector representatives
(including SMEs), the donor community, and Government officials for the preparation of
the CPS.
113. The proposed DPL supports measures that will enhance competitiveness and
growth, access to finance, and financial stability, all of which contribute to positive
social outcomes. The focus o f the operation i s centered on reforms aimed at: (i)ensuring
sustainable improvements in household access to finance, (ii)         ensuring sustainable
improvements in SME access to finance, (iii)       strengthening financial regulation and
supervision, and (iv) developing further capital markets and instruments. As such, none
o f the activities supported by this operation have distributional implications that would
warrant a poverty and social impact analysis (PSIA). Indeed, the reform supported by the
proposed operation has a number o f components that are expected to generate direct
benefits to the lower income segments o f the population, as well as indirect benefits such
as employment opportunities generated through general economic growth and SME
growth in particular.
 114. The Government remains committed to monitoring the distributional impact
of all key policy reforms and economic events. PSIAs have been done in the past or
are planned in the coming months to inform critical policy issues. For example, a PSIA
was completed in 2008 to inform the design o f the solid waste management reform
program and two were done for the water sector reform. In the context o f the envisaged
reform o f the social protection system, Government i s currently evaluating the
distributional impact o f various options including the introduction of subsidized health
insurance and conditional cash transfer programs in education. PSIA i s also foreseen for
the potential reform o f the energy tariff system.

                           B.      ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

 115. The DPL program does not pose any significant environmental effects. I t i s a
development policy credit in support of a broad program o f policy and institutional
reforms, for which the environmental requirements o f O P B P 8.60 apply. However,
none o f the activities supported by the program pose any likely and significant effects on
the environment and natural resources. Furthermore, the Bank's overall strategy focuses
on strengthening o f the Government's legislative and institutional capacity to address
environment and natural resource management through a dedicated large portfolio o f
analytical and operational activities.

            C.      IMPLEMETATION, MONITORING, AND EVALUATION

116. The responsibility for implementing the program rests with the Ministry o f
Finance, in collaboration with the Central Bank. The Government will take the lead
in monitoring progress in implementation and in updating the program policy matrix as
appropriate. The Ministry o f Finance i s coordinating inputs from all the relevant
authorities. Bank staff will continue to maintain dialogue with the key counterparts and


                                           36
the relevant sector ministries and will conduct periodic reviews in close coordination
with the AfDB. In this context, dialogue and joint reviews will continue to focus on the
impact outcomes o f the program and eventual adjustments that may be to take into
account the latest country developments, stakeholder support, and feasible options for
realizing the intended development goals. Consequently, specific attention will be
devoted to monitoring indicators and goals o f the program.

                                D.      FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

117. N o major fiduciary issues are expected for the proposed DPL. The Moroccan
public administration operates in a structured and reliable control environment.
118. Financial Management Diagnostics and Risk Rating: In response to the
government request, the Bank issued a Country Financial Accountability Assessment
(CFAA) update in 2007 following the first C F A A o f 2003. Like the first one, the C F A A
update assessed the Moroccan public sector fiduciary risks as low. Morocco's public
finance system i s governed by a well-developed legal and regulatory framework, and
generally provides adequate reliability and transparency. This system i s predicated on
the principle o f the strict separation o f the roles o f payment authorizer ("ordonnateur '7
and public accountant, who are financially responsible to the Audit Office, and on the
principles governing ex ante expenditure control and internal and external audits. The
rating i s due in large part to the steady and continued Government efforts and major
reforms to modernize and improve the efficiency o f the public sector including the
public financial management o f the past several years. These reforms are still ongoing.
 119. The CFAA update recommended improvements in a number of areas;
including (a) reducing the delays to produce the year end government financial
statements and accounts and the audited accounts by the Auditor General ("Cour des
Comptes"), (b) further simplification o f the a priori internal controls while continuing
the strengthening of the ex-post controls and internal audit already underway, and (c)
continuing the progress in the Management Information System. Public financial
management reforms to further enhance the efficiency o f the public financial system
remain central to the government reform program, C F A A recommendations have been
integrated in the agenda and progress in implementation has taken place.

120. Funds Flow. Morocco has had no safeguards assessment by the IMF. However,
over the many years o f working with the Moroccan government, the Bank has had no
major fiduciary issues in relation to the funds flow. The Government budget i s
comprehensive, unified and subject to centralized treasury account. Cash flow and debt
are professionally managed by the Treasury Department o f the Ministry o f Finance
under generally satisfactory conditions. Loan proceeds are deposited in a government
designated account at the Central Bank and transferred to the Treasury single account for
government budget.

operation.



                             E.        DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

121. The proposed loan would be in an amount o f 133.1 million EUR, with two
tranches. Upon effectiveness, front end fees of 0.3 will be paid from loan proceeds.
The first tranche in the amount o f 88.6 million EUR would be disbursed following
Board approval, which will be conditional on the realization o f specific reforms and
compliance with the tranche and withdrawal conditions in the legal agreement. The
attached draft policy matrix lays out the proposed conditions for each tranche. The
approved tranches will not be linked to any specific purchases, and no procurement
requirements will be needed. The loan proceeds will be deposited by the IBRD in an
account designated by the Borrower and acceptable to the World Bank at the Central
Bank o f Morocco (Bank A1 Maghrib). The Borrower should ensure that upon deposit o f


                                                    38
the Loan proceeds into said account an equivalent amount i s credited in the Borrower's
budget. The loan proceeds will be administered by the MOF.
122.   Although an audit of the use o f the funds may not be required, IBRD
reserves the right to require audits of the deposit account at any time.
123.    The proposed two-tranche structure of the operation reflects the Bank's and
the authorities' assessment that the proposed reform program represents a
consistent and self-reinforcing package to be implemented over a 12 to 18 month
timeframe. In this context, the first tranche aims at locking in as soon as possible a set o f
irreversible policy measures and at supporting the reform momentum. The second tranche
conditions encompass measures which require more time for preparation and will deepen
the structural changes.

                            F.      RISK AND R I S K MITIGATION

124. I n the short term, Morocco i s confronted with uncertainties on the timing
and speed of the recovery from the global crisis. While there are encouraging signs of
an end to the crisis, it i s too early to predict how the global economy will emerge from
the recession, particularly in the EU, Morocco's key international partner. Consequently,
i t i s not yet clear to what extent Morocco will continue to be confronted with the impact
o f the economic slowdown on exports, remittances, FDI flows, and the sustainability of
i t s public stimulus program. The economic risks are mitigated through continued strong
macroeconomic management and Morocco's track record suggests that it is well placed
to face the current uncertainties. The Bank will help mitigate this risk through continued
monitoring and dialogue with the authorities on the overall macroeconomic context, as
well as analysis o f options for remedial measures as eventually requested by the
Government.
125. A deterioration of the credit portfolios of some institutions could jeopardize
expected improvements in access. Although non-performing loans seem to be leveling
o f f in the microcredit industry, further deterioration cannot be ruled out, especially if
urban unemployment i s to rise. However, the Government has proved i t s resolve to
handle the situation and has taken measures to strengthen the capacity o f the microcredit
institutions to grow in a sustainable way. Likewise, the slowdown o f non-agriculture
output may put some stress in bank portfolios, but the government has also taken
measures to strengthen the banks' solvency and their capacity to manage new risks.
 126. The resumption of long-term Treasury bill issues may imply some increase in
the reference rate for existing mortgage holders. The link between long-term bond
rates and floating rate mortgages was one o f the reasons why the government stopped
issuing long-term Treasury bills at the start o f the crisis, when long term rates increased
and the effects o f the crisis were uncertain. However, the current policy o f keeping
interest rates on floating mortgages constant by not issuing long-term Treasury bills i s
simply not sustainable from a debt management perspective. The envisaged change in the
reference rate for new mortgages (fiom Treasury bills rates to a reference to short term
instruments) i s aligned with international practice and essential for sound debt
management. Existing mortgage holders may experience some increase in mortgage
payments as long-term Treasury bill issues resume, but the impact i s likely to moderate


                                             39
for several reasons. First, floating mortgages account for less than half o f total mortgages.
Second, long-term rates have declined significantly relative to crisis levels. Third, the
average ratio o f debt service to income i s moderate. Finally, l o w income mortgage
holders have benefitted from fixed rate mortgages covered by the housing subsidy
scheme (floating rate mortgages are not eligible to this scheme).
127. T h e Government may experience difficulties in having specific capital
market reforms approved. Critical implementing regulations for the new securitization
law have not yet been approved by the Council o f Ministers because o f the opinion issued
by the Auditor general ("Cour des comptes") emphasizing the negative role played by
complex securitizations in the current global financial crisis. In the wake o f this crisis,
more caution towards new market mechanism may emerge (e.g. securitization or future
market). The government is addressing this risk by introducing only new instruments
which are simple, tested and bring clear benefits to the country, by setting up appropriate
prudential regulations to reduce risks and by reaching out to all concerned parties.

                                Development Policy Letter



Mr. President,

Since the early 1990s, the Kingdom o f Morocco has been engaged in a process o f
thorough modernization o f i t s financial sector. As a result o f the government's resolve
and o f the dynamism o f the private sector, significant progress has been made. The
Moroccan Government initiated a new phase o f reform to sustainably strengthen financial
access for individuals and small and medium enterprises, as well as financial sector
development. We would like the World Bank to accompany us in this important phase o f
reform, as was successfully done in the past (including .as part o f a financial sector
development policy loan in 2005).

1. Characteristics o f the financial sector

Morocco has made very substantial progress in developing i t s financial sector in the past
five years, with financial institutions' total assets now exceeding 200% o f GDP. This
success has been made possible by the sound macroeconomic policies implemented b y
the Moroccan Government and by the important financial sector reforms carried out
earlier in the decade (especially, restructuring o f state-owned banks and strengthening o f
financial supervision and infrastructure).

Thanks to these reforms, all banks' performances are now satisfactory with rapid credit
growth associated with a good management o f all risks, a strengthening o f credit
institutions' financial strength (solvency and profitability especially) and the vigilant and
proactive supervision o f Bank A1 Maghrib. Morocco i s also a regional leader for
microcredit and the authorities promptly reacted when problems in asset quality
appeared, so as to ensure the sustainability o f this industry. The Government will
maintain i t s efforts as part o f this Program. Eventually, the international financial crisis
validated Moroccan choices in terms o f financial sector development. This sector was not
directly affected by this crisis and proved i t s capacity to maintain a sound development in
a difficult environment
                                                                                 ANNEX I
UNOFFICIAL TRANSLATED TEXT                                                       Page 2 o 5
                                                                                        f



2. Governement' stratew

The Government intends to maintain its efforts to develop and modernize all components
the Moroccan financial sector. It i s fblly aware that additional reforms are necessary to
broaden financial access, while ensuring that all necessary mechanisms for good risk
management are in place. Rapid credit growth contributed to the country's growth and
facilitated financial access for a growing number o f Moroccan companies and
individuals, but many l o w income individuals and small and medium enterprises (SME)
s t i l l face difficulties to access such services. Moreover, the global financial crisis
highlighted the increased importance o f reform and the need to strengthen financial
infrastructure and regulation to ensure sustainable improvements in access to finance.

In this regard, the Government largely took into account the analyses and
recommendations o f the Financial Sector Assessment Program undertaken in 2007 to
build a new program o f financial reforms which efficiently addresses the two objectives
o f access and stability. The first pillar contains measures designed to ensure sustainable
improvements in individuals' access to finance and the second pillar consists o f measures
to ensure improvements in SME access to finance.                The third pillar includes
improvements in financial regulation and supervision, fostering an early identification
and management o f risks. The fourth pillar covers further development o f capital markets
and contributes both to access and stability, by strengthening competition for banks and
introducing better instruments to manage risks.

3. Government's Program

The Government's program i s based on the following four pillars:

(a) First pillar: Ensuring sustainable improvement in access tofinance for households

The Government intends to accelerate progress in financial access for individuals thanks
to the creation o f A1 Barid Bank. This new bank will start operations in 2010 and will
complement services offered by other banks. The gradual development o f its operations,
the quality o f internal control and governance frameworks as well as supervision carried
out by Bank A1 Maghrib will guarantee good risk management by this new bank. The
Government will maintain i t s efforts to ensure the sustainable development o f the
microcredit industry, which i s an important component o f the financial system with over
a million customers. The unprecedented growth o f this sector revealed weaknesses, as
shown inter alia by an increase in non-performing loans. This situation is being closely
monitored by the Moroccan authorities who initiated the strengthening o f the regulatory
                                                                                       ANNEX 1
UNOFFICIAL TRANSLATED TEXT                                                             Page 3 o 5
                                                                                               f


framework o f the microcredit sector (especially regulations on classification and
provisioning, as well as risk management and governance). More broadly, the Moroccan
authorities are working in close cooperation with all stakeholders to make possible a
sustainable and smooth evolution o f the microcredit industry.
Eventually, the Government i s strengthening measures allowing l o w income households
to access housing finance. A mortgage loan guarantee scheme (Damane Assakane) was
set up in 2009, which leverage on the success o f FOGARIM, which it absorbed. I t s
increased resources and improved risk mechanisms will facilitate access to home
ownership for poor people, as well as the middle class. Moreover, the Government has
started thinking about housing savings products which would facilitate access to
mortgage loans and ensure a good control o f risks.

(6) Second Pillar: Ensuring sustainable improvement in access to finance for small
and medium enterprises

The establishment o f a credit bureau i s a key measure which complements other
initiatives which aim to reduce the access to finance constraints s t i l l faced by part o f the
population as well as SMEs. I t will allow them to build their credit history, while
providing financial institutions with the necessary information and tools to screen
borrowers and efficiently manage risks. The credit bureau has commenced i t s operations
and its impact should gradually become evident in 2010 as i t s operations develop.
Beyond credit institutions, the Government supports the gradual inclusion o f microcredit
associations in the credit bureau, which will benefit their customers and foster better risk
management in the industry. The Government has initiated the reform o f the credit
guarantee scheme for companies, allowing sound improvement in access to credit for a
larger number o f SMEs. This comprehensive reform o f the existing scheme and o f i t s
management will result in a better selection o f borrowers and a strengthened efficiency o f
the system.
Eventually, new mechanisms will be introduced to support the development o f growth or
mature SMEs through improved availability o f private equity. The government i s
contemplating introducing new mechanisms to foster private equity investments in SMEs
(a public private fund, a new dedicated guarantee fund and possible amendments to the
private equity law).

(c) Third Pillar: Strengthening the regulatory and supervisory architecture

The Government intends to maintain i t s efforts to strengthen the Moroccan framework
for financial stability, based on international best practices. With the support o f the World
Bank, Morocco was the first MENA country to carry out a crisis preparedness and crisis
                                                                                    ANNEX I
UNOFFICIAL TRANSLATED TEXT                                                          Page 4 o 5
                                                                                            f



management exercise in April 2009. Over the short term, the Government will initiate the
necessary measures to implement operational improvements identified at the end o f this
exercise. The Government and the Central Bank intend to agree on procedures and
information exchange mechanisms between the different stakeholders in time o f systemic
financial crisis. Moreover, i t will keep monitoring developments in international best
practices in this area, with a view to assess the opportunity o f larger scale changes over
the medium term.

After the implementation o f major reforms in the mid-2000s, the authorities intend to
maintain the constant efforts to adapt banking supervision so that it remains on top o f
changes in banking risks and international best practices. An independent bank
governance review will be conducted in 2010 with World Bank support to assess the
banks' capacity to address the risks they face. In addition, the implementation o f Base1 2
remains high on the agenda o f the Central Bank with a short term emphasis on Pillar 2
(the supervisory review). Eventually, the Central Bank will publish, in 2010, a new real
estate price index, which will be used to assess changes in banking risks.

Aware o f the need to protect our financial sector from diverse risks which could weaken
i t s strength and knowing that such a goal requires the consolidation o f financial
regulatory and supervisory bodies, the authorities plan to undertake, in 2010 if the
respective draft laws are passed by Parliament, the revamp o f the legal and regulatory
framework applicable to the regulatory authorities responsible for the capital market and
insurance sectors ; the ultimate objective being to set up independent supervisory bodies,
fully capable o f meeting the need for efficient regulation, adapted to the requirements o f
a rapidly growing market and complying with international best practices and standards.
With respect to capital markets, improved investor protection remains a priority and the
strengthening o f the governance o f the stock exchange will be pursued through the
opening o f the capital o f this institution which will foster the increased participation o f
key stakeholders o f the sector in i t s development strategy. Eventually, a new detailed
roadmap for the period 2009-2014 will be finalized with the insurance industry. In the
short term, the introduction o f an investment regime consistent with an evolution towards
risk based capital requirements will be examined to avoid excessive exposures to specific
asset classes (e.g. equity).

d) Fourth Pillar: Further strengthening the development o capital markets
                                                         f

The Government intends to strengthen i t s efforts to build a more liquid and reliable

platform, a modification o f the reference rate for interest rates on floating rate loans will
take place in 2010, easing long term issuance by the Treasury.
The Government wants to broaden the range o f instruments available to Moroccan
institutions to manage their risks. The Government will prepare the introduction o f
covered bonds, so as to facilitate a decrease in maturity mismatch and create resources
for the funding o f mortgage loans at lower rates.
The Government also wants to attract more investors to the stock market, to increase the
number o f listed companies and turn the Moroccan market into a regional player.
Improving investor protection i s at the core o f the program o f the Government, which
intends to reinforce i t s recent efforts b y establishing detailed rules. In addition to existing
measures, the Government expects that strengthened market integrity, marketing efforts
towards large private companies and improved listing conditions will attract new
companies to the market.
The Government tabled in Parliament a text establishing the foundations o f a futures
market allowing Moroccan companies to better hedge their risks. K e y decisions on the
implementation o f these provisions will be taken once the law i s enacted (e.g. types o f
contracts, clearing house, managment, prudential framework etc.) and the Government
will ensure that relevant financial supervisors take necessary measures to avoid any
excessive risk-taking by financial and non-financial firms. The market should be
launched after 2010 and will only cover a limited number o f standardized contracts
related to liquid underlying instruments.

These are, Mr. President, the main directions o f this new phase in the ongoing process to
reform and modernize our financial sector, whose implementation will contribute to
strengthened savings mobilization and improved financing conditions within the
economy, supporting strong and sustainable growth.

We would like to thank you for your valuable support in the implementation o f this
ambitious program.

Very truly yours,

          ANNEX 1 1
                 1.         OVERVIEW OF THE BANKING SECTOR



1.      The Moroccan banking system i s concentrated, but appears competitive. Two
well-established local private banks (Attijariwafa and Banque Marocaine du Commerce
Exte'rieure, BMCE) and a public and mutual group (Cre'dit Populaire du Maroc, CPM)
control almost two thirds o f bank assets. Smaller foreign-owned banks (mostly French-
controlled) and public banks are also active and spur competition. However, market
entries are rare. Before two large Spanish banks set up branches in 2009, prior entries had
mostly taken the form o f buying into existing banks.
2.      Public banks still have a significant role, but do not distort market
mechanisms. The Government plays a key role in three large banks: the CPM and two
smaller institutions which restructuring was supported by the 2005 Financial sector DPL
(Cre'dit Immobilier e t Hbtelier, CIH, and Cre'dit Agricole du Maroc, CAM). The
Government wields significant influence in the CPM group thanks to statutory provisions
and control o f more than 50% o f Banque Centrale Populaire (BCP), a large bank and the
apex for eleven regional mutual banks. The CPM group i s one o f the three largest
Moroccan banks with a 22% market share, while CIH and C A M have a combined share
o f 13% in 2008. The soundness o f CIH and C A M improved dramatically since 2005: (i)
solvency was restored with capital adequacy ratios respectively at 14.1% and 7.4% in
2008, while they both had negative equity in 2005 and (ii) performing loans (NPLs)
                                                            non
declined significantly (19.4% in 2008 compared to 40% in 2005 for CIH and 14.2% and
21.3% respectively for CAM) while their coverage improved.
3.      Banks took advantage of an environment of abundant liquidity to grow their
portfolio while improving their capacity to mobilize resources and strengthening
their risk management capacities. Abundant liquidity was fuelled by tourism receipt
and remittances, and also benefited from the rapid expansion o f banking networks (3,138
branches in 2008, +41% in four years).
4.      Bank soundness markedly improved with declining non performing loans
and improved solvency thanks to initiatives from the Central bank. At the same time,
banks risk profiles significantly changed and a deterioration o f the quality o f asset
portfolios following a period o f rapid growth remains a possibility.

               ANNEX IV.             THE INSURANCE AND PENSION SECTOR

1. Overview o f the Insurance Sector
1.     Morocco has the second largest insurance market in Africa after South Africa.
With total premia and assets amounting to 3 and 18 percent o f GDP, respectively,
Morocco sits well above i t s benchmark as determined by i t s GDPhapita, size, and
population density. This relative success reflects a number o f factors including:
        The existence o f well policed mandatory insurance classes - including motor third
        e

        party, workman's compensation (WCA), professional liability and mortgage
        related coverages.
    e   The historical major role the sector has played in providing comprehensive health
        insurance, although this role i s likely to be modified;
    e   The rapid emergence o f banc-assurance.
    e   A stable political environment.
    e   A stable macroeconomic framework, in particular the low rate o f inflation (high
        inflation i s problematic for life and personal lines o f non l i f e insurance).
    e An excellent, and relatively unique, working relationship between the industry
        and regulatory authorities.
2.      The sector has historically derived i t s approach to products and regulatory norms
from France although the market also reflects local conditions. There are 17 licensed
insurers in the market o f which one (La Marocaine Vie) specializes in life, 11 are
grandfathered composites (including 3 mutual insurers)", 3 are assistance companies, 1
is a specialist credit risk underwriter and 1 i s the national reinsurer (SCR). The industry
has recently seen two 'mergers', one o f which involved an effective takeover o f a
troubled institution and the top 5 insurers now account for more than 90 percent o f the
premium.
3.       Two o f the larger insurers (AXA and RMA Watanya) have significant French
insurance interests. The largest insurer i s now WAFA following a portfolio transfer from
AXA and the rapid growth o f i t s banc-assurance business in partnerships with
Attijariwafa Bank and the Post Office. WAFA has O N A as a significant shareholder. The
second largest insurer RMA Watanya has B M C E bank and A C M (France) as
shareholders. C D G and the industrial group Holmarcom each have a 40 percent interest
in Atlanta and Sanaad. C D G is also a major shareholder in SCR. Societe GenCrale has an
interest in La Marocaine Vie.
4.      Distribution i s through brokers (approximately 300), tied and semi-tied agents
(approximately 1,000) and bank branches (approximately 2,780 counters not including
the post office, and dominated by the Cre'dit populaire du Maroc, Attijariwafa Bank and
BMCE). Brokers and agents need to be accredited through examination. The postal
service also distributes some socially desirable classes such as health. At present banks
are restricted to life, assistance, credit, and health and accident, and already account for

IO
     A decree issued early in 2006 bans the issue o f any further composite licenses.

                                                                                    Page 2 o I1
                                                                                           f

more nearly 70% o f l i f e and assistance insurance sales. The largest class, motor (90% o f
which i s mandatory third party insurance) i s mainly handled by agents. A relatively high
commission rate on mandatory motor insurance o f 12% of premium applies, although
commission levels have been liberalized for some time.
5.     The insurance industry has shown remarkable growth in recent years (Table 1).
This has been largely in the l i f e account following the introduction o f banc-assurance
under the new 2002 Code. However the growth o f the mortgage market has also been a
factor. L i f e sales growth has come largely from sales to individuals through bank
branches. There i s some concern that some policyholders do not fully understand the
contract terms, despite the efforts to introduce consumer protection regulations.

6.       Total assets o f insurance companies amounted to 120 billion MAD in 2008, or the
equivalent o f 18 percent o f GDP, a very high ratio for a country with Morocco's per
capita income, and by far the highest ratio in the MENA region. Financial assets under
management by the sector reached 96.49 billion MAD in the same period. The
composition o f the financial investments o f insurance companies i s not entirely clear.
Estimates based on available data point to approximately 30% o f aggregate insurer assets
being in equities and property. However discussions with the sector indicate that the
equity portfolio has in the recent past been substantially higher for some insurers. This i s
in part due to the absence o f risk-based capital requirements.

2. Overview o f the Pension Sector
7.       The Moroccan pension system consists primarily o f four major pension schemes -
also called pension funds or "Caisses de Retraite" - that cover formal private sector
workers, c i v i l servants, the military, employees o f state owned enterprises and other
public bodies. These pension funds include the CNSS (Caisse Nationale de Securitk
Sociale), the basic scheme for private formal sector workers, the C M R (Caisse
Marocaine de Retraite) for tenured civil servants and the military, the R C A R (Rkgime
Collectif d 'Allocation de Retraite) for employees o f para-statal organizations, and the
                                                                                                          ANNEX I V
                                                                                                          Page 3 o 11
                                                                                                                  f

           CIMR (Caisse Interprofessionelle de Marocaine de Retraite), which i s a non-
           governmental supplementary fund.
           8.      The CNSS (2.5 million affiliates), the CMR (800 thousand affiliates), and the
           RCAR (200 thousand affiliates) are mandatory, although they cover less than 30 percent
           o f the labor force due to labor informality. The C I M R (250 thousand affiliates) i s
           voluntary and complementary. The CNSS and the C M R operate defined benefit schemes
           financed o n a pay-as-you-go (PAYG), while the R C A R operate both a defined
           contribution plan and a defined benefit plan, also financed on a PAYG basis.
           9.      Morocco does not have private pension funds o f significant size, but its four
           major pension schemes have accumulated a large volume o f assets (Table 2), due to their
           surpluses and the policy o f prefunding o f future PAYG liabilities. The R C A R assets
           back both i t s defined benefit plan and i t s defined contribution plan. The assets o f the
           CNSS and the R C A R are managed by the C D G (Caisse de DkpGt et de Gestion) while the
           assets o f the CMR and the CIMR are managed internally.

for more liquid assets and shorter durations. The C D G has indicated that this switch
takes into consideration the possibility o f reforms that would preserve the surpluses o f the
C M R for a longer period.
 12.    Together, the assets o f the insurance and pension sectors in Morocco amount to
about 38 percent o f GDP, by far the largest ratio in the MENA region. The two sectors
have the capacity to absorb a large volume o f financial assets issued by domestic
financial and non-financial institutions and promote further more capital market
development. This capacity has been to some extent under-utilized due to the
insufficiency o f prudential rules reducing the duration mismatch o f both banks and
insurance companies. However, the ongoing efforts o f the Central Bank to reduce banks'
maturity mismatch, and the plans o f the insurance regulator to migrate towards risk-based
capital requirements (see below) should promote the supply and demand for assets with
longer duration. The current plans o f the two major pension funds should have a similar
effect.
13.          The taxation o f longer term savings broadly follows international norms, although
s t i l l being some way from the EET ideal. In practice a TTT system applies but with the
exit tax reducing considerably (in some cases to zero) when a contract has been
maintained for more than 8 years (recently reduced from 10 years). A project i s currently
underway to examine further strategies to encourage long term savings.

3.      Regulation and Supervision
 14.   Supervision o f insurance and pensions i s currently carried out through an arm o f
the Ministry o f Finance and Privatization called DAPS (Direction des Assurances et de la
Pre'voyance Sociale). This unit has a staff o f 150 of which approximately two thirds are
technical operatives. Costs are met by levies on the industry which go into general
revenues.
 15.        As noted, DAPS has the benefit o f a relatively modern insurance law passed in
2002 and which became largely effective with the issuance o f relevant regulations and
circulars by the end o f 2005, although the Minister o f Finance has wide powers to change
some regulatory parameters. Conservative assumptions are applied under the law in
establishing technical reserves including a maximum technical interest rate o f 3.75% for
l i f e rating and reserving purposes (the current technical interest rate i s 2.75%). Solvency
rules broadly follow current EU practice, although they were recently modified to allow a
proportion o f unrealized capital gains to be included in net assets for solvency purposes.
 16.   A Consultative Committee consisting o f representatives o f the insurance industry
(including intermediaries), CDG, MOF, a representative o f the National Council for
Prevention o f Road Accidents and a financially qualified magistrate has had to date
oversight o f new regulatory developments, sanctions and the issuance o f new licenses.
This committee will be disbanded under a new draft law to set up an independent
insurance supervisory body, and more targeted consultative arrangements will take i t s
place.
17.    Accounting standards in Morocco do not differentiate between SAP (statutory
accounting standards) and G A A P (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles). These can
be quite different in industrial countries as the former assumes a wind up scenario (Le.
                                                                                   ANNEX I V
                                                                                   Page 5 o I1
                                                                                          f

having a balance sheet orientation) and the latter primarily attempts to identify economic
earnings. Moroccan banks broadly follow international standards and listed holding
companies have the option. Individual companies other than banks have to follow
Moroccan standards which s t i l l adopt a historical cost approach.
18.    Accounting standards for insurance and pensions are promulgated by DAPS. At
present listed equities and mutual funds are held at market or quoted value. Historical
cost accounting applies t o the remaining financial assets including: (i)  Government debt
and dept guaranteed by the government held directly; (ii)   Certificates o f deposit; and (iii)
Bank bonds. This approach appears to arise from a view that it should not be possible
over time to see a profit or loss from a fixed interest security issued at face value. Thus
any realized losses or profits (after tax) need to be taken to a special capital reserve and
are not available for distribution, although they are available in part to support insurer
solvency ratios.
19.     Another area where a graduated approach i s being taken i s the introduction o f
Takaful insurance. Rather than introduce Sharya law to the financial sector, Morocco has
created substantial scope for the creation o f mutual insurers. This i s in contrast to a
number o f other Islamic countries, particularly in the GCC, but does not appear to have
affected the growth o f the insurance sector. In discussions with the insurers it became
clear that the broad logic for the development o f the sector i s linked to compulsory
insurance and banks' clients.

4.     Current Reforms
20.      Although the insurance sector has grown in recent years, the Government i s aware
o f the regulatory and supervisory weaknesses and the need to ensure the sound growth o f
the sector, especially the fast growing l i f e sector. The prudential regulation o f the
insurance sector i s not a trivial matter as attested by the complex technical discussions
surrounding the introduction o f Solvency I1 in the EU. Morocco is making an effort to
harmonize i t s regulatory framework with the EU. Progress towards this goal will require
inter alia a more stable supervisory framework and enhanced supervisory capacity.
Establishment o an independent insurance supervisor
               f
21.     The Government has recognized the need for more supervisory independence
through a draft law that creates a new and independent supervisor and which currently
sits with the Secretariat o f the Government. The draft law gives the new authority
("Autorite` de ContrGle des Assurances et de la Pre`voyance Sociale ") statutory control
over insurance, pension funds (subject to any specific laws) and annuity providers.
22.    The draft law i s well structured and provides a reasonable regulatory balance
between the supervisor (who should have basic technical regulatory authority) and the
Ministry (which should retain power over policy matters). In practice, most Ministerial
level decisions will follow recommendations emanating from the Authority and the
Ministry will maintain oversight through a government commissioner.
23.    The authority will be structured around a Board (Conseil), a President (appointed
under Article 30 o f the Censtitution) and two commissions. The Board will act much as
a normal oversight body, setting overall policy, approving the annual report and budget,
                                                                                    ANNEX I V
                                                                                    Page 6 o 11
                                                                                            f

designating the external auditor, approving the accounts, setting remuneration, and
deciding the organization chart and Director level appointees (on the President's
recommendation). The Council will consist o f the President o f the Authority, the Vice
Governor o f the Central bank, Bank Al-Maghrib, the Director o f the Treasury, the
Director General o f the securities supervisor and three experts in insurance or pensions
(four year terms, renewable once). The Board will meet at least twice a year, although
any 3 members can call an ad hoc meeting.
24.   The President i s responsible to the Board for information flows and may delegate
management responsibilities to his staff. In the event the President i s impeached the
Bank Al- Maghrib Vice Governor or Director general would fill in.
25.      A sanctioning commission (Commission de Discipline) will advise the President
o f the Authority on such matters as sanctions to be applied and recovery plans submitted
by insurers and pension funds. It will consist o f two o f the experts from the Board plus a
third person expert in this specific area, a representative o f the insurance and reinsurance
sector, a representative o f mutual societies (only present for discussions concerning
mutuals) and a representative o f the pensions sector (again only present when matters
relevant to their sector are being discussed). The Commission can take testimony from
outside experts, the party concerned or their legal representatives. Only the specialist
member will be remunerated for services rendered. Recourse against decisions o f the
Authority will be available via the Rabat administrative tribunal.
26.     A regulatory commission will advise the President o f the Authority on proposed
legal and regulatory matters. This consists o f two representatives o f the Authority (acting
as president and vice president o f this commission), 6 representatives o f the insurance
and reinsurance sector, 2 representatives o f the intermediaries. One representative o f the
credit grantors, 2 to 4 representatives o f the pension sector, 4 representatives o f mutual
societies and 2 representatives o f the compulsory health insurance sector. The insurance
sector, intermediaries and credit grantors are able to designate their representatives. As a
general rule, representatives may only attend sessions related to their sector.
27.   The Authority will be financed from the markets it supervises (as i s the Insurance
Department already) and will be permitted to reserve up to three years o f recent average
expenditure.
28.    Discussions with the industry evinced a general concern over the demise of the
current consultative body, the creation o f the sanctions commission and the loss o f
industry oversight o f new license applications. However the M O F Insurance Department
Director has made it clear that the sanctions commission will effectively be an
independent decision making body (although the industry representative's input will be
advisory only - he or she will not have a vote). In addition, the recourse mechanism
appears consistent with good international practice.
Program Contract between the Sector and the Government (2009 - 2014)
29.   It has been pointed out that the relative success o f the Moroccan insurance sector
can in part be attributed to the close coordination that has existed between the
government and the sector, and a forward looking approach when it comes to approval o f
                                                                                  ANNEX I V
                                                                                  Page 7 o I1
                                                                                         f

innovative marketing mixes. The introduction o f banc-assurance i s one good example o f
this - although market conduct standards may need to be examined.
30.     The next phase o f this coordination will be effected through a Contract Program
to be agreed between the sector and the government. Formally this entails a document
laying out the commitments and roles o f the various parties in the presence o f the King
and the Prime Minister. The production o f this contract i s being coordinated by the M O F
and as a starting point a report laying out all o f the relevant issues and possible reform
actions was commissioned from Oliver Wyman (an arm o f Marsh) and Actuaria (a
French actuarial consultant). The report lists 75 measures covering product development,
compulsory classes, prudential controls, investment rules, internal controls and risk
management, internationalization and implementation. Most measures are sensible
although there i s probably too much emphasis on the addition o f new compulsory classes,
and the introduction o f modern risk management and prudential standards i s allowed a
rather generous timeframe.

5.     Main Issues that will be Addressed by Program - Contract
Insurance and pension sector Asset and Liability Management (ALM) and risk
coverage - capital market linkages
31.     Measures 33 to 36 o f the draft program contract deals with prudential matters.
The contract anticipates a transfer by 2013 o f safety margins requirements from asset
coverage o f conservative technical reserves to capital standards (i.e. to a solvency margin
determined by a Risk-based Capital, RBC, formula). One initiative already underway
will see the sector installing formal internal control systems (envisaged by a 2008
Circular) by December 2010. Others see ALM and risk management processes being
introduced over the next 3 years. A the same time, the Program Contract sees excess
asset coverage o f reserves being reduced, limits on equity investments being withdrawn
and assets eligible to cover technical reserves being extended to include equity in foreign
insurance subsidiaries. These latter proposals will be carefully considered, as some are
probably undesirable.
32.     One highly desirable recommendation sees the establishment o f a recognized
actuarial role and in particular a requirement that a responsible actuary sign o f f on
insurers' accounts.
33.      The proportion o f technical liability coverage that can be invested in listed
equities was increased from 50% to 60% in a decision issued in March 2009. Given the
                                                                        2008
scope provided b y the estimated asset allocation as at December 3 lst, it i s not clear
why this step was seen as being necessary. However the implication i s that some insurers
may wish to have up to 60% o f relevant assets in listed equities - a risky strategy given
that most liabilities o f the Moroccan insurance sector involve contingent guarantees. If a
comprehensive R B C regime were already in place there would be grounds for liberalizing
investment rules for insurers - however the current solvency regime i s based largely on
EU Solvency Iwhich assumes a conservative investment portfolio and caters largely for
liability side risk.
34.   In the circumstances there is recognition o f the need to establish an interim
regime while the new prudential regime i s being developed and implemented. Two
                                                                                     ANNEX ZV
                                                                                     Page 8 o I1
                                                                                             f

possible approaches are to a) reduce the limits on risky investments or b) to add asset
loadings to the current liability based minimum solvency level. The major insurers
appear to be well capitalized and the latter approach would ensure that a larger proportion
o f their net assets were secured against asset value fluctuations.
Limited operational andfinancial control o Long Tail insurance classes- MTPL and
                                          f
Workman 's Compensation
35.     Aside from the potential for high exposures to risky investments the major risk
facing the insurance sector i s the potential volatility (and even secular decline) o f
technical underwriting results from long tail classes o f non l i f e insurance - in particular
compulsory third party motor and workman's compensation. M T P L and W C A account
for two thirds o f gross non l i f e premiums in Morocco and a larger proportion o f technical
reserves. Morocco i s one o f the ten worst countries in the world for motor related deaths
relative to vehicle usage. Public transport experience i s particularly bad and a separate
insurer (CAT) set up for this market segment and owned by all participating insurers has
been in operation since 1992.
36.        An increasing frequency o f losses has rendered these classes marginal in terms o f
profit. In addition there i s chronic under reporting o f payrolls by employers and W C A
premium revenues are either inadequate or rates need to become artificially high. These
two classes are also subject to legal and social trends and economic conditions: implicit
pure premiums can change significantly over short periods and the current minimum non
l i f e solvency margin i s almost certainly inadequate to cover even liability risk alone. In
order to be able to respond it i s critical that the industry has access to a consolidated and
up to date database and relevant analytical capabilities (Le. actuarial skills).
37.    Other identified factors in controlling these classes are active risk control (e.g.
safe driver campaigns and industrial safety measures) and professional claims
management. In most industrial countries the insurance sector plays an active role on the
loss control front. Finally there i s a need to ensure compliance with the relevant laws by
all drivers/ employers, and to control fraud.
38.     While premium setting for these important classes was partially deregulated in
2006 (however very limited use o f rating factors i s permitted for motor - only fuel type
and power level may be employed) the industry i s not really prepared for, or permitted, to
act as a fully liberalized market. In particular there i s a need to establish a clean and
complete claims and exposure database and to introduce relevant actuarial methodology -
the insurers association has initiated a project along these lines. This in turn will mean
training the sector in the maintenance o f appropriate policy and claims records and
establishing an affective central database manager and electronic data transfer
capabilities.
Statutory and financial accounting standards
39.     As noted, Morocco does not differentiate between financial and statutory
accounting standards. Most standards are promulgated by the Conseil National de la
ComptabilitC (CNC). However banking and insurance accounting standards are
established by the relevant supervisory bodies. Accounting standards for banks broadly
follow EU standards (Le. are close to international standards).
                                                                                         ANNEX ZV
                                                                                         Page 9 o I 1
                                                                                                 f

40.     In contrast insurance accounting methodology, which was most recently
reaffirmed under Articles 38 through 40 o f the Ministerial decision updated in March,
2009 (No 5718), continues to follow a classical historical cost formulation. In particular
capital gains are required to be transferred to a permanent reserve and are not available
for distribution. Where price discovery i s not readily available an expert valuation must
be sought.
41.    Article 41 provides an exception from historical cost accounting for investment
linked contracts and unrealized gains can in part be taken into account for solvency
purposes.
42.      This rather dated approach reflects combination o f a a desire to maintain hidden
reserves (i.e. maintain balance sheet strength) while solvency standards are weak and
asset limits are relatively unconstrained and some concern as to whether Solvency I1 can
be applied in emerging markets such as Morocco. However the Moroccan insurance
accounting plan does not encourage insurer management and boards to think about ALM
issues (Le. relative durations and convexity and liquidity) and if macro settings change
significantly this could see the industry balance sheet significantly weakened. In addition
there i s no incentive for the sector to push for the development o f the medium and long
term debt markets - at present the average duration o f private sector debt instruments i s
only 3 years. The duration o f public debt instruments i s a little longer at between 5 and 6
years. No long t e r m debt has been issued by the Government for 2 years and this market
i s currently effectively illiquid.
43.      Foreign insurers such as AXA are subject to local and group risk models but other
local insurers are not necessarily so aware o f modern risk management techniques. Under
the circumstances there i s good reason to hasten the introduction of mandatory ALM
analysis and related risk management requirements (see paragraph 34 above) as an
interim step towards the introduction o f international accounting standards and a more
fully fledged RE3C regime.
Taxation o life insurance - investment only products
          f
44.     N o n life insurers are subject to normal company tax with offsets for withholding
tax on interest income and capital gains. The company tax rate for financial institutions
i s higher than for other enterprises although the rate was reduced from 39.5% to 37% in
2008. L i f e insurance i s treated similarly to non l i f e (there i s no statutory fund concept so
an insurance policy is considered to be purely a contract with the l i f e insurer) and longer
term savings are encouraged through reduced or nil tax (for capitalization policies paid
from un-deducted premiums) on proceeds taken after 8 years.
45.     A crude imputation system means that dividends are effectively taxed little more
than once and differential tax rates between individuals and companies means that
investment income received via a l i f e contract i s potentially treated more generously than
dividends received directly b y an individual. Short term capital gains on fixed interest
securities are taxed at 20% while those arising mainly from equities are taxed at 15% -
reinforcing the bias towards equities for trading portfolios.
46.     A clear anomaly i s that capitalization policies (Le. pure savings and investment
contracts) are subject to a 3.45% tax on premiums. Reasons given for this included:
                                                                                       ANNEX I V
                                                                                       Page 10 o 11
                                                                                               f

      0   A tax o n the rich
      0   A replacement for there being no VAT ( VAT and GST i s not applied to
          insurance in most countries)
      0 A tradeoff for the 8 year plus concession.
    0   It copies French practice - not borne out by an investigation o f French practice
47.     Global best practice i s to tax services not capital and the result o f this tax has been
to effectively kill the capitalization market. Ideally capitalization contracts would be put
onto a similar tax basis as normal long t e r m l i f e insurance contracts.
Catastrophe Fund
48.      Morocco has a history o f weather and earthquake related disasters and to date
relief, rehabilitation and reconstruction have been funded largely out o f state revenues
(including privatization proceeds) and donations from other countries (Saudi Arabia in
particular). A draft law to establish a compulsory catastrophe and terrorism classes o f
insurance has been with the Secretary to the Government for some years. This law would
establish a Catastrophe/ Terrorism Pool to be run by the national reinsurer, Soci6t6
Centrale de R6assurance (SCR) and potentially remove a large contingent liability from
the government's balance sheet. However the proposed arrangement would not cover
drought - this i s sensible given the special characteristics o f this risk in Morocco.
49.    A second important reason given by M O F for establishing such a fund i s that it
would support additional FDI, particularly in the tourist industry, where terrorism
insurance i s not readily available. Presumably awareness o f insurance at household level
would also rise: insurance penetration is currently very l o w within the household sector
(mortgage and motor related coverages aside).
50.    A further side benefit would be that the transition o f SCR to a stand-alone
reinsurer without the benefit o f compulsory cessions would be eased - SCR could aspire
to become a regional catastrophe and terrorism pool manager. Compulsory cessions to
N C R have to cease in 2012 under an international trade and services agreement. To date
Morocco has been complying by gradually removing classes subject to compulsory
cession with motor, the largest class, due to be the last to be removed.
Access to health insurance
51.     The insurance industry has been offering voluntary group health insurance to
private sector employers in Morocco for several decades. In 2005 a basic public health
insurance scheme called Assurance Maladie Obligatoire (AMO) was introduced. This
covers 4 1 relatively serious interventions, ambulatory care and hospitalization with a
30% co pay for the medical interventions and 10% for hospitalization. Employers with
existing insurance arrangements were given 5 years grandfathering before having to enter
the public scheme. The contribution rate i s 4% (2% employer/ 2% employee) and there
i s some concern that as the scheme i s extended to previously uninsured workers with
accumulated health issues this will prove to be inadequate. This i s offset by a concern
that lower paid workers will not be able to access some medical interventions because o f
the size o f the co-pay.

                                                                                      Page I1 o I1
                                                                                               f

52.     Other insurance arrangements include mutuals de santC (mainly for local
authorities) and CNSS which runs a number o f clinics. In addition the post office i s
distributing a privately underwritten coverage for the s e l f employed, supported by the
government's micro-finance initiative. Feedback during the mission questioned the
efficacy o f this latter initiative. Subsidized mutuals (mutuelles de sante) have proved to
be more effective for delivering health funding to the informal sector in other developing
markets.
Investment linked life contracts
53,     Investment linked life insurance (effectively mutual funds with insurance tax
wrappers) products have been approved, but to date have not gained a significant market
presence. La Marocaine Vie launched the first products in November, 2007, managed by
Gestar, a Socie'te' Ge'ne'rale subsidiary. These products are extremely complex in practice
- particularly in terms o f accounting, reserving and tax - and it i s not clear that either the
supervisor or the industry as a whole, fully understand the technical and system
requirements.

 Financial Sector Depth vs. Access
 1.     The Moroccan financial sector i s large relative to GDP, whether measured by
 deposits or credits. As shown in the upper part o f Figure 1, Morocco has ratios of
 deposits and credits to GDP o f about 90 percent, much higher than expected for i t s per
 capita income. The large volume o f remittances from Moroccans living abroad i s
 probably one o f the main factors that have contributed to this outcome, although
 macroeconomic and financial stability and sound financial regulation have probably
 contributed as well.
  2.       However, Morocco's financial depth s t i l l does not translate into access. While it
 i s true that Morocco made an impressive progress in financial inclusion, as indicated b y
 the increase in the number o f commercial banks' deposit accounts per population, from
 15 percent in 2002 to 29 percent in 2008, access ratios are not particularly impressive by
 international comparison. As shown in the Figure 1, the ratios o f deposits and loans per
 population are not particularly remarkable, and are even slightly below the levels that
 would be predicted by Morocco's per capita income.
 3.       The scope for further gains in access becomes even more apparent in the bottom
 part o f Figure 1. A country with Morocco's high ratios o f deposits and loans to GDP
 would be expected to have much higher ratios o f deposits and loans per 1,000 adults.
 These results imply higher rates o f concentration in the case o f Morocco, and the scope
 for further gains in access to larger segments o f the population and o f enterprises.
 4.      Measures o f physical access show a similar picture. As shown in Figure 2 and
 Table 1, Morocco seems to have a relatively better level o f physical access to financial
 services through branches but lags behind in ATM and, especially, points o f sales
 coverage. Compared with other MENA countries Morocco has also comparable levels o f
 branch network but has markedly fewer ATMs or POS per population, helping explain
 why access to financial services i s low. Banking density remains heavily skewed to
 urban locations (5,800 per branch) as versus rural locations (112,000 per branch).

Firms' Access to Finance

5.      According to the latest Investment Climate Assessment (2007), access to finance
improved dramatically in Morocco between 2004 and 2007. In 2007, 32% o f f i r m s
identified access to finance as a major constraint, compared to 78% in 2004, as illustrated
in Figure 3. In spite o f this improvement, a larger share o f Moroccan enterprises s t i l l
reports access to finance as a constraint than enterprise in MENA and lower middle
income countries. As shown in Figure 4, this i s particularly true for smaller enterprises.
6.      One o f the obstacles faced by small f i r m s i s the level o f collateral which seems to
be high by international standards. Moroccan banks tend to require from loan applicants a
whole range o f collaterals (Table 2), including land, buildings, personal assets, andfonds
de commerce (goodwill). According to the banks, this conservative behavior is a result of
the financial opacity o f Moroccan firms. The Investment Climate survey shows that f i r m s
with more reliable information for banks, whose financial statements are audited by
external auditors, tend to get more credit with lower collateral (Figure 5). These results
also suggest that more information o n credit histories could also contribute significantly
to greater access to credit.

The M o r o c c a n microcredit sector
7.      Morocco i s a recognized leader in microcredit for the MENA region, with 40% o f
client outreach in the Arab world. There are 12 licensed microfinance institutions (MFIs)
in Morocco servin about one million clients, with combined assets o f 5.7 billion MAD
(705 million U S D15). The industry is heavily concentrated and the four largest institutions
account for over 90% o f the outreach. Between 2004 and 2007, the sector enjoyed one o f
the most rapid growth rates seen in the microfinance industry so far. As shown in Table
3, the number o f clients increased by a factor o f three and the coverage ratios increased
by similar rates. l3
8.     This high growth rate was driven by four associations: Zakoura, Al-Amana,
Fondation des Banques Populaires pour le Microcre'dit, and Fondep. These institutions
scored well on all microfinance performance metrics including scale, depth o f outreach,
asset quality, and profitability. These impressive results did not go unnoticed and Al-
Amana and Zakoura were awarded several international prizes (including MIX best
performing MFI in the world, European prize for microfinance).
9.     Commercial banks are unusually significant backers o f microcredit in Morocco.
Banque Centrale Populaire and Cre'dit Agricole created two o f the largest microcredit
associations and are funding 85% o f the sector's assets. Their exposure to the sector was
estimated at U S D 600 million in 2008. And over the past four years the commercial
funding liability ratio o f the sector has gone from 9.5 percent to 71 percent.

areas. Non-performing loans started to rise significantly from one o f the lowest levels o f
the world, 0.42% in 2003, to 1.9% in 2007. The sharp rise in non-performing loans took
place in 2008 and affected all MFIs. Portfolio at risk (30 days) increased significantly to
5% in December 2008 and reached an alarming level o f 9% in June 2009. In M a y 2009
Zakoura, one o f the Moroccan flagship institutions, experienced major difficulties and
was rescued by the initiation o f a merger with another institution. Some MFIs are still
facing serious management and portfolio quality challenges. These problems resulted in a
loss o f outreach in the period, as shown in Table 3.
 13.    The roots o f the credit crisis can be found in the institutional capacity o f
microcredit associations. The unprecedented growth overstretched their capacity,
translating into lenient credit policies, obsolete Management Information Systems (MIS)
systems, lack o f internal controls and substandard governance. Multiple lending to the
same clients was an aggravating factor. A study conducted by the central bank estimated
that 40% o f microcredit beneficiaries had more than one loan. The problem i s particularly
acute in urban areas.

 14.    The Ministry o f Finance supported the initiation o f the merger o f the worst
affected association, Zakoura, by the Fondation des Bungues Populaires pour le
Micorcre'dit, a large microcredit association associated to the Cre'dit Populaire du Maroc,
to restore confidence and avoid further contagion effects on loan delinquency. l5
15.    Microcredit associations have put in place aggressive recovery plans. Their plans
encompass some bold actions, including management changes and freezing new
disbursements. Associations are tightening their credit processes, putting in place
'SWAT' teams focusing on loan recovery, and are taking judicial action with a
demonstration effect o n delinquent borrowers. They are also exchanging credit

information on a weekly basis to control over-indebtedness. Finally, small and medium
size microcredit associations are planning to share resources such as back office systems
or to merge. These efforts are slowly paying o f f and a recovery i s expected for the first
semester o f 2010. However, some associations have been severely hit and will have to be
restructured; others are emerging stronger and well positioned for another phase o f
growth.
16.    The first priority o f the government i s to consolidate the microcredit sector.
Several actions are underway in collaboration with the central bank and the Federation o f
Microcredit Associations, FNAM16. This includes a directive to strengthen the
governance o f the associations and introduce tighter financial reporting requirements.
The Moroccan government has also secured 46 million USD from the Millennium
Challenge Account to support the sector, provide new liquidity through a country fund
JAIDA, and strengthen management information systems and internal control.
17.     The second priority i s to control over-indebtedness. The credit bureau was
launched in October 2009, and collects borrower information from large microcredit
associations. This i s a major step forward that allows microcredit associations and banks
to improve credit analysis as well as to control client over-indebtedness. The third
priority i s to secure liquidity. The government i s encouraging linkages between
microcredit associations and banks. Two o f the largest associations have already been
established by banks. Smaller institutions are encouraged to find bank sponsors.
18.    The fourth and final priority i s to improve the regulatory framework. The
Ministry o f Finance has launched a survey with funding from the Millennium Challenge
Corporation to assess the strengths and weaknesses o f the sector and to provide
recommendations to improve the regulatory framework for microfinance. The study will
also look at the transformation o f some o f the largest institutions into commercial,
prudentially regulated, entities. The results o f the survey should be available in the
second quarter o f 2010 and discussed with FNAM and the industry in the second half o f
2010.
Banks in Microfinance
19.      L o w income banking (bank down-scaling) appears to be poised for take-off. Four
large commercial banks have launched new financial products targeting l o w income
groups. However it i s not clear how far banks will penetrate into rural and semi-urban
areas, beyond their urban concentration. Each bank has a specific strategy, linked to
diverse distribution channels which make it possible to have a competitive banking offer
for l o w income individuals.

Government Support to Microfinance and Financial Inclusion
21    I The growth o f the microfinance sector could not have happened without the
strong support of the Moroccan government. The Microfinance L a w o f 1999 provided a
clear framework for the development o f the industry, and the fund Hassan I1 helped to
capitalize the first microcredit associations. The sector also benefited from the support o f

the international donor community, notably U S A I D and the European Commission, now
relayed by International Finance Institutions (IFIs) such as the IFC or the German KfW.
22.     The Government has also provided a strong lead in promoting financial inclusion.
In 2008 for example banks were invited to develop financial inclusion strategies, and the
central bank more recently has signaled to banks that it i s open to allowing innovations in
products and delivery mechanisms. The establishment o f the A1 Barid bank (the Postal
bank), which will use the postal branch network to extend access to a wider set o f
financial services to l o w income clients, i s an important measure to extend access to
financial services and to encourage competition. The current framework for mobile
phone banking i s s t i l l in development but doesn't seem to hamper innovations in the
markets
23.     The Government has recently encouraged l i n k s between banks and MFIs, for
example in supporting the merger between Zakoura and FBPMC. Banks are already well
regulated and can offer a range o f financial services, so developing service delivery and
client monitoring arrangements with microcredit associations that take advantage o f their
networks, market knowledge, and customer base, offers considerable potential. The
expense and demands on supervisory resources that a law allowing deposit-taking
microfinance institutions would imply, on the other hand, will be carefully assessed
against the potential use and benefits o f such a law.

                         Macroeconomic Performance and Policies"


1.      Despite the recession in partner countries, notably the euro area, economic
performance in Morocco has remained favorable. With little financial sector l i n k s to
international financial markets, the main impact o f the global crisis has been on the real
sector. Activity in manufacturing, tourism, and trade slowed considerably starting in the
last quarter o f 2008, but now appears to be stabilizing, and growth in nonagricultural
output o f about 2% percent i s expected for 2009. Combined with exceptional output in
the cereal sector, overall GDP growth in 2009 i s projected at around 5 percent. Average
inflation i s expected to fall below 2 percent in 2009 from 3.9 percent in 2008 as
international commodity prices fall. The unemployment rate stabilized at 9.8 percent in
the third quarter o f 2009, but youth unemployment i s higher and remains an important
challenge.
2.       Morocco's external current account i s expected to improve following a
deterioration in late 2008 and the first half o f 2009. As a result, after registering a
deficit o f more than 5 percent in 2008, the current account deficit should narrow to below
4% percent o f GDP in 2009 as exports, tourism, and remittances stabilize. On the other
hand, the capital account i s expected to deteriorate reflecting the sharp decline in net
foreign direct investment. Gross international reserves slipped in late 2008 and the first
half o f 2009, but have been recovering since then and are expected to remain strong at 7
months o f prospective imports by the end o f the year.
3.       A fiscal deficit o f about 2% percent o f GDP i s expected in 2009 following a
very strong performance in 2008. Revenue i s expected to fall considerably as a share o f
GDP, primarily reflecting the slowdown in nonagricultural activity, but also the lowering
o f certain tax rates, and the expiration o f exceptional factors that boosted revenues in
2008. On the spending side, the government launched a stimulus package to mitigate the
economic downturn which includes a boost in public investment and several specific
initiatives targeted at exporting industries. Outstanding government debt f e l l to 47
percent of GDP in 2008. The projected debt-to-GDP ratios for 2009 and 2010 are 47 and
48 percent, respectively..
4.      I n the context o f low inflation, and consistent w i t h the exchange rate peg,
monetary policy has been loosened this year. The Central Bank lowered i t s key interest
rate by 25 basis points to 3.25 percent. Broad money has slowed significantly, increasing
by only about 3 percent since the beginning o f the year, while NFA has broadly
stabilized. With declining liquidity in the market during the first half o f the year, the
central bank has lowered reserve requirements gradually from 15 percent to 8 percent
since end-2008.

                                                                                Page 2 o 2
                                                                                        f

5.      The economic outlook for Morocco should improve in 2010, but will remain
partly conditioned on developments in the external environment. Growth in the euro
area, Morocco's main trading partner, i s projected to be low, but slightly positive,
contributing to a gradual recovery. Coupled with a further fiscal expansion in 2010,
helping to boost domestic demand, nonagricultural growth should rise to about 4 percent
in 2010. However, agriculture output i s projected to return to trend levels, pulling down
overall GDP growth to 3-3s percent. Inflation i s projected to be around 2 percent, and
the current account deficit i s expected to remain stable.
6.       The authorities intend to loosen fiscal policy further in 2010 to support
economic recovery. To this end, the 2010 budget envisages a deficit o f 4% percent o f
GDP (excluding privatization receipts). With a further rise in public investment, spending
will increase by about % percent o f GDP relative to 2009. Revenues are projected to fall
by about 1 percent o f GDP, due both to tax policy changes and automatic stabilizers
playing out. While the fiscal loosening i s appropriate given the economic conditions, the
crisis i s a temporary phenomenon, and thus the authorities should aim at bringing the
deficit under 3 percent o f GDP over the medium term to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio.
7.      The direct impact o f the global crisis on Morocco's banks has been limited.
The global integration o f Morocco's banking system i s limited: banks and corporates
have very l o w external debt, there i s no exposure to toxic assets, and the system i s
effectively non-dollarized. Moreover, the capital account is only partially open, further
shielding the financial system from the global crisis. The impact on Morocco o f the
recent events linked to Dubai World i s expected to be very small. Moroccan banks have
very limited exposure to Dubai financial institutions and corporate entities. NPLs have
been under control, but the rapid rise in credit in 2005-08 raises concerns about future
loan deterioration. In this context, banks have tightened lending standards, and the central
bank intends to increase the minimum capital adequacy ratio o f some banks according to
their risk profile by end-2009. Moreover, a credit bureau has recently become
operational, which will further improve credit monitoring.
 8.     The authorities are deepening structural reforms to increase productivity
and competitiveness, which should help boost growth and reduce unemployment. In
the agricultural sector, the Plan Vert i s moving ahead, with the aim o f boosting
productivity and ensuring that the sector serves as a source o f economic growth.
Likewise, reforms in the education sector are ongoing to achieve a better match o f skilled
labor to the needs o f the market, a critical effort to reduce the longstanding problem o f
youth unemployment. In addition, the authorities have initiated a reform o f the justice
system, and will continue ongoing efforts in the energy, industrial and tourism sectors.
They are also proceeding with a reform o f the universal subsidy system. In this respect,
the ongoing pilot schemes to better target subsidies are welcome, but should only be
extended as the universal subsidy scheme i s scaled back to avoid having two systems in
place. O n trade, the authorities are lowering tariffs in the context o f their trade
agreements while more broadly aiming to simplify the tariff regime and lower maximum
rates.
