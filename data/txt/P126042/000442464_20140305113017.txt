1.   Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.     Tajikistan is a small landlocked country vulnerable to natural disasters and the
influence of external economic conditions. Located in the heart of Central Asia, it is blessed
with abundant water resources, contributing to its specialization in cotton production.
Inexpensive hydropower, in turn, led to its other specialization: processing of aluminum. Shortly
after its independence in 1991, the country descended into a civil war that lasted until mid-1997
and brought widespread physical damage and loss of life. The country is susceptible to natural
disasters and is regularly affected by floods, landslides, earthquakes, and droughts. Only 7
percent of its total land area is arable; high mountain ranges make communication between
different parts of the country difficult, especially in winter. These factors combine to make
Tajikistan one of the world’s poorest countries, with a gross national income per capita of
US$880 in 2012. Limited employment opportunities at home have led 40 percent of the working
age population to seek better jobs in Russia. Remittances – over 90 percent of which are coming
from Russia – accounted for over 48 percent of GDP in 2013, the highest ratio in the world.

2.     Despite these difficult initial conditions, the economy grew rapidly in the aftermath of
the civil war. Following the civil war, the government opened up trade, established a central
bank and a commercial banking system, negotiated visa-free access for workers to go to Russia
and removed taxes on inflows of remittances. Private businesses and households were given a
bigger role than before as small- and medium-sized enterprises were privatized, and land reform
provided more land for private farms and households. Strong economic growth, which averaged
8 percent per annum during 1998-2008, was made possible by five favorable factors: the peace
agreement that permitted businesses and households to return to normal economic activity; the
dividend from the government’s success in stabilizing the economy; the growing global and
regional economy that led to increased aluminum and cotton exports as well as rising inflows of
remittances; increased development assistance, including from the international financial
institutions; and reforms that permitted businesses and households to take advantage of emerging
opportunities.1

3.     The 2009 global economic crisis adversely impacted Tajikistan through a sharp fall in
remittances and decline in exports of cotton and aluminum. Inflows of remittances, which had
grown fivefold in 2004-2008 to close to 45 percent of GDP in 2008, declined by more than 30
percent, while the dollar value of exports dropped by almost 13 percent due to lower international
prices of cotton and aluminum. According to the 2010 Life in Transition Survey (LITS),
58 percent of households in Tajikistan reported they had been adversely affected by the crisis.
The financial sector was also adversely affected by the growth slowdown, with non-performing
loans in the banking sector rising to record levels. The disruption of cargo deliveries due to the
border closures with Uzbekistan added to the economic and financial difficulties. As a result of
the crisis, the government budget experienced substantial revenue shortfall, resulting in pressures
on public spending in education, health, and social protection.

4.   The government responded to these unfavorable developments by allowing for more
exchange rate flexibility, increasing public spending under its anti-crisis action plan to

Growth: Stimulating Private Investment, Report No.54677-TJ, January 2011.




                                                 1
protect critical expenditures, and by continuing reforms. The government sought support
from development partners to mitigate the crisis, and substantial support was provided, inter alia,
by the World Bank Group, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the European Union (EU),
and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The appropriate policy response and robust external
support helped limit the slowdown in economic growth to 3.9 percent in 2009 from 7.9 percent in
2008.

5.     The main objectives of the Tajikistan Programmatic Development Policy Grant
(PDPG) 4–6 series were to protect basic services within a sustainable fiscal framework and
to lay the foundation for post-crisis recovery and growth. The series combined actions to
mitigate the impact of the economic crisis and to continue with structural reforms. Given high
degree of uncertainly during the preparation of the series about the global environment and the
path of Tajikistan’s recovery, the flexibility was deliberately embedded into the series . PDPG 4-6
were built on the previous series (PDPG1-3) completed in 2009, which supported the government
program of reforms aimed at increasing the competitiveness of the private sector, strengthening
public sector management, and improving the delivery of services. 2 The PDPG4-6 aimed at
sustaining gains from the reforms supported under the PDPG1-3 in the context of less benign
external environment and, to promote the further reforms in the areas critical for the long-term
growth and poverty reduction.

6.     As the series advanced, the focus of the second and the third operations was
increasingly concentrated on the binding constraints to growth. These constraints, identified
in the 2011 Country Economic Memorandum, included: (i) weak macroeconomic management;
(ii) poor institutional environment for private investors, characterized by overly complex and
non-transparent regulations; (iii) high cost and unreliable energy services; (iv) expensive
transportation services for accessing domestic and external markets; (v) restrictions on freedom of
farmers what to produce and where to market it, preventing a transfer of resources to more
profitable activities; and (vi) weak human capital.

7.     When PDPG4, the first operation in the series, was appraised in May 2010,
Tajikistan’s economy was showing initial signs of recovery from the impact of the global
economic crisis. The economy grew 6.8 percent during January-March 2010 from a year earlier
on the back of recovering remittances and industrial production. However, Tajikistan remained
highly vulnerable to external shocks and the medium-term fiscal outlook was assessed to be
challenging. In this context, PDPG4 provided SDR 16.9 million in budget support, including
SDR 5.7 million in Pilot Crisis Response Window resources. PDPG4 supported the ring-fencing
of expenditures for health, education, and social protection services at no less than 2009 levels.
PDPG4 also supported the reform program aimed at increasing competitiveness of the private
sector, at strengthening public sector management, and at improving the delivery of services.

8.     When the second operation in the series – PDPG5 – was appraised in May 2011, the
recovery was underway but the economy remained fragile and future growth required
reforms aimed at increasing efficiency and private investment. The economy grew at
6.5 percent in 2010 on the back of higher growth in hydroelectric power production, construction,
manufacturing, and agriculture. As exports and remittances rose from their depressed levels,
growth in 2011 rebounded to 7.4 percent. PDPG5 moved to post-crisis reforms and supported
actions in support of the investment climate, the financial sector, and agriculture aimed at

enhancing transparency and predictability of private property rights for investors. In addition, it
supported actions to strengthen public financial management and financial performance of energy
SOEs. PDPG5 also supported government reforms to increase the efficiency of public services
delivery and improved access to services.

9.      When the third operation in the series –PDPG6 – was appraised in September 2012 –
the economy had recovered after the 2009 crisis with growth projected at 7.5 percent in
2012 as a whole. Accordingly, the focus of the PDPG series further shifted to actions supporting
post-crisis recovery and sustained growth. PDPG6 supported continued implementation of health
and education financing reforms and ongoing efforts to improve targeting effectiveness of social
assistance. To help spur private sector-led growth, the government submitted a new law on public
private partnerships to Parliament in August 2012, continued expedited issuance of land-use
certificates to farmers, introduced a new salary grid in all central government entities, approved
the chart of accounts for public institutions, and prepared the 2012 budget based on the new
budget classification. A new law on public administration was approved by Parliament in May
2012. The government also conducted an energy efficiency audit of TALCO, the country’s large
aluminum smelter, to identify options for reducing its energy use.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

10. The original program development objectives of PDPG 4–6 were to protect basic
services within a sustainable fiscal framework, and to lay the foundation for post-crisis
recovery and growth. The three main policy areas supported by the series were to: (i) protect the
delivery of basic services within a sustainable fiscal framework; (ii) improve the environment for
private sector development; and (iii) strengthen government effectiveness.

Actions under the first pillar designed to protect the delivery of basic services include
maintaining or increasing budget allocations for health, education, and social protection services,
as well as the implementation of per capita financing (PCF) reforms in the education and health
and the development of a pilot scheme for better targeting of social assistance.

Actions under the second pillar designed to improve private sector development include reduced
coverage of permits and passage of a law codifying the reduction, financial sector strengthening
by implementing high-priority recommendations of the financial sector assessment program
(FSAP), adoption of an aviation sector policy to liberalize the air transport sector, and accelerated
issuance of land-use certificates to farmers to strengthen property rights and boost investments in
farm improvements.

Actions under the third pillar designed to strengthen government effectiveness include improved
public financial management through establishing a supreme audit institution, implementation by
Barki Tajik (BT) and Tajiktransgas (TTG) of financial management improvement plans,
introduction of a new salary grid, and enactment of a law on public administration.

11.       The key outcome indicators as approved were the following:3
(i)     Utilization of primary health centers in selected rayons is maintained at no less than 2008
levels (measured by primary health center visit rates).
(ii)    Efficiency of expenditure for education improves (measured by increasing student to
teaching load ratio and by maintenance of proportion of schools’ budget allocated to wages).

                                                    3
(iii)   The cost and time of starting a business and of dealing with construction permits
declines.
(iv)    Access to formal financial services increases (accounts in banks and microfinance
organizations rise).
(v)    Access to Tajikistan by air improves (measured by number of flights and by number of
passengers).
(vi)   Farmers gain control over farm management (as indicated by the proportion of farmers
who perceive that they can take independent production and marketing decisions).
(vii)    Effectiveness of the government in Tajikistan improves (measured by Tajikistan’s score
in the annual Global Competitiveness Index of the World Economic Forum).
(viii) Transparency of budget formation and execution improved (budget reports produced
based on new classification; consolidated budget execution reports are posted on the government
website).

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

12. In the course of the PDPG4-6 series, the program development objectives did not
change. The three policy areas remained relevant throughout the three operations, although some
adjustments were made within the policy areas 2 and 3, reflecting the shift in focus from
measures to mitigate the impact of the global crisis to actions supporting post-crisis recovery and
sustained growth through private sector development and increasing government effectiveness.
The adjustments reflected the changed global and domestic environment, the new opportunities
for opening a dialogue in critical for future growth areas as well as the pace of the provision of
technical assistance (including from other development partners) and government’s absorptive
capacity and ability to carry out the reforms.

(i)     Under the PDPG5, the changes were as follows:
Under streamlining business regulations, the prior actions for the PDPG5 remained unchanged
but the triggers for the PDPG6 were revised to support preparation of the Public Private
Partnership (PPP) law and amendments to the Customs Code to simplify trade procedures. An
initial trigger – the government undertaking a regulatory impact analysis of key laws applicable to
the private sector – was appropriately dropped as too complex given the low level of government
capacity.
Under strengthening of the financial sector, submission of a draft law on Anti-Money laundering
and Countering Financing of Terrorism – a part of the post-FSAP action plan – was added as a
new prior action to support Tajikistan’s high-level political commitment to work with FATF and
EAG to address its strategic AML/CTF deficiencies. An issuance and enforcement of the
remedial action framework was moved to the next operation as required more time to complete
the task and technical assistance that was expected to be approved and provided in time sufficient
for the preparation of the framework.
Under the modernizing aviation policy, envisaged further actions were dropped (for PDPG5 and
for the subsequent PDPG6), as it was identified that the further improvements in the sector will
require investments for impact. Under the promoting transparent PFM, approval of the chart of
accounts was moved to the next operation as the implementation entailed a substantial amount of
work, including training.
Under the enhancing transparency of energy SOEs, due to slower than envisaged progress in the
introduction of IFRS at BT, the prior action was modified to complete the implementation of


                                                4
FMIP by end-2011. At the same time, a new trigger was added for PDPG6 aimed at improving
efficiency of energy use, namely, completion of an audit of TALCO’s energy use to identify
options for increasing its efficiency.
(ii)    Under the PDPG6, the changes were as follows:
Under streamlining business regulations, the envisaged prior action – submission of the Customs
Code to the Parliament – was dropped; the draft Code was submitted to the Parliament (which
would imply fulfilling the prior action), but the proposal was returned to the government for
modification.
Under strengthening of financial sector, measures to strengthen financial sector, envisaged earlier
as prior actions for PDPG6 (preparation an improved remedial action framework for banks; a
contingency planning framework; and strengthening the legal and institutional environment for
secured transactions), were dropped, given the complexity of the issues, more time needed for
technical assistance to implement the actions supported by Financial Reform and Strengthening
Initiative (FIRST).
Under the promoting transparent public finance management, the formulation of the prior action
related to the establishment of an independent audit body and making it fully functional was
enhanced to make more explicit what should be done, namely, passing presidential decree
approving the staffing of the Accounts Chamber, appointment of core personnel (Chairman,
Deputy Chairman), and, securing premises.
Under the enhancing transparency of energy SOEs, the prior action formulation was revised to
take into account that although BT and TTG completed about three-quarters of FMIP, remaining
work will require additional time.

13. Under the PDPG6, the monitoring framework was streamlined, including by
increasing the number of key outcome indicators from 8 to 13 and by refining the
formulation and way of measurement of some indicators to show more clearly the flow of
prior actions into results. New indicators were added to measure the progress achieved under
PDPG4 and PDPG5, including under maintaining adequate social protection system (policy area
1), and under the enhancing transparency of energy state-owned enterprises (policy area 3). In
addition, some initially approved indicators were revised to better capture the progress given the
availability of the information at the moment of the preparation of the last operation in the series.

14.     Key outcome indicators (as revised or amended under the PDPG6):
(i)     PHC funding as a share of regional health budget is maintained or increased. The
formulation of this indicator was slightly revised – from “rayon” to “region” health budgets as
reforms were expanded from selected rayons to two regions (Sughd and Khatlon).
(ii)    Efficiency of expenditure on education improves (as measured by the proportion of
schools’ budget not allocated to wages). Here the reference to student-teacher ratio was dropped;
the share of non-wage budget was proposed as an indicator of efficiency (instead of “wage”
budget).
(iii)    Improved targeting mechanism is available for channeling social assistance. This is the
new indicator, measuring progress under the protecting deliveries of social services (policy
area 1).
(iv)    Total cost of acquiring permits is reduced. This is the new indicator aiming to track the
progress in streamlining business regulations. The information was expected to come from the
IFC SME surveys for Tajikistan.



                                                 5
(v)      Cost and time of dealing with construction permits declines. No change as compared to
original design.
(vi)    Farmers gain control over farm management (as measured by the proportion who
perceive that they can take independent production and marketing decisions). No change as
compared to original design.
(vii)    Access to formal financial services increases; financial system becomes deeper and more
efficient. The indicator was revised to include in addition to the measure of increased access to
financial services (number of bank accounts), the measure financial sector deepening (increase in
private sector deposit and credit base as percent of GDP) and the measure of efficiency (reduction
in interest rate spread between lending and deposit rates).
(viii) Access to Tajikistan increases (as measured by the number of flights and passengers). No
change as compared to original design.
(ix)    The attractiveness of the civil service as an employer improves (measured by the ratio of
applicants to published vacancies). This is a new indicator under the strengthening capacity of
government institutions.
(x)     The regulatory environment improves, as evidenced by an increase in the share of firms
for which "licenses and permits are not a problem in doing business" and there is a reduction in
reported management time spent dealing with public officials. This is the indicator aimed to
measure increased efficiency of government institutions, replacing the one based on change in
Tajikistan’s score in the annual Global Competitiveness Index of the World Economic Forum.
(xi)     Transparency of budget formation and execution improved. No change as compared to
original design.
(xii)    The financial viability of BT and TTG increases (measured by increase in cash collection
as a ratio of total billed consumption). New indicator, measuring the progress towards enhancing
transparency of energy state-owned enterprises.
(xiii) Transparency of Energy SOEs is increased (measured by entity audits being conducted
based on IFRS). New indicator, measuring the progress towards enhancing transparency of
energy state-owned enterprises.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program:

15.     The program was divided into three areas, each with several areas of focus.

Policy area 1: Protecting Delivery of Basic Services within a Sustainable Fiscal Framework

      a. Protecting the gains in access to health services

16. The PDPG 4-6 series supported protection of health expenditures during the crisis
and reforms to improve the efficiency of public spending on health. Public spending on health
(excluding the PIP) rose from 5.1 percent of state expenditures in 2005 to 6.9 percent in 2008 but
fell to 6.1 percent in 2009. Under PDPG4, the government committed to maintain the budget
share allocated to health services in 2010 at least at the 2009 level. The focus of the subsequent
operations shifted from protecting health expenditures to improving their efficiency. PDPG5
supported the adoption by the government of the health sector master plan to guide more efficient
planning of the health sector delivery system. PDPG6 focused on implementation of the health
financing reform and supported as a prior action the utilization by two new districts of a per-
capita formula in allocating 100 percent of primary healthcare resources.


                                                  6
    b. Protecting the gains in access to education

17. The PDPG 4-6 series supported protection of education expenditures during the crisis
and reforms to improve the efficiency of public spending on education. Education accounted
for 17.8 percent of the state budget in 2009 and it was expected to marginally increase in 2010.
Under the first programmatic series, the government gradually rolled out the PCF scheme. The
PDPG 4-6 supported the expansion and full implementation of PCF, including a review of and
revision of legislation to ensure that there is a legal base in place to accommodate national
implementation of per capita financing in general education.

    c. Maintaining an adequate social protection system

18. The PDPG 4-6 series supported protection of social protection expenditures during
the crisis and reforms to improve targeting mechanism. Spending on various social protection
schemes (excluding PIP, but including pensions) accounted for 20 percent of total state budget in
2009. Although the pro-poor targeting of social assistance schemes improved between 2003 and
2009, the system suffered from inefficiencies and inclusion errors (e.g. as suggested by the 2009
LSMS, only 23 percent of total social assistance was delivered to the poorest quintile of
population and about 30 percent of social assistance leaked to the richest 40 percent of
population). PDPG 4-6 supported the introduction of the improved targeting mechanism for
social assistance on a pilot basis in two rayons.

Policy area 2: Improving the Environment for Private Sector Development

    a. Reducing the burden of regulations on business

19. The PDPG 4-6 supported reforms aimed at reducing the regulatory burden on
businesses. The PDPG4 supported implementation of guillotine process to eliminate the
unnecessary permits, removing disincentive to enterprise growth, as well as implementation of
specific measures aimed at reducing the time and costs of obtaining construction permits. PDPG5
supported the preparation and passage of the new Permits Law, codifying the decision of the
permits commission and regulating the introduction of the new permits. The trigger for the
PDPG6 was completion of the regulatory impact analysis of key laws applicable to private sector.
PDPG5-6 also supported strengthening the one-stop-shop, in partnership with the EU.

    b. Strengthening the financial sector

20. The PDPG 4-6 supported reforms laid out in the Government’s financial sector
strategy and the action plan to implement recommendations of 2008 FSAP. PDPG 4
supported the implementation of key first-year legal and regulatory actions, including submission
to parliament for approval of a revised banking law and of amendments to NBT law. The triggers
for PDPG 5 were measures to support implementation of key elements of the second year of the
financial sector action plan: (a) submission of the revised deposit insurance law to parliament,
and (b) issuance and enforcement of a regulation on a process for a prompt remedial action
framework for commercial banks. The triggers for PDPG 6 were measures to support
implementation of key elements of the third year of the financial sector action plan, including: (a)
strengthening consumer protection regulation and supervision of banks, and (b) strengthening the
legal and institutional environment for secured transactions.




                                                 7
    c. Modernizing aviation services

21. The PDPG 4-6 supported adoption and implementation of the national aviation
policy. The policy explicitly (a) allows progressively increased access to international airlines in
terms of routes and frequency capacity; (b) removes any restrictions on air cargo in terms of
aircraft types, size, frequency, uplift or discharge (as long as technically feasible); (c) ensures
equal treatment at the airports for all carriers in terms of pricing, fueling, and other services; and
(d) improves air safety through adequate funding and strengthened licensing certification,
monitoring compliance and inspection. The triggers for PDPG5 and PDPG6 were key measures
of a time-bound action plan to implement the aviation policy, including actions to strengthen the
technical regulation and accident and incident investigation functions, to reform institutions, and
improve operations of both of the airports and of air traffic control service.

    d. Reforming agriculture institutions

22. The PDPG 4-6 supported several measures to improve the incentive framework for
rural growth and deepening reforms of agricultural institutions. It supported the issuance of
debt-write-off certificates to all eligible farmers, acceleration of farmland restructuring as
reflected through issuance of land use certificates to family farms in accordance with agreed
standards and targets. Securing famers’ rights to land is essential for the improvement of
incentives to invest in agriculture, strengthening of the rule of law, deepening of the financial
system ((land can be used as collateral for loans), raising productivity of agriculture (while
lowering its risk through diversification), and for poverty reduction.

Policy area 3: Strengthening Government Effectiveness

    a. Strengthening capacity of government institutions

23. The PDPG 4-6 supported implementation of public sector reforms initiated by the
PDPG1-3 and Public Sector Reform Project. This includes the introduction of a new civil
service salary grid, linking compensation to levels of responsibility, experience, the introduction
in the civil service of the performance appraisal system, and, enactment of a law on public
administration, which clarifies the functions of the executive and assigns the development of
sectoral policies to the ministries and implementation and regulatory functions to the agencies.

    b. Promoting transparent public financial management

24. The PDPG 4-6 supported implementation of public financial management reforms
initiated by the PDPG1-3 and Public Sector Reform Project. This includes the introduction of
the new budget classification and chart of accounts, enactment of the legislation on and setting up
of the external audit, strengthening the scrutiny of the parliamentary review of the proposed
budget (including through the established permanent budget committee secretariat), and
improving access of public to budget reports.

    c. Enhancing transparency of state-owned enterprises

25. The PDPG 4-6 supported measures to improve transparency and governance of state-
owned energy utilities. This includes support to continued implementation of the financial
management improvement program at the two energy utilities (BT and TTGs), such as migration
to an international financial reporting system and publishing the financial reports prepared in
compliance with IFRS and audited in accordance with International Standards on Audit.

2.    Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance

28. The series were delivered in a timely manner and responded well to the government
needs in light of the crisis and thereafter. The time between the Concept Note review and
appraisal for PDPG4 was 6 months, for PDPG5 – less than 3 months and for PDPG6 – 8 months.
PDPG4 had eight prior actions across policy areas 1 and 2; PDPG 5 and PDPG6 had nine prior
actions each with focus of actions being shifting to increased government effectiveness (policy
area 3) and addressing the most difficult and delayed reform areas, such as budget transparency
and transparency of SOEs. These changes also reflected the changed dynamics of the reform
process, when any further progress in private sector development has become increasingly
dependent on public sector efficiency and transparency. The schematic illustration of PDPG4-6
series as delivered is presented in Table A3.1 in Annex 3.

29. There were some variations between the initially proposed triggers and the actual
prior actions for subsequent operations. The triggers were adjusted to make the program more
manageable and focused on government priorities, taking into account capacity constraints and
political economy considerations. The team was seeking for opportunities to launch the dialogue
in the areas deemed the most difficult and, where possible, used the momentum to get a traction.
At the same time, the team demonstrated enough flexibility in the areas that needed more time to
see the results, while continuing to maintain the dialogue in these areas through not only policy-
based budget support but also through analytical and advisory services.

In the case of PDPG5, the original design included 11 triggers. 9 triggers became prior actions,
one was moved to the next operation and one was dropped. Out of 9 prior actions, 7 were
implemented as envisaged in the original design of the series and 2 were modified. Changes in
prior actions and the reasons behind these changes are described in section 1.3 and also
summarized in Table A3.2 in Annex 3.

In the case of PDPG6, the original design included 12 proposed actions. Under the revised design
– under the PDPG5 – 10 triggers were proposed for PDPG6 to increase the focus of the operation
on growth-enhancing reforms, to strengthen the policy response by the Government to emerging
opportunities (e.g. energy efficiency audit of TALCO, adoption of PPP law) and to postpone
implementation of some of the originally proposed reforms in light of weak government capacity.
Out of the proposed 10 triggers, 9 became prior actions and one was moved to the next DPO
series. Out of 9 prior actions, 6 were implemented as envisaged under PDPG5 and 3 were
modified. Changes in prior actions and the reasons behind these changes are described in section
1.3 and also summarized in Table A3.3 in Annex 3.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation

30. The flexibility embedded in the program design allowed to focus on the areas of
strategic importance. The PDPG team identified the program matrix through extensive
consultations with the government, with the Bank sector specialists, and with other development
partners. The actual reform program supported by the series reflected both the opportunities for
change and the country capacity to design and implement reforms, so that the revisions to the
initial design during the time of PDPG5 and PDPG6 were well justified. Despite the revisions, the
focus on the three main policy areas was maintained.

31. Evolving energy sector reform dialogue has had a strong impact on the program
implementation. Through support from the World Bank’s Energy Loss Reduction Project, the
government reform effort in the energy sector focused on improving commercial performance
and financial transparency of the energy utilities Barki Tajik (BT) and Tajiktransgas (TTG). Both
companies moved from the old practices of normative-consumption based billing to ones based
on actual metered billing, and are implementing comprehensive Financial Management
Improvement Programs (FMIP). PDPG5 and PDPG6 supported these important reforms.
Moreover, through the PDPG6, the Bank supported an energy efficiency audit of TALCO to help
identify priority options for reducing its energy use, and plans to prepare a follow-up action plan
to implement the recommendation of the efficiency audit – the area, where sector policy dialogue
was stymied by the lack of information and hard data on concrete steps that could be taken and
electricity savings potentially realized. This work has being carried out in close collaboration with
the Public Expenditure Review (PER), and Institutional and Governance Review (IGR) teams,
and has potentially very high payoffs, as even modest improvements in TALCO’s energy
efficiency (e.g. 10 percent reduction in energy consumption) would help significantly improve
access to scarce electricity for other domestic consumers (both households and businesses). The
agreement with the Bank on Rogun’s assessment studies and related monitoring also provided an
additional platform for discussion of the most critical reforms in energy sector and their fiscal and
social implications.

32. The design of PDPG4-6 took into account the experience from the implementation of
the previous series. Experience with PDPG1-3 has shown that PDPG implementation was most
successful in areas that benefited from strong government ownership, complementary technical
assistance, efficient coordination among WB/IFC/IMF and with the Development Coordination
Council and, long-term engagement on the part of the World Bank Group.

33. Agroinvestbank crisis affected adversely the planned schedule of the delivery of
PDPG6 and declaration of grant’s effectiveness. Directed lending practice has contributed to
the deterioration of the loan portfolio of the largest commercial bank (Agroinvestbank – AIB),
which was effectively driven into bankruptcy and was bail out at a cost of 2 percent of GDP in
2012. As the problem emerged, the Bank and the IMF intensified the dialogue with the authorities
and provided additional technical assistance to sort through restructuring options, while seeking
to maintain the soundness of the rest of financial system. However, the resolution of this complex
problem, involving strong vested interests, required time to build commitment and capacity to
implement the plan. An inclusion of the high-level commitment to find a credible, equitable and
long-lasting solution for AIB in the Letter of Development Policy (LDP) and delaying the
declaration of effectiveness helped to strengthen the position of the reform-minded part of the
Government, continue the dialogue in this important area and be prepared to more decisive
actions as soon as the situation is ripe. Annex 4 describes the AIB crisis and its impact on the
PDPG6 implementation in more detail.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

34. Design. The three program documents included a policy matrix clearly setting out prior
actions for the current operation, triggers for the subsequent operation, and expected results. The
outcome indicators were refined after the approval of the second operation to reflect the changes
in the program and to specify the measurement. Due to the low quality and availability of official
statistics very few data required to track the progress come from publicly-available sources of
information; substantial amount of data were supposed to come from surveys or be provided by
the counterparts upon a special request. This created certain difficulties in monitoring results,
especially in cases, where new surveys were not conducted at all, conducted with significant
delays and/or with revised questions.

35. Implementation. The Bank team closely monitored actions and reviewed progress with
implementation of the program using the policy matrix. Aide-memoires and implementation
status reports (ISRs) from PDPG4-6 missions reported on progress, challenges, and agreed
measures for moving forward. Sector specialists carried on the dialogue with the authorities in
their respective areas, and informed the PDPG team on progress with implementation and
outcomes.

36. Utilization. The Government and Bank teams used monitoring information to identify
areas of particular challenge and to develop measures to address them. This includes an additional
technical assistance (e.g. financial sector), moving some measures to the consequent
operation/series to allow enough time to build capacity (e.g. introduction of unified chart of
accounts) and to implement the measure in a complete and adequate manner (e.g. implementation
of FSIP by energy utilities). The team used the window of opportunity to unlock the dialogue on
TALCO. It also made all efforts to address new issues arising at the end of the program
implementation (e.g. insolvency of the AIB).

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation

37. The Government requested continued budget support from the Bank in the context of
the new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). The Bank in principle agreed to assist the
government with a proposed new series of two development policy operations, tentatively
scheduled for FY15-16. The design of the new series will take into account the lessons learnt
from PDPG4-6. The new DPO series will be linked to the proposed pillars of the new CPS for
FY15-18 – private sector development, social inclusion, and regional connectivity – and to the
achievement of twin goals of reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity.

3.   Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Overall Rating: Satisfactory

38. The PDPG4-6 was central to the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY10-FY13.
The CAS FY10-13 supported two main objectives: (i) to mitigate the negative impact of the crisis
on poverty and vulnerability, and (ii) pave the way for post-crisis recovery and sustained growth.
PDPG 4-6 supported both of these objectives. PDPG4 was also consistent with the Pilot Crisis
Response Window’s objective of protecting core spending in countries affected by global
financial crisis. PDPG4-6 served as the primary vehicle for engaging in policy dialogue with the




                                                13
government and for discussions with other development partners on how best to align support for
the Government’s program.

39. A new CPS for FY15-18 is expected to be prepared by May 2014. The overarching
theme of the CPS will be expanding economic opportunities for all and, especially, for the most
disadvantaged groups through a mix of advisory, financial, and technical activities and services
in three broad areas of engagement. It will be based on the three pillars (private sector led growth,
social inclusion and regional connectivity). PDPG4-6 pillars and selected policy areas remain
highly relevant in the context of the new CPS.

40. The main objective of PDPG4-6 and the pillars were highly relevant to the
government’s own development strategy. In February 2010 the government formally approved
its Third Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS 3) for 2010–2012. The overarching PRS3 objective
was to promote sustainable strong economic growth and to improve the population’s living
standards, especially of vulnerable groups. The new Tajikistan’s medium-term Living Standards
Improvement Strategy (LSIS) for 2013-15 focuses on sustainable economic development and
improving access to social services for all. PDPG4-6 pillars and selected policy areas remain
highly relevant in the context of the new government’s medium-term development strategy.

41. The design and implementation arrangements for PDPG4-6 were also adequate. The
design was based on prior AAA (by the Bank or other development partners) and existing
government strategies, while implementing arrangements benefited from previous experience
with PDPG1-3. Implementation arrangements where relevant. The Minister of Finance was
responsible for the overall implementation of the program and for coordinating implementation of
specific reforms by line ministries (health, education, social protection, agriculture, energy,
transport) and other government agencies. An additional support was provided by the Executive
Office of the President, because of its role in coordinating policy within government.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

Overall Rating: Satisfactory

42. On overall achievement of objectives, performance of PDPG4-6 series was
satisfactory. The satisfactory rating takes into account the completion of all prior actions for all
the three operations, progress on all but one outcome indicators under policy area 1 and, while
uneven but still, significant progress under policy areas 2 and 3. With the support of the program,
the fiscal framework stabilized, while the delivery of essential social services has been
maintained, assisting to preserve human capital during an economic slowdown. The program
facilitated reforms, addressing the key constraints to long-term growth, thereby contributing to
quick recovery aftermath 2009 crisis and laying the foundation for future growth. At the same
time, the structural reform agenda remains large. Initiated and supported by the program reforms
need to be further deepened and widened to ensure sustainability and quality of future growth.

Recent Macroeconomic and Fiscal Trends

43. Economic growth in Tajikistan rebounded strongly from a recent low of 3.9 percent
in 2009 to over 7 percent a year on average during 2010-13. Economic activity in the post-
crisis period has been spurred by a pickup in remittance inflows, which rebounded sharply since
2009 to a record high of over 48 percent of GDP in 2013. Larger inflows of remittances fueled
domestic demand and on the production side strong growth in services, which accounted for more
than one-third of growth in 2012 and 2013. Twelve-month inflation was contained at single digit


                                                 14
levels, declining from 9.8 percent in December 2009 to 3.7 percent in December 2013. After
widening to 5 percent of GDP in 2011, the current account deficit narrowed to 1.9 percent of
GDP in 2012 but is estimated to have widened again in 2013 to about 3 percent of GDP due to
moderated external demand and adverse terms of trade developments.

44. The overall fiscal stance improved notably in the post-crisis period. The fiscal balance
shifted from a deficit of 5.4 percent of GDP in 2009 to a surplus of 0.1 percent in 2012 on the
back of higher revenues and lower expenditures. The latter largely reflected a decline in
externally financed capital spending under the Public Investment Program, which is being phased
out gradually. The general government budget was concluded with a deficit of 1.3 percent of
GDP in 2013, largely due to increased spending under donor-financed projects, especially in
transport, construction and energy, and a sharp decline in receipts from extra-budgetary funds.

Policy Area 1: Protecting Delivery of Basic Services within a Sustainable Fiscal Framework
Rating: Satisfactory
45.     On the first policy area under the PDPG series, performance was satisfactory.
Expenditures for health, education and social protection (as a share of the total budget and as a
share of GDP) had been maintained at the 2008 level and substantial progress was achieved in
reforms aimed at increasing efficiency of public spending. All but one outcome indicators were
met (Table 3).

    (a) Protecting the delivery of health services
46. Recent reforms have addressed issues contributing to poor health system
performance by prioritizing PHC and reform of the payment systems. Public expenditures on
health in relation to GDP in Tajikistan are among the lowest in ECA and the limited resources
had been used inefficiently, with the health system focused largely on curative in-patient services,
with poorly paid providers that are not held accountable for results, under-funded PHC, wide
disparities in PHC spending across rayons, and large out-of-pocket expenditures. Through PDPG
support, the government raised PHC worker salaries, increased public spending on health (to at
least 6 percent of government expenditures in 2009-2012), adopted a Health Sector Master Plan
in 2010, and started implementing and expanding per capita PHC financing and case-based
financing of hospital services in two oblasts (Sughd and Khatlon). As a result, the PHC started
receiving priority financing (as evidence by the increased share of PHC expenditures in total
health outlays) and the utilization of healthcare services was maintained and somewhat improved
(as evidenced by the increased number of PHC visits per capita per year).

47. The sustainability of the results is supported by the continued expansion of full PCF
and efforts to improve the financing mechanism based on a comprehensive use of
population-based resource allocation in Sughd oblast. The new financing mechanism, the
introduction of which on a pilot basis was supported by PDPG4-6 series, is expected to produce a
number of positive effects, including: (i) improved equity in the allocation of public health funds;
(ii) enabling the introduction of more efficient provider payment methods; and (iii) reducing
fragmentation in health financing, and improving coordination between rayon, oblast and
republican administration that fund overlapping health care networks.

    (b) Protecting delivery of education services

48. The PDPG 4-6 series supported protection of education expenditures during the crisis
and reforms to improve the efficiency of public spending on education. Public spending on
education rose steadily from 2.3 percent of GDP in 2000 to 4.2 percent in 2009 and this level has



                                                     16
been maintained since then. This is still below the ECA average (4.8 percent of GDP) but just
about the average among the countries at a similar level of economic development and
demographic compositions. Whereas in 2009/2010 only 82 percent of all general secondary
schools had a PCF-compliant budget, the proportion of schools with PCF budget increased to 95
already in 2010/2011.

49. The introduction of the PCF has led to a number of positive outcomes. They include:
more equitable and efficient distribution of resources, increased budget autonomy at school level,
and greater transparency and community involvement in school planning and budgeting.
Efficiency of public spending on education increased as suggested by the increased nationwide
average student teacher ratio (STR) from 17.0 to 18.0 between 2007/08 and 2011/12. The share of
wage expenditures in local governments’ education expenditures fell from 92 percent in 2008 to
89 percent in 2012, freeing resources for improving the quality of education. Yet, the share of
non-wage expenditures is below the target set forth in the PDPG4-6 monitoring framework. The
target was met by 2010, when non-wage expenditures accounted for 23 percent of total school
budgets. However, increases in teachers’ salaries during the last 2 years, not accompanied by the
adequate adjustments in the PCF formula, have resulted in crowding out of non-wage
expenditures. To address the problem (that could have been further aggravated due to the recent
increase in public sector wages by 30 percent), the required adjustments were introduced to PCF
formula from 2014.

    (c) Protecting delivery of social protection services

50. The PDPG 4-6 series supported protection of social protection expenditures during
the crisis and reforms to improve targeting mechanism. The Government spent 0.2 percent of
GDP on social assistance in 2009; this made the social assistance program among the smallest
when compared to similar countries in ECA. The Government maintained social assistance
expenditures in 2010-2012 at no less than 2009 level. Importantly, new improved targeting of
social assistance, based on proxy-means testing (PMT) methodology was piloted in 2011 in two
rayons.

51. The pilot social assistance program achieved better targeting rates than the standard
social assistance programs. The coverage rate of the standard social assistance programs was 19
percent compared with a coverage rate of 22 percent for the pilot. Moreover, the poorest quintile
receives only 23 percent of the benefits from the standard programs but the poorest quintile
receives 68 percent of the benefits from the pilot program. The program thus represents an
improvement in terms of poverty-targeting. Based on preliminary positive results of the pilot, it
was expanded to 10 districts in 2013, planned to be further expanded to 25 districts in 2014
before the national-wide roll out.

Policy Area 2: Improving the Environment for Private Sector Development
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

52. On the second policy area under the PDPG series, performance was moderately
satisfactory. All outcome indicators had been fully or partially met (Table 4). Important progress
was achieved in reforming agricultural institutions, streamlining business regulations and
reforming aviation. Despite the fact that all outcome indicators for strengthening financial sector
are met (in full or partially), it remains weak and vulnerable. This, together with the absence of
sizable progress in implementing commitment provided in the LDP in relation to the resolution of
the AIB and halting directed lending, as critical for sustained growth and development of

    (a) Streamlining business regulations
53. PDPG 4-6 series has provided a multi-year framework for policy dialogue to support
reforms to improve business environment, including the establishment of one-stop shops to
enable enterpreneurs to receive information, forms, and other services needed to start a business,
including consolidated registration with the Tax Authority, Statistical Committee, and with the
Social Insurance and Pension Agency. However, despite recent progress in reducing the burden
of doing business, Tajikistan remains a relatively unattractive country for investment with
significant under-exploited economic diversification potential. In Doing Business (DB) 2014
Tajikistan ranked 143d globally on the ease doing business.

54. The regulatory environment improved and the costs of acquiring permits were
reduced as a result of the new Permits Law in 2011. The Law was drafted with a regulatory
guillotine approach that led to a reduction in the number of the permits from 607 to 85, or by 86
percent. The impact of this reform on compliance cost savings to the private sector was evaluated
by the IFC through a Standard Cost Model analysis (SCM) approach to amount to about
US$14 million annually. This number reflects the elimination of hundreds of permits as well as
the reduction in cost of several others. Another target – the reduction in the number of days
needed to obtain construction permit – was achieved. However, it takes more time and resources
to obtain a construction permit in Tajikistan than in most countries in the world. The DB 2014
ranks Tajikistan 184th out of 189 countries in dealing with construction permits.

55. The enactment of the PPP law provided the legal basis for attracting investment in
key sectors such as energy, infrastructure, transport, and potentially health. The new PPP
law outlines a transparent tendering process for PPP projects and addresses dispute resolution and
such issues as non-solicited bids. Implementing the law will require amendments to existing
legislation, extensive training for government officials, and the formation of a PPP Center to lead
tendering on specific projects. The government has expressed interest in identifying some
projects to use as pilots of the new law.

       (b) Reforming agricultural institutions
56. The main objectives of PDPG4-6 were to improve farmers’ property rights and access
to farm inputs to help raise agricultural productivity. Through PDPG4 support, the
government undertook several measures to reduce farmers’ debt and improve the agricultural
financial system, issuing 6,390 debt write-off certificates to farmers as part of the cotton debt
resolution. PDPG5 supported the strengthening of criteria for site selection for on-farm irrigation
investment. PDPG 4-6 supported the accelerated issuance of land use certificates to family farms
to empower farmers and promote farmland restructuring. PDPG6 also supported measures to
improve an enabling environment for agriculture, including the implementation of an improved
irrigation investment framework and reform of policies designed to improve farmer access to
inputs.

57. Available information suggests that these reforms had been critical for increasing
agricultural productivity and poverty reduction. Production of cotton and other crops started
to increase after agricultural reform and debt relief, and after farmers obtained the freedom to
farm any selection of agricultural products. Just from 2009 to 2012, the production of cotton in
the country is up by 41percent, the land allocated to cotton up by 18 percent, and cotton yields
increased by 18 percent.4 The results of the quantitative survey of 1,800 farmers in 18 rayons,
supplemented by in-depth interviews, focus groups and case studies in eight rayons, conducted
for 2011 Rural Vulnerability Study (RVS) show: (i) significant shift in perceptions regarding
rural life compared to 10-15 years ago; (ii) key role household plots and family farms played in
increased agricultural productivity to to their higher propensity to invest in farm improvement;
(iii) positive impact of issuance of land certificate on “freedom to farm” (more than half of
surveyed farmers strongly agreed that they make farming decisions independently as compared to
slightly more than a quarter in 2007).

58. Recent data suggest there has been a sharp positive shift in the farmers’ perceptions
in respect to “freedom to farm” between 2011 and 2013. 5 According to the Final Project
Assessment (FSA) for the Tajikistan Cotton Recovery Project, one of the major changes between
2011 and 2013 is the understanding of farmers that they can farm freely. In the survey years,
farmers were asked about whether they agree or disagree with the statement: "In general, farmers
can use the land as their choice." For cotton farmers, in 2013, almost 92 percent indicated that
they are free to choose how much land to allocate to cotton as compared to 43 percent in 2011.
For non-cotton farmers, in 2013, 94 percent of respondents indicated that they can truly use the
land as they wish (crop choice) as compared to 65 percent in 2011. Although the data are not
directly compatible with the results of 2011 RVS (and the baseline), they do indicate a laudable
progress in this most critical policy area.

59. A new Government program for reform of agriculture for 2012-2020 includes the
measures for widening and deepening the reforms supported under the PDPG4-6 series.
The Action Plan includes measures aimed at reforming policies for better farmer access to inputs,
improving access to irrigation, and ensuring sustainable use and improved management of natural
resources. The new Land Code, approved in August 2012, provides for land use rights to be life-
long, inheritable, marketable and exchangeable—all essential preconditions for small farms and
rural households to make their own production decisions, as well as to stimulate private sector.
Effective implementation of the Land Code will require continued issuance of land use
certificates, definition of land valuation methods, further improvements to the mortgage law, and
strengthening of the unified registration and cadaster land market systems.

    (c) Strengthening the financial sector
60. PDPG 4-6 supported the implementation of high-priority recommendations of the
2008 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), addressing weaknesses in the legal
framework. PDPG4 supported submission to the parliament of a revised banking law and of
amendments of NBT law, and the issuance by the NBT of revised versions of key regulations and
instructions in line with amended laws. PDPG5 supported the passage by the parliament of a
revised deposit insurance law and the law “On Anti-Money Laundering and Countering
Financing of Terrorism” (AML/CFT). Since February 2013, Tajikistan has taken further steps
towards improving its AML/CFT regime, including by enacting amendments to the criminal code
improving the criminalization of money laundering and terrorist financing.

61. Indicators of access to finance, financial sector depth and efficiency improved. Access
to financial services is improved as suggested by the increased number of banks’ accounts.
Another indicator of access to financial services – number of branches per 100,000 adults in
commercial banks – shows that in 2012 this ration in Tajikistan (7) was higher than the median
for low income countries (4) but significantly lower than regional average (20). Deposit base
widened and interest rate spreads narrowed even further than targeted.

62. Notwithstanding the importance of these actions, and the fact that all outcome
indicators for this area either fully or partially met, financial sector remains weak and
highly vulnerable. Interest rates remain high, while financial intermediation remains limited.
High interest rates are often cited as the major reason for SMEs not applying for a loan. Private
sector credit to GDP ratio is very low and decreased as compared to baseline. Financial
intermediation is low for several reasons, including weaknesses in the infrastructure for banking,
inefficiencies of financial service providers, risk aversion by financial service providers, and a
lack of bankable projects. The share of non-performing loans (NPLs) to gross loans of banks
remain high and on rise (21.2 percent in September 2013 as compared to 18.2 at end-2012).
Governance issues and enforcement of prudential regulations in the banking sector remain a
concern. The health of financial sector is undermined by the directed lending, which distorts the
market, misallocates credit, and undermines confidence and the credit culture. Low confidence in
the banking system impedes the channeling of remittances into investments.

    (d) Modernizing aviation services
63. Tajikistan’s regional connectivity has improved since 2008, but there is a
considerable scope for further improvement to help enhance the country trade and tourism
potential. With PDPG support, the government approved the National Aviation Policy in 2010,
and issued the “Government Policy Strategy for Development of Civil Aviation of the Republic
of Tajikistan”. The Bank conducted a situational review in 2011 to measure available
international travel options in terms of routes, frequencies, and airlines (competition) and to


                                               21
contrast these findings against connectivity levels two years earlier and assess the effect of
reforms. The market analysis examined annual available capacity at Dushanbe and Khujand
airports (which account for over 90 percent of international travel) and showed that between 2009
and 2011, Tajikistan became better connected to regional and international countries, as measured
by the increased number of flights and passengers. The new dataset, provided by the Ministry of
Transport, allows for comparisons between 2008 and 2012-2013 and supports the conclusion of
the market analysis of 2011. The Bank and the IFC are continuing with the policy dialogue in this
area, supporting it with upcoming IFC investment operations.

Policy Area 3: Strengthening Government Effectiveness
Rating: Satisfactory

64. Under the third policy area of the PDPG series, performance was satisfactory. All but
one outcome indicators were met (Table 5). The progress on some indicators cannot be assessed
by the indicators originally intended (from BEEPS) because BEEPs has now been delayed for 2
years. As a result, the assessment of the progress has to be made based on other information.

    (a) Strengthening capacity of government institutions
65. The implementation of the government’s Public Sector Reform Strategy, supported
by the PDPG series, brought somewhat mixed results. A new law on public administration as
well as the development and initial implementation in 2012 of a new performance-based salary
grid for all central government employees have contributed to improved transparency of
remuneration by eliminating all previous salary increments and ad hoc bonuses and increasing the
salaries of young professionals whose recruitment and retention had become problematic. The
rollout of the wage and public administration reform measures had been intrinsically related to
reforms in health and education sector described earlier. However, there is no real competition in
civil service yet: the ratio of applicants to published vacancies fell from 1.25 in 2010 to 1.09 in
2012, at large, due to staff downsizing policy. There is no new BEEPS data to access the
improvement in regulatory environment due to strengthened government capacity; alternative
information suggests that the regulatory environment for business improved but still remains
difficult (see paragraphs 49 and 50 above).

    (b) Promoting transparent public financial management
66. Supported by the PDPG series and on-going PFM dialogue, transparency and
accountability of public finance management improved. The government approved unified
chart of accounts (UCOA) for public institutions, prepared the 2012 state budget based on new
administrative budget classification. GFSM 2001-based economic and functional segments, has
been introduced for budget execution from January 1st, 2014, in conjunction with the new
UCOA. It is a massive preparatory effort, with more than 6,800 budget organizations (BOs)
involved in the training and subsequent implementation. UCOA integrates budget and financial
accounting, which provides consistency on those types of accounting. The first 10 accounting
standards based on international public sector accounting standards (IPSAS) are to be introduced
from 2014. A new Treasury organizational structure has been approved and is being
implemented from January 1st 2014 to support implementation of the UCOA and the accounting
reform. The budget is published in a timely manner and available to the public. In addition,
quarterly, bi-annual, and annual reports are produced and published on the website of the
Ministry of Finance. The independent external audit body (Chamber of Accounts) had been
established and became operational. In addition, with support of the ongoing PFM Modernization
Project, the government has embarked on further reforms to strengthen public financial
management in partnership with other development partners active in this area (IMF, EC, DFID,



                                                     23
ADB, and USAID). The 2012 PEFA assessment has revealed an overall improvement across
most Performance Indicators as compared to 2007 PEFA, while helped to identify the areas
where the further work is needed.

      (c) Enhancing transparency of energy state-owned enterprises
67. Supported by the PDPG series and on-going energy sector dialogue, government
efforts to improve the operational and financial management and transparency of the main
energy utilities recorded some advances but the overall progress has been mixed.
Introduction of metering of electricity and gas consumption contributed to improved billing and
collection and to reduction in financial and technical losses. Owing to tariffs increases and high
economic growth, quasi-fiscal deficit6 in power sector was reduced from over 4 percent of GDP
in 2008 to about 1 percent in 2011. However, the further progress in tariffs adjustment has been
stalled since then and other imbalances (such as inter-enterprise arrears) are on rise. Preparation
of audited financial reports in compliance with IFRS also contributed to increased transparency of
main energy SOEs. By now, both 2011 and 2012 audit reports per IFRSs for BT and TTG entities
were prepared and submitted to the Bank (see Table 5). Furthermore, the SOE Monitoring
Department (SOEMD) within the Ministry of Finance started to prepare and publish on the
Ministry of Finance website the annual report on fiscal risks from largest SOEs7, which is an
important step towards greater transparency.

68. The government completed an energy efficiency audit of TALCO in August 2012 to
identify options for increasing energy efficiency (prior action for PDPG6). By adding this
important trigger, the Bank team for the first time started addressing the reform area that has been
considered the most difficult and not feasible to address in the first PDPG series and at the time of
the design and approval of the first operation in the second series (PDPG4-6). This unlocked the
dialogue on TALCO as the entity consuming 40 percent of energy produced in the country at
privileged tariffs and its deepening to the issues of TALCO’s relations with BT and with the
budget and, in general, to fiscal implications of SOEs and SOEs governance in Tajikistan.

69. An action plan to implement the recommendation of energy audit of TALCO is under
implementation. The government expressed its commitment to implement recommendations of
the energy audit through adopting a time-bound action plan by end-2012 in the LDP. Albeit with
delay, the Resolution approving the Action Plan for 2013-2018 was approved on January 31,
2013. The Action Plan is being under the implementation, the initial report was shared with the
Bank in October 2013 and the revised report was received by the Bank at end-January 2014 and
is being reviewed by the energy team.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

70. The PDOs set at the time of approval of the first operation in the series, still remain
highly relevant. The overall PDPG4-6 series achieved satisfactory progress in the areas targeted.
The program was largely implemented as planned and the foreseen program outcomes were

achieved. High relevance and satisfactory achievement of objectives justifies the overall outcome
rating of satisfactory for the operation.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

71. The series are expected to have positive poverty, gender and social impact. However, lack
of up to date poverty data – the latest TLSS data available are of 2009 – does not allow providing
any quantitative estimates of such impacts and, thus, substantiate the qualitative assessment
below.

72. A key objective of the PDPG series was to protect delivery of basic services (health,
education, and social protection) and support implementation of reforms designed to ensure
more equitable resource allocation across regions. Introduction of partial capitation in PHC
and greater emphasis on maternal and child care have had a positive equity and gender impacts.
The social assistance pilot supported by the series has helped the government design and
eventually scale-up an improved social assistance program nationwide.

73.     Other program-supported measures were also expected to have pro-poor impacts.
According to official statistics, agriculture still accounts for about half of total employment.
Strengthening farmers’ rights to land and improving access to inputs has led to greater
agricultural profitability, reduced production risk, and lower rural poverty. Promoting greater
freedom to farm and choice of which crops to grow has had both positive gender and poverty
reduction impacts. The new PPP law is expected to help spurring private investment and growth.

74. More reliable energy services have helped promote growth—essential for poverty
reduction. Improved billing and collection in the energy has helped establish a more equitable
system, with electricity tariffs in Tajikistan continuing to be quite low in relation to other
comparator countries. An improved incentive framework for service providers was expected to
have a positive impact on public service delivery. Citizen satisfaction with service delivery in
Tajikistan, though low compared to other ECA countries, has improved in recent years.

75. An important objective of the program was to strengthen national monitoring
systems to track poverty and human development outcomes. With the support of a multi-year
trust fund financed by DFID, the World Bank has substantially increased technical assistance
provided to the government. The World Bank poverty team is being working with the national
statistical agency on the update and improvement of poverty methodology. The proposed
Household Budget Survey (HBS) poverty monitoring methodology will represent a historical
break in the poverty series, and no distributional analysis on the change of poverty will be
possible given this change. The preliminary calculations suggest that poverty in 2012/3 was
approximately 36 percent using a revised national poverty line. Although not directly comparable
with the previous methodology, simulations do support that the period between 2009 and 20012/3
also showed a continuous monetary poverty reduction.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

76.     Technical assistance activities under the umbrella of PDPG series have had a
substantial impact on institutional development. PDPG4-6 supported several reforms aimed at
institutional strengthening across the three operations and the three policy areas. The Bank
(including IFC) has provided technical assistance in key areas, such as social protection, financial


                                                25
sector, public finance management, private sector development (see also Annex 5). In addition,
several Bank investment projects or donor supported programs are helping with institutional
capacity in policy areas, covered by the series. Furthermore, the PDPG series have contributed to
the institutional strengthening through offering an organizing framework for coordination among
various Ministries and agencies involved in the reform agenda.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

77. PDPG4-6 provided continuity by supporting relevant and necessary structural
reforms. The series supported the quick recovery after the crisis through financial support and
technical assistance. PDPG4-6 laid the groundwork for the next DPO program and further Bank
and IFC interventions in selected areas.

Macro            Major external risks stem from high dependence on remittances and imports, narrow                H
economic         export base and low external and fiscal buffers (foreign currency reserves amount to only
risks            1.5 months of imports of goods and services). Domestic policy risks stem from quasi-
                 fiscal activities of state-owned enterprises and public financial institutions. The
                 macroeconomic and structural policy dialogue under the PDPG 4-6 and other World Bank
                 activities was aimed at reducing these risks, but progress has been uneven to date with
                 some signs of reversals being observed (especially related to the directed lending via
                 commercial banks).
Government       The Government commitment to the overall reform agenda is uneven and inconsistent.              M
commitment       Although reforms are continued, the overall pace of reforms has slowed in part as a result
to the overall   of the global economic and financial crisis. Moreover, after “the low hanging fruits” have
reform           been picked up, further reforms need to be anchored into a stronger political consensus
agenda           and governance framework that is yet to be fully built. The WTO accession and post-
                 accession adjustment could potentially provide such an anchor.
Government       Tajikistan remains among the least reformed transition economies with substantial               M
capacity to      outstanding reform agenda and relatively low government capacity. However, intensive
implement        investments by the Bank and other development partners in capacity and institutional
reforms          building and, importantly, better coordination in the assistance provided have been
                 helping to overcome these constraints.

                  needs to maintain and build on the achievements.
Policy area 2     The government committed to the further reforms to improve the environment for private          S
                  sector development, including in agriculture. However, financial sector weaknesses and
                  continued recourse to directed lending undermines progress in this area. As the reform
                  progress is too dependent from vested interests, the risk of sustained progress is high. On
                  the upside, implementation of commitments under the WTO could provide an anchor for
                  many reforms aimed at improvement of investment climate and competitiveness of
                  Tajikistan economy.
Policy area 3     The risk to public sector and public financial management reforms is moderate as they are       S
                  anchored in the government’s strategy till 2018 and supported by the continued assistance

                 by the Bank and other development partners. In the field of enhancing transparency of
                 energy state-owned enterprises, the counter pressures for reform remain high and the
                 progress is likely to remain slow. Continuous strong political commitment and support
                 from development partners (incl. through policy-based financing) will be required to
                 maintain the gains and ensure the further progress.

5.    Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

78. The Bank’s performance in ensuring quality at entry was satisfactory and was aided
by several factors. These included the lessons learned from the previous series, strong analytical
underpinnings, continuous policy dialogue and technical assistance. The work was also well
coordinated within the World Bank Group’s (including IFC) multi-sectoral team, with the IMF
and other development partners. The Bank team managed to flexibly adjust the program to
changing government priorities and constraints without compromising the program development
objectives and deliver the series in a timely manner.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

79. Supervision was embedded in the preparation of each operation of the programmatic
series, which was approved based on the fulfillment of all prior actions. The groundwork for
each of the subsequent operation entailed continuous dialogue with policy-makers and technical
staff on progress towards agreed triggers. The dialogue with the government was supported by
technical assistance activities directly or indirectly supported by PDPG series. The team also
regularly discussed aspects of the reform program with other development partners to ensure that
all are working towards a common goal.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

80. The Bank’s overall performance was satisfactory. The Bank responded to the
government’s request to support its two-pronged strategy to mitigate the impact of the global
crisis and to pave the way for post-crisis recovery and sustained growth and poverty reduction by
the new programmatic development operation. The Bank maintained a close dialogue with
authorities and development partners throughout the nearly three years of implementation.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory



                                                      27
81. The government performance was moderately satisfactory. The government’s
commitment to the overall reform program as laid out in the policy matrix for PDPG4-6 was
strong but uneven across the reform areas, which caused delays in implementation of some
triggers and subsequent modification of the prior actions (e.g. public sector reform, transparency
of energy utilities). However, all prior actions for each operation had been met by the time of
appraisal. Government’s performance is rated less than satisfactory because of slippages in the
implementation of two important measures spelled out in the LDP for PDPG6 related to: (i)
issuance of a resolution adopting a time-bound plan to implement recommendations of an energy
efficiency audit of TALCO, and (ii) finding a credible, equitable, and lasting solution for the AIB.
These slippages, especially the latter, caused delay in the declaration of the grant effectiveness.
While the first measure was completed, the second remains still to be done after the initial first
steps during December 2012-February 2013 with the support from the ongoing financial sector
dialogue.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

82. The Ministry of Finance was also responsible for the overall implementation of the
series and for coordinating actions among other concerned ministries, agencies and
departments. An additional help was provided by the State Advisor to the President for
Economic Policy. The Executive Office of the President took responsibility for implementing the
public sector reforms, while other agencies and line ministries involved (NBT, agriculture,
energy, transportation, health, education and labor) were accountable for implementing the
reforms under their responsibility. The State Committee for Investments and Property
management was responsible for overseeing policy actions related to streamlining business
regulations. Top officials of the Ministry of Finance and of the Executive Office of the President
generally provided the required leadership to motivate and guide the sector ministries and
agencies in designing and implementing reforms.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

83. The overall performance of the borrower was moderately satisfactory. The borrower
demonstrated its commitment to the program from the identification to the completion of the
policy actions. It facilitated the adoption of key policies, legislation and regulations, and
promoted their implementation. However, the government failed to achieve any meaningful
progress in respect to the AIB resolution to date, as committed to in the LDP.

6.   Lessons Learned

84.     DPO is an important instrument to facilitate dialogue on structural reforms in
combination with macro advice, technical assistance, and investments provided by
complementary sector specific operations. DPOs in Tajikistan support a broad reform agenda,
reinforcing and complementing investment operations and TA activities. Moreover, DPOs have
facilitated the creation of a platform for various parts of the Government to talk and to coordinate
with each other, which is being critical for building consensus on the reform agenda and its’
implementation. However, realism is required of what can be accomplished within the large
agenda in a relatively short period of time. The most progress was achieved in the areas where
there was a consensus on the need of the reform, either built during the previous budget support
series or in the process of on-going policy dialogue, analytical work and technical assistance (e.g.


                                                28
reforms of social sectors financing mechanisms, agricultural institutions, public finance
management). In other reform areas (e.g. strengthening government capacity, improving
transparency of SOEs and building financial institutions) achieving meaningful results takes time
and continued dialogue and capacity-building efforts. Future DPO operations should be more
focused and avoid duplication of specific agreements achieved under investment operations and
related supervision and TA. This will help to avoid overloading of DPO agenda and to
concentrate on areas, where the benefits of complementarity are the largest.

85. Providing continuous support for implementation of the reform agenda is essential in
an environment of low government capacity. Passage of legislation and adoption of strategies
are just first steps that, unless followed upon through support for implementation and monitoring,
may not be pursued by the government and will have little impact in Tajikistan. For example, the
development and adoption of the Law on Permits was an integral part of PDPG5, but there is still
a big outstanding agenda on implementation, and the IFC’s technical assistance supports the
implementation of the Law. Similarly, the Law on Chamber of Accounts was submitted to the
Parliament under the PDPG5, PDPG6 supported concrete steps towards making the Chamber of
Accounts operational and yet, further follow-up and technical assistance is required to sustain this
difficult reform.

86. Ensuring availability of information on a regular basis is important for monitoring
progress towards the program objectives. Reliance on surveys with periodicity of three years
or more (e.g. BEEPS) creates problem of tracking the progress towards the targeted outcomes and
take corrective actions as needed. Ideally, the indicators should be available through the public
domain (i.e. websites of National Statistical Agency, Ministry of Finance, Central Bank and other
government agencies). As this is not possible in case of Tajikistan (and, likely in case of most low
income countries), the list of clearly defined indicators (including information required for
monitoring of the adequacy of the macro-framework) with the frequency of their reporting should
be agreed with the Borrower as a part of the negotiation package for each operation.

                                    implementation

The practice of directed lending has contributed to the deterioration of the loan portfolio of the
largest commercial bank (Agroinvestbank – AIB), which was effectively driven into bankruptcy
and was bail out at a cost of 2 percent of GDP in 2012.

As the problem emerged, the Bank and the IMF intensified the dialogue with the authorities and
provided additional technical assistance to sort through restructuring options, while seeking to
maintain the soundness of the rest of financial system. As the discussions and technical assistance
had been still on-going during the time of the preparation and appraisal of the last operation in the
series, an inclusion of any prior actions in the program was deemed as a premature. To get a
traction the team agreed with the authorities that their commitments to halt directed lending and
find a credible, equitable, and lasting solution for the AIB will be reflected in the Letter of
Development Policy for PDPG6 and that the Bank will continue providing technical assistance as
needed in this area.

The draft action plan for the AIB resolution was presented to the Bank in December 2012 but was
not accepted by the Bank as a satisfactory. The Bank team continued consultations with the
authorities and took a dual track approach, allowing to declare the grant effective (first track) and
remain engaged in a constructive way on the structural issue of banking insolvency and its
implications for development outcomes (second track). The Bank was holding back the
declaration of effectiveness of the PDPG6 before the receipt of evidences of move from
intentions to some concrete actions, such as appointment of government representative to the AIB
board, creation of a loan workout unit to collect bad loans, and, preparation of a collection
schedule for the bad loans. Once the evidences were provided about initial actions, the Bank
agreed to disburse the grant (first track) but urged the Government to move more decisively in the
AIB resolution, and, continued the dialogue through the technical assistance (second track). The
Bank made it clear that sizable progress in the AIB resolution would be a pre-requisite for a
formal discussion about new budget support series and that the directed lending should be ceased
immediately.

we present information about the implementation of this grant (attached).

to extend to the World Bank renewed assurances of its highest consideration.

Sincerely,

                                   Annex 1. Summary of the results

1. Programmatic Development Policy Grant (PDPG) Program implementation (4-6)

         In the framework of Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of the World Bank to Tajikistan,
the Government of RT has closely cooperated with the World Bank to implement reforms in the
context of Programmatic Development Policy Grant (PDPG) Program. A series of three PDPG
Programs (4-6) supported two-pronged strategy of the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan
to mitigate the impact of the global crisis in 2009 and to establish the ground for post-crisis
recovery and sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction. The Government of RT was
committed to reforms, agreed under PDPG, which was confirmed by successful implementation
of activities of all three tranches of the program.
          The Government of the Republic of Tajikistan agrees with the World Bank and believes
that all tasks, set forth in PDPG 4-6, have been fulfilled. As a result, significant results have been
achieved as described below. Thus, significant results have been achieved, as described below.

2. The main results of the reforms

         Activities of the Government of Tajikistan, supported by the Programmatic grant 4-6,
were aimed at: (i) ensuring the provision of services within the sustainable fiscal framework; (ii)
improving the environment for private sector development; (iii) strengthening effective
governance. Actions under the first section were directed at supporting or increasing budgetary
allocations for health, education and social protection, and the implementation of reforms in the
area of per capita financing in education and health sectors. Actions under the second section
included a reduction in issuing permits and adoption of the law providing permits reduction,
introduction of a new law governing public-private partnerships, strengthening the financial
sector through the implementation of priority recommendations of financial sector assessment
programs, adopting a policy of market liberalization for air transportation sector , as well as
accelerated issuance of land use certificates for farmers aimed at strengthening property rights
and increasing investments in agricultural development. Actions under the third section, included
support for increasing effectiveness of public finance management by creating a supreme audit
institution and implementation of plans for the improvement of financial management in Barki
Tojik and Tajiktransgas, implementation of the new tariff system and the law on public
administration .
Ensuring the provision of services based on the sustainable fiscal framework

        It should be noted that the Government of RT Plan on fiscal management, against the
background of demonetization of TJS and increase of the support from development partners,
have contributed to mitigation of the consequences of crisis. Within the framework of fiscal
management plan, approved in response to the crisis, the Government of the Republic of
Tajikistan revised the state budget for 2009, taking into account the lack of funds. The
Government of RT increased public spending for social sector (education, health and social
protection) and expanded employment opportunities through the implementation of such social
programs as paid public works and measures to promote entrepreneurship. As for the social
spending, in 2010 and 2012 the structure of budget allocations for health, education and social
protection was similar to 2009 spending in relation to the total spending.
         The first step in the reform was made by the Government to launch pilot program on
allocation of single direct welfare benefits to 20% of the poorest households in January 2011.
Comprehensive evaluation showed that the above mentioned pilot project proved to be more

Improving the environment for private sector development

         Creating a more favorable investment climate and private sector development is a priority
for the country's development. In some areas a considerable progress was made - implementation
of major reforms in agriculture and the ongoing efforts to rebuild and modernize energy and
transport infrastructure should be noted.
        Tajikistan took active measures to promote private sector. For example, since 2008
Government has simplified the procedure for starting a business by abolishing unnecessary
procedures, reducing the requirements for minimum capital and creating a single point for
business registration. In addition, in the area of licensing and construction, the Republic of


                                                42
Tajikistan Government adopted a series of amendments to simplify the procedure for issuing
licenses for the construction, and also introduced a legislation that foresees the establishment of a
“single window” for construction companies. The rate of income tax for legal entities was
reduced from 25% to 15 %, the cost and number of procedures, required to start a business and
obtain permit for construction, were significantly reduced.
        The Government has reduced the list of permits and passed a law that provides a
reduction of this list. As a result of amendments to the Law “On the registration of business”, the
number procedures and days, required to start a business, has been reduced from 13 to 5 days, and
from 62 to 24 days, respectively; the number of procedures, required to obtain construction
permit has been reduced from 32 to 26 days, and also a system of companies registration through
the single window was introduced. The number of entrepreneurial permits has been reduced from
609 to 85. The Customs Code was amended with the purpose to reduce the number of documents,
required for trade operations. New laws to protect the rights of investors, including the Law on
investment agreements, have been adopted.
        In addition, the new Tax Code reduced the time and the tax burden for small and medium
enterprises. The new Tax Code was prepared with assistance from the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank Group. The key changes are: the abolition of the retail sales tax, road
users tax phasing out by 2017; and increasing VAT minimum registration amount and bringing it
in line with the upper threshold for the simplified taxation system; the introduction of a single
declaration on income tax and social tax, as well as simplification of tax procedures and reporting,
for example, shift from monthly to quarterly reports concerning certain types of taxes.
         Tajikistan became the second state in Central Asia that received a pass to the WTO (after
Kyrgyzstan that joined the WTO in 1998). Moreover, the Government of RT, in collaboration
with the World Bank Group, has begun work on the reform of the mining sector; the Board of the
International Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) approved application of
Tajikistan and gave country EITI candidate status at the meeting in Oslo in February 2013.
        With the support of IFC and the World Bank, the Government of Tajikistan has
developed a new law on “Public-Private Partnership”, which was adopted in early 2013 and is
designed to stimulate the flow of investment in infrastructure and social services. As a result of
these reforms, Tajikistan steadily improves its position in the ranking of the World Bank “Doing
Business” Reports, and for the past five years, it was among the top ten countries, more than once
that have achieved the best results in improving the business environment.
        In addition to the aforementioned WTO accession, on November 12, 2012 Tajikistan
became the 147th member of the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign
Arbitral Awards, known as the “New York Convention”. Accession of Tajikistan to the New
York Convention was a priority issue for foreign investors.
        In agriculture, farmers' debts have been written off in the cotton sector, farmers were
given more than sixty seven thousand (67,000) land certificates in accordance with agreed
standards and objectives, set forth in the Decree № 374, as of July 2, 2012 and the Government of
RT Resolution “On reform program in agriculture of the Republic of Tajikistan for 2010-2012”,
№ 383, as of 1st of August 2012, was issued.
         Changes in laws and regulations related to the operation of the central bank, banking
sector, deposit insurance and bank liquidation were made in accordance with the Action Plan in
the financial sector. In addition a number of amendments were made to the laws “On the National
Bank”, “On Banking activity”, “On deposit insurance”, “On Commercial Banks”, “On Payment
Systems”, “Bankruptcy” and relevant regulations, with a view of streamlining terms of
procedures, provided by the law, which helped to enhance protection of the rights of minority

shareholders in the event of their independent company asset management and to reduce the tax
rate on business income. New laws providing for the establishment of a credit bureau were
adopted. The law “On Combating Legalization (money laundering) of proceeds, received through
crime and terrorist financing” was endorsed.
Strengthening the effectiveness of management
        It should be noted that one of the obvious achievements of the reform process was the
adoption of the law on state administration bodies, which created a legal framework for further
development of the entire public administration system; in particular three-tier management
principles have been formalized.
        In April 2011, a single treasury account was introduced at the national level; it is planned
to be implemented at provincial and district level in 2013-2014 year. Steering Council of the
Republic of Tajikistan to deal with issues of public finance management was established in
September 2008 by Decree of the President of RT and approved Treasury Modernization
Program for 2011-2016 and Accounting Reform Strategy in the public sector for 2011-2018.
        In September 2011, a new system of remuneration of civil servants was introduced in the
entire system of civil service, including local state government and administration bodies. As a
result of the reform all nontransparent salary increments have been abolished, wages are now
close to market prices, salaries for similar jobs have been streamlined in all government bodies,
and the wage system has become more consistent.
        There is on-going consistent implementation of the medium-term expenditures program,
which initially covered only the social sector (education, health, social protection of the
population), and since 2011 additional sector have been included.
        Another achievement is the introduction of administrative budget classification in 2010 at
the republican level, and in 2012, it was introduced at the local level.
         In 2012 unified chart of accounts, based on the GFS 2001, was approved with the budget
classification and it is planned to introduce it at the national level from 1st of January 2014.
       In parallel with the support of the major development partners work has been done to
improve other components of public financial management reform, in particular a lot of attention
was paid to accounting and internal audit system development.
        Successful implementation of the above initiatives has led to the need to review the legal
framework for public finance management, respectively, in 2011 a new Law “On Public Finance
of the Republic of Tajikistan” was adopted, which recognized the new requirements for the
financial management system and ensured flexibility of financial system to support reforms in
other sectors.
         Independent external audit body was created under the Parliament of RT in order to
improve control over the efficient use of budgetary funds. In 2011 parliamentary hearings on the
formulation and execution of the budget were held. Also, a special secretariat was created under
the Parliament of RT to strengthen the capacity of the Committee on Economy and Finance with
regard to participation in the budget process.
        The Ministry of Finance is implementing key reforms in public finance management, in
particular Treasury modernization program, accounting system reform strategy for the public
sector, human resources reform strategy, personnel training strategy that advances the key
reforms in the public finance management.
       Activities that the Ministry of Finance of RT has already completed to improve planning
and execution of the state budget are the following:

No. # 2-3-19/351

To:
Marsha M. Olive
Country Manager
World Bank Tajikistan Country Office
Republic of Tajikistan

Dear Ms. Marsha M. Olive,

The Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan expresses appreciation to you and the
World Bank management, represented by you, for the continued assistance and support extended
to the Republic of Tajikistan in economic reforms.

Having reviewed the final version of the report on the completion and results of the
Programmatic Development Policy Grant (PDPG4-6), we appreciated the positive evaluation.
And, in general, we support this report, which demonstrates our commitment to continue such
initiatives.

However, it is worth noting that the content, outlined in paragraph 44, is not clear, which is likely
due to incorrect translation from English language. Therefore, we would like to ask you to revise
the content of the given paragraph in the Russian version of the document.

In addition, concerning the issue of directed lending, we believe it is necessary to take the words
“based on government's decision” out of paragraph 4. “Risk assessment for the development
results”, “Macroeconomic risks” and the first paragraph of Annex 4 of the given report, since so
far there were no any documents found that confirmed government’s influence over the
commercial banks in the provision of directed loans.

In conclusion, the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan would like to avail itself of
the opportunity to extend to the World Bank renewed assurances of its highest consideration.


Sincerely,
Shavkat Sohibov
Deputy Minister of Finance
Of the Republic of Tajikistan
