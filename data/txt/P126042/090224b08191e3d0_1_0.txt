                         Program Development Objectives
                         Program Development Objective (from Program Document)

                         The PDPG6 is the third in a programmatic series of three operations for the Republic of Tajikistan. The PDPG 4-6 series are central to the World Bank engagement in
                         Tajikistan as envisaged in the FY10-13 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). The development objectives of PDPG4-6 are to protect basic services within a sustainable
                         fiscal framework, and to lay the foundation for post-crisis recovery and growth. They support actions in three main policy areas to (i) protect the delivery of basic
                         services within a sustainable fiscal framework; (ii) improve the environment for private sector development: and (iii) strengthen government effectiveness.

Public Disclosure Copy




                         PDPG6 was approved by the Board on October 31, 2012. In order to declare the grant effective, the Bank needs to be satisfied that (i) all prior actions have been met; (ii) the
                         macroeconomic policy framework remains adequate; and (iii) the authorities are carrying out the implementation of the Government's program as described in its Letter of
                         Development Policy. All prior actions have been met and the macroeconomic framework remains adequate. However, implementation of the Program as spelled out in the Letter of
                         Development Policy has not been carried satisfactory and two important actions that the authorities committed to complete before the end of 2012 (concerned with the resolution of a
                         major Bank and the adoption of the recommendations of the TALCO energy efficiency audit) have not yet been fulfilled. It is also too early at this stage to make a firm judgment about
                         the progress towards the end of the series objectives, especially given unavailability of more up to date information for the results monitoring framework (as compared to the appraisal
                         stage).
