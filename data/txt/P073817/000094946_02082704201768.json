Reform\n            Loan Project builds on the country's programmatic\n            structural adjustment program in support of the medium-term\n            social reform policy, and, is a critical element of the\n            Bank's assistance to the Government's development\n            strategy. Specifically, the project will: 1) establish a\n            pro-poor social expenditure regime, and adequate social\n            protection mechanisms for the poor; 2) improve access by the\n            poor to critical social programs, by improving targeted\n            assistance, efficiency, and rationalization of expenditures;\n            and, 3) improve transparency in social programs, and\n            expenditures, as well as empower beneficiaries to\n            participate in policy, and budget processes. However, the\n            project differs from the previous programmatic operation in\n            a major way, at three levels: it attempts to link structural\n            adjustment actions with medium-term results indicators (many\n            related to the Millennium Development Goals); it facilitates\n            transition from short-term budget protection during a\n            prolonged economic slowdown, to a medium-term shift in pubic\n            expenditure to benefit the poor; and, it supports a\n            consistent program of social reforms, with a series of\n            single tranche adjustment loans, complemented closely by\n            technical assistance, and programmatic investment loans in\n            health, and education."}, "docdt": "2002-08-19T00:00:00Z"}
