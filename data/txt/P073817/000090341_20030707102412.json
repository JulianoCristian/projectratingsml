AND EVALUA", "versiontyp": "Final", "loan_no": "4678", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The ratings for the Programmatic Social\n            Reform Loan (02) for Peru were as follows: the outcome was\n            satisfactory, the sustainability was likely, the\n            institutional development impact was modest and, the Bank\n            and borrower performance were both satisfactory. The lessons\n            learned include: the number of specific components,\n            activities, conditions and implementing agencies\n            incorporated into an operation should be bounded by and\n            prioritized within the coordinating and supervision\n            capacities of the Bank and the Borrower. The designation of\n            a subset of these elements as benchmarks and triggers for\n            follow-up operations may help to specify priorities but does\n            not significantly lighten coordinating and monitoring\n            responsibilities, so long as the non-highlighted objectives\n            are also to be taken seriously. The Pension Reform\n            Adjustment Loan (PSAL) instrument, designed as a series of\n            one-tranche loans, is useful for giving flexibility to\n            adjust program details over time, and thus, assures\n            continuity of support to an agreed medium-term program of\n            reforms. It offers the potential in Peru, for example, of\n            now adjusting program elements to the requirements of\n            governmental decentralization, while maintaining the overall\n            coherence of its programmatic objectives. At the same time,\n            however, it potentially presents a trade-off between\n            maintaining continuity in support and evaluating rigorously\n            the achievements of program phases whose future direction\n            may change because of country circumstances. Judgment is\n            further complicated by the number of components, some of\n            which will inevitably progress more rapidly than others. The\n            probability of success of fast-disbursing programmatic loans\n            that require substantial analytical foundations and involve\n            significant institution building is enhanced by the\n            availability of financing for technical assistance. An\n            accompanying technical assistance loan or similar financing\n            under a parallel investment loan also provides the resources\n            and \"foot in the door\" for the intensive\n            supervision that is typically required by capacity-building\n            support. The agenda of reforms encompassed by the\n            Programmatic Social reform Loan (PSRL) and the successful\n            decentralization of government functions are, appropriately,\n            being given high priority in the assistance programs for\n            Peru of the Bank, other IFIs, UN and bilateral agencies.\n            Greater attention should be given by all involved to\n            achieving active coordination of these assistance efforts."}, "docdt": "2003-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
