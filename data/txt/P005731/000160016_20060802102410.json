Lessons\n            learned from the project: The project restructuring should\n            have been done earlier and in a formal way to allow for a\n            formal revision of the development objectives. Considering\n            the shift in strategic thinking about private sector\n            participation (PSP) in the water and sewerage sector and the\n            failure of some build-operate transfer schemes in developing\n            countries, the Bank should have been less aggressive with\n            regard to promoting PSP schemes. The Bank should also be\n            more realistic in terms of cost recovery for sewerage and\n            progress already accomplished tariffs in Tunisia as compared\n            to other countries. Financial covenants related to increases\n            of sewerage tariffs are always difficult to obtain from the\n            Government. They are usually obtained just before the loan\n            is made when the Bank's leverage is the highest. A key\n            factor of the project's moderate success in improving\n            overall sector performance and achieving most development\n            objectives lies in the National Sewerage Board's strong\n            institutional capacity and long familiarity with the\n            Bank's procedures and requirements."}, "docdt": "2006-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
