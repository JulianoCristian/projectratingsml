F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
From the PAD: Lesotho's citizens are less isolated and have improved access to services and
market opportunities, through a better managed, more complete, safe and affordable transport
system.

  From the Financing Agreement: The objective of the project is to enhance prospects for
economic growth in the Recipient's territory through provision of an efficient and integrated
transport system that is safe and affordable to improve access to services and market
opportunities for all across the Recipient's territory.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
In the August 2012 restructuring approved by the Board a new Project development objective
(PDO) was introduced worded "to improve the connectivity in selected transport networks in
the Recipient's territory". The Financing Agreement was accordingly amended in September
2012.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1   Context at Appraisal

1.      The Kingdom of Lesotho is a mountainous country with a population of about two
million people. It is entirely surrounded by the Republic of South Africa and this proximity
inevitably influences its macro economy. Lesotho is classified as a lower middle-income
country and has a gross national income per capita of US$1,210; the incidence and degree of
poverty varies, but is more severe in the isolated highland areas where there are limited
income opportunities and high costs of service delivery. Maseru, the capital, is the country’s
main economic node. Only ten per cent of Lesotho’s land is suitable for cultivation and
agriculture is mostly of a subsistence nature. The economy relies for its income primarily
from clothing manufacturing, diamonds, and the sale of water to South Africa from the
Highlands Water Scheme, in addition to revenues from the Southern African Customs Union
(SACU) and workers’ remittances.

2.      When the Integrated Transport Project (ITP) was under preparation, the Government
of Lesotho’s (GOL) development strategy was largely based on the Sixth National
Development Plan, the 2004 Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) and the country’s “Vision
2020” document. Infrastructure development, under which the transport sector falls, was the
third priority area in the PRS, but transportation links were regarded as vital to implement the
country's strategic objectives. Given Lesotho's landlocked location and mountainous terrain,
it was considered important to have an efficient transport system that ensured cost-effective
access to economic opportunities, markets, and basic services, as well as reliable links to
external markets and ports.

3.      Roads and road transport are the backbone of Lesotho’s transportation system. In
2003, when the project was conceived, the extent of the road network (managed by all
authorities) was 7,436 km of which only 1,150 km were paved.1 This has grown to 7,900 km
of which 2,500 km are paved in 2015. Private companies and individuals provide public
passenger services, while air transport infrastructure consists of an international airport and
several smaller aerodromes. A short stretch of railway line also connects Maseru with the
South African railway system. In the remote highlands a network of bridle paths, footbridges
and river crossings provide limited and sometimes difficult access to main roads for the rural
population.

4.       Institutional measures identified in the Transport Sector Program had their origins in
a GOL Letter of Road Sub-Sector Policy (1995), which laid the foundation for a series of
institutional and policy reforms, with support of the Bank-financed Road Rehabilitation and
Maintenance Project (RRMP) (P001403) that closed December 31, 2003. The RRMP assisted
the creation of a Road Fund (RF) and Road Fund Board, the consolidation of two road
management agencies (Labor Construction Unit and Civil Works Section) in the Department
of Rural Roads (DRR), the improvement of road maintenance management capabilities, and
a move toward private contracting, along with training of public and private sector

stakeholders. These reforms required fundamental changes to established practices, but at
appraisal of the ITP the new institutions were not yet functioning as efficiently as had been
intended. The rationale for Bank involvement in ITP has been to build upon and expand the
support platform established in the RRMP. Although this project included some significant
road investments, the concept also addressed the need for a comprehensive and integrated
approach to transport provision in Lesotho based on strengthening existing institutional
capacity, including policy, transport planning, and road safety. The European Union (EU)
through the European Commission (EC) agreed to co-finance the project from the European
Development Fund through a Trust Fund (TF-90728).

1.2   Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

5.      The Project development objective (PDO) in the original Financing Agreement was
to enhance prospects for economic growth in the Recipient’s territory through provision of
an efficient and integrated transport system that is safe and affordable to improve access to
services and market opportunities for all across the recipient’s territory.

6.      The Project Appraisal Document worded the PDO slightly differently: Lesotho’s
citizens are less isolated and have improved access to services and market opportunities,
through a better managed, more complete, safe and affordable transport system.

The Original PDO indicators included the following:

         The quality of national road network as measured by the Lesotho Road
          Management System (LRMS) is improved from 27 percent good and 38 percent
          fair to 39 percent good and 46 percent fair by 2010;
         The average travel cost to social services and markets for beneficiary populations
          in targeted areas along the South Eastern (SE) Corridor for emergency and regular
          trips is reduced by 20 percent by 2009; and
         The International Comparison Program (ICP)2 for the targeted areas along the SE
          Corridor and Sekake decreases by 20 percent by 2009.

1.3   Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

7.      Additional International Development Association (IDA) credit was approved in
2010, because of higher than expected bid prices and the addition of a poverty alleviation
subcomponent in respect of designated rural access roads (see section 1.6). The results
framework was also modified slightly at this time, mostly to align the wordings with the
core indicators and add two new PDO indicators to reflect the mandatory rural accessibility
index (RAI) and “number of beneficiaries” requirement as core indicators, as shown in the
Additional Financing paper. The two newly added PDO indicators were “share of rural
population with access to an all-season road (within the project area)” and “direct project
beneficiaries (number), of which female (percentage)”. At the same time, the indicator on
“ICP’ changes between the targeted areas along the South Eastern Corridor and Sekake has

decreased by 20% by 2009” was dropped due to attribution problems, as ICP change was
affected by many external factors outside the project.

8.      In the 2012 “level one” restructuring the words “to improve the connectivity in
selected transport networks in the Recipient’s territory” replaced the original PDO, and this
was confirmed in the amendment to the Financing Agreement dated September 14, 2012.
The PDO and Results Framework were refined to reflect outstanding activities to be
completed and to align with project interventions (see section 1.7).

1.4   Main Beneficiaries

9.      The entire population of Lesotho was expected to benefit directly or indirectly from
the project, but especially communities living in the vicinity of the southeast corridor and
other roads selected for improvement. Primary beneficiaries were the road users who would
benefit from a more efficient, and safer road system; the improved roads were also expected
to assist access to markets and services. Policy and institutional reforms were intended to
lead to better integration and efficiency for a number of government departments and
agencies including Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT), the Department of
Road Safety (DRS), Ministry of Local Government (MLG); the Department of Civil
Aviation (DCA), local authorities and the Maseru Municipal Council (MMC).

1.5   Original Components

10.    The original components were financed by means of IDA credit (4237-LSO) of
US$11.2 million and an IDA grant of US$12.3 million (H255-LSO). EU Trust Funds
accounted for US$9.5 million (EUR 7.85 million: TF90728), and the GOL provided US$5.2
million for a total of US$38.2 million.

11.    Component A: Policy and Institutional Reform in the Transport Sector. Total
US$10.044 million: Financing: Government US$0; EC US$9.500; Bank US$0.544. This
component was designed to support Government's proposed institutional reforms in the road
sub-sector and had two sub-components:

12.    Sub-Component Al: Support for Road Sub-sector Institutional Reforms (fully funded
by EC). The activity was to support Government's reform effort with:

         Advisory services for planning change and implementation support at central and
          local level.
         Capacity building for the RD; refurbishing/equipment for RD; capacity building
          for local authorities; equipment for local authorities;
         Training for staff redeployment to other public sector activities resulting from the
          organizational arrangements.
         Preparation for private sector development to replace most remaining force
          account (departmental construction) activities;

13.     Sub-Component A2: The roads sub-sector development and capacity support
(funded by EC, except where indicated) to finance technical assistance, institutional support
and training resources for the implementation of key reforms stated in Government's Letter
                                               3
of Sector Policy including:

          Road safety program with focus on establishment of driver training and
           examination system, vehicle inspection system, piloting dangerous spot
           rectifications, purchase of traffic surveillance equipment and creation of a Road
           Safety Council;
          Institutional capacity for database and Geographic information system (GIS);
          RF revenue reforms, with a focus on improving cost recovery mechanisms and
           achieving full self-sufficiency by 2010, as well as improvements in RF
           management, RF monitoring mechanisms and road management and
           maintenance funding stakeholder awareness program;
          Study of basic access and mobility including an Intermediate Means of Transport
           (IMT) study and pilot project;
          A local construction industry development plan, (fully funded by IDA);
          Continuation of the contractor’s training program;
          Technical assistance for a study on alternative surfacing standards (fully funded
           by IDA);
          Institutionalizing of environmental management;
          Upgrading of LRMS including: (a) mechanized road condition survey for Roads
           Branch (RB) roads; (b) annual review of RB and the DRR - and future RD road
           program; (c) expanding the system for urban roads.
          Evaluation of options for Department of Traffic and Transport computerization;
          Implementation of computerization of vehicle registers, licenses and data (fully
           funded by IDA).
          Supporting capabilities in social assessment and monitoring, gender issues,
           HIVIAIDS prevention and GIS capabilities
          Technical assistance for implementing agencies (DRR and RB) as well as RD
           upon establishment.

14.    Sub-Component A3: Policy reformulation and capacity building in other transport
sub-sectors (fully funded by EC).

          Maseru Urban Planning and Transport Study. In the light of inadequate urban
           transport planning and management capacity within MMC and in other urban
           centers, MPWT and later RD will, in the medium term, assist in the management
           of the urban road network until such time that sustainable institutional and human
           resources capacity has been established in MMC and other urban centers to
           provide and maintain adequate infrastructure and related services. The purpose
           was to undertake a comprehensive study of the MMC's overall urban planning
           and management activities, with a special focus on the transport system. Focused
           studies will also be undertaken in other sectors, such as utilities, housing,
           employment, community facilities, and environmental services.
          Integrated transport study and policies development (Civil Aviation, Rail, IMT
           and Inland Water Transport) aligned with the road sub-sector. Policies,
           strategies, development, and management of the indicated sub-sectors have
           traditionally been elaborated in isolation of each other and the road sector. In
           order to achieve a better-integrated transport sector, this subcomponent was to
                                              4
           support GOL’s efforts in stocktaking and elaboration of a complete set of policies
           and strategies appropriately aligned with the road sub-sector.
          Capacity Building. Capacity building was to be carried out through training, in
           line with the proposed reform for transport sector staff. The current draft-training
           plan is to be discussed between Government and funding agencies during
           implementation.

15.      Component B: Infrastructure Investments. Total Including Contingencies;
US$23.375 million: Funding: Government US$4.700; EC US$0; Bank; US$18.675. This
component was to support the Government's prioritized program for some key network
improvements through rehabilitation of paved roads needing emergency repairs,
contributing in opening of new corridors, and limited upgrading of rural roads considered
critical for improving accessibility in isolated areas. Included are civil works, design and
supervision services for the following activities:

          Improvements for the Northern Corridor through emergency repairs on the paved
           section Oxbow-Mokhotlong, which has deteriorated rapidly due to frost
           susceptible material in the base course;
          Construction of two bridges over the Senqu and Senqunyane rivers, their
           approaches, and a limited length of access road. This investment forms part of a
           multi-donor effort on the Roma–Romabanta–Semonkong–Sekake to Qacha's
           Nek, South Eastern Corridor. It will reduce the distance by140km between the
           two regional centers of Qacha's Nek and Maseru.
          Upgrading of Rural Roads, through the upgrading of 25km of the Mantsonyane-
           Lesobeng road and 8km of the Likotopong-Lints’a feeder road. This area is
           largely inaccessible due to difficult terrain, yet critical for the socioeconomic
           development of the eastern region.
          Construction of footbridges in the Senqu/Senqunyane area as well as IMT access
           improvements, and the undertaking of HIVIAIDS interventions.

16.     The design and supervision was to be fully funded by IDA, while civil works were
to be co-funded by GOL and IDA at 20 percent and 80 percent, respectively.

17.   Component C: Project Management and Monitoring and Evaluation. Total:
US$2.781; Funding: Government US$0; EC US$0; Bank US$2.718.

          Technical assistance for the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) to finance the
           local consultant positions for Project Manager, Financial Manager, Financial
           Controller, Financial Accountant, Procurement Compliance Officer,
           Environmental and Social Coordinator, and HIV/AIDS Coordinator, with
           support of a Secretary, Office Assistant and Driver, as well as operating costs
           related to the execution of the project;
          Additional TA support for the Planning Unit to finance the local consultant
           positions for Statistician and Assistant Statistician; and
          Monitoring and evaluation, including HIV/AIDS, gender, poverty alleviation,
           and economic development associated with civil works.

1.6   Revised Components

18.     Additional Financing (AF). On September 16, 2010 the Board approved an
Additional Financing to the value of US$15 million in the amount of an additional IDA
credit of US$8.5 million (4827–LS), of which US$2.5 million was funded by the Pilot Crisis
Response Window (PCRW), and an additional grant of US$6.5 million (H623-LS), of which
US$2.5 million was also funded by the PCRW. This window was created to respond to
countries affected by the negative impacts of the global financial crisis. Additional
Financing was to cover a cost overrun of US$10 million on the Senqu-Senqunyane bridges,
due to substantial increases in the prices of fuel, bituminous products, and other materials
and a decline in the US dollar against other key currencies; and scale up activity for the
periodic maintenance (resealing and repairs) to the value of US$5.0 million covering two
sections of rural roads in the northern region: Nyenye to Makhoroane and Teyateyaneng to
Mapoteng Junction, for a total of 64 km. The resealing was expected to generate 6,000
person-days employment during the project period. The results framework was also revised
and improved.

1.7   Other significant changes

19.    Restructuring. The project was restructured five times: twice in respect of the Trust
Fund and three times concerning the credits/grants:

            In December 2010 a level two restructuring took place to extend the closing date
             for the associated Trust Fund by one year due to delays in signing the
             administrative agreement between the EC and the World Bank, because there were
             inconsistencies with a generic financing agreement EC had previously signed with
             the GOL;
            In September 2011 there was a level two restructuring to extend the closing date
             of both the grant agreement for the EC funds by one year to December 31, 2012
             and the administration agreement of Trust Fund by one year to June 30, 2013 to
             allow sufficient time to complete the activities under component A of the original
             project;
            In September 2012 a level one restructuring was discussed and approved by the
             Board to modify the project objective and the results framework, reallocate funds,
             and retroactively extend the closing date. The Board also discussed issues related
             to the erroneous disbursement of funds to a debarred contractor;
            In January 2014 the project closing date was further extended by one year under
             a level two restructuring to June 30, 2015, some three and a half years later than
                                                 6
           originally planned; and
          The final level two restructuring was carried out in February 2015 to reallocate
           funds from civil works, goods and operating costs in favor of supervision
           consultancy services.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1   Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

20.     The project was forward-looking and augmented donor coordination. Since the
MPWT encouraged more collaboration between donor organizations, the EU confirmed it
would participate through co-financing the project and this gave momentum to an integrated
approach, aimed at better coordination of the other transport modes with the dominant road
system. Apart from standard financial covenants, there was a requirement for the GOL to
establish and make operational a semi-autonomous Roads Directorate by the end of 2008.

21.     The previous Bank-financed project, the RRMP, offered four lessons and these were
taken into account during project design. These lessons were the need to avoid fragmentation
in road management by the creation of a single responsible entity; a requirement to improve
revenue from road user charges; the need to open up the southeast corridor and improve
mobility to connect the rural poor; and the need for appropriate coordination of maintenance
funds. The project included, rationalizing road management institutions, achieving
sustainable road maintenance funding, ensuring stakeholder participation in road
management, a shift from force account works to contracting; and the building of capacity
in the public and private sectors to support these actions. A stand-alone sector-based
financing instrument was deemed the best option to finance the ITP, while a project
preparation facility was used to cover the costs of inter alia detailed engineering design and
bidding documentation for the bridges and their approaches. The background analysis was
reasonably sound. Based on the RRMP experience and government interactions during
preparation the commitment to the project by GOL appeared strong. Looking back, however,
the preparation team seriously underestimated the institutional capacity constraints, the
administrative difficulties in co-financing with a development partner, and underestimated
contract costs, which caused considerable delays. Later, procurement issues compounded
these problems. The expansion of the project due to the need to remedy flood events and
alleviate impacts of the global financial crisis could not, however, have reasonably been
foreseen. Although the results framework was adequate, it would have been considerably
improved had it included outcome indicators for sector reform, integration, and road safety.

22.     In the event, the reform measures were not vigorously pursued, the capacity of the
RD still fell short of needs, although it improved in efficiency, and the financial management
was barely adequate. Thus not all mitigation strategies were sufficiently effective. The risk
of working with another development partner was also not addressed. Prior to construction
a baseline socio-economic assessment at community and household level was carried out
and during preparation the project received funding from Genfund to pilot a participatory
approach in respect of gender aspects, criteria for rehabilitating footbridges and tracks, and
identification of potential indicators for monitoring and evaluation. The social issues
addressed in the project included social safeguards triggered by civil work construction,
                                               7
retraining of force account laborers and training for private small contractors as well as
HIV/AIDs prevention measures. Several risks were documented and mitigation strategies
were laid out, categorized as high, medium or low (Table 2):

2.2   Implementation

23.     The original project was approved on October 19, 2006 and became effective on
February 22, 2007 in compliance with all covenants. Delays were due to negotiations in
respect of the Administration Agreement with the EU and issues regarding design details.
Additional Financing was approved on September 16, 2010.
                                                    8
24.     Mid-term Review. The mid-term review mission took place between May 25 and
June 4, 2009, about six months later than originally planned. The review found that while
implementation progress was broadly satisfactory, there were concerns such as insufficient
attention to the improvement of the RF. This entailed the need to finalize key appointments
and submit audit reports for 2008/09. On the other hand the RD was already fully operational
and the enabling bill had been reviewed by the Law Office and was ready for submission to
the Cabinet and Parliament. Good progress was also being made with the implementation of
the investment component. Furthermore, some 500 km of roads together with personnel,
immovable property and equipment had been transferred to the MLG, consistent with the
Government’s decentralization policy. In addition, the Government introduced tollgate fees
(2008) and raised the road maintenance levy (2006) increasing RF revenues from LSL 57.5
million in 2007/08 to LSL 79.5 million in 2008/09. However, this amount was still
insufficient to cover maintenance and the mid-term review team proposed that
administrative expenses be reduced and that priority be given to funding routine and periodic
maintenance before allocating for rehabilitation and upgrading works.

25.     Cost Overrun on the Senqu-Senqunyane Bridges. The cost overrun for the Senqu and
Senqunyane bridges was due to a deficient cost estimate based on questionable preliminary
design assumptions, and was affected by substantial increases in the prices of fuel,
bituminous products and other materials, as well as a decline in the US dollar against other
key currencies. Bid prices also trended higher because of a glut of work for contractors
engaged with infrastructure in preparation for the 2010 Soccer World Cup in South Africa.
The lowest bid came in US$10 million higher (i.e. 85 percent more) than estimated. In order
not to delay the project unduly, the Bank project team proposed that the work be divided
into two stages: stage one would be the bridge construction and approaches with earth roads
for the connecting road sections, and stage two would be the balance of earthworks, sub-
base and bitumen surfacing of the road, which would need to be funded by Additional
Financing.

26.     Defects on the Senqu-Senqunyane Bridge Works. Several defects were identified, the
most serious of which was settlement on the bridge approaches and the need for slope
stabilization measures. Since it was unclear whether further settlement would occur the Bank
advised GOL to appoint an independent professional to monitor the situation including
through the rainy season. This independent expert, in the view of the Bank and implementing
agency provided an excellent service.3 No further settlement was recorded thereafter and in
due course the defects were satisfactorily rectified.

27.     Completion of the Nyenye–Makhoroana road. The rehabilitation of the Nyenye–
Makhoroana road was still ongoing at project closing, but was substantially completed and
finalized by December 2015. Lot one, the first 20 km, has been substantially completed
using Bank funds, while lot two, 17 km, was implemented using Government funding.
MPWT showed the Bank documentation validating that the required financing has been
allocated to complete the works at the time of project closing.


3
  MPWT went on to use this expert at the Bank’s suggestion to advise on similar problems occurring on a RF
financed project of 4.8 km of rehabilitation of the Motimposo-Lancer’s Gap road.

2.3   Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

28.     The original project design called for the data for the project outcome and results to
come from the project progress reports, financial reports, road condition surveys, audit
results, road management system outputs, as well as Government published records. The
PIU was responsible for the data collection relating to agreed performance indicators, and
analysis of the project results to compare with the projected outcomes. Baseline data
collection on the project’s primary outcome indicators was carried out in 2006 before
effectiveness in conjunction with the establishment of a GIS capability in respect of the
quality of the national core road network, the average travel cost to social services and
markets for beneficiary populations in targeted areas along the South Eastern Corridor, and
ICP changes between the targeted areas along the South Eastern Corridor. For reasons of
attribution, the latter indicator was dropped in 2010 when additional credit was provided. It
was replaced by a new (mandatory) indicator for rural access measuring the number of
people with access to an all-season road in the project area.

29.     However, there was then no measure of enhancing prospects of general economic
growth. In the main project area there were data to show that average household income had
increased, but perhaps surprisingly, this was not designated as a formal indicator even
though it was measured in the baseline and social impact studies. Similarly, the timesaving
for individuals would have been a useful indicator, but this was subsumed in the rate of
return estimate under efficiency. The number of female beneficiaries (52 percent of the local
population) was however specifically recorded. Outcome indicators in respect of sector
reform, integration and road safety would have enhanced the design.

30.      Only intermediate outcome indicators were used to measure the sector reform
initiatives. Typically, such outputs were studies completed or training activities undertaken.
There was little attempt to assess the impact of those activities. Some other changes in 2010
were minor refinements of the wording and updates of end targets. The importance of road
safety was acknowledged by noting the number of road safety workshops and campaigns,
but strictly speaking this was an intermediate result rather than a core indicator and was later
reflected as such in the 2012 restructuring. A good PDO outcome indicator of road safety,
often used in other countries, would have been a reduction in the road accident fatality and
injury rates, but in Lesotho’s case the available statistics were considered too unreliable.

31.     During the 2012 restructuring the development objective was simplified, reflecting
the nature of the remaining work still to be undertaken. Resealing of the Teyateyaneng and
Nyeneye area roads had to be replaced by full rehabilitation after extensive flood damage.
A Social Impact Survey was completed in 2014 superseding an interim study done in 2012
(see Annex 5). Quarterly monitoring and evaluation reports were submitted regularly.

2.4   Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards Compliance

32.    The ITP was designated as an Environment Category “B” project – a partial
assessment since the road improvements followed existing alignments where the potential
adverse impacts were considered to be easier to mitigate. Three safeguard policies were
                                               10
triggered: Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01), Physical Cultural Resources (OP/BP
4.11) – mainly avoidance of graveyard sites - and Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12).
Safeguards instruments prepared for the project included a sector environmental assessment,
a resettlement policy framework, an environmental and social impact assessment (disclosed
at Info Shop on July 19, 2006), and a resettlement action plan (RAP). Environmental and
social development specialist positions were part of the PIU in the first year of
implementation. In the second year a HIV/AIDS prevention coordinator was also recruited.
However, both safeguards specialists moved on in the second year of the project creating a
hiatus that was only filled in May 2009, when new positions were assigned to the newly
formed Roads Directorate established under the project. During this gap period quarterly
progress reports on safeguards matters were not produced and the mid-term review team
requested this matter be attended to.

33.     Capacity was, however, strengthened and there were extensive investigations and
consultations with the local communities. A baseline survey was carried out. The IMT study
also helped identify ways in which rural access could be improved in the project area and
small civil works were carried out using local contractors trained in the DRR contractor-
training program. The preparation of safeguard instruments was satisfactory for the original
project, but less so for the Additional Financing. Implementation was unsatisfactory, as the
assessment of safeguards impacts after the Additional Financing approval had been
underestimated. Specifically, environmental mitigation measures were neither
systematically monitored nor documented; workers’ safety measures were only respected
partially, and several additional resettlement activities were subsequently identified. For
example, new culverts resulting from changes in road design induced adverse impacts on
farmland and the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) mission noted that stones and
loose material in many places had fallen onto the roads. Further, no safeguards specialist (or
consultant) was made part of the Bank’s supervision missions for Additional Financing, and
a RAP completion report had not been prepared.

34.      Initial resettlement per se was confined to two households, but compensation also
had to be provided for many strips of farmland, where the existing alignment was improved
or the road widened to provide bus and taxi stops. For the Nyenye–Makhoroana road, the
Bank cleared the environmental management plan and reviewed the plans to move a small
number of temporary stalls to allow for sufficient construction space for the work activities.
Many taxis use this route and these vehicles congest the village of Makhoroana. A new taxi
rank is under construction at a site adjacent to the center of the village that will provide toilet
facilities and sites for hawker’s stalls. This matter has been discussed with the local chief,
who enabled the land donation for the site, but the ICR team expressed concern that no
formal engagement had yet been made with the taxi association, which should have been
involved at a much earlier stage. Expected savings in contract costs will be used to provide
traffic calming measures and safe walkways for pedestrians in the villages along the route.

35.      In 2012 life expectancy in Lesotho was seven years lower than life expectancy at
birth compared with World Health Organization’s statistics for the region. Although over
the last ten years the incidence of HIV/AIDS deaths per 100,000 people has decreased from
695.1 in 2000 to 582.9 in 2012, Lesotho still has the second worst HIV/AIDS record


                                                11
globally.4 For this reason HIV/AIDS prevention activities, such as education and ensuring
availability of condoms, were important in this project. A significant awareness campaign
took place in 2010, when there was a full time HIV/AIDS coordinator in the PIU, but after
this position was closed the activity was mainstreamed by the PIU and less attention appears
to have been given to this issue under AF, although this is denied by the implementing
agency. The Social Impacts Study reported, however, that HIV/AIDS infection rates had
increased. Prostitutes frequented the construction camp, but because of its remote location
supplies of condoms were not always readily available. Overall, safeguards performance
was moderately unsatisfactory.

Fiduciary Compliance

36.    Financial Management. The financial management of ITP experienced challenges
throughout implementation with performance varying between unsatisfactory and
moderately satisfactory. During the financial management review of component A (largely
financed by the EC) several weaknesses were observed: for example, the audit report for the
year ending March 31, 2012 was delayed, statements of expense reviews had not been
possible because of a computer crash in the accounting system (for which there was no back
up), and there were lapses in the internal control environment. This resulted in a financial
management rating of unsatisfactory in December 2012. Although there was subsequent
improvement this function was never strong despite intervention in the form of “hands-on”
support and portfolio training both in country and in Johannesburg. By closure the
performance had to some extent stabilized with a final rating of moderately satisfactory as
unqualified audit reports were in the end submitted and the project finances were mostly
disbursed.

37.     Procurement. For all purchases and contracts the project adhered to the
Government’s existing policies and procedures for locally financed procurement, which
were in harmony with those of the Bank. IDA-financed international procurement of works,
goods, and consulting services followed the Bank’s standard procurement procedures and
documentation. The procurement function was, however, slowed by significant delays and
sometimes-laborious procedures awaiting approval from the Government Procurement Unit
and Tender Panel. This adversely affected the utilization of the available grant money from
the EU and when the contribution agreement was ended, some EUR 576,277 unused funds
had to be refunded. The detailed discussion of the issue involving the debarred contractor
on stage two of construction of the Senqu-Senqunyane bridges is covered below (although
mentioned in the Bank’s procurement and consultant selection guidelines, this is primarily
an anti-corruption issue5).

38.    Appointment of a Debarred Contractor. The firm that had been contracted for the
stage one works began implementation. This firm, however, became debarred from bidding
on any further Bank-financed projects for a period of five years effective from January 2009,
because of alleged collusive practices in the Philippines. The World Bank Integrity
Department conducted detailed investigations and sanctions were imposed against the firm

concerned. Prior to the approval of the Additional Financing in 2010 the Bank, according to
its procedures, should have advised that the stage two works were very unlikely to be
financed by the contractor used for the stage one works, even if the bid price were favorable.
This important matter was not mentioned in the project paper requesting approval. Despite
the debarment issue, the firm in question was nevertheless appointed by GOL for the stage
two works and invoices to the value of US$4.35 million were in error paid by the Bank even
though a no objection had yet to be provided, thus this amount became ineligible
expenditure. The Bank initially sought a refund from GOL for the disbursed amount, but
because of GOL’s deteriorating fiscal capacity brought about by the financial crisis,
eventually accepted the Government’s request to provide substitute invoices for eligible
stage one works that had already been fully paid by GOL. 6 Consequently the GOL and the
Bank agreed to reallocate the resources as follows:

     US$4.35 million would be allocated to finance the already completed stage one works
      previously funded by GOL. The Government would provide invoices for eligible
      expenditures. This change effectively increased IDA’s contribution for the works from 42
      to 63 percent; and
     US$5.65 million would be allocated to the rehabilitation of two junction roads, Teyateng-
      Mapoteng and Nyenye-Makhoroana. This was because recent extensive flooding now
      necessitated complete rehabilitation rather than periodic maintenance of this
      infrastructure as originally planned. The US$5.65 million was in addition to the US$5.0
      million already earmarked for periodic maintenance under Additional Financing.


2.5      Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

39.     Most of the activities at closure were either completed or close to completion. The
rehabilitation of the Nyenye–Makhoroana road was not yet completed by the project closing
date, but was substantially completed, and completed by December 2015. The MPWT will
take responsibility for ongoing maintenance. Discussions have commenced for a follow-on
project (P155229) Lesotho: Transport Infrastructure and Connectivity. This will
complement the ITP and pursue further some of the reform initiatives begun, but not carried
forward due to lack of funding. The new project identifies the need to improve rural and
urban mobility as well as access to safe and sustainable transport. It also recommends the
use of performance-based contracting to try to improve the quality of road maintenance. The
need to ensure sufficient funding for maintenance will be pursued in the context of ensuring
there is appropriate capacity in the RD for handling more maintenance activities (see also
section 4).

40.     Road Network Maintenance Issues. According to the visual condition surveys carried
out by the RD, the directorate manages 5,864 km of the total Lesotho road network of 7,436
km. RD is responsible for 1,526 km of paved roads, 3,036 km of gravel roads, 1,170 km of
earth roads, and 132 km of tracks. The maintenance of this network, both routine and
periodic, is financed from the RF and the Government budget. Based on LRMS, established
under the ITP, the budget includes a rolling three-year priority investment program for the
core maintainable road network to eliminate the backlog of deferred periodic maintenance,

6
    This is in accordance with OP 12, Paragraph 8.
                                                     13
avoid further deterioration of the poor roads, and preserve the existing road assets. The RF
also makes a contribution towards road safety. However, the current levels of revenue are
lower than required to properly maintain the road assets. About 28 percent of all paved roads
are in good condition, 55 percent in fair condition, while 27 percent are in poor condition.
The rehabilitation backlog of the paved roads exceeds the norm by 17 percent. 7 For the
unpaved roads the situation is much bleaker: 96 percent are in fair or poor condition,
meaning only four percent are in good condition. The problem is broader than funding since
the RD requires robust institutional strengthening to efficiently provide and maintain a safe
road network. Moreover, the functions of the RF, now operational for several years, require
a review to update responsibilities in line with the changing road network requirements. Not
surprisingly, the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning is reluctant to increase user
charges further, while there is a capacity bottleneck in implementation. Part of the problem
is the difficulty of recruiting and retaining good engineers when they can earn up to three
times more in the private sector in South Africa.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1      Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance of Original Objective
Rating: Substantial

41.      This ITP was prepared and appraised in the context of the GOL’s Sixth National
Development Plan, the 2004 Poverty Reduction Strategy, and the “Vision 2020” document.
Infrastructure (including transport) was seen as the third highest priority. The Transport
Sector Program 2004-2010, accordingly focused on strengthening the country's strategic
transport networks, both for in-country and external linkages as well as improving the
institutional capacity to manage transport assets and services. To achieve enhanced impact,
the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) 2006-2009 proposed a results oriented framework
based on four strategic objectives: to fight HIV/AIDS; achieve more employment and
income generation through better economic growth; improve human development
outcomes; and decentralize public service delivery. In this regard ITP was of substantial
relevance because it addressed improving the inadequate economic and social integration of
the rural and mountainous areas and, at the same time, enabled the development of potential
commercial opportunities such as agriculture and tourism. It also targeted institutional
reform and skills development to improve competitiveness and move toward more client-
focused public service delivery.

42.     The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY2010-14 recognized the impact of
the global economic recession, which had led to a fall in SACU revenues, declining export
sales and reduced remittances. However, the high levels of public expenditure that had been
possible prior to the recession had to be constrained. GOL initiated significant spending cuts,
especially in major recurrent expenditure categories, in order to restore long-term fiscal
sustainability, but recognized a need to get better value for public resources by increasing
the efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery. The global economic crisis also
highlighted the country's economic vulnerability and pointed to the necessity of accelerating

progress in laying foundations for economic competitiveness and export diversification.
When the AF was approved for ITP it was partly funded from the Crisis Response Window
(CRW) and included roads to be constructed using manual labor to help alleviate the
negative impact of the global financial crisis. Accordingly, the relevance of the ITP
continued to be substantial, even in a deteriorating situation.

Relevance of Revised Objective
Rating: Substantial

43.     The revised objective was to “improve the connectivity in selected networks in the
Recipient’s territory”. Since the reform component was complete there was no need to refer
to it. The completion of two investment sub-components remained substantially relevant.
Further funds for rural roads severely damaged by flooding were made available in part from
the CRW and these works were considered a high priority to the GOL because some villages
were entirely cut off in adverse weather.

Relevance of Original Design
Rating: Substantial

44.      The project had three components: the first reviewed the policy and institutional
framework of the sector (component A), the second provided needed investments and jobs
during construction to improve access in some of the remoter areas of the country
(component B), while the third provided the necessary means to project, manage, and
monitor the project (component C). The causal linkages between the performance indicators
and the PDO were reasonably aligned to the provision of a more efficient, safer, and
affordable transport system that would improve access to services and market opportunities.
In this regard component A was important since it sought to help establish an integrated and
efficient approach to transportation in Lesotho through a comprehensive review of policy
that would look at how the different modes of transport connected to the road system. The
revised institutional approach incorporated a semi-autonomous Roads Directorate based on
commercial principles and funded by a RF. The National Road Safety Council meanwhile
was to oversee a new road safety policy.

45.    These measures, together with selected road infrastructure investments were
expected to enhance economic growth, but the international comparison indicator that was
supposed to show economic improvement was abandoned early on for reasons of attribution
and replaced with an indicator that measured access to an all season road. The way the PAD
worded the objective was actually better than that in the Financing Agreement, since it did
not purport to measure ITP’s contribution to economic growth. Overall, the design concept
was sound and some of the delays in the investment component could not reasonably have
been foreseen, although they eventually impacted the realization of many of the reform sub-
components. The indicators for the reform component were all of an intermediate nature and
could have been better linked to a sustainable development outcome.

Relevance of Revised Design
Rating: Substantial

46.    When the project was restructured in 2012 a new PDO was approved, namely: “to
                                             15
improve the connectivity in selected transport networks in the Recipient territory”. This
simplification reflected the work that remained outstanding in ITP as funds for the policy
and institutional aspects were largely expended. The results framework was slightly
amended to support the new objective. The Nyenye-Makhoroane road had to be re-designed
for rehabilitation instead of periodic maintenance because it had deteriorated as a result of
extensive flooding.

3.2   Achievement of Project Development Objectives

47.     As noted above, in September 2012 the Financing Agreement was amended
following a level one restructuring. At this point 67 percent of the project funds had been
disbursed and 33 percent still remained for disbursement. In such circumstances evaluation
guidelines indicate that the project outcomes should be rated against the original objectives
and against the revised objectives weighted by the share of credit/grant disbursement before
and after the revision took place.

Performance against Original objectives
Rating: Substantial

PDO: to enhance prospects for economic growth through provision of an efficient and
integrated transport system that is safe and affordable to improve access to services and
market opportunities.

i) Evidence of achievement of PDO:

48.     The achievement of original PDO is considered substantial. By the project closing
date, all the PDO targets have been met, i.e. the target of National roads in good and fair
condition (39 and 46 percent respectively); the average travel cost per trip in the southeast
corridor had already reduced 40 percent from LSL 1200 to LSL 900; and 42 percent of the
population in the corridor had benefitted directly by gaining access to an all-season road.
The PDO indicators show improvements in efficiency, affordability, and better access.

49.      The major southeast corridor was opened up and successfully completed, and a
number of rural roads were reconstructed or repaired, substantially improving accessibility
and affordability of transport for the population in these areas. The southeast corridor link
through Qacha’s Nek to Maseru resulted in travel time savings of almost three hours. Taxi
services have begun operating between Maseru and Qacha’s Nek and locally, though th e
findings of the social impact study indicate that the taxi fares are unregulated and that the
high charges reported need to be referred to the Traffic Commissioner. Nevertheless, in spite
of the taxi fares being unregulated, the reduced travel time between the two regional centers
still yields travel cost savings, making it more affordable. Upgrading of the 37 km of
Nyenye – Makhoroana and 40 km of Oxbow–Mokhotlong road sections improved access to
services and markets and reduced transport costs to road users through savings in vehicle
operating costs. Construction of three footbridges and IMT access tracks improved access
of the population in the Senqu/Senqunyane area, which was cut-off from the government
services and job opportunities. Improvement of 33 km Mantsonyane- Lesobeng rural roads
enabled an all-season road access for the population in the eastern region, which was largely
inaccessible due to difficult terrain.
                                             16
50.     There were no outcome indicators to measure progress in transport sector integration
or safety. However, the road sector reforms carried out with the project’s support improved
the efficiency of road sector management by shifting responsibilities from the MoPWT to a
newly set up semi-autonomous Roads Directorate and reducing the administrative costs of
the Road Fund from 25 to 12.8 percent. Significant step was initiated also for a more efficient
and effective road safety management through establishment of Road Safety Council;
however, given that it was not fully operationalized by the project closing, the road safety
objective is considered only partially achieved. For transport sector integration, several
transport studies were carried out under the project, including the urban transport planning
and transport study and an integrated policy and strategic roadmap for aviation, rail, IMT
and water transport; however, considering that the implementation of these studies was not
taken forward by the Government, this objective is also considered as partially achieved.

51.     In regards to the PDO on “enhancing prospects for economic growth”, the
international comparison indicator intended to measure this was dropped when the data were
found to be unreliable and when attribution issues were recognized. Nevertheless, since most
of the GOL economic goals were based on the existence of a good transport system and
since there was a positive return on the major road links in the form of time savings and
savings in vehicle operating costs, it is presumed that economic growth was enhanced by
the project. The economy of Lesotho grew at an annual rate of four percent per capita over
the past decade8. In the Senqu-Senqunyane catchment area some 20,000 people that were
previously very isolated had much better access to employment opportunities and to
government services, as they had to spend hours waiting for a boat to cross the river in order
to reach a hospital located on the opposite side. The employment vicinity has also been
expanded as many were not even able to seek work opportunities in town across the river.
As for the temporary work opportunities provided to the population in the project
construction works, the numbers were usually not recorded, but were clearly substantial.
There were also specific labor-intensive rural roads sub-components with the sole intention
of providing local jobs. In addition, the training of small contractors, and the opening up of
areas for agriculture and tourism would have been beneficial to the economy, especially
considering the growing tourism sector that has accounted for 4.6 percent of GDP and
employed 20,500 workers in 2012.9

ii) Evidence of achievement of intermediate indicators:

PDO: Efficient transport system that is safe

      (a) Support for road sub-sector institutional reforms

52.    Consultants were engaged to support capacity building and developed a blueprint to
guide planning and change management. A road safety advisor was appointed for a period
of 12 months, while consulting firms were appointed to develop systems, plans, studies and
technical manuals. The RD was approved by parliament on March 12, 2010. The design was
commercially orientated under professional management, with some autonomy.

Responsibility for about 500 km of local roads was transferred along with personnel,
immovable property, and equipment to the Ministry of Local Government in line with
Lesotho’s decentralization policy. At completion the RD was fully operational with few
vacant positions. RF staffs were recruited in accordance with Legal Notice for RF
Regulation, 2005. In addition, some 900 personnel were redeployed to other Government
agencies or the private sector and received reskilling instruction. Local government senior
personnel also participated in a study tour to learn more about decentralization practices.
Preparation assistance was provided for private sector development to replace most of the
remaining force account (departmental construction) activities. About 800 former DRR and
RB staffs were retrained; in addition, 455 people from the former road sector force account
received training. Courses included how to start and improve a business (guided by
International Labor Organization manuals). The latter was organized and carried out through
the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning.

   (b) Road Fund Revenue Reforms and Support for the Roads Directorate

53.     The RF was intended to ensure sustainable funding for routine and periodic
maintenance. Revenue for road maintenance from user charges was increased in 2006 and
tollgate fees at border crossings were introduced in 2008. At the same time a stakeholder
awareness program concerning these developments was carried out so the public had a better
understanding of the need for maintenance. Furthermore, a commitment was made to adjust
user charges upwards gradually as needed. Some achievements did occur under the project.
Revenues increased by 36 percent between 2011 and 2014, while administrative costs
decreased from 18.1 percent to 12.8 percent during the same period. However, the current
level of revenue is still lower than is required to properly maintain the road assets, resulting
in a growing maintenance backlog. This said, the Ministry of Finance and Development
Planning is reluctant to permit further increases unless the capacity of the RD is expanded
to enable spending of the funds provided.

54.     A study and subsequent installation of a GIS was completed and the system is
operational and used as a planning tool. Staff were appropriately trained and mentored. The
main outputs were a GIS information system and a GIS decision support system. On the
other hand, technical assistance for a study on alternative surfacing standards was abandoned
due to cost considerations and over-ambitious scope, while the planned study on
management of the social and environment agenda was cancelled after the consultant raised
the bid price by 30 percent during the negotiation phase. Reinforcing this decision, MPWT
had in any case developed an in-house capability in this area. The Lesotho Road
Management System (LRMS) study report and road condition survey were completed, the
system was reinstalled and staff given initial training. This has enabled better planning and
reporting. Technical assistance activities for the implementing agencies were also fully
accomplished.

   (c) Implementation of computerization of vehicle registers, licenses and data

55.     An agreement between South Africa and Lesotho regarding the electronic National
Administration Traffic Information System (eNATIS) (traffic information system including
computerization of vehicle registers and licenses) was concluded, but was not taken further
due to the protracted nature of the consultations between the countries; legal issues in South
                                               18
Africa have jeopardized the rollout. Some wiring at district level was done in anticipation
of eNATIS implementation, but the bulk of the installation work and hardware is
outstanding. Although US$300,000 was set-aside in the project for eNATIS, the amount was
later reallocated due to the continuing slow progress with bilateral negotiations.

   (d) Road safety program

56.     A crucial intermediate indicator was that a National Road Safety Council (NRSC)
should be established and functioning. A policy paper presented by MPWT in 2010
recommended the establishment of the NRSC and the Cabinet approved this. However, it
has not been acted upon, ostensibly because of the limited time availability of the nominated
board members, but in reality demonstrating limited political commitment to road safety.
Similarly, the current Road Traffic Act dates from 1981 and although a bill updating the
laws was prepared in 2010, it has not been enacted and consequently it does not reflect best
international practice while the penalties prescribed in the Act are extremely low in today’s
terms.

57.     The project supported some 20 road safety workshops and campaigns. Raising
awareness through campaigns and education has become the main activity of the Road
Safety Department of MPWT and has some support at political level because of the visibility
provided for local politicians. While this has sometimes led to tangible actions such as the
installation of speed humps to slow traffic, there is little evidence that the campaigns have
had a measurable impact on road safety, given the limited capacity for road safety law
enforcement. The average annual rate of traffic fatalities in Lesotho fluctuates around 15
deaths per 100,000 people, which is three times worse than the best performing countries in
the world. Nevertheless, syllabus amendments to include road safety issues have been
approved and implemented by the Ministry of Education. Under ITP the improvement of
the training of driving school instructors and examiners met its target of 100 training
sessions, but most trainee drivers are still instructed by non-professional friends and
relatives.

58.      The current vehicle inspection system was also reviewed and both police and
inspectors, who were trained on a once-off basis, received operational manuals. Although
there are three vehicle inspection centers, the ICR team established that none have working
equipment to test vehicles, meaning that only visual inspections are possible leaving open
opportunities for corruption. The recommendation that the vehicle inspection process be
privatized has not made progress. Some road safety pilot projects were proposed and two
traffic circles were designed for the City of Maseru. These traffic management
improvements were not carried out, however, since there was disagreement concerning the
best design solution and in the end there was insufficient time left for implementation before
the Trust Fund closing date. Consequently IDA gave a no objection to the funds being used
for the procurement of road safety materials. Equipment was also purchased for the road
safety information unit as well as for the traffic police, which included speed guns. However,
some 7.2 percent of the EU funds were returned unspent - more equipment could have been
provided had the procurement process started earlier. Although the road safety sub-
component was a small part of the overall project it is clear that a larger and more sustained
initiative is required in the follow on project.

                                              19
59.    In addition, considering that the roads and bridges constructed have improved the
driving conditions, this results in higher levels of traffic with high speed and consequently
increased road accident risks on these roads. However, given the regional nature of the road
corridors, which these road sections and bridges are part of, relatively high design standards
have been adopted with appropriate safety measures incorporated to mitigate potential safety
risks.

   (e) A local construction industry development plan and industry training

60.    Two studies were completed – one on a local construction industry development plan
and the other on the development of standard bidding and contract documents, curriculum,
syllabus, and training material. The overall goals were to create a sustainable environment
and promote best practice. Staffs from 24 construction companies were trained in two
batches, with an additional course for further interested parties.

PDO: Improved access to services and market opportunities, affordable transport

   (a) Study of basic access and mobility including IMT study and pilot project

61.     A study of basic standards and needs was completed. Outputs covered an appropriate
framework for improving rural access, selection criteria, revised design standards, as well
as identification of IMT service suppliers. The infrastructure was built under component B.
Technical assistance was provided to MPWT for supporting capabilities in social assessment
and monitoring, gender issues, HIV/AIDS and GIS capabilities. Given the prevalence of
HIV/AIDS the project area contained many orphaned children. These orphans received
intervention packages under the project that included food and other items.

   (b) Construction of footbridges in the Senqu/Senqunyane area as well as IMT access
       improvements, and the undertaking of HIV/AIDS interventions

62.     In addition to the study discussed in component A2 above, construction of the access
infrastructure (footbridges and tracks) was completed using small contractors. Originally it
had been planned that some IMT goods such as bicycles, motorbikes and animal carts would
be procured, but the Government requested that these funds rather be used for river
crossings. IDA gave a no objection to the procurement of riverboats. Other planned social
sector activities were completed including community radio, assistance to clinics, and
distribution of food packages for orphans, and HIV/AIDS awareness programs

PDO: Integrated transport system

   (a) Policy Reformulation and capacity building in other transport sub-sectors

63.     The reform activities were mostly accomplished by completion and the road reforms,
including the operation of the RD, have also made progress. Integration of the transport
system was supported through the development of an integrated transport policy. The study
proposed better modal interchange facilities including the international airport, the Maseru
railhead and container terminal, urban bus terminals and rural bus stops. In the remote areas

                                              20
it stressed the importance of footbridges and river ferry services. Regarding the findings of
the Maseru Urban Planning and Transport Study, this has largely superseded the Maseru
Development Plan of 1990. Proposals were made to intervene in the ongoing sprawling
development that characterizes Maseru currently, and to establish an integrated spatial
development approach.

PDO: Efficiency, access, connectivity

   (a) Improvements to the Northern Corridor through emergency repairs to the paved
       section Oxbow–Mokhotlong:

64.     This paved road in the northeast highlands (107 km) was originally designated for
emergency repairs, but had deteriorated rapidly due to frost susceptible material in the base
course. Reconstruction works had to be carried out on 67 km, while 40 km were resealed,
achieving the revised target.

   (b) Upgrading of Rural Roads, comprising 25 km of the Mantsonyane-Lesobeng road and
       the upgrading of 8 km of the Likotopong–Lints’a feeder road:

65.     Prior to this sub-project, this area was largely inaccessible due to difficult terrain,
although it was important for the socioeconomic development of the eastern region. The
entire 33 km road section was fully upgraded, with 20 km completed under the project using
labor-based methods. .

   (c) Construction of two high level bridges over the Senqu and Senqunyane rivers, their
       approaches, and a section of access road:

66.     The support provided under the project to construct two high level bridges on Senqu
and Senqunyane rivers enabled successful completion and opening of the major Roma–
Ramabanta–Semonkong-Sekake-Qacha's Nek southeastern corridor. A number of access
roads and approaches reconstructed or repaired under the project substantially improved
accessibility for the population living in these areas. . The project comprised the construction
of the remaining link to create a corridor between Maseru and Qacha’s Nek and reduced the
distance by140 km between the regional centers. The road consists of a paved 7.4 m road,
with two high level bridges.

   (d) Senqu/Senqunyane area footbridges constructed and IMT access improved:

67.     This indicator has been fully achieved, with three access footbridges constructed and
access tracks improved. Construction of the access infrastructure was completed using small
contractors. Originally it was planned that some IMT equipment such as bicycles,
motorbikes and animal carts would be procured, but the Government requested the funds be
used for river crossings, and thus accordingly riverboats were procured under the project.
All social sector activities (such as community radio and assistance to the clinic) were also
carried out, including HIV/AIDS awareness programs in these area.

   (e) Upgrading of Nyenye-Makhoroane roads

                                               21
68.     As part of the Additional Financing approval in 2010, US$5.0 million was approved
from the pilot Crisis Response Window for the periodic maintenance of 64 km of roads to
Nyenye, Makhoroana and Teyateyaneng in the northwest of Lesotho. In the 2012
restructuring, due to extensive floods in Lesotho, the resealing of the Teyateyaneng –
Mapoteng and Nyenye – Makhoroana was replaced by the rehabilitation of the 37 km of
Nyenye – Makhoroana road only. This was because in the meantime the Nyenye area roads
in question had seriously deteriorated and were in poor condition, having been badly
damaged by extensive flooding constraining accessibility severely – some villages were
virtually cut off. The Government also undertook separately to finance the section of road
from Mapoteng Junction to Teyateyaneng. These rural roads were seen as high priority for
the GOL as they directly provided connectivity benefits and higher level of service to the
users. The work was still in progress at the time of project closing, but was substantially
completed, and finalized by December 2015.

   (f) Appointment of project staff and operating costs related to the execution of the project

69.     The PIU was established in February 2007 with 11 staff to coordinate and facilitate
project implementation. Although there was some staff turnover, the PIU was managed
reasonably effectively, but was scaled down and some of its functions were mainstreamed
as the project matured.

Performance against Revised Objectives
Rating: Substantial

PDO: Improved connectivity in selected transport networks

70.     At the time of restructuring in 2012, the PDO was officially revised, however, there
were no changes made to the original PDO indicators and targets. It is also important to
note that the following two new PDO level indicators were introduced during Additional
Financing in 2010: “share of rural population with access to an all-season road (within the
project area)” and “direct project beneficiaries (number), of which female (percentage).”

i) Evidence of achievement of PDO:

71.     The revised PDO of improving connectivity in selected networks has been
substantially achieved as evidenced by the following: (i) average travel cost in targeted
project areas has been reduced achieving the target of 40 percent or a decrease from LSL
1500 to LSL 900 per trip by the end of the project; (ii) share of rural population with access
to an all-season road within the project area has increased to the targeted 42 percent by the
end of the project; and (iii) the direct beneficiaries from the project have reached the targeted
number of 9,372 people, of which 52 percent are women, by the project closing. Target for
“roads in good and fair condition as a share of total classified roads” was achieved by 2010,
but at closing in 2015 roads in good condition fell 1 percent short of target.

72.     The construction of major road corridor links as well as access and rural
infrastructure improved connectivity and the level of service to road users in the following
selected networks: (i) completion of the new southeast corridor link through Qacha’s Nek
to Maseru connecting further to South Africa resulted in reduction of the circuitous
                                               22
alternative route through Quthing by 140 km, saving almost three hours in travel time; (ii)
upgrading of the 37 km of Nyenye – Makhoroana roads contributed largely to greater
connectivity as well as the improved level of service to road users in the area; (iii)
construction of three footbridges and IMT access tracks improved connectivity and access
of the population in the Senqu/Senqunyane area to government services and job
opportunities; (iv) resealing of the 40 km Oxbow–Mokhotlong road section improved the
connection of the Northern Corridor responding to the emergency condition of the road; and
(v) upgrading of 33 km rural roads in Mantsonyane and Lesobeng provided an all-season
road access to the population in the eastern region, which was largely inaccessible due to
difficult terrain.

3.3 Efficiency

Original PDO
Rating: Modest

73.     The MPWT carried out an ex post project evaluation on the costs and benefits
emanating from the upgrading of the Mantsonyane–Lesobeng road and the corridor
completed by the Senqu and Senqunyane bridge construction link. In addition, the Nyene-
Makhoroane was subject to a separate economic evaluation. The repairs to the Oxbow-
Mokhotlong road were not evaluated because of their emergency nature, while the reform
and project management components and the capacity building activities were not conducive
to such analysis. About 78 percent of the final project cost was evaluated.

74.      The completion of the remaining link in the Roma–Sekake corridor (i.e. the two
bridges and their approach roads) effectively opened up a new main through route. Parts of
the road did not exist before the construction; only a poor earthen track offered some access
to the area. Movement was only possible between villages in the area for some 20,000 people
by horseback, on foot, or via ferries (for river crossings). During the wet season even this
was extremely difficult. The road has now been improved to offer a high quality pavement
throughout its length. This reflects its potential for use as a long distance route for heavier
vehicles in the future. The route is 140 km shorter than the alternative through Quthing.
Opportunities for tourism would also become possible (e.g. the Maletsunyane Falls – the
highest single drop waterfall in Africa. At the time of appraisal, the Roma–Sekake corridor
was evaluated using the highway design and maintenance model HDM-3. It was based on
projected traffic estimates and savings on using the longer alternative route. The economic
internal rate of return (ERR) was estimated to be 15.8 percent and the net present value
(NPV) 108.7 at a 12 percent discount rate.

75.    The completion evaluation is based on the World Bank’s multi criteria Economic
Decision Model (RED) methodology and uses similar figures for expected traffic generation
(35 percent). The report uses a recent traffic survey and shows that current traffic levels are
around 450 per day on average, between Roma and Sekake. Input costs are higher than at
appraisal, however, because the construction of the bridges was much more expensive than
expected. The subcomponent was 27 percent of the final total project cost at completion. In
order to assess the benefits of the investment, a calculation was made for a range of
economic indicators. These included the ex post ERR and NPV, calculated for the Senqu
and Senqunyane bridges projects. An ERR of 14.6 percent has been calculated and an NPV
                                              23
of 210.3 at 12 percent discount rate.

76.     The non-quantifiable benefits associated with the corridor include the effects of
improving access in the vicinity of the bridges, which will create new economic
opportunities, enabling better access to education and particularly health facilities that
already exist in the area; potentially encouraging new tourism related investments in the
area; and creating the opportunity for workers residing in the area to access employment
opportunities throughout Lesotho and South Africa. On the other hand, as the road and
bridges are completely new, the situation has changed from one with very little traffic and
no crashes, to one with higher levels of traffic with high speed. However, given the regional
nature of the corridor, relatively high design standards have been adopted for this road,
which incorporates appropriate safety measures.

77.     Turning to the Mantsonyane–Lesobeng road, it was passable only by four-wheel
drive vehicles and not at all during wet periods. Traffic levels were around 80 vehicles per
day. Whilst it was not possible to significantly improve the alignment of the road, which
reflects the rugged topography of the area, major improvements were made in terms of
width, safety, and passing opportunities. Around 27 km of the road were improved to gravel
standard and the other 13 km were paved, reflecting the steep nature of these sections. An
ERR of only 3.7 percent was calculated however at a 12 percent discount rate. The NPV
was 61.02. This is low, due to the difficult terrain and the need to pave the steeper sections.
The main benefits include vehicle-operating costs and travel timesaving, which were
assessed using the RED Model. However, a major consideration in this case was poverty
relief whereby part of the project was built using local manual labor funded through the
Crisis Response Window. It was also recognized that the area served has higher agricultural
potential than many other highland areas. This sub-project accounted for about US$5.95
million or 7.5 percent of the final total project cost.

Revised PDO
Rating: Modest

78.     The Senqu and Senqunyane bridges project was divided into two stages. Since the
ERRs were calculated for the whole corridor (including sections not specifically part of ITP)
the results were unaffected by which party funded which stage. Under the Additional
Financing it had been intended to apply periodic maintenance (resealing and repairs) to two
sections of road (64 km) – Nyene-Makhoroane and Teyateyaneng-Mapoteng Junction.
However, after considerable damage to both roads due to extensive flooding complete
rehabilitation became necessary. Since there was insufficient IDA funding for the whole 64
km, the Bank focused on the first lot (20 km) of the Nyene-Makhoroane road, and GOL
undertook to cover the costs of the latter (17 km) as well as the Teyateyaneng-Mapoteng
road. The average daily traffic using the facility was about 585. An economic evaluation
using the RED model was carried out in respect of the estimated costs for the road from
Nyenye to Makhoroane (37 km), indicating an ERR of 10.6 percent and an NPV of 69.07.10
Some technical alternatives were suggested, but did not make a material difference to the
result. Actual bid costs, however, were about US$6.3 million higher than expected, which

10
  This was based on a social discount rate of eight percent corresponding to the rate used in South Africa in
2013
                                                      24
would have pushed the rate of return below the normally acceptable threshold (no further
analysis is recorded in the Bank’s project portal). Given the fact that the villages benefitting
from the improvements were frequently inaccessible during wet weather, and served areas
of agricultural potential, the GOL nevertheless regarded this infrastructure as a high priority
and the Bank acceded to this view. The final cost of the road (including the section funded
solely by GOL) is expected to be around US$34.6 million or 43.7 percent of total project
costs including GOL’s contribution, making this the costliest sub-project in the ITP. This
may be compared with the Senqu-Senqunayne road section, which was 27 percent of total
project cost.

79.     It is a moot point as to whether the opportunity cost of these alternative expenditures
was optimal for the Bank, but since the ineligibility of the Senqu-Senqunyane (stage two)
contractor to receive Bank funds had not been highlighted in timely fashion, the Bank had
an obligation to help GOL find a solution.

80.      Operational and Administrative Efficiency. Looking back at the overall efficiency of
the project there were further factors that need to be taken into account. The project
experienced accumulated delays of three and a half years, while nine years elapsed between
approval and completion. Because the investment component took so long, the initiative to
implement the sector reforms (25 percent of the original project cost) was largely lost and
now these reforms will have to be picked up in the follow-on project. This is inefficient
because some of the studies and recommendations will have to be updated because of
circumstances that have changed in the meantime. Many officials who were involved in
these activities have moved on and the process will have to start anew with different
incumbents. There were missteps in not identifying soon enough that the contractor for stage
two of the Senqu-Senqunyane bridges was debarred leading to ineligible expenditures,
considerable embarrassment and probing questions by the Board of Executive Directors on
the effectiveness of Bank procedures. While this is partly a reflection of Bank performance
it clearly also introduced unexpected delays affecting the benefit stream. Finally, there were
additional delays in concluding the administrative agreement between the EU and the Bank.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

81.     Taking into account substantial relevance and modest efficiency ratings discussed
above, as well as the weighted average efficacy rating of “substantial” given the shares of
project resources used over the two respective periods was {(0.67x4) + (0.33x4)} = 4.00,
the overall outcome is moderately satisfactory reflecting moderate shortcomings in the
operation’s achievement of objectives. 11

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

82.     At appraisal a number of potential risks were identified. First was the likelihood that
the reform measures would not be carried out. This has partly materialized as there has been

11 The formula is the split evaluation of the PDO achievement to assess the overall outcome rating based on
the weighted average of the outcome ratings of the original and revised PDOs weighted in proportion to the
share of the actual credit disbursements made in the period before and after the restructuring.
                                                     25
little sustained progress on the reform component beyond the achievement of the
intermediate targets. This was because the investment component took far longer (nearly
four years) to complete than anticipated and there were no funds available to pursue further
the reform initiatives that had commenced. A policy paper compiled by MPWT in 2010
recommended the establishment of the NRSC and the Cabinet approved this. However, it
has not been acted upon, demonstrating limited political commitment to road safety.
Similarly, the current Road Traffic Act dates from 1981 and although a bill updating the
laws was prepared in 2010, it has not been enacted and consequently it does not reflect best
international practice and penalties prescribed in the Act are extremely low. Similarly, the
national integrated transport policy and the Maseru urban planning and transport study,
though useful reference documents, have lacked funding to follow through on the
recommendations. This may be addressed in the follow on project, subject to the availability
of resources.

83.      A further area of risk related to the sufficiency of revenue accruing to the RF for road
maintenance; this aspect has been addressed to the point where about 87 percent of the
required funding for periodic maintenance for main roads is available, compared to 72
percent when the project commenced. The improved revenue stream has been achieved
through increasing user charges and reducing administration costs, but still falls short of
needs. The condition of most gravel roads, including some financed under ITP, is
inadequate. Road user charges have not been adjusted since 2010. Given inflation, the
volatility in the fuel price and fluctuations in the volumes of traffic this situation can change
rapidly, so a future risk lies in there being insufficient funds available. The Ministry of
Finance and Development Planning is reluctant, however, to permit further funding
increases since the capacity of the RD to spend existing funding is constrained. There are
not enough engineers to carry out the work program effectively.

84.     Although implementation capacity has been strengthened through a technical
assistance program and the establishment of the RD as a semi-autonomous entity, this aspect
needs more attention. Although the GOL approved the new RD and the level of efficiency
in managing the roads has improved, the move to a full Road Agency, which has proved
successful in other countries, is still a matter for debate, although recommended by the Bank.
A proposal in the follow-on project is also to introduce performance-based works for a small
secondary road network still to be identified. This would involve some core rehabilitation
work and a commitment by the successful contractor to maintain this network against agreed
measures of performance. The concept has been successfully introduced in several other
developing countries in Africa. The strengthening of private sector capacity as part of a
construction industry plan is also ongoing and supports the ability of small contractors to
undertake routine maintenance work as required. However, such capacity building needs to
be continuous as the absorptive capacity of the contractors is low and will need further
attention in the future. The training is paid from the RF, which already has a constrained
budget. The availability of well-paid employment in neighboring South Africa that can
attract persons with skills away from Lesotho continues to be an issue that is less easy to
resolve.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

85.     A strong, well-balanced team was put together for preparation and appraisal. The
Bank clearly identified the main country transport sector issues and these included a need
for improved and coordinated management of the road system including urban roads, the
lack of sufficient funding for road maintenance, limited implementation capacity, and a lack
of coordinated transport policy. The Bank played a leadership role in coordinating aid with
other multilateral donors and secured a commitment from the EC to co-finance the ITP.
However, the Bank underestimated the complexity of working with a major partner, because
in the event it took some time for the PIU and Bank staff to understand EC requirements and
procedures - the administration agreement was delayed for a year. The results framework
was adequate, but required more thought, as it later needed modification. Lessons were taken
from the previous Bank-funded project (RRMP) and considered in the project design. The
importance of establishing functioning GIS systems was recognized as well as the need to
use this tool in decision-making. The design also aligned with the country assistance strategy
and Lesotho’s six-year transport sector program. Good preparation was done in respect of
participatory assessments of social needs in the project areas. Issues to receive attention
included social safeguards triggered by civil works construction, retraining of force account
laborers as small contractors as well as the need for HIV/AIDS prevention measures and
establishing criteria for improving rural access.

86.     However, looking back, the Bank to some extent underestimated the capacity
constraints, the need for a robust results framework, and administrative difficulties in
working with a major development partner, as well as substantially underestimating contract
costs in a volatile economic environment.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

87.      Some 20 implementation supervision reports were submitted for this project and
visits were reasonably frequent, but some specialists were unavailable at times due to a
heavy work program. The administration agreement for the EC Trust Fund was delayed by
a year because of a need to reconcile inconsistencies with a generic agreement previously
signed by the EC and GOL. Consequently, this delayed startup, fund disbursement, and the
payment of some consultants. In the interim funds from both IDA and GOL were used to
fill the gap, and these amounts were refunded at a later stage. The Bank put appropriate
fiduciary measures and safeguards in place, but both needed more attention as
implementation progressed.

88.     One of the major activities under Component B was the construction of the Senqu-
Senqunyane bridges and associated road works. Since the bid prices were much higher than
expected it was decided to divide the work into two contracts so as not to slow down the
project. The stage one contract (US$23.3 million) was awarded in February 2008, but in the

                                              27
meantime the Bank debarred this firm for five years commencing in January 2009 because
of collusive practices on a Bank-funded project in the Philippines. In August 2010 additional
credit was approved for ITP in the amount of US$15 million of which US$10 million was
to cover the outstanding stage two works for the bridges. In the paper to the Board requesting
Additional Financing, it should have been made explicit that the firm appointed for stage
one, was now likely to be ineligible for Bank funding under stage two. Such information
should have been provided in accordance with the Bank’s Manual of Procedure of 2008.
This did not happen, although the paper anticipated that the stage two works would be
pursuant to an addendum to the existing contract requiring specific procurement clearance
from the Bank.

89.     Shortly after the Additional Financing was approved there was a change in the Bank
team. On February 2, 2011 the Bank discovered during a routine review of project related
information in the project portal that US$4.35 million had already been disbursed against
the Additional Financing even though the contract addendum review had not been
completed and a no objection decision had yet to be made. Consequently, the TTL made an
urgent request to the disbursement office in Johannesburg to stop further disbursements
against this contract.

90.      This turn of events created a difficult situation for both Bank and Borrower. At first,
the Bank requested GOL to refund the ineligible amount, but the Government responded
that this would be extremely difficult due to a lack of fiscal capacity worsened by the global
financial situation. It was thus proposed and confirmed in the 2012 restructuring that
invoices paid by the GOL for the stage one works would be retroactively reimbursed to the
value of US$4.35 million. While this fungible approach technically meant that the Bank was
not directly funding the debarred contractor, it enabled GOL to do so. Of greater concern to
the Board, though, was the failure in the Bank’s system to identify the issue in a timely
manner and resolve the matter expeditiously. The Board asked for a special meeting on the
matter. This took place on September 11, 2012 at which time the proposed restructuring was
approved. However, this was not an easy discussion and one executive director voted against
the motion, while three other directors abstained. The Board also underscored the
importance of internal controls and accountability issues and urged management to review
this case, learn its lessons, and further improve the relevant systems and corporate culture.

91.     The Borrower’s ICR, reflecting their perceptions of that time, suggested (without
providing specifics) that the “quality and effectiveness of some task team leaders had been
inadequate because some remedial measures had not been elaborated in a timely manner,
and some relevant information had not been made available when the need arose”. They also
noted “delays amounting to a year in approving the Additional Financing Agreement”.
However, this was incorrect – the reference should have been to the year it took to restructure
the project following the debarred contractor debacle. While this was partly explained by
the need for negotiations with GOL in respect of the erroneous disbursements, there were
undoubtedly unacceptable delays in the Bank review system prior to presenting a proposal
to the Board. This prompted the Board to express its concern “that it took management more
than one year to inform the Board on this issue”.

92.    It should also be mentioned that although the course of action pursued favored no
funding of the debarred contractor, there could have been a case put forward that there was
                                               28
no material change in the contract, which had for convenience been divided into two stages.
Stage one was the construction of the two bridges and approaches with earth roads, stage
two was the completion of the layer work and the bituminous surfacing of the road. In the
event, however, the view was taken that this was a material change. Since that time the Bank
has enhanced its system to enable the easy identification of firms that may have procurement
sanctions.

93.     Based on the above alone the rating would clearly have been unsatisfactory, but since
between 2012 and 2015 the supervision was satisfactory, the rating for supervision is on
balance moderately unsatisfactory. A good working relationship was also restored with the
Borrower, while crucial advice was also given in respect of the remaining works for the
Senqu-Senqunyane bridges, where several defects had been encountered including worrying
settlement issues. The Bank proposed the appointment of an independent monitor to review
the problem areas and any remedial work performed. Other outstanding works were either
satisfactorily completed or nearly so by project closure.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

94.     When the rating for one dimension is in the satisfactory range, while the rating for
the other is in the unsatisfactory range, the rating for overall Bank performance normally
depends on the outcome rating. Since the outcome rating is in the satisfactory range, the
overall Bank performance is moderately satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

95.      The GOL was supportive of the project and initially strongly backed the need for
additional revenue for the RF through user charges combined with efforts to reduce
administration costs. While it was recognized that the extent of revenue collection should
be adequate to cover road maintenance costs, the current reality is that there has not been an
increase since 2010 and on occasion the funds are used for non-maintenance activities.
While there has been progress, the RF still does not have sufficient funds to cover
maintenance. Regarding road safety, there was also no commitment to follow through with
the setting up of a functioning NRSC. In addition, while GOL claimed it could not afford to
repay the disputed US$4.35 million due to lack of fiscal space, it was able to somehow find
the US$75 million to complete outstanding civil works connecting the bridges with the
section of road constructed in earlier projects.

96.     On the other hand the GOL supported appropriate legislation for the establishment
of the RD and the delegation of parts of the network (and redeployment of staff) to local
authorities under the decentralization strategy. It also agreed that the selection of the
Executive Secretary of the RF should be carried out on a competitive basis. Progress of
negotiations with South Africa concerning the adoption of mutually acceptable eNATIS
systems were extremely slow and in the end this sub-component could not be completed
within the life of ITP, although largely this was due to factors outside the control of GOL.


                                              29
97.     On the issue of the funding of the debarred contractor the GOL had entered a contract
with the firm and was in a difficult position. The agreement to fund other works
retrospectively was a pragmatic solution albeit far from ideal. The Government
demonstrated its commitment to the project by substantially increasing its financial support,
not only completing the southeast corridor, but also the completion of the Nyenye-
Makhoroane road.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

98.     Initially implementation progress was satisfactory. A Project Management Office
(PMO) or Project Implementation Unit (PIU) was set up and adequately staffed, while the
results framework was established and a baseline survey completed. The Borrower, like the
Bank, technically had a duty to check the eligibility of bidders from the list of firms and
individuals debarred and suspended.12 Realistically, however, it was highly unlikely that
such a check would occur. The implementing agency submitted the stage two invoices for
payment before a no objection was issued. In April 2012 implementation progress was
downgraded to moderately satisfactory because some activities such as training for RD staff
and deployment of staff to other government agencies and the private sector were behind
schedule. There were also weaknesses in financial management and procurement described
in paragraphs 37 and 38. In due course this situation was turned around and the accounting
software system was fully restored, acceptable audits were carried out, procurement
improved, and some quality issues concerning defects on the Senqu-Sequnyane bridge
section were sorted out with the help of an independent monitor. By November 2014, the
implementation status and Results Report upgraded implementation performance to
satisfactory once more. Going forward it is suggested that the procurement and financial
management functions be further strengthened in consultation with the RD and the GOL
civil service.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

99.      Despite some shortcomings in both Government and implementing agency
performance, the outcome of the project overall was in the satisfactory range. The Borrower
had weak capacity, but made maximum efforts to improve it and complete all project
activities in compliance with the Bank’s rigorous fiduciary requirements. Moreover, it is
worth emphasizing the progress made by the Borrower in initiating the reform process in
road safety and road sub-sector in general, which are often a challenge in many larger
countries. Accordingly, overall Borrower performance is considered moderately
satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

100. There is a need for better due diligence when making project cost estimates. The
utilization of detailed rather than preliminary design estimates should be used in
circumstances where the terrain is difficult and an adequate contingency amount should

12
  In accordance with paragraph 1.16(d) of the Guidelines and 1.23(d) of the Consultants Guidelines posted on
the Bank’s external website.
                                                     30
be included. A recurring pattern in this project has been that cost estimates were consistently
underestimated – in some cases quite badly - and this was partly the reason for the delays
amounting to three and a half years. The increase in costs due to the high demand for
contractors prior to the Soccer World Cup event in South Africa should have been foreseen.

101. The Bank’s internal systems need to adequately warn staff and clients of debarred
contractors when bidding procedures are in progress. Clearly the Bank was at fault in
failing to implement adequate systems to identify debarred contractors during the bidding
processes. This has largely been rectified after the event by changes to the Bank’s Manual
of Procedures intended to enhance the Bank’s internal system.

102. When investment and reform components work in parallel in the same project the
risk of delays to the investment component should not be reason to postpone
implementation of the reforms. Project design should take this into account. The sector
reforms in the ITP were evidently hampered by a lack of funds to continue the good
foundation that had been put in place. There was a disconnection between the investment
component that took three years longer than anticipated to complete and the reform
initiatives that were funded only up to 2012.

103. Road projects should take into account the likely impacts on the transport
operators and their passengers affected by the road design and its implementation. While
the impact of the road projects was generally positive on the local population, the main
means of transport on these roads is the minibus taxi. It is apparent that in the future this
aspect deserves more attention in rural road projects. In the case of the Nyenye-Makhoroane
road a new taxi rank is under construction at a site adjacent to the center of the village. The
ICR team expressed concern that no formal engagement had yet been made with the taxi
association, which should have been involved at a much earlier stage. Similarly, in the
vicinity of the Senqu-Senqunyana bridges the taxi operators have formed a cartel and are
charging excessive prices – a matter that needs to be taken up with the local Traffic
Commissioner.

104. Adequate maintenance arrangements for road projects need continuous attention
and a long-term solution. Road maintenance, at least of National roads, has improved under
ITP, but this matter needs to be further pursued in the follow-up project, both in terms of
funding and the adequacy of capacity in the Roads Directorate. Measures need to be taken
to attract more skilled engineers and financial management specialists. The introduction of
performance-based contracts should strongly be considered.

105. For road safety reform to be effective it needs unambiguous commitment from
Government and a comprehensive strategy. The failure of the NRSC to become a
functioning entity in this project emphasizes the importance of political commitment in road
safety agenda and the need for a strong road safety champion at a high level. Lesotho made
a major step in getting the Cabinet’s approval for establishing the NRSC, and while this
legal ground was critical, more work and push were required in building political support to
fully achieve the intended outcomes. Certain conditionalities could be built within the
projects’ designs to incentivize the Borrowers to complete the reform process.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

 (a) Borrower/implementing agencies

106. See Borrower’s ICR in Annex 7. The Borrower’s comments on the HIV/AIDS
activities under the project have been summarized as follows (full comments are presented
in Annex 8):

   It is incorrect to assume that increased HIV and AIDS infections, as reported by the
   Social Impacts Study, was influenced by less attention to awareness campaigns after the
   departure of a full time HIV /AIDS Coordinator in the PIU. The PIU intervention was
   short lived by design and was merely boosting the already started activities by other
   change agents in the project area before and during the construction stage. The issue of
   condoms availability or not in the project area, was never the responsibility of the PIU.
   Despite the efforts made by all agents who tried to create awareness and provide
   training in preventive measures to the communities, the worsening level of poverty and
   poor agricultural production, as well as end of temporary employment in the area, are
   likely to have weakened the livelihood coping strategies, with the result being an
   increasing level of HIV and AIDS prevalence.

 (b) Co-financiers

107. The Delegation of the European Union thanked the World Bank for sharing the
information in the ICR, but had only editorial comments on the text.

 (c) Other partners and stakeholders

108.   There were no other comments received.

                           Annex 2 .Outputs by Component

Original components at appraisal:

Component A: Policy and Institutional Reform in the Transport Sector

A1.    Support for road sub-sector institutional reforms:

Advisory services for planning change and implementation support at central and local
level.

Consultants were engaged to support capacity building and developed a blueprint to guide
planning and change management. A road safety advisor was appointed for a period of 12
months. Consulting firms were appointed to develop the needed systems, plans, studies, and
technical manuals.

Capacity building for the Roads Directorate (RD); refurbishing/equipment for RD;
capacity building for local authorities; equipment for local authorities

The RD was approved by parliament on March 12, 2010. The design was commercially
orientated under professional management, with some autonomy. Responsibility for some
500 km of roads was transferred along with personnel, immovable property, and equipment
to the Ministry of Local Government (MLG) in line with the Government’s decentralization
policy. At completion the RD was well staffed and fully operational with minimal vacant
positions. Staffs were recruited in accordance with Legal Notice for Road Fund Regulation,
2005.

Training for staff redeployment to other public sector activities resulting from the
organizational arrangements

Some 900 personnel were redeployed to other Government agencies or the private sector
and received reskilling instruction. Local government senior staff participated in a study
tour to learn more about decentralization practices.

Preparation for private sector development to replace most remaining force account
(departmental construction) activities

About 800 former Department of Rural Roads (DRR) and Roads Branch (RB) staffs were
retrained; in addition, 455 people from the former road sector force account received
training. Courses included how to start and improve your business (guided by International
Labor Organization manuals). The latter was organized and carried out through the Ministry
of Finance and Development Planning.

A2.    Roads sub-sector development and capacity support:

Road safety program

Because of its poor road accident record, Lesotho placed special emphasis on road safety
                                            34
including increasing the awareness of the need for road safety among stakeholders. The
project focused on establishment of a driver training and examination system (based on a
range of manuals for different vehicle types), a vehicle inspection system, a spot
improvement pilot scheme, established a road accident database, procured traffic
surveillance equipment and supported the creation of the National Road Safety Council
(NRSC). The NRSC was agreed in principle and approved by Cabinet, and a road safety
policy drafted. Priority dangerous spots were to be eliminated and two traffic circles
designed. However, the consultant failed to submit acceptable cost benefit analysis for this
work and IDA gave a no objection to using the funds instead for road safety materials.
Syllabus amendments to include road safety issues were approved by the Ministry of
Education and road safety awareness campaigns were implemented coinciding with seasonal
peaks in road travel. Equipment was also purchased for the road safety information unit. A
training plan was drawn up to provide road safety officers with accreditation.

Institutional capacity for database and GIS and Implementation of computerization of
vehicle registers, licenses and data.

The study and installation of the GIS was completed and the system is operational and used
for planning. Staff were appropriately trained and mentored. The main outputs were a GIS
information system and a GIS decision support system.

An agreement between South Africa and Lesotho regarding the eNATIS (traffic information
system including computerization of vehicle registers and licenses) was concluded, but has
not been taken further due to the protracted nature of the consultations between the countries.
Some wiring at district level was done in anticipation of eNATIS implementation, but the
bulk of the installation work and hardware are in abeyance. Although US$300,000 was set-
aside in the project for eNATIS, the amount was later reallocated due to the slow progress
with bilateral negotiations. It is likely that in future Lesotho will proceed with its own system.
Technical assistance was provided for supporting capabilities in social assessment and
monitoring, gender issues, HIVIAIDS and GIS capabilities.

RF revenue reforms, with a focus on improving cost recovery mechanisms and achieving full
self-sufficiency by 2010, as well as improvements in RF management, RF monitoring
mechanisms and road management and maintenance funding stakeholder awareness
program

The RF was intended to ensure sustainable funding for routine and periodic maintenance.
Road works programs were identified and prioritized by the appropriate ministries. Revenue
for road maintenance from user charges was increased in 2006 and tollgate fees at border
crossings were introduced in 2008, while a commitment was also made to adjust user charges
upwards gradually on an annual basis. Revenues increased by 36 percent between 2011 and
2014, while administrative costs decreased from 18.1 percent to 12.8 percent during the same
period. Surplus revenue (when available) could be applied to new road works and road safety
projects. A stakeholder awareness program concerning these developments and the
importance of good maintenance was also carried out.

Study of basic access and mobility including IMT study and pilot project

                                               35
A study of basic standards and needs was completed. Outputs covered an appropriate
framework for improving rural access, selection criteria, revised design standards, as well as
identification of IMT service suppliers. The infrastructure was built under Component B.

A local construction industry development plan

Two studies were completed – one on a local construction industry development plan and
the other on the development of standard bidding and contract documents, curriculum,
syllabus, and training material. The overall goals were to create a sustainable environment
and promote best practice.

Continuation of the contractor’s training program

Staffs from 24 construction companies were trained in two batches, with a further course for
further interested parties.

Technical assistance for studies on alternative surfacing standards and environmental
management

The work on surfacing standards was not pursued due to cost considerations and the
ambitious scope, which was too complex. Similarly, a study on management of the social
and environment agenda was cancelled after the consultant raised the bid price by 30 percent
during the negotiation phase.

Upgrading of LRMS including: (a) mechanized road condition survey for RB roads; (b)
annual review of RB and DRR - and future RD road program; (c) expanding the system for
urban roads

The LRMS study report and road condition survey were completed, the system was
reinstalled and staff given initial training. Further support will be given under the RF. This
has enabled better planning and reporting.

Technical assistance for implementing agencies (DRR and RB) as well as RD upon
establishment

All activities were successfully completed. A technical expert was appointed to assist.

A3. Policy reformulation and capacity building in other transport sub-sectors:

This sub-component was to finance technical assistance and studies for the elaboration of
transport sub-sector policies and strategies - urban planning and transport; aviation, rail, IMT
and inland water transport aligned with roads sub-sector. These sub-sectors have been
preparing their development plans in isolation from each other and no comprehensive study
has ever been carried out to determine the impact of individual sub-sectors on the overall
economy of the country.

Maseru Urban Planning and Transport Study:

                                              36
The study had three objectives: i) To provide policy, institutional, financial and investment
guidance regarding urban planning and management, urban transport infrastructure and
transport services to the Maseru Municipal Council (MMC) for the next 10-20 years; ii) To
formulate strategies for development of an effective urban planning and transport system in
Maseru, as well as suggesting short and long-term improvements in management systems
and service delivery, which will benefit the city's residents in the short, medium and long
terms.; iii) To provide a policy, institutional, financial and investment framework regarding
urban public transport infrastructure and associated services to the MMC for the short,
medium and long term. This work was completed and although becoming outdated is used
as a reference work.

Integrated transport study and policies development:

The aim was to achieve an integrated approach for all transport modes. This included
reviewing and formulating policy for civil aviation, rail, IMT, and inland water transport,
with the aim of arriving at an integrated multimodal transport policy aligned with the
country's road sub-sector policies. Institutional arrangements for the sub-sectors were also
reviewed and recommendations made. An inventory was developed of condition data for all
transport infrastructures. The roles and responsibilities were also defined for regulatory,
safety and management aspects. Finally, a strategic plan or roadmap was prepared for the
development of aviation, rail, IMT and inland water transport infrastructure, and services.

Capacity building:

A training plan was prepared and capacity building was achieved through training activities
and various courses. Some specialized training was undertaken outside the country. Training
covered laboratory and quality control, information technology, strategic planning,
administration, and several technical and financial aspects. Study tours to learn more about
output and performance based road contracts were organized to Australia, New Zealand, and
South America jointly with the road agencies of Botswana and Mozambique.

Late procurement Issue:

Component A was mostly funded from the EC Trust Fund, which closed on December 31,
2012. Because MPWT procurement began late in a number of instances, US$734,000 were
not utilized and returned. The unfunded procurement covered mainly equipment.

Component B: Infrastructure Investments (original)

Improvements for the Northern Corridor through emergency repairs on the paved section
Oxbow–Mokhotlong:

The road was originally designated for emergency repairs, but since it had further
deteriorated rapidly due to a frost susceptible material in the base course, it was agreed that
full rehabilitation would be done for 67 km, and one section of 40 km would be resealed.

Construction of two high level bridges over the Senqu and Senqunyane rivers, their
approaches, and a section of access road:
                                              37
This investment forms part of a multi-donor initiative on the Roma–Ramabanta–
Semonkong-Sekake-Qacha's Nek South Eastern Corridor. It reduces the distance by 140 km
between the two regional centers of Qacha's Nek and Maseru. The Roma–Sekake project
involves the construction of a partly new road to create a new corridor between Maseru and
Qacha’s Nek. The infrastructure consists of a paved 7.4 m road, with high level bridges where
required. An additional US$10 million was approved to cover a cost overrun for the Senqu
and Senqunyane bridges. This overrun was due to substantial increases in the prices of fuel,
bituminous products, and other materials, a decline in the US dollar against other key
currencies, and competition from a multitude of projects associated with the Soccer World
Cup Championships held in South Africa. In order not to stop the work on the bridges, the
work was divided into two stages: stage one covered the extent of the work possible under
the available budget and stage two was to cover the additional cost.

Subsequent to the approval of the Additional Financing, the Bank determined that the stage
two works could not be financed if the selected contractor completed them, because the firm
concerned had been debarred from bidding on any Bank-financed projects for a period of
five years. However, this firm had already been appointed as contractor for the Senqu and
Senqunyane bridges stage two works prior to the discovery of the debarment and invoices to
the value of US$4.35 million had been paid, thus becoming ineligible expenditures. The
Bank initially sought a refund from GOL for the erroneously disbursed amount, but because
of GOL’s lack of fiscal capacity brought about by the financial crisis, accepted the
Government’s request to provide substitute invoices for eligible stage one works that had
been fully paid by GOL. Several defects were identified, the most serious of which was
settlement on the bridge approaches and slope stabilization issues. Since it was unclear
whether further settlement would occur the Bank advised GOL to appoint an independent
professional to monitor the situation including through the rainy season. No further
settlement was recorded, however, and in due course the defects were satisfactorily rectified
and the work completed. Taxi services have now begun operating between Maseru and
Qacha’s Nek and locally. The Bank has also produced a short video on the benefits of the
corridor.

Upgrading of Rural Roads, through the upgrading of 25 km of the Mantsonyane -Lesobeng
road and the upgrading of 8 km of the Likotopong–Lints’a feeder road:

Prior to this sub-project, this area was largely inaccessible due to difficult terrain, but
important for the socioeconomic development of the eastern region. Some 20 km were
completed using labor-based methods and the remainder using equipment. The steep sections
were asphalt surfaced. A further 13 km was funded by GOL exclusively. The contract
involved drilling and blasting work due to the mountainous terrain.

Construction of footbridges in the Senqu/Senqunyane area as well as IMT access
improvements, and the undertaking of HIVIAIDS interventions:

In addition to the study in component A above, construction of the access infrastructure
(footbridges and tracks) was completed using small contractors. Originally it was planned
that some IMT equipment such as bicycles, motorbikes and animal carts would be procured,
but the Government requested the funds be used for river crossings. IDA gave a no objection
                                             38
to the procurement of riverboats. All social sector activities (such as community radio and
assistance to the clinic) were carried out including HIV/AIDS awareness programs.

Upgrading of roads: Nyenye to Makhoroane and Teyateyaneng to Mapoteng Junction, for a
total of 64 km: Additional credit of US$5 million from the Pilot Crisis Response Window
was part of a response to alleviate the negative impact on Lesotho of the global financial
crisis. Periodic maintenance (resealing and repairs) to the value of US$5 million was to be
undertaken covering two sections of road in the northern region: Nyenye to Makhoroane and
Teyateyaneng to Mapoteng Junction, for a total of 64 km. Bank financing was used for Lot
1 (20 km), while Lot 2 (17 km.) is entirely financed by Government funding. There were
initial delays in startup. Due to extensive floods in Lesotho, the resealing of the Teyateyaneng
– Mapoteng and Nyenye – Makhoroana was replaced by the rehabilitation of Nyenye –
Makhoroana (37 km) road only. The labor-based resealing and repair work was expected to
generate 6,000 person-days employment during the project period.

Component C: Project Management and Monitoring and Evaluation.

Appointment of project staff and operating costs related to the execution of the project

The Project Management Office (or Project Implementation Unit) was established in
February 2007 with 11 staff to coordinate and facilitate project implementation. Some key
staff resigned in 2009 including the environmental and social coordinator, financial manager,
and procurement compliance officer. After a disruptive delay all positions were eventually
filled. Technical assistance was also given to the planning unit.

                       Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The MPWT carried out an ex post project evaluation finalized in June 2015 on the costs and
benefits emanating from the upgrading of the Mantsonyane–Lesobeng road and the corridor
completed by the Senqu and Senqunyane bridge construction link. In addition, the Nyene-
Makhoroane was also subject to a separate economic evaluation. The repairs to the Oxbow-
Mokhotlong road were not evaluated because of their emergency nature, while the reform
and project management components and the capacity building activities were not conducive
to such analysis. About 78 percent of the final project cost was evaluated.

The completion of the remaining link in the Roma–Sekake corridor (i.e. the two bridges and
their approach roads) effectively opened up a new main through route. Parts of the road did
not exist before the construction; only a poor earthen track offered some access to the area.
Movement was only possible between villages in the area for some 20,000 people by
horseback, on foot, or via ferries (for river crossings). During the wet season even this was
extremely difficult. The road has now been improved to offer a high quality pavement
throughout its length. This reflects its potential for use as a long distance route for heavier
vehicles in the future. Climbing lanes and passing places have been provided where
appropriate. The route is 140 km shorter than the alternative through Quthing. Opportunities
for tourism also became possible (e.g. the Maletsunyane Falls – the highest single drop
waterfall in Africa). At the time of appraisal, the Roma–Sekake corridor was evaluated using
the highway design and maintenance model HDM-3. It was based on projected traffic
estimates (data not provided) and savings on using the longer alternative route. The
economic internal rate of return (ERR) was estimated to be 15.8 percent and the net present
value (NPV) 108.7 at a 12 percent discount rate.

The completion evaluation is based on the World Bank’s multi criteria Economic Decision
Model (RED) methodology and uses similar figures for expected traffic generation (35
percent). The report uses a recent traffic survey and shows that current traffic levels are
around 450 per day on average, between Roma and Sekake. Input costs are higher than at
appraisal, however, because the construction of the bridges cost much more than expected.
The subcomponent was 27 percent of the final total project cost at completion. In order to
assess the benefits of the investment, a calculation was made for a range of economic
indicators. These included the ERR and NPV, calculated for the Senqu and Senqunyane
bridges projects. An ex post ERR of 14.6 percent has been calculated and an NPV of 210.3
at 12 percent discount rate. Whilst this section was more expensive than anticipated, the
benefits of this investment are considerable as the road improved access to a previously
isolated area, and created a shorter through route, which significantly reduces the costs of
travel between Maseru and Qacha’s Nek and beyond.

The non-quantifiable benefits associated with the Roma–Sekake corridor include the effects
of improving access to the area close to and between the bridges, which will create new
economic opportunities, enabling better access to education and particularly health facilities
that already exist in the area; potentially encouraging new tourism related investments in the
area; increasing the resilience of Lesotho’s road network to extreme weather and other
events; and creating the opportunity for workers resident in the area to access employment
opportunities throughout Lesotho and South Africa. As the road and bridges are completely
new, the situation has changed from one with very little traffic and no crashes, to one with
                                              40
higher levels of traffic with high speed. In this case it is expected that overall this would
produce a dis-benefit. However, given the regional nature of the corridor, relatively high
design standards have been adopted for this road, incorporating high levels of safety
measures.

Turning to the Mantsonyane–Lesobeng road, it was passable only by four-wheel drive and
not at all during wet periods. Traffic levels were around 80 vehicles per day. Whilst it was
not possible to significantly improve the alignment of the road, which reflects the rugged
topography of the area, major improvements were made in terms of width, safety, and
passing opportunities. Around 27 km of the road were improved to gravel standard and the
other 13 km were paved, reflecting the steep nature of these sections. An ERR of only 3.7
percent was calculated at a 12 percent discount rate. The NPV was 61.02. This is low, due
to the difficult terrain and the need to pave the steeper sections. The main benefits include
vehicle-operating costs and travel timesaving, which were assessed using the RED Model.13
However, a major consideration in this case was poverty relief whereby part of the project
was built using local manual labor funded through the Crisis Response Window. It was also
recognized that the area served has higher agricultural potential than many other highland
areas. This sub-project accounted for about US$5.69 million or 7 percent of the final total
project cost.

Under the Additional Financing it was originally intended to apply periodic maintenance
(resealing and repairs) to two sections of road (64 km) – Nyene-Makhoroane and
Teyateyaneng-Mapoteng Junction. However, after heavy damage to both roads due to
extensive flooding complete rehabilitation became necessary. Since there was insufficient
IDA funding for the whole 64 km, the Bank focused on the first lot (20 km) of the Nyene-
Makhoroane road, and GOL undertook to cover the costs of the latter (17 km) as well as the
Teyateyaneng-Mapoteng road. The average daily traffic using the facility was about 585.
An economic evaluation using the RED model was carried out by a different consultant in
respect of these roads (37 km), indicating an ERR of 10.6 percent and an NPV of 69.07. In
this instance a social discount rate of eight percent was used corresponding to the discount
rate used for economic evaluations in South Africa in 2013. This was based on the fact that
Lesotho and South Africa have similar repurchase rates, economic growth rates, and a
common exchange rate. Costs, however, based on the actual bids were about US$6.3 million
higher than expected, which made the rate of return marginal. No ERR has been calculated
using the final cost figures. Given the fact that the villages benefitting from the
improvements were frequently inaccessible during wet weather, and served areas of
agricultural potential, the GOL nevertheless regarded this infrastructure as a high priority
and the Bank acceded to this view. The final cost of the road is expected to be around
US$34.8 million or 44 percent of total project costs (including GOL’s contribution), making
this the costliest sub-project in the ITP. This may be compared with the Senqu-Senqunayne
road section, which was 27 percent of total project cost.

It is a moot point as to whether the opportunity cost of these alternative expenditures were
optimal for the Bank, but since the ineligibility of Senqu-Sequanyane (stage 2) contractor to
receive Bank funds had not been highlighted in timely fashion, the Bank had an obligation
to help GOL find a solution. The cost of US$34.8 million for the two lots involved was

13 The RED model is suited for low volume unpaved roads with average daily traffic of <300.

somewhat higher than originally conceived, but the ERR was still close to minimum
threshold requirements.

Operational and administrative efficiency

Looking back at the overall efficiency of the project there were further factors that need to
be evaluated. The project experienced accumulated delays of three and a half years and nine
years elapsed between approval and completion. Because the investment component took so
long, the impetus to implement the sector reforms (26 percent of the original project cost)
was largely lost and now these reforms will have to be picked up in the follow-on project.
This is inefficient because some of the studies and recommendations will have to be updated
because of circumstances that have changed in the meantime. Many officials who were
involved in these initiatives have moved on and the process will have to start anew with
different incumbents. There were missteps in not identifying soon enough that the contractor
for stage two of the Senqu-Senqunyane bridges was debarred leading to ineligible
expenditures and considerable embarrassment. While this is also a reflection of Bank
performance it introduced unexpected and protracted delays that have affected the benefit
stream.

 To ensure investment costs reflected resource costs, it was considered inappropriate to
 apply a conversion factor, as all inputs are freely tradable with South Africa. Unskilled
 labor has a shadow wage rate of one (1), reflecting that labor is highly mobile. The Maloti
 is tied to the South African Rand and the currencies are interchangeable. Removing
 customs duties and value added tax is thus the only measure necessary.

 For the rehabilitation of the Nyenye-Mapoteng-Makhoroana road two further alternatives
 to the original assessment were also examined using a G2 base for the full section of the
 road and using a G2 base for the first 27.5 km and then a G5 base for the remainder of the
 road. However, these refinements made only a very marginal difference in the ERR. Use
 of the RED model was not warranted because the daily traffic was too high (varying
 between 2,422 and 567 per day).

Summary of the Social Impact Study of Senqu and Senqunyane Civil Works

The Social Impact Study, (May 2014), compared the findings of the baseline study, an
Interim Social Impact Study and the current Social Impact Study. However, it found the
interim study less reliable because of the limited sample size. All studies focused on the
same communities in the vicinity of the Senqu-Senqunyane project area.

In respect of household headship, it was observed that in spite of the traditional practice in
which men normally play the major role, some 37 percent of household heads were women.
There were also more educated females than males in all the educational levels.

Subsistence agriculture is predominantly the traditional source of livelihood, but cash
income predominates as the primary source of income. Those household members who
were employed worked in the government and private sectors, and a high proportion worked
in mining both in Lesotho and South Africa. Households often spent more than their
available incomes by utilizing loans from micro-lenders.

The civil works construction associated with the road and bridges was undoubtedly the most
important socio-economic development ever in the area and contributed to access to social
services, educational facilities and businesses. Because of the civil works the supply of
clean water and sanitation services has improved. Access to health services was also
considerably better than before because it was no longer necessary to make difficult river
crossings and taxis provided a door-to-door service. However, walking and horse riding are
still the most used forms of transport for cost reasons. In fact taxi fares have actually
increased due to a cartel of taxi operators. On the other hand people can now supplement
their income by traveling to South Africa to buy goods and then re-selling these items
locally at a profit on their return. Improvements have been reported in access to church and
funeral services and to woolsheds, local courts, and administrative offices.

The baseline study showed that animal dung and wood were not used for cooking, but for
lighting and heating. However, after the project, candles and paraffin were mainly used for
lighting and limited use of solar energy and LP gas was reported – both were non-existent
in the baseline study.

Enrolment in primary schools in the areas around the bridges increased significantly, since
the rivers and associated floods were no longer a barrier to pupils. Vehicles from the
Department of the Inspectorate under the Ministry of Education and Training are now also
a common sight.

HIV/AIDS infection rates were reported by the communities to have increased despite
awareness campaigns. This was thought to be due to the inaccessibility of condoms at
construction sites that are also frequented by prostitutes. Some communities also
complained about a lack of transparency and fairness in employment and working
conditions by the contractors. Overall, however, most respondents believed that the benefits
of the road far outweighed the negative impacts.

1. PROJECT CONTEXT, DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN
1.1    Introduction
This document is the contribution of the GoL to the ICR of the ITP, which was co-financed
by the IDA through Grants and Credits (Grants H2550 and H6230, and Credits 42370 and
48270); and the European Union (EU) through TF90728. The Government, as well as its
development partners, attached great importance to the achievement of project development
results. It is for this reason that the ICR evaluates ITP execution and operation against the
costs and benefits that are derived from the project finances. The ICR also provides an
assessment of lessons learned, the co-financiers’ performances in relation to their respective
obligations under the financing agreements, as well as the extent to which the purposes of
the finances were achieved. By providing project performance data, this ICR purports to
assist the Bank in preparation of its ICR.
1.2    Context at Appraisal
When ITP was appraised in September 2006, the Government of Lesotho was already
implementing the PRS 2004/2005-2006/2007, wherein eight strategic areas for achieving
economic growth and poverty had been identified. Infrastructure Development, under which
the transport sector falls, appeared as a third priority area in the PRS. Furthermore, the
Transport Sector Program, 2004 – 2010, had already been adopted for guiding reforms within
the sector, and ITP was planned to provide some impetus to the Program. Under
infrastructure, within the PRS, transportation links are regarded as necessary and essential to
the implementation of all strategic objectives. The importance of the transport sector to the
country’s economy was also elaborated in the Letter of Lesotho’s Transport Sector’s Policies
and Strategies, which appears in the Project Appraisal Document. In the Letter the
Government has reiterated its commitment to transform the transport sector into a vital
service sector in order to attain its development objectives as reflected in both the National
Vision 2020 and the PRS. The ITP was, therefore, meant to facilitate achievement of the
Government’s aspirations for an efficient transport system that ensures cost effective access
to economic opportunities, markets and basic services, as well as reliable links to external
markets and ports. The RRMP, a forerunner of ITP, kick started some elements of the desired
reforms. The ITP came into being in 2006/2007 in order to boost or fast track the reform
process and improve the socio–economic benefits of the poorest communities living in the
remote rural areas.
1.3     ITP Objectives
The original Primary Development Objective (PDO) of the ITP was to enhance prospects for
economic growth in Lesotho, through provision of an efficient and integrated transport
system that is safe and affordable to improve access to services and market opportunities for
all across the country. However, when ITP was restructured in August 2012, the original
PDO was modified to focus on improving connectivity in selected transport networks in the
country. It is, therefore, facilitating social service delivery and on-going democratization and
decentralization program through assuming connectivity between and within regions, by way
of addressing isolation problems. In addition, ITP was mandated to support the formulation
of integrated policies and strategies for aviation, rail and water transport sectors with a view
towards more coordinated transport sector management. The main thrust is still on the road

                                              48
network, but with a view to establishing a more coherent and complementary multi-modal
approach. The Project has three components, which comprise:

A. Policy and Institutional Reform;
B. Infrastructure Investments; and
C. Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation.
The World Bank approved the ITP on October 19, 2006 for a total amount of SDR 15.9
million or US Dollar 23.5 million. The total estimated cost of ITP at appraisal in May 2006
was USD 38.2 million, with GoL financing USD 5.2 million, EC financing EUR 7.85 million
or (USD 9.5 million equivalent) and IDA USD 23.5 million. It was declared effective on
February 22, 2007 and was scheduled to close on June 30, 2011 initially. However, the
closing date was extended twice to June 30, 2014 and June 30, 2015.

1.4    Project Components and Sub-Components
COMPONENT A: POLICY AND INSTITUTIONAL REFORM IN THE TRANSPORT
SECTOR

Under this component transport sector management would be rationalized, sustainable road
maintenance financing would be achieved, and transport sector management capacity
improved.

This component was estimated at US $ 10.04 million and was supported by EC (US$9.50
million) and IDA (US$0.54 million). Three interrelated sub-components in support of
Component A objectives are as follows:

Ai. Support for roads-subsector institutional reforms.

The reforms include setting up and capacity building for a Roads Directorate (RD),
capacitating Local Authorities, and elaboration for private sector development.

Aii. The Roads sub-sector development and capacity support
 Specifically, concerted efforts would be made to bring about a sustainable funding for
routine and periodic maintenance, and of improving performance of the RF. Attention would
also be given to other auxiliary functions of the MPWT such as road safety, basic access and
mobility, contractor development and GIS.

Aiii. Other Sub-Sector Development and Capacity Support.
The focus here would be on policy reformulation and capacity building in other transport
sub-sector (aviation, rail, inland water, IMT). A comprehensive Maseru Urban Planning and
Transport Study was also included.




                                             49
COMPONENT B: INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS
Targeted sections of the road network are improved through construction, periodic
maintenance, and rehabilitation and upgrading, roads upgrading and opening of new
corridors.
This component was estimated at US$23.38 million and was supported by the GoL (US$4.70
million) and IDA (US$18.68 million). Under this component, there are four sub-components:
(a) Carrying out of emergency repair works on the paved section of the Oxbow Mokhotlong
    road;
(b) Construction of two bridges over Senqu and Senqunyane rivers and related road
    connections;
(c) Upgrading of a rural roads - stretch of about 25 km on Mantsonynane-Lesobeng road and
    another stretch of about 8 km on the Likotopong-Lints’a feeder road; and
(d) Construction of footbridges and intermediate transport access schemes.

COMPONENT C: PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND MONITORING AND
EVALUATION
Facilitation of project activities, institutional reform change and monitoring & evaluation,
would be the main focus of this Component.
The component was estimated at US$2.78 million and was supported entirely by IDA
(US$2.78 million).


1.5    Risk Assessment and Mitigation at Appraisal
(a)    Safeguard Aspects:
At appraisal, Components of ITP likely to generate environmental impacts concerned civil
works investments involving emergency repairs to paved sections of the Northern Corridor,
construction of two bridges over the Senqu and Senqunyane Rivers, new roads, rehabilitation
and upgrading of rural roads. As the proposed roads follow existing alignments it was
realized that adverse environmental and social impacts would not be significant and would
be readily mitigable, leading to the project being classified as B. It was foreseen that the
impacts would be site specific and measures would be adopted to minimize any possible
adverse impacts. The Environmental Assessments (EAS) were undertaken for the bridges
and roads, and related mitigation measures were defined as part of Environmental
Management Measures.         By way of implementing the mitigation measures, the
environmental and social clauses now appear in all civil works bidding and contract
documents.

(b)    Social Protection:
In order to contribute to poverty alleviation program in Lesotho, the project was designed to
support the prevention of Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome (HIV/AIDS); improved access and communications to address maternal
mortality; support to vulnerable groups such as orphans through food packages and seeds;
and other road influential areas.

(c) Institutional Arrangement for Implementing Environmental Management Plan

                                             50
The high risk associated with institutional reforms involved creation of positions, which were
mandated to address and monitor the necessary work on safeguards. The positions comprise:
Environment and Social Coordinator; Resettlement Desk; HIV/AIDS Coordinator;
Statistical Office; and GIS Officer. Both the Environmental and Social Guidelines and the
RAP were developed and implemented.

(d)    Project Risks
The critical risks and possible controversial aspects that the Project faced in achieving the
objectives and self-sustaining institutional reforms as well as strengthening RF management,
were identified in conjunction with their associated mitigation measures. Some possible
controversial aspects, which were rated high comprised increasing road user charges to
improve the road maintenance financing, and social aspects of redundancies and aggravated
unemployment problems resulting from the reforms and capacity constraints.
1.6     Implementation Arrangement
The MPWT, the parent Ministry for ITP has the overall management and implementation of
the Project, while other ministries, departments and agencies are involved in implementing
specific project components. For day-to-day Project coordination and management, the
MPWT established an ITP Project Office, headed by a Project Manager. The other staff
members comprised: a Financial Manager, Financial Controller and Financial Accountant; a
Procurement Compliance Officer, an Environmental and Social Coordinator, with support of
Secretary, Office Assistant and Driver. The ITP Project Manager reports to the Director of
Planning. Monitoring and evaluation, which includes HIV and AIDS, gender, poverty
alleviation and economic development associated with civil works, was to be carried out by
the Planning Unit and ITP staff. Additional TA support to the Planning Unit included
Statistician and Assistant statistician. The Project was to be overseen by a Project Steering
Committee, chaired by Minister of MPWT and comprising higher-level representatives from
the ministries of Finance and Development Planning, Public Service, Local Government and
Office of Attorney General. A standing Technical Coordination Committee, led by Director
of Planning and including the EC and World Bank would assist the Committee.
1.7    Partnership Arrangement
At the time of ITP design the principal development partners in Lesotho had already
increased their consultation in policy dialogue with Government. The MPWT had indicated
its intention to lead in donor coordination by way of improving shared understanding of the
development challenges faced by lack of Lesotho transport. These developments resulted in
a co-financing arrangement between IDA and EC, and an adoption of a Specific Investment
Loan (SIL) by IDA while EC provided a grant.
1.8    Sustainability
ITP conforms to the objectives of the National Vision 2020 as well as the PRS. Furthermore,
it was based on the six year Transport Sector Program in addition to a Letter of Sector Policy
dated December 2005, and is, therefore, addressing the national priorities. As the ITP was
planned to continue with reforms started by the RRMP, there was evidence, at the design
stage, that the MPWT had become more proactive in implementation. For instance, the fuel
levy and user charges were increased in 2006 in order to increase funding for road
maintenance. The Road Maintenance Levy was increased by 100% from 15 to 30 Lisente/
liter of petrol, while diesel was increased from 20 to 40% Lisente /liter from 1st June 2006.
                                             51
A commitment was made to adjust the user charges upward gradually on an annual basis to
increase GoL resources for maintenance. Table 1 gives a picture of the revenue situation
between 2011 and 2014.

Another major factor that affected the Project was the cost for the two bridges. The risk
element associated with the construction of two bridges over Senqu and Senqunyane rivers
emanated from the low original cost estimate at project appraisal in May 2006. The bridges
were estimated at USD 11.85 million, while the lowest evaluated bid price was USD 29.30
million, excluding price contingency. Table 2 shows the actual funding situation, which
enabled completion of the bridges, as reflected in the Additional Financing Proposal.

The high bid price for the bridges could be attributed to: (a) the global commodity prices
inflation on fuel, bituminous products and other materials from 2006 to 2007; (b) the
premium to attract international contractors as the construction industry was fully engaged
due to 2010 World Cup in South Africa; and (c) decline in value of the US dollar with respect
to other foreign currencies. At negotiations for the contracts related to the two bridges and
associated road works in September 2007, the work was split into two stages. Stage one was
construction of two bridges and approaches with earth roads, while stage two involved
                                                 52
completion of bridges approaches with bituminous road. At the time of signing stage one
contract, whose contract duration was 24 months, there was a price escalation provision in
the contract based on agreed formula. As indicated earlier, ITP Original Financing
Agreement had insufficient funds to pay for such price escalation, unallocated funds
included. The causes of cost overrun were outside the control of the borrower. The
Additional Financing Agreement resolved the situation.

2. IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES

2.1    Project Components
As indicated in the previous chapter, ITP was mandated to provide appropriate road transport
infrastructure on a sustainable basis, to encourage an environment in which affordable
transportation services are available to service the economy and the citizens of Lesotho as
well as reliable access into isolated areas where the poorest live. The achievement of these
objectives was dependent on the following:

A. Policy and Institutional Reforms in Transport Sector

The Policy and Institutional Reforms in the Transport Sector were aimed at supporting
MPWT in reviewing its portfolio mandate and rationalizing its service deliveries.

Sub-Component A (i): Support for Roads Sector Institutional Reforms

Under this Sub-Component ITP supported the establishment of Roads Directorate in
December 2008 and assisted in delegation of certain tertiary and feeder roads to Local
Authorities, in the main. The new RD has been designed to be a commercially oriented and
professionally managed entity through appropriate legislation. It is well staffed and
operating fully. The form of RD has taken some autonomy into account. By way of
facilitating its proper functioning a consultant, SMEC, was engaged to spearhead the Change
Management process of RD. Thus, SMEC was contracted to provide support for planning,
design, and implementation of the new change management process. The key tasks for
SMEC included; a review of the proposed organizational structure; a review of the
Legislations of the new RD and Road Act; Capacity building program for staff; facilitation
of consensus on the vision, goal and core activities of the RD; definition of minor roads and
guidelines as well as the modalities of transfer to the MLG for management. The transfer of
the 500km roads to the MLG was second pillar of the transport sector reform, and was
consistent with the Government decentralization policy. Currently, the RD is well staffed
and operating fully. It has minimal staff turnover in the key areas.

Sub-Component A (ii): Road Sector Development & Capacity Support

The ITP supported the Government’s plan of bringing about a sustainable funding for routine
and periodic road maintenance and of improving performance of the RF. The road works
programs financed by the RF were identified and prioritized by the ministries responsible for
construction and maintenance of roads as stated in Section (2) of the RF Regulation.
Furthermore, the Fund covers new road works and road safety projects. In order to increase
revenue, road user charges were increased in 2006. In 2008 the tollgate fees were
                                             53
implemented, thereby raising the accumulation of funds in order to ensure sustainable
financing for road maintenance and development. As the Government was committed to
making the RF a sustainable entity so that it covers 90% of total road maintenance, by end
of ITP, a consultant, AFRICON, was engaged to update the cost estimated for routine and
periodic maintenance of the road network, as well as various collections scenarios for
increasing revenue. A commitment to increase user charges gradually was made and
implemented.

Sub-Component A (iii): Other Sub-Sector Development and Capacity Support

Under this sub-Component, ITP financed important studies, which comprised an Integrated
Transport Study and Policies Development for other sub-sectors of transport (aviation, rail,
inland water, IMT) and a comprehensive Maseru Urban Planning and Transport amongst
others. Capacity building was also addressed in the subsectors, based on information from
the studies reports. The recommendation from the studies led to skills upgrading training as
well as professional enrichment for various categories of staff in all road agencies. In the
Department of Traffic, for instance, Traffic Inspectors and Drivers Testing are now using
guidelines that resulted from studies in those areas. In some areas the recommendations are
being implemented piecemeal as part of the reform process.

B. Infrastructure Investments

This Component covered emergency improvement for the Northern Corridor which entailed
Oxbow-Mokhotlong Road repairs; construction of Senqu and Senqunyane Bridges by way
of contributing to South Eastern Corridor; upgrading of Mantsonyane–Lesobeng Road which
was deemed critical for socio economic development of the eastern region which was
Inaccessible due to difficult terrain; upgrading of Likotopong–Lints’a Road; and HIV and
AIDS interventions associated with civil works which were intended for promotion of
awareness and mitigation of HIV and AIDS on road projects, and was implemented in
conjunction with some NGOs operating in the rural areas. Currently, to strengthen HIV and
AIDS and related programs, tender evaluation process for civil works, by the Roads
Directorate, ensures that some resources are made available for campaigns and training in
contractors’ implementation schedules. With additional funding from the Government,
Mantsonyane-Lesobeng Road is now 40 km long as opposed to the initially planned 25 km.

On the whole, proper procurement procedures were adhered to for all civil works contracts.
However, the procurement process for Senqu-Senqunyane Bridges took longer than expected
due to the reluctance of the preferred bidder to extend bid validity period, in addition to all
bids being too high and exceeding the budget. Even after selection of the second lowest
evaluated bidder, the value of work for the bridges was still higher than available funds and
led to: (a) increased share of financing to 55% by GOL, and (b) a request by GoL to IDA for
revision of the Financing Agreement in order to incorporate appropriate changes. This
situation resulted in Additional Financing Agreement being signed in October 2012.




                                              54
C. Project Management and Monitoring and Evaluation
Project Management

Under this Component the financial and procurement guidelines were developed; the
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) procedures, including those for social and economic
development were developed and implemented; the training on social assessment and
baseline survey, quality assurances, report writing and establishment of M&E system for
Senqu and Senqunyane River Bridges and Associated Roads was conducted for Planning
Unit and ITP staff. Technical assistance support was also provided to both Planning and ITP.
With regards to the fiduciary aspects timely and satisfactorily audit reports were provided,
in accordance with the Disbursement Letter. However, exception to the rule was the 2011/12
ITP Audit Report, which was delayed by seven months and submitted in April 2013 instead
of September 2012. The delay was due to the FINPRO system, which collapsed, and the
Auditing firm whose staff took longer than expected to complete the work.

Monitoring and Evaluation

The appraisal process of ITP developed a comprehensive results and monitoring framework,
including outcome and intermediate indicators for PDOs and each Project Component, with
well-defined target values. The data for the project outcome and results came from progress
reports, financial reports, road condition surveys, road management system reports, baseline
surveys, audit reports and Government published records. Training in M&E and social
assessments was undertaken, and a functional M & E system installed in 2009. The Baseline
Survey was conducted in 2006 while the Interim Social Impacts Study was completed in
2012. The Social Impact Survey was conducted and completed in 2014. All the three surveys
covered the immediate area around Senqu and Senqunyane Bridges. The data was analyzed
and compared with project outcomes and agreed performance indicators. Furthermore, the
Results Framework and M&E arrangements in the PAD were revised to incorporate a Rural
Access Index and the number of beneficiaries as core indicators, as well as, an indicator for
“safe” transport system stated in PDOs. Quarterly monitoring and evaluation reports were
submitted regularly.

Fiduciary Issues

Procurement

The project adhered to the Government’s existing procurement policies and procedures for
locally financed procurement, which were in harmony with those of the Bank. The IDA
financed international procurement of works; goods and consulting services followed the
Bank Standard procurement procedures and documentation.

Financial Management

The financial management system (FMS) was based on conventional accounting software
called FINPRO/TOMPRO. The Project Accounts staff was trained for producing required
financial reports to manage and monitor the Project, for all financiers. As part of Internal
Controls, bank reconciliation for all project accounts was done quarterly, as well as
submission of Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) as required by the Disbursement Letter.
                                             55
The Project finances were released and utilized in accordance with the agreed financial
schedule for all the three components. However, an exception was made to the two bridges
where GoL ended up paying 55% of additional costs. The supervision mission reviewed the
Project Financial Management (FM) arrangements in terms of correct recording of all
transactions and balances, in order to ensure proper use of Bank’s funds in an economic and
effective way, for the purpose intended In this way the funds disbursement by donor,
component and category were scrutinized. The FM objective assessment was then rated
based on the Implementation Status and Results Report. The overall rating for ITP FM is
satisfactory.

External Audits

External Auditors Reports were submitted on time with the exception of the report for the
financial year 2011/12, which was delayed by 7 months, due to the TOMPRO system
collapse and some delays by the selected Auditing Firm.

2.2    Safeguard Compliance
The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of the ITP did not identify any salient adverse
environmental or social impacts. The civil works components, especially, the roads followed
existing alignments and the potential adverse impacts were not considered significant. The
EAS were undertaken for roads and bridges (Senqu and Senqunyane) and mitigation
measures were defined as part of EMP. However, the impacts for infrastructure investments
were site specific, and measures were adopted to minimize adverse impacts. For instance,
the road alignment was done to minimize impact on cultivated fields. The EMP was updated
as well as the EAP in order to mitigate the negative impacts. The two documents were
disclosed publicly at the relevant project areas. The Environmental/Social Coordinator was
employed to ensure systematic application of environmental management measures. The
households whose land was appropriated for infrastructure development were compensated
in accordance with the newly developed Government’s policies and procedures.

2.3    Co-financing Arrangement
The financial management, disbursement arrangements and procurement under ITP were
satisfactory for all financiers. However, the EU funds, for Component A, were received late
in 2008 and that affected timely start and payments of some consultants. In order to salvage
the situation, funds from both IDA and GOL were used and refunded at a later stage. The
Closing Date for EU funding was December 2012, after which the undisbursed funds
amounting to US Dollar 734,198.47 were returned. Despite the delayed funds disbursement,
all activities under component A were successfully implemented. The EU funds were
received late because it took some time for both the PIU and the Bank staff to understand the
EU requirements and procedures. The different dates for signing the EU Financing
Agreement, with both GOL and IDA, were another delaying factor.

It is worth mentioning that despite the arrangement for IDA to finance 80% of Component
B while GoL financed 20%, the exception of the rule applied to the Senqu and Senqunyane
bridges, which ended up being funded by GoL to the level of 55%. Thus, the GoL ended up
increasing its contribution from US$2.49 million to US$13.44 million to cover cost overrun

                                             56
for the bridges while IDA’s contribution remained the same as US$9.36 million, before
Additional Financing Agreement was signed in October 2012. The increased contribution by
GoL demonstrated its commitment to the Project and the importance of the
Senqu/Senqunyane Bridges to the country’s economy.

Furthermore, the increase of GoL contribution to the construction of two bridges and
associated works reflects its anxiety for smooth running of the project while the Bank was
looking into possibilities of additional funding. Thus, the GoL financed certain payment
certificates 100% instead of adhering to the 80:20 ratio for civil works. The issue of cost
overrun as well as the need to scale up certain activities, for the two bridges influenced a
request for Additional Financing (AF) amounting to US$15 million from IDA’s Pilot
CRW15, in January 2010. No changes to the PDOs were brought by AF, which was meant
to cover, (a) the cost overrun for Senqu-Senqunyane bridges construction amounting to
US$10 million, and (b) the costs amounting to US$5 million for resealing the 64 km of
Nyenye-Makhoroana and Teyateyaneng-Mapoteng Junction roads. However, only the 37
km Nyenye-Makhoroana Road ended up being done, while the Government funded the 27
km Teyateyaneng-Mapoteng Road from own resources.

2.4     Mid–Term Review
The Mid-Term Review was held in May 25–June 4, 2009. The Review indicated that the
Project had managed to achieve some of the targets, after the first two years of
implementation. It also showed that for several activities two years was too short for
realization of the targets. A major concern was delays in appointing Executive Secretary for
the RF; timely submission of 2008/09 RF audit report; and appointment of Road Engineer in
RF. This led to the Project rating for the achievement of development objective being
moderately satisfactory at that time.

Other recommendations from the Mid-Term Review comprised: preparation of a
comprehensive analysis of the status of the fund and projection throughout the life time of
the ITP; time table for the amendment of Finance (Road Fund) Regulation 2005 in
consultations with RD; appointment of technical assistance to strengthen technical capacity
of RD in the design and supervision of bridges; revised Senqu-Senqunyane quality assurance
plan with comments from RD TA; bidding documents, monthly progress reports on civil
work activities; and action plan for social development components of the project. All these
recommendations were successfully implemented.

3. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES

3.1   Project Development Objective Indicators
Rating: Satisfactory

The Results Framework and Monitoring Indicators indicate that more than 90% of the targets
were achieved by end of December 2014. The shortfalls are not significant. For instance, the
conditions of good roads are reported as 38% against a target of 39%, while those in fair

15Only US$5 million of Additional Financing was actually financed through the Pilot CRW. US$8.5 million
was from IDA Credit and US$6.5 million was IDA Grant.
                                                  57
condition are 50% against a target of 46%. Almost all targets for components A, B and C are
achieved, showing that the ITP has satisfied the objectives for which it was designed.

3.2   Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: Satisfactory

The ITP is highly relevant to the country’s development objectives as stated in the Vision
2020, PRS, Transport Sector Policy, and the World Bank CAS. It is consistent with the
Government poverty reduction and economic growth strategy by improving the rural and
urban populations’ access to basic services, markets, and employment opportunities.
Through civil works and bridges in the remote and isolated areas, it has facilitated
connectivity between and within regions as well as employment generation and marketing
opportunities. It has complimented other Government efforts with a rich HIV /AIDS agenda
in the project areas.

3.3   Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory.

The ITP is rated satisfactory because of its high relevance, achievement, and impact in the
livelihoods of the poor who are in the remote areas. It has also created connectivity within
and between regions, thereby facilitating social service delivery and ongoing decentralization
and democratization programs, in accordance with the PDO.

3.4   Overacting Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
Rating: Moderate

(a)   Poverty and Socio –Economic Impacts

Subsistence agriculture is predominantly the traditional source of livelihood in the area
around Senqu and Senqunyane Bridges, as is the case in the rural areas of Lesotho. In recent
years, according to various agricultural statistics reports, agricultural production is reported
as having deteriorated significantly, forcing communities to look for other sources of
livelihoods, particularly remunerative jobs. The annual household average cash per month
was reported as LSL 8,600 in the Baseline Survey, LSL 7,708 for the interim survey, and
LSL 5,611 in the social impact survey. Very few people receive cash incomes from small-
scale businesses, which are coming up. According to the interim study, the overall socio-
economic objectives of access had been realized, with small business enterprises locating in
many areas where access had improved and prices of many commodities dropping due to the
elimination of river crossing handling charges. Despite the appreciation of the infrastructure
by the communities in the area around the Senqu-Senqunyane Civil Works (SSCW), poverty
is still a major concern, which requires coordinated multi-sector approaches for its
meaningful reduction.


(b)   Employment

The SSCW has reported that the SSCW has contributed significantly in terms of employment
                                              58
generation during the construction period. For Instance, the construction company, for
Semonkong to Sekake, was committed to a total employment level of 233 people composed
of permanent and casual labor, sourced locally on a monthly basis. Now that the construction
phase is over, there is a shortage of jobs and many depend solely on subsistence agriculture.
On the whole, employment creation was higher during construction phases for all ITP civil
works and has since dwindled after completion. However, under Component A, capacity
building for road agencies and contractors is contributing to more civil works contracts which
create temporary jobs during construction.

(c)   Gender Aspects

With respect to household headship, both the Baseline Survey, for SSCW area, and the Social
Impact Survey confirm that a considerable percentage of women are household heads, about
37%, despite the traditional practice in which men normally play a role of household
headship. Furthermore, in terms of gender differences in educational attainment at household
level, the two studies showed that there were more educated female members than male
counterparts in all educational levels.

Figure 1: Household Educational Level




Source: Final Report, Social Impacts Study of Senqu and Senqunyane Civil Works


With the completion of both Senqu and Senqunyane Bridges, there is a positive trend in clinic
attendance and both primary and secondary education schooling, for boys and girls, because
travelling to nearby schools has become easy.

(d)     Access to Social Services
                                                  59
The construction of the Senqu and Senqunyane Civil Works (SSCW) has been reported by
the Social Impact Study, as one of the most important interventions for socio-economic
development in this area. It is contributing to improved access to social services (health
services and schools) and is also facilitating transport infrastructure that is most essential for
various business activities in the area. In the Baseline Study, 50% of the households reported
constraints to access services due to transport constraints. A reduction in the situation was
noticed in both the interim survey and the social impact survey where 31% and 19% still
have constraints to road transport. It is worth mentioning that some of the positive
externalities of the SSCW consist of water and sanitation facilities. The number of
households who reported presence of community standpipes increased from 39% in Baseline
Survey to 56.3% of households in the social impact study. Regarding improvements in
sanitation, the Baseline Survey noted that 77% of households had no toilet facility.
According to the social impact study about 68% had no toilets, showing an improvement of
9 % over the Baseline.

The 2011 Interim Social Impact Study did also confirm that enrolment in primary schools in
the areas around the bridges increased significantly, since the rivers and associated floods
were no longer a barrier to pupils. The vehicles from Department of Inspectorate, under the
Ministry of Education and Training, have also become a common sight on the roads. On the
whole, the general consensus from all sources, according to both surveys, is that the benefits
that came with the SSCW and related access infrastructure far outweigh associated negative
impacts.

4. ASSESMENT OF RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

Rating: Moderate

It has already been indicated that under Component A: Policy and Institutional Reforms in
Transport Sector, a major emphasis was on establishment of the Roads Directorate and
strengthening the RF. While there is a positive trend in revenue increase for the Fund, the
actual road maintenance requirements supersede the available financial resources. If no
action is taken to review and increase the road user charges, in accordance with the Letter of
Transport Sector Policy as appears in the ITP Appraisal Document, chances of a proper and
sustainable road maintenance on a long term basis will be reduced. The user charges and
petrol levies generate revenue for the RF. The last increase of the roads user charges was
made in 2010. The current collected roads user chargers are not adequate for the current
maintenance needs. It is worth noting that both inflation and maintenance backlog put a
heavy pressure on the existing resources, as well as capacity for the road agencies.

It is equally important and urgent to improve implementation capacity of the road agencies,
which benefit from the RF revenue, to ensure full utilization of their allocation on an annual
basis. This issue is also dependent on the capacity of the private sector, specifically, the
contractors who need continuous short term training so that they are equipped with skills
necessary for quality performance. Currently, the RF is financing training of contractors so
that they are enabled to reduce the country’s maintenance backlog. The training is intended
to redress the low absorptive capacity, by contractors, which has a negative effect on the
utilization of available financial resources. Thus, funding for capacitating the contractors in
                                               60
the long run is essential, and will also be sustained by the revenue from the RF. In conclusion,
if no efforts are made for a gradual increase of the rates for user charges and levies, coupled
with strengthening of the road agencies, the Roads Directorate included, as well as the
contractors, then sustainability of road maintenance will suffer hence a moderate rating. The
reviews and increases are necessary from time to time, because even the maintenance
backlog contributes to a heavy burden for the road agencies, which are already facing a huge
road maintenance challenge.

5. PERFORMANCE OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE CO-FINANCIERS

5.1   Assessment of the Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The performance of the Government of Lesotho can be assessed as follows:

POSITIVE
    The PDO’s were consistent and in conformity with the Vision 2020, PRS and
      Transport Sector Strategy;
    The Government demonstrated its commitment to development of the South Eastern
      Corridor by increasing its contribution to cover funding shortfall for Senqu-
      Senqunyane bridges, and by financing the Roma-Ramabanta-Semonkong-Sekake
      Road;
    Additional Funds were also provided for Mantsonyane-Lesobeng Road for a longer
      road completion at 40km instead of the original 25 km;
    Approving Legislation for Roads Directorate and its creation;
    Increasing its contribution to the Project during the extension period; and
    Increasing road user charges in order to meet road maintenance needs.

NEGATIVE
   Creation of a Steering Committee chaired by the Minister of MPWT. This was not a
    good decision to expect the ministers to oversee the Project policy matters and
    progress monitoring due to their several commitments, and
   Late external audit of ITP for the 2011/12 financial year

5.2    Assessment of IDA Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The performance of IDA in the Project can be assessed as follows:

POSITIVE
   Project consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy;
   The Bank played a leadership role among donors in supporting road sector reforms
      and capacity building;
   Regular supervision missions. The missions provided the necessary support in project
      implementation, were constructive, and were strong in enforcing fiduciary measures
      and safeguards.
                                              61
NEGATIVE
   Quality and effectiveness of some Task Team Leaders was inadequate. In this regard,
    some failed to elaborate remedial measures, in a timely manner, when asked to resolve
    a problem; and
   Delays in approving Additional Financing Agreement. (Request August 2011 –
    Response September 2012).

5.3     Assessment of EU Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

      The EU financed the necessary reforms, studies and training in line with the Transport
       Sector Program;
      The flow of the EU funds was challenging because it involved three agreements; and
      The prerequisites for disbursement were not clearly understood for almost the first two
       years of the Project effectiveness.

6. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

This section focuses on assessment of the level of benefits that have occurred to Lesotho as
a result of the investment to improve the Mantsonyane–Lesobeng Road, and construction of
Roma–Sekake Road including the major bridges at Senqu and Senqunyane rivers. According
to the consultant, IMC worldwide, the benefits are quantifiable and non-quantifiable. The
former relates to those benefits that are closely aligned to traffic movements like vehicle
operating costs savings, travel time, non-time benefits and generated traffic. The latter, in
addition to those already mentioned, comprises a broad range of other benefits which are
currently not quantifiable, such as: improved access to health and education facilities; access
to new employment opportunities, agricultural and livestock markets; incentives to the local
tourism industry; and improvements in the overall resilience of Lesotho’s road network.

It is worth noting that both roads represent considerable improvements on what existed prior
to the investment, as indicated by the consultant, IMC worldwide, who prepared the
economic analysis of the roads. The Mants’onyane–Lesobeng Road was passable only by
4-wheel drive and not at all during wet periods. The Roma-Sekake Road, especially the
Semonkong–Sekake section, was non-existent before construction except a poor eastern
track coupled with ferryboats. Before construction of the bridges, travel between several
villages was difficult, expensive, time consuming, resulting in restricted movements for
many households. The economic evaluation of the investment used both the NPV and the
Internal Rate of Return (IRR), the same indicators used at appraisal for the whole civil works
programme at appraisal. According to IMC, the IRR for the Mants’onyane–Lesobeng project
is 3.7%. ‘This is some way below the usual ‘pass marks’ of between 10% and 12% usually
applied, but reflects the difficult terrain. This is due to higher costs, which cannot be reflected
in higher levels of benefits’. The Roma–Sekake Project on the other hand has a higher IRR
of 14.6%. The benefits of this latter project are considerable, given that the road has the twin
benefits of improving access to a previously cut off area, and creating a long distance through
route, which significantly reduces the costs of travel between Maseru and Qacha’s Nek. In
this regard, the benefits far outweigh the incurred higher than normal costs, due to terrain
                                                62
and the two bridges. According to the Study, the effects of this investment are still revealing
themselves, and could take more than 2 years, before fundamental changes in traffic patterns
and socio-economic activity are fully realized. The IMC study shows that a large portion of
user benefits are related to savings in vehicle operating costs, in three forms as follows:

      Benefits to existing traffic, applicable to both roads;
      Benefits accruing to traffic which diverts to a shorter route, applicable only to SSCW;
       and
      The impact of traffic generated by the new road, applicable to both roads.

While increasing levels of traffic are being seen on both roads, Roma–Sekake has a higher
traffic flow because it is leading to Qacha’s Nek, which is one of the major towns. Improved
access to services, clinics, schools, marketing and business, as well as drastic reduction in
drowning during river crossing, are some of the benefits emanating from the Government’s
investment on roads and bridges. The overall benefits from the investment on the two roads
far outweigh the costs, and reflect a major contribution of ITP in opening socio-economic
opportunities for livelihood improvement it the remote rural areas of Lesotho. In light of the
benefits, resulting from investment in the southeastern corridor, the District Administrator in
Qacha’s Nek is quoted as confirming that ‘the road is changing and improving family
cohesion and demographics, making it possible for migrant workers to return home more
frequently, due to the reduced time and cost of the journey’.

FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

It has already been mentioned that the ITP co-financing arrangement involved IDA, EU and
GOL. The GOL provided its counterpart contribution all the time during the Project duration,
and has exceeded its planned share of USD 5.2 million as appears in the appraisal document.
The co-partners contribution was successfully disbursed and spent as per Project components
and activities in line with Table 3. Almost all allocated funds’ disbursement, with the
exception of IDA 48270, has exceeded 90%. It is expected that by Disbursement Closing
Date of 30 October 2015, the ongoing rehabilitation works at the Nyenye-Makhoroana Road
will have raised the level of expenditure for IDA 48270 to over 90% as well.

    7. LESSONS LEARNED AND CONCLUSION

    Lessons

             The national documents like the Vision 2020 and the PRS as well as the Transport
              Sector Program facilitated consistency in PDOs;
             Some of the information emanating from the study reports is being used in various
              policies and operations by the beneficiaries, e.g. road safety, drivers training;
             Some reforms are in motion in a number of transport sector agencies like the Maseru
              City Council due to recommendations from the studies;
             Implementation capacity, by the private sector, for medium to large works contracts
              is still a big problem, despite contractors’ training, and will be like that for some
              years;
             Additional resources are required to fast track the reforms;
             Training of senior staff, study tours included, has contributed to better performance
              and positive attitudes towards reforms;
             Some of the agreed sector reform measures have been carried out despite some
              resources constraints, few backlogs due to capacity constraints and high staff turnover
              in some MPWT departments and RD;
             Road Fund revenue has increased and is not being fully utilized by the Road agencies
              due to inadequate capacity. The Fund capacity has been strengthened;
             The Roads Directorate is well staffed and its performance is satisfactory. However,
              continuous refresher training is necessary. Staff turnover in key positions is not high;

                                                      64
      In the area of infrastructure investments, contractor training is practically improving
       performance. However, continuous training at all levels is necessary.

Conclusion

It could be said that the ITP was designed to be an investment and a reform in one single
project. Its funding allocation by component supported this emphasis, whereby about 55.63%
was for Component B: Infrastructure Investment; while about 26.29% was for Component
A: Policy and Institutional Reforms; with 7.28% going for Component C: Project
Management and Monitoring and Evaluation. Reforms are known to require institutional
changes and attitudes, which are dependent on the political economy of the country as well
as the urgency of issues to be addressed. The roads were urgently needed in accordance with
the Transport Sector Program. In Component A only two activities, the RF and the Roads
Directorate, appeared to have been given top priority due to their urgent need. In conclusion,
a selection of fewer policies and reforms could have made their implementation easier given
resources constraints and political economy. It is recommended that a phased approach, for
implementing the recommendations from the various studies under Component A, be
adopted by the next project.

       Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

Comments from the Government of Lesotho

It is worth noting that an HIV and AIDS framework and workplan was developed to guide
all activities and processes in the Senqu and Senqunyane bridges project area. The workplan
included interventions that were aimed at building the capacity of the workers in the
construction project, the communities around and the community leaders. Issues of
sustainability and exit strategies were built into the activities, i.e., involvement and forging
of partnerships with change agents, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and
Community Based Organisations (CBOs) already operating in the area. Thus, the intention
was to facilitate buy in to the HIV and AIDS programme by the communities, through
empowerment activities, strengthening ownership and sustainability of processes.

It is against this background that numerous inroads were made towards management of HIV
and AIDS in the bridges project area. The training that was provided emphasized social
dialogue on a continuous basis. The MoPWT through ITP had forged partnerships with the
existing change agents, NGOs, and CBOs, who were already experienced in the campaigns
as well as training in HIV and AIDS. It was foreseen that the communities needed a lot of
information about the pandemic, so that even when the project has expired or phased out,
they would be enabled and motivated to continue practicing the preventive measures with
minimum support from the change agents.

It is incorrect to assume that increased HIV and AIDS infections, as reported by the Social
Impacts Study, was influenced by less attention to awareness campaigns after the departure
of a full time HIV /AIDS Coordinator in the PIU. The PIU intervention was short lived by
design and was merely boosting the already started activities by other change agents in the
project area before and during the construction stage. The issue of condoms availability or
not in the project area, was never the responsibility of the PIU. Despite the efforts made by
all agents who tried to create awareness and provide training in preventive measures to the
communities, the worsening level of poverty and poor agricultural production, as well as end
of temporary employment in the area, are likely to have weakened the livelihood coping
strategies, with the result being an increasing level of HIV and AIDS prevalence.

With regards to additional financing, the Nyenye-Makhoroana Road contract has stipulated
that the campaigns and training, of the workforce and communities around the road, in HIV
and AIDS prevention be given priority, amongst others. Activities regarding the HIV and
AIDS awareness programme are included in the monthly contractor’s progress report. There
is an ongoing awareness campaign programme for the communities along the road, which is
provided by Maluti Hospital, World Vision, Population Services International (PSI), the
Contractor and the Ministry of Gender Youth and Sports.
