{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Integrated Transport\n            Project for Lesotho were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was also moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the Bank\u2019s\n            internal systems need to adequately warn staff and clients\n            of debarred contractors when bidding procedures are in\n            progress. Clearly the Bank was at fault in failing to\n            implement adequate systems to identify debarred contractors\n            during the bidding processes. This has largely been\n            rectified after the event by changes to the Bank\u2019s Manual of\n            Procedures intended to enhance the Bank\u2019s internal system.\n            When investment and reform components work in parallel in\n            the same project the risk of delays to the investment\n            component should not be reason to postpone implementation of\n            the reforms. Project design should take this into account.\n            Road maintenance, at least of National roads, has improved\n            under ITP, but this matter needs to be further pursued in\n            the follow-up project, both in terms of funding and the\n            adequacy of capacity in the Roads Directorate. Measures need\n            to be taken to attract more skilled engineers and financial\n            management specialists. The introduction of\n            performance-based contracts should strongly be considered.\n            The failure of the NRSC to become a functioning entity in\n            this project emphasizes the importance of political\n            commitment in road safety agenda and the need for a strong\n            road safety champion at a high level. Lesotho made a major\n            step in getting the Cabinet\u2019s approval for establishing the\n            NRSC, and while this legal ground was critical, more work\n            and push were required in building political support to\n            fully achieve the intended outcomes. Certain\n            conditionality\u2019s could be built within the projects\u2019 designs\n            to incentivize the Borrowers to complete the reform process."}, "docdt": "2015-12-21T08:05:04Z"}
