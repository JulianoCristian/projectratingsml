Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The project implementation progress is satisfactory with the project objective of improving access to services and market opportunities through a better
 managed and affordable transport system likely to be fully achieved. Most of the activities have been completed. The only major works contract still
 ongoing is the rehabilitation of the Nyenye-Makhoroana-road, scheduled for completion by August-September, 2015, two months after Project closure.
 There are no key decisions pending.

         From the December 2014 Semi-Annual Progress Report: Emergency cost =M50.68 and regular trips M26.85; estimated from the ISIS
         Household Surveys, August/September 2011. The costs increased at an alarming rate of 71% (M71.00) of emergency and 82.5% (M49.00)
         for regular trips.
         NB: Department of Traffic and Transport to set fares and monitor implementation of the set fares. Current Meeting held between
         transport owners, DTT, and DA agreed on M60.00 as the fare price.
         With a fare price of M60, the actual fare decreased to about 8% of the average original. Taking the fares before government intervention,
         there was still a decrease to about 8% of the original average fare.
