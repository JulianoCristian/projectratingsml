A. Summary of Proposed Changes
This request involves a simple reallocation across four categories in the Annex 1 of the Amendment to the
Financing Agreement dated September 14, 2012: Section IV.A.2 of schedule 2 to the original Financing
Agreement (Credit 4237-LSO and Grant H255-LSO). This reallocation reflects the greater than expected
expenditure requirements on Supervision Consultancy Services for the rehabilitation of the
Nyenye-Makhoroana-Road under Category (3), and the reduced requirements under Categories (1), (2) and
(4); Civil Works, Goods and Operating Costs respectively.

B. Project Status
Most activities under the project have now been completed. The only ongoing works activity is the
rehabilitation of the Nyenye-Makhoroana-Road including the supervisory consulting services for this
contract. Disbursement has continued in a satisfactory manner since the last mission in November 2014 and
the total amount disbursed now stands as US$34.3 million (or a disbursement ratio of 89 percent). The client
informed the Bank that the next withdrawal request would be for the total remaining funds, as these would be
required to pay upcoming payment requests from the Contractor and Supervision Consultant. The entire
amount of both the credits and grants have been committed.

There are no overdue audits for the project.

C. Proposed Changes

Financing
Reallocations
Explanation
The increase reflects the stronger Supervision Consultancy requirement for the Nyenye-Makhoroana Road
rehabilitation. The original intention was to undertake routine and periodic maintenance activities only on
this road link. However, the design studies showed that the road deteriorated significantly and that
rehabilitation would be the most efficient option. Due to the increased civil works costs, the Client divided
the works into two Lots with the Bank supporting one Lot only and Government financing the second Lot in
full from own resources. The supervision assignment covers both Lots and is financed under the Financing
Agreement.

In addition the reallocation will incorporate a reduction of the funding requirements for Categories (1), (2)
and (4). This is possible due to a smaller financing requirement within these Categories than originally
estimated.
