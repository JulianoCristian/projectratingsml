Health Service) in Peru were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was low or negligible, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Lessons learned included: 1) Political volatility has a\n            detrimental effect on Project implementation and impact; 2)\n            Use of a variety of lending and non-lending instruments can\n            enhance the implementation of critical sectoral reforms; 3)\n            Ensuring implementation readiness conditions prior to\n            negotiations leads to a more effective and timely physical\n            and financial execution cycle; 4) The use of a clear\n            evidence-based causality model can strongly enhance the\n            achievement of Project Development Objectives; 5)\n            Intercultural strategies are vital when beneficiaries belong\n            to diverse indigenous groups; 6) Community ownership of\n            project activities is likely to contribute to the\n            sustainability of a health reform process through\n            participatory maintenance of the goods provided and promotes\n            decentralization under a context of ensuring accountability\n            and equity; and 7) Rehabilitation of health facilities needs\n            to pay greater attention to overall utility capacity, in\n            order to ensure that new facilities have sufficient\n            availability of electricity, water and sanitation
