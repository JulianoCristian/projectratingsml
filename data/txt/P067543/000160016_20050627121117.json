Overall, the project provided the Bank with an\n            opportunity to gain valuable experience in shifting\n            ownership and responsibility for vertical disease control\n            programs to the states, increasing state-level capacity to\n            take on the new role, and strengthening central capacity for\n            policy guidance, technical support, surveillance and\n            advocacy. Specific lessons include: 1) Decentralization can\n            transform the program by shifting ownership and\n            responsibility to the states. However, this needs to be\n            backed up with a strong capacity building component.\n            Establishing sustainable systems and maintaining quality at\n            the state level require a strong central hub, providing\n            overall support on several fronts: (a) accessing and\n            disseminating best practices; (b) setting standards and\n            developing appropriate guidelines; (c) mustering a group of\n            advocates; (d) monitoring the disease at the national level;\n            and (e) brainstorming about future strategies and\n            sustainability. 2) An internationally established end-point\n            serves as a rallying point. The project had the advantage of\n            a well-recognized, internationally accepted outcome:\n            'elimination of leprosy' 3) Involving all\n            stakeholders from early on is essential; some of the cadre\n            problems encountered in pockets across the country could\n            have been avoided by adopting a more participatory approach.\n            4) Stringent monitoring is a must. Tracking and analyzing\n            data by gender and castes/tribal categories has been a very\n            useful tool in particular for targeting inputs. 5) An\n            effective education program, coupled with enhanced quality\n            of services, has boosted voluntary reporting and early\n            diagnosis of cases by reducing fear and stigma, and provided\n            clear information regarding the availability of services. 6)\n            Public-Private Partnerships need to be well defined, and\n            expanded and sustained. 7) Having one umbrella organization\n            as the intermediary - the International Federation of\n            Anti-Leprosy Associations - has made managing and monitoring\n            the partnership with NGOs simpler."}, "docdt": "2005-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
