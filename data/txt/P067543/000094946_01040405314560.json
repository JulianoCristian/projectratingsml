There are five\n            project components. The first component focuses on\n            decentralization and institutional development. The second\n            component strengthens and integrates service delivery,\n            namely financing incremental operating costs, drug delivery,\n            campaigns, and training, activities to target special\n            groups, and service delivery by non-governmental\n            organizations. The third component focuses on disability\n            prevention and finances purchase of services from\n            nongovernmental organizations, consultant services,\n            training, purchase of equipment, and operating expenses. The\n            fourth component is an information, education, and\n            communication component, carrying out political advocacy,\n            and changing society's attitude to leprosy and\n            increasing demand by affected individuals for leprosy\n            control services. It finances consultant services,\n            workshops, training, technical assistance, IEC materials,\n            and media space and operational expenses. Finally, the fifth\n            component reorients staff to an integrated approach and\n            provides them new skills in the general health services,\n            management skills, and technical skills."}, "docdt": "2001-02-27T00:00:00Z"}
