Dear Sir:
      We refer to the Development Credit Agreement for the above-
mentioned
Project, dated October 16, 1989, between the Republic of Kenya (the
Borrower) and the International Development Association (the
Association) and to your letter dated January 28, 1993, requesting
the amendment of the definition of Project Coordination and
Management Unit (PCMU) operating costs to include, inter alia,
transport operating costs.
      This letter is to inform you of our agreement to your request
and to propose that paragraph 2(c) of Schedule 1 to the Development
Credit Agreement be amended to read as follows:
      "(c) "PCMU Operating Costs" means the costs of technical
      support to the PCMU, including costs associated with travel,
      subsistence and office and vehicles operating costs for such
      technical support".
      The provisions of the Development Credit Agreement as amended
herein remain in full force and effect.
      Please sign, date and return to us the enclosed copy of this
letter.  The amendment shall take effect as of the date of this
letter.
                                          Very truly yours,
