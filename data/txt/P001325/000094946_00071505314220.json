Project\n            sustainability is uncertain due to external factors\n            including delays in the liberalization of coffee marketing.\n            World Bank and Borrower performances are rated overall as\n            satisfactory. Key lessons learned include the following:\n            Conditionalities were not included in designing the project\n            to address some of the wider and possibly contentious policy\n            issues facing industry reform today. However, it is\n            acknowledged that the political nature of these problems\n            could have pre-empted the entire project and sacrificed the\n            achievements gained under the project at the producer and\n            processing level. Delegating project supervision to the Bank\n            team located in the field was desirable for ensuring timely\n            client service during project start-up, clearance of bidding\n            documents, processing of disbursement requests and\n            implementation adjustments to the project in response to the\n            changes facing the coffee industry. After financing by the\n            Commonwealth Development Corporation was withdrawn, the\n            project should have found a way to support through financial\n            and technical assistance the increasingly important small\n            estate sub-sector. On revising the project risks at\n            appraisal, it proved essential that adopting an improved\n            payment system was a condition of effectiveness."}, "docdt": "2000-03-28T00:00:00Z"}
