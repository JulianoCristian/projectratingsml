Reallocation of Proceeds

1.      Proceeds for Kosovo, Avian Influenza Control and Human Pandemic
Preparedness and Response Project, IDA Grant No. H272 KOS, P102165 will be
reallocated as follow:



Category of Expenditure         Allocation (SDR)               % of Financing

Current        Revised        Current         Revised       Current     Revised

2.      The Project is rated Moderately Satisfactory both on the achievement of
development objectives and on implementation progress. The reallocation of funds for
Eligible Emergency Imports (EEI), although 6 percent of Grant proceeds (SDR 120 000,
a minor change), is in accordance with BP13.05, and does not entail any significant
project change. The country managed the A/H1N1 Pandemic in the 2009 winter season
without these funds. The project has met financial covenants, including maintaining
accounts and records for project implementation, and having these records and financial
statements audited annually. The auditors issued unqualified opinion on all annual
financial statements, and there are no outstanding audit reports. Interim financial reports
are submitted on time, but with some revisions. Despite initial delays, the disbursement
of Project funds as of December 1, 2010 has reached 74%, while funds already
committed amount to 87 %.

3.      The project is on track to achieve its development objectives. Main achievements
include: (i) disease prevention through well focused and timely public awareness and
information campaigns, led by the Ministry of Health and Institute of Public Health
(IPH), in close cooperation with the WHO and the Bank; (ii) response to level 6 A/H1N1
Pandemic has been quick and efficient, showing the country cumulative benefit from the
project investment in knowhow, infrastructure, equipment, vaccines, antivirals etc., (iii)
strengthened IPH laboratory capacity, enabling testing of novel viruses, responding
promptly to the Pandemic and other infectious diseases present in the country, and
showing very good results with the recently achieved 100% confirmation rate from
reference laboratory; (iv) increased capacity to treat patients affected by new viruses and
inter-related infectious disease with a modern Intensive Care Unit of the Pristina
University Hospital, and its staff trained; and (v) increased diagnostic capacity of the
veterinary service thru construction, furnishing, equipping and training of staff of the
Animal Health laboratory, as well as supporting the establishment and training of an
Epidemiology Unit.

4.      The proposed reallocation, as per the Minister of Economy and Finance request of
September 17, 2010, is necessary to fully utilize the available funds originally allocated
to Eligible Emergency Imports for use in emergencies. Given that no emergencies
occurred, the Government requested to use the funds amounting to SDR 120,000 to be
spent for goods the Animal Health Component ($100,000) and for the Human Health
Component (US$100,000) of the Project respectively for goods (US$50,000) and minor
civil works (US$50,000).

Extension of Closing Date

5.     The closing date for Kosovo, Avian Influenza Control and Human Pandemic
Preparedness and Response Project, IDA Grant No. H272 KOS, P102165 will be
extended from December 31, 2010 until June 30, 2011.

6.     The proposed extension, requested with a letter of the Minister of Economy and
Finance on October 29, 2010, is necessary to (i) allow the Government to fully utilize the
available IDA grant funds resulting from the reallocation of the Eligible Emergency
Imports category and the favorable exchange rate, and (ii) further strengthen the
Country's capacity to respond to pandemics thru increased enhancement of the Institute

                                            4
of Public Health Laboratory and the Pristina University Hospital capacity, and
strengthening of the Veterinary Service and its monitoring capability. The Recipient has
prepared an action plan to complete the implementation of the Project within the
requested extension.

This will be the second extension of the project.
