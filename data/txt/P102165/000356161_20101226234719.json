The extension, requested with a letter of the\n            Minister of Economy and Finance on October 29, 2010, is\n            necessary to allow the Government to fully utilize the\n            available grant funds resulting from the reallocation of the\n            eligible emergency imports category and the favorable\n            exchange rate, and further strengthen the country's\n            capacity to respond to pandemics thru increased enhancement\n            of the institute of public health laboratory and the\n            pristina university hospital capacity, and strengthening of\n            the veterinary service and its monitoring capability. The\n            recipient has prepared an action plan to complete the\n            implementation of the project within the requested\n            extension. The closing date for project will be extended\n            from December 31, 2010 until June 30, 2011.
