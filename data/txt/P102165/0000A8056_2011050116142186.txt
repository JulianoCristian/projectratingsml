                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The revised PDO:
                         The Project Development Objective is to minimize the threat posed to humans by Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) infection and other zoonoses to
                         prepare for, control, and respond to influenza pandemics and other infectious disease emergencies in humans.
                         The expected outcomes of the revised Project are: (i) the development of a National Integrated Preparedness Plan for control and response to outbreaks and
                         pandemics prepared in accordance with WHO recommendations; and (ii) a contained and diminishing pattern of HPAI and other zoonotic viral threats and
                         infections in humans.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Avian Influenza Project Kosovo met its development objectives. Since fall 2009, the A/H1N1 pandemic detection, prevention, and treatment has been efficient, demonstrating

                         the cumulative country benefit from the project investment in knowhow, infrastructure, equipment, vaccines, antivirals. The Project Team and the Ministry of Health response to
                         pandemic and influenza like diseases has been well focused, timely, and in close cooperation with the WHO and the Bank. The Human Heath component of the project has been
                         implemented efficiently, to make sure that the A/H1N1 vaccines, antivirals, and all necessary consumables are in place and properly used. The Institute of Public Health laboratory
                         and the Clinical Center of Pristina Hospital rehabilitated from the project were fully functional and professionally responded to the pandemic. The new Animal Health Laboratory is
                         finished, equipped, staff trained and new capable personnel are performing modern diagnostic techniques. The Veterinary Epidemiological Unit is functioning more efficiently. Under
                         the Project it was given priority to the public awareness activities all-over the country to prevent communicable diseases through classical hygiene measures. School children's were
                         targeted through theoretical lesson and recreational thematic games for seasonal flu, A/H5N1 and A/H1N1, and health workers were trained in communication for disease prevention.
                         The cross sectoral work and multi-disciplinary effort of the public awareness, the animal and human health were successful. The human and animal health teams worked together
                         under one health agenda and they are very likely to continue in the future. To this end the Veterinary Food Agency staff has been included in the in the IPH Commission for Health
