(B) Improvement of the economic and\n            social welfare of rural households by enabling the rural\n            outreach program in three sub-regions to support rural women\n            to: (i) increase their productivity through better access to\n            agricultural extension messages and assistance; (ii) form\n            more women cooperatives; (iii) improve food crops storage,\n            processing and marketing to facilitate investments; (iv)\n            improve their literacy, numeracy, knowledge of household\n            economics, primary health care, nutrition, and personal and\n            rural hygiene; and (v) increase their capacity to save.  (C)\n            Improvement of the marketable skills and social welfare of\n            marginalized urban women enrolled in selected Institutes for\n            the Education of Women through: (i) skills training; (ii)\n            preparation in competing for specialized vocational training\n            programs; and (iii) assistance in finding employment."}, "docdt": "1990-06-07T00:00:00Z"}
