EIMOEANDUM  AND EECONKENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANR FOR RECONSTRUCTION AUD DEVELOPMENT
TO TEE mECUIvE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO TEE REPUBLIC OF COTE D'IVOIRE
1,       The folloving memorandum and recamendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire for $2.2 million equivalent in submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would carry the standard variable IBRD
interest rate and 20 years maturity, including a five-year grace period,
and vould help to finance a Vomen In Development (VID) Pilot Support
Project.
2.       Eackaround.  With a GNP per capita of $740 In 1988, tbe Republic
of Côte d'Ivoire (RCI) is a middle income country amoag the most developed
in the West Africa Region.  However, the key social Lndicators in RCI
compare unfavorably vith those of countries at sieilar levels of Lnca«e sad
even vith some loaer Lncame countries in the region.  This tenuous
situation la further threatened by a rapidly groving population, especially
Ln the urban areas.  The health statue 0f  -sir$ans is poor vith infant
mortality at 119 per thousand births, and matert%al mortality rate estîmated
at close to 500 per 100,000 live births in 1986. The education and
literacy level le low, particularly for girls and vomen.  The adult female
illiteracy rate Le 69 percent, compared vith the national average of 57
percent. Vomen, who bave traditionally found lt difficult to get accees to
the formal market, are finding it even more so today as une ployment has
risen dramatically froa 2.1 to 11.2 percent between 1975 jnd 1985. Many
vomen have entered the inforinal sector, but their potential la limited by   --=
the lack of necessary skille sad of access to credit.
3.       Traditional support services have failed to reach  omnen
adequately. This ls particularly so In the case of agricultural extension
services shich are highly decentralized in RCI and up until recently have
focussed on lndividual cash crope rather than an farming systeme. Vomen
cultivators have been Lgnored. The vocational training programs are mainly
targeted to the urban male population and are usually under-funded sud lack
*         supervision.  Many are competitive programe, and girls often do not have
the mLuimum requirements to qualify for applying.  The principal
beneficiaries of health services are vomen but the health care system In
RCI is top heavy, urban-biased and seeke to cope vith diseases rather than
promote primary services such as preventive medicine and family planning.
These veaknesses are being addressed by the Government vith Bank
assistance, but the procese le expected to take time.
4.       The Mlinistry for the Advancement of Vamen (MPP) in RCI vas created
in 1986.  In addition to its conceptional and promotional roles, Lt has two
main operational programes a field program consisting of 118 vomez rural
outreach vorkers (Aie) assigned to different villages and a home economice
and literacy progrum given at 76 institutes.  The Government has asked HP?
to strengthen public services $n favor of vomen and to launch a multi-year
program vUich vould put thls strategy luto action. For the medium- and
long-term, the MPF strategy seeks to promote the integration of vamen into
the economic and social life of the country by (a) identifying the
principal constraiLts to this integration; and (b) Ldentifying sud -
promoting, within every ministry and public agency, activities to lift
these constraints. Hovever, in the short-term, this s=trategy foresees the



direct intervention of MPF in providing critical support services to vomen
in the areas of rural and agricultural extension and skills training. Over
the medium- and long-term, MPF vill be disengaged from these operational
activitiei which vill be integrated into entities whose responsibilities
are to provide support services to the population at large, such as the
agricultural extension services.
5.       Rationale for Bank's Involvement.  The Government has developed a
national strategy to address vomen's concerna and issues. It has called on
the Bank for assistance to further develop and implement this strategy.
Vomen have by and large only marginally benefited from Bank suppcrt to RCI
to date. Pipeline projecte are slowly being reoriented s0 that they better
incorporate women's issues into project objectives. The Vomen in
Development Pilot Support project vould facilitate the acceleration of the
incorporation of vomenes issues into Government's mainstream activities, of
vhich the principal ones are, or vill be, receiving Bank support. The
project is being prepared in collaboration vith other Projects in Côte
d'Ivoire, particularly the Human Resources Development/Social Dimensions of
Adjustment Project, and the Agricultural Services Project.
6.       ProJect Ob3ectives.  The proposed project vould be the pilot phase
(24 months) of a medium-term program to establish a viable process for
strengthening the institutional capacity of support services, initially
through NPF, to better address vomiens Issues in three sub-regions and
specifically; (1) improve the productivity of the farming systems of the
participating rural vomen and their ability to market their produce; (ii)
upgrade the marketable and-employable skills of the urban women enrolled in
selected Institutes for the Education of Vomen; (iii) hIprove the welfare
of rural and urban households benefitting from the project; and (iv) change
the perception of the role of women by government managers and staff who
provide support services, as well as by society at large and the vomen
themselves.
7.       Proiect Description.  The project comprises three componentst
(a) Starting the process for the strengthening of the MPF's
institutional capacity in (i) policy and prograà formulation
through strategy development, studies, monitoring and evaluation,
and information feedback and dissemination; and (ii) coordination
and promotion of activities described below concerned vith the
iuprovement of the status and velfare of women.
(b) Improvement of the economic and social welfare of rural households
in the pilot areas by enabling the rural outreach program in three
sub-regions to support rural vomen in Ci) increasing productivity
through better access to agricultural extension messages and
assistancel (iI) forming more cooperatives; Cili) lmproving food
crop storage, processing and marketing through transfer of
technology and provision of funds; (iv) limproving their literacy,
numeracy, knowledge of household economics, primry health care,
nutrition, and personal and rural hygiene; and tv) increasing
their capacity to save.
(c) Improvement of the marketable skills and social velfare of
margizalized urban women enrolled in selected Institutes for the
Education of Vomen through (i) training in akills for which there



la a market demand: (il) better preparation in competing for
specialized vocational trdining prograus; (iii) assistance in
finding employment or other itcome 8enerating activities; and (iv)
training in literacy, numeracy, home economics and primary health
care.
8.       The total cost of the project is estimated at $3.6 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of $1.4 million (40 percent)
breakdown of coste and the fJ.ancing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule are shoWn in Schedule B. A tlmetable of key project processing
events and the statue of Bank Group operations in the Republic of Côte
d'Ivoire are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A Map li also
attached.  The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 8617-.VYC, dated June 7, 1990, is
also attached.
9.       Implementation.  As the success criteria of the pilot project
would depend on NPF's ability to promote the accelerated integration of
women's conceras into the mainstream goveromont support services, an inter-
ministerial coordinating committee would be established under the project
to permit full participation of all ministries and agencies concerned with
the advancement of vomen. This Committee, chaired by WPF, would review and
approve the project's vork program and budget and ensure the necessary
collaboration between the various agencles and coheirence of their
activities. Specific cooperative agreements vould be made directly by NPF
vith the technical ministries and entities for the provision of some
services.
10=.     Actions AUreedlto be Apreed. Agreemeut has been reached vith the
Cwoverumont on project objectives and design. Other agreements reached vith
the Goverument lnclude (a) establishment and teras of reference of the
Inter-ministerial Coordination Committee: (b) preparation and selection of
candidates, and the location and timing of training programs; (c)
establisbment of satisfactory staffing of the Institutes for the Education
of Women participating la the project; (d) identification of and
contracting vith a Developmert Agency to manage the Development Fund; (e)
establishment of, and operating procedures for, special accounts; (f)
review of the budgets and annual work plans by the Inter-ministerial
committee and by the Bank; (g) naintenance of accounting records for
project activities; (h) deposit of CFAF 75 million by tSo Goverument in the
Project Account, representing its contribution for four enths of project
expenditures; and (i) signature of cooperative agreements and contracts
required respectively under the rural outreach and skills training
components.
11.      Benefits.  Vomen lu RCI vould benefit from the increased
institutional capacity of government entities to address women's issues
(i.e., through the strengthening of NPF and its abilit-y to coordinate with,
and seek collaboration of, line ministries). The enhanced promotlonal
activities of HPF vould translate into a greater avarenese of women's
needs, issues sad rights couatyvide and the incorporation of these
concerns into future mainstream investment programs. The direct principal
beneficiaries of the pilot prqject vould be vomen in the regions covered.
Over a 24-month period, about 4,800 rural vomen vould benefit from the
pilot project through increased food production and income from food
processing and marketing, and 1,200 urban vomen vould benefit through urban



-4-
urban employment.  The pilot project vould enable the Goverament to learn
from experience and to design a national program to support women, which
would have not only a social but also an econouic Impact at the national
level.  Under the national program vhich vould follow the pilot project, it
i8 expected that about 60,000 rural vomen vould benefit, as all rural
outreach workers and extension agents of line ministries vould be more
active in providing support services to rural vwoen.  About 8,000 urban
vomen vould benefit during the generalization phase, since all Institutes
for the Education of Vomen vould participate. The indirect benefits vould
be multiple, as these vamen'. familles vould a10 benefit fron improved
faiily velfare both in income and health.  Productivity of all members of
households vould improve as illuess te reduced.  ln the long-term, since
vomen are the principal producers of food crops, 'the project vould lead to
actions vith an important Impact on their food security. Furthermore,
vomen's enhanced role in the national development effort wculd contribute
to better overall economic performance and to poverty alleviation.
12.      Risks.  The main risk of the project is that MPF vould not have
the capacity to undertake the dynamic operational role required under the
project. Because of the decentralized nature of support services in RCI,
the task to reorient each entity to better meet the needs of vomen,
although essential, vill take tlme.   Z vill be difficult to change
traditional attitudes toward the role of vomen in society, including the
attitude of civil servants r'sponsible for providing support services in
the agricultural and health sectors, and the attitude Gf jomen tovard
thenselves.  In spite of being a new Hinistry, MPP has a dynamic and
enthusiastic staff most of vhom are seconded from the technical ministries.
Strengthening the support program for  anmen on a pilot scale vould not only
give it more time to develop, but would also give the Bank a chance to
observe the evolution of HP? capabilities.  Another riek is the difficulty
of designing and implementing a project vith such a priorj.y theme as women
ln development, which requires a multisectoral approach,  ad for which
there are as many questions as there are ans'ers.  The    orporation into
the project of many surveys and studies using local co.  tants where
feasible, increases the use of empirical evidence for de isions on specific
interventions thus reducing the risk of adapting inappr-  riate approaches
for enhancing the status and velfare of vomen.
13.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan vould
comply vith the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and reconmend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
