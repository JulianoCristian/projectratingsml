To remain on\n            track to reach the Millennium Development Goal of 85 percent\n            water supply coverage by 2015, access will have to expand\n            steadily while new and existing systems remain operational\n            and affordable. Annual funding for water must at least be\n            sustained at its recent level. Funding for sanitation and\n            environmental health promotion will have to be increased and\n            restructured. Related operational approaches will have to be\n            upgraded. Under the countrywide decentralization policy,\n            these challenges will have to be met largely at the district\n            level despite pervasive capacity gaps. Rapid urbanization\n            calls for targeted programs to serve poor urban households\n            and enlist consumer engagement and feedback in the\n            regulatory process for water supply and sanitation services."}, "docdt": "2009-10-07T08:44:02Z"}
