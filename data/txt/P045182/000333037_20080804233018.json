"versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Rural Water Supply and\n            Sanitation (RWSS) Project for Rwanda were as follows:\n            outcomes were highly satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was low to negligible, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: to be\n            effective, decentralization requires adequate financial and\n            human resources and must be accompanied by an effective\n            monitoring of results by the central Government and by\n            establishing a clear sense of accountability among local\n            authorities. To deliver results, project rules should be as\n            simple as possible and fully flexible, as the commitment of\n            populations is a direct function of the speed at which\n            subprojects are prepared. In addition, capacity building at\n            decentralized level can only be effective when the size and\n            number of local entities is adequate. Self-standing RWSS\n            projects should also aim at facilitating harmonization and\n            preparing to scale up and to shift to a sector-wide approach\n            and budget support by: (i) providing a complete set of\n            tested guidelines and procedures for preparing and\n            implementing investments and for managing and delivering\n            services; and (ii) enabling sector staff, rather than\n            consultants, to elaborate objectives and policy matrix\n            actions. As it was the case in Rwanda, only a strong\n            sectoral leadership at the ministerial level can create\n            incentives for staff and donors to internalize the change in\n            approach and to ensure harmonization."}, "docdt": "2008-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
