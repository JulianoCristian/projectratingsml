The choice for water-catchment will be\n            assessed following a bio-diversity analysis, taking into\n            account the role of natural forests, in safeguarding water\n            equilibrium. Mitigating measures call for: 1) installation\n            of latrines, or septic tanks, to be located at a distance of\n            no less than two hundred and twenty meters from the well, or\n            bore-hole, with provision for water testing training; 2) a\n            public awareness campaign, to inform consumers on potential\n            water contamination and sludge, resulting from construction\n            materials. Populations should be aware of this fact until\n            infrastructure is stabilized; 3) protective measures will be\n            in place on construction sites, enclosing the area with\n            barriers, and, regulations will be enforced by government\n            officials; 4) herbal vegetation with shallow roots will be\n            planted to avoid soil erosion, preferably, gramineous\n            species, which do not dry water sources. Recommendations\n            include re-enforcement of monitoring, and management testing\n            capacities, provision of rain water canalization to ensure\n            pasture lands, and, necessary controls to ensure water quality."}, "docdt": "2000-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
