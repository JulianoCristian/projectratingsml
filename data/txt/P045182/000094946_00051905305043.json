Thus, the component will support private\n            sector, and non-governmental organizations' in the\n            provision of computer services, and, the public sector will\n            facilitate the sub-sector development, and management\n            process; and, 4) inclusion of incremental project management\n            costs, and technical assistance to community development committees."}, "docdt": "2000-05-10T00:00:00Z"}
