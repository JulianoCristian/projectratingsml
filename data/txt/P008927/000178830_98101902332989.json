export-oriented projects; (ii) continue the\n            emphasis in its resource allocation on the less developed\n            regions and small- to medium-sized, labor-intensive\n            projects; and (iii) bridge a part of its foreign exchange\n            resource gap up to end-1980, as it continues its efforts to\n            increase and diversify such resources. TSKB's new drive\n            to escalate its lending and technical assistance to\n            export-oriented projects will have a major direct impact on\n            the Government's efforts to increase such investments\n            in Turkey. The risk that Government policies may not\n            maintain sufficient incentive to achieve this objective, is\n            being addressed by inter alia financing of exporters'\n            imported requirements and a dialogue on export policy under\n            the Bank's Program Loan."}, "docdt": "1979-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
