over a four-year development period and will\n            include: the provision of 8,500 new Low Lift Pumps (LLPs)\n            together with spares to replace unserviceable and condemned\n            units and to allow additional LLP fieldings; the\n            rehabilitation of 5,000 unserviceable LLPs; the initiation\n            of LLP sales to farmers with provision of credit from\n            commercial banks;the provision of tools and equipment for\n            BADC workshops; the supply of transport vehicles for BADC\n            field operations, a training program and facilities for pump\n            mechanics and operators and, advisory services to execute\n            water availability and monitoring surveys. The project will\n            also assist in the financing of incremental diesel fuel\n            requirements of project LLPs over the four-year development\n            period. About 430,000 rural households will benefit directly\n            from access to irrigation facilities provided under the\n            project, resulting in significant increases in output and\n            incomes. At full development in 1984, the project will\n            protect against the loss of 21.6 M man-days of employment\n            and employment and generate and incremental annual\n            employment of about 7.1 M man-days in on-farm work."}, "docdt": "1980-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
