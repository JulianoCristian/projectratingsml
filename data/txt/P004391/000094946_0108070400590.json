The main lessons learned from the project\n            include: Objectives that are extraneous to the implementing\n            agency's responsibilities should not be included, for\n            instance, inclusion of standards for storage, handling and\n            transportation of petroleum products. Objectives should not\n            suggest or prescribe modalities of development at too early\n            a stage, for instance, framing studies for commercial gas\n            development by Liquefied Natural Gas export (without\n            including other development scenarios). Systems and\n            procedures for project management and implementation should\n            be in place before the commencement of the project and\n            should be maintained. Their usage should be closely\n            monitored throughout the project to ensure acceptable\n            standards of project implementation. Organized\n            implementation of project activities through defined\n            documentation such as the Project Task Form is most useful\n            for management control. Contacts for goods and services\n            should, as far as possible, be denominated in the currency\n            of the loan to avoid impacts from exchange rate fluctuations\n            and consequent costs variations."}, "docdt": "2001-03-22T00:00:00Z"}
