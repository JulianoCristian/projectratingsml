of the project is\n            considered deficient. Although supervision by the Bank was\n            mostly timely and responsive to the changing needs of the\n            Borrower, the overly-dimensioned capability of the Borrower\n            was conducive to a deficient Bank's performance, in\n            addition to the design flaws during preparation, and,\n            expectations set at appraisal. Regarding the policy reform\n            conditionality, in response to recommendations by the Bank,\n            both the Borrower's and the Ministry of Agriculture and\n            Livestock (MAC) performed below expectations. The key\n            lessons convey that project objectives and loan instruments\n            should be carefully analyzed, and consistent with\n            preparation rationale, since initially the project was\n            prepared as a fast disbursing loan, but changed to an\n            investment loan at negotiations. Furthermore, it is\n            paramount that the implementation capacity of the Borrower\n            be in tune with the scope of the project. Sound ownership of\n            implementing agencies should be confirmed while preparation\n            work is involved; effective implementation and\n            sustainability results from a commitment between the Bank\n            and the Borrower. Additionally, those investments to be\n            financed by the operation, should be identified well ahead\n            of negotiations, to prevent delays during implementation.\n            Risks should be monitored, and, project management should be\n            consistent throughout the project."}, "docdt": "1999-04-02T00:00:00Z"}
