I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
1. At the time of appraisal of the Rural Access Improvement Decentralization Project in
   2004-05, progress on Nepal’s economic development was under threat. Reforms that had
   commenced in the 1990s together with strong demand for Nepal’s exports and a healthy
   tourism sector had led to a steady growth rate of 5% per year. Progress over the preceding
   decade had led to a perceptible improvement in certain human development indicators and
   a decline in consumption poverty. However, the Maoist insurgency and the low rate of
   growth and stagnant income in the agricultural sector were a serious threat to future broad-
   based social and economic development, particularly in rural areas.
2. Nepal’s economic and social development had always been inextricably linked to
   accessibility, with various surveys indicating that poverty and human development
   indicators were worse in remote areas. The road network density was low relative to
   neighboring countries and an estimated 36 percent of Nepal’s 24 million people lived at
   least 2 hours walk from the nearest all-season road where public transport services might
   be available.
3. At the time of appraisal, completing the devolution of district roads and fiscal
   responsibilities to respective District Development Committees (DDCs) was a Government
   priority in its Immediate Action Plan for the Poverty Reduction Strategy. 1 The policy of
   devolving development authority and service delivery responsibility to local bodies had
   been institutionalized through the Local Self-Governance Act (LSGA) 1999. Under the
   Act, Village Development Committees (VDCs), municipalities and District Development
   Committees (DDCs) were assigned responsibility for development programs and service
   delivery in their respective localities. While the legal framework for decentralization was
   in place, there was still a need to make its provisions operational and fully effective.
4. The Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development’s Department of Local
   Infrastructure Development and Agricultural Roads (DOLIDAR) provided technical
   support and backstopping to DDCs on all rural infrastructure issues.
5. The Rural Access Improvement and Decentralization Project (RAIDP) was a follow up
   operation to the Bank’s Learning and Innovation Loan (LIL) for the Rural Infrastructure
   Project (RIP, Credit 3215-NEP). It was designed to replicate, scale up and mainstream the
   positive lessons and good practices from RIP in support of the Government’s
   decentralization and improvements to rural access priorities.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
6. The project development objective (PDO) under the original operation was as follows:
   “For residents of participating districts utilize improved rural transport infrastructure and
   services and benefit from enhanced access to social services and economic opportunities.”
7. The key outcome indicators were:
    (a)   20 percent increase in motorized and non-motorized trips by beneficiaries to key
          social and economic centers by End of Project (EOP); and
    (b)   20 percent reduction in travel time by beneficiaries to key social and economic
          centers by EOP.
8. The Development Grant Agreement for SDR 21.2 million was dated August 1, 2005.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification
9. In 2009, as part of an adaptive and opportunistic restructuring carried out to provide
   additional financing, the Project Development Objective (PDO) was slightly revised to “for
   residents of participating districts to utilize improved rural transport infrastructure and
   services in order to have enhanced access to social services and economic opportunities”.
   The additional financing was provided to (a) cover the shortfall in achieving the original
   targets (due mainly to price increases in civil works); and (b) respond to the Government of
   Nepal request to increase the scope of various categories of civil works in the existing
   districts and cover 10 new districts. In order to allow sufficient time for completion of
   remaining activities from the original financing and the new activities from the additional
   financing, the closing date was extended by 3 years.
10. Following the additional financing, the results framework for the project was revised to
    capture the increased scope of outputs. A summary of the original and revised targets for
    the major categories of civil works (under the Rural Transport Infrastructure component) is
    provided below; for further details of the changes, please see the section on revised
    components below.

11. In addition, as part of the restructuring, a new civil works sub-component, entitled “River
    Crossing Structures” was added with a target of constructing 10 bridges by the end-of-
    project (EOP). This reflected a key finding from the original operation which was that
    bridges are a key element of providing all season road access in Nepal. The other major
    changes to indicators were related to the Capacity Building and Advisory Services (CBAS)

12. The revised PDO and outcome indicators were made applicable to both the original project
    (IDA Grant No. H171-NEP) as well as the Additional Finance Grant/credit. The revised
    Financing Agreement, for a credit of SDR 15.7 million and grant of SDR 12.8 million was
    signed on May 17, 2010.
13. The project was restructured again in November 2013, just prior to the closing date. This
    was mainly to effect a reallocation of amounts across different categories and cancel the
    unutilized amount.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
14. The main beneficiaries of the project were the residents living in the area of influence of
    the roads to be improved. In addition, some roads carried long distance traffic and those
    road users benefited from reduced vehicle operating costs and travel time costs. Reliable
    access and lower transport costs also benefited service providers since improved roads
    made it easier to engage in economic activities. The original financing was estimated to
    directly benefit 900,000 people, the additional financing in 2009 was expected to benefit
    1.5 million more (including approximately 450,000 in the new districts).

1.5 Original Components
15. A summary of the original two main components of the project, together with their costs as
    estimated at the time of appraisal, is as follows:
16. The RTI component ($34.63 million) comprised: (a) rehabilitation and upgrading of about
    800 km of existing dry-season rural roads to all-season standard; (b) upgrading of about
    200 km of existing rural trails and tracks to dry-season standard in remote hill districts; (c)

2
  This revision was in-line with the recognition in the MTR mission that the ISAP for DOLIDAR was
too detailed and would need to be recalibrated to what was reasonably achievable.



                                                    3
    maintenance of about 3,500 km of rural roads, covering routine and recurrent maintenance;
    (d) construction of 350 short-span trail bridges; and (e) development of small community
    infrastructure.
17. The CBAS component ($7.31 million) comprised: (a) implementation of training-related
    activities; (b) provision of technical assistance and advisory services; (c) preparation of a
    GIS-based transport master plan; (d) undertaking a rural transport study; (e) undertaking a
    socioeconomic impact study; and (f) provision of project implementation support,
    including logistics and operations costs, to DOLIDAR and the DDCs.

1.6 Revised Components
18. The additional finance continued to have two components but with a modified scope,
    mainly to include more of the same activities in the original set of districts and in 10 new
    districts. The total additional finance was $54 million with $45 million being provided by
    IDA and $9 million by Government of Nepal (GON) and DDCs.
19. RTI. Following the restructuring, the RTI component included an increase in the scope of
    various categories of civil works over and above what was estimated to be achievable with
    the original allocations, viz., (a) upgrading to all-weather standard of approximately 1,165
    km (615 km from original and 550 km through additional financing); (b) upgrading of
    approximately 211 km of tracks to dry season standard (61 km from original and 140 km
    through additional financing); (c) 317 trail bridges (166 nos from original and the balance
    through a SWAp3); (d) completion of 4,500 km of maintenance (3,500 km envisaged under
    original financing); (e) ten key river-crossings (new activity); and (f) community
    infrastructure with an outlay of $2.4 million (of which, $1.2 million from original
    financing). In all, the IDA financing for this component increased from $34.63 million to
    $71 million.
20. CBAS. The financing for this component increased from $7.31 million to $13.31 million,
    with a substantive part (about $4 million) of the increased allocation directed towards
    implementation support and incremental costs, mainly on account of the increase in the
    scope of activities under various categories of civil works. Also, the scope of the support
    for remaining activities aimed at capacity building was recalibrated keeping in view what
    was feasible and was mostly limited to developing an IT-based data system including road
    asset management, within DOLIDAR and the DDCs. The project continued to support the
    Rural Transport Service Study and policy recommendations contained therein. Support was
    also extended for measures aimed at ensuring effective application of the Environment and
    Social Safeguard Framework (ESMF); the implementation of the social action plans; and
    timely completion of the Remedial Action Plan.

3
  Under the original financing, the trail bridges were envisaged to be constructed through a combination
of IDA support and contribution from DDC and the communities. Whereas, under the SWAp (Sector-
wide Approach) arrangement, the IDA financing was envisaged to be a part of a multi-donor effort for
building bridges across all districts (including non-RAIDP districts) but meeting only the cost of steel
fabrication components of those bridges. From the documentation made available to the ICR team, it is
not clear how the revised target of 317 bridges was fixed for this activity at the time of the additional
financing.

1.7 Other significant changes
21. Some of the other significant changes at the time of additional financing in 2009/10 were:
    (a) a shift of the support to trail bridges through a SWAp arrangement;4 (b) a change in the
    percentages of expenditures to be financed by IDA support for the major categories of civil
    works, from 100% to 90%; and (c) the introduction of a Governance and Accountability
    Action Plan (GAAP).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
22. The project design was focused on the enhancement of rural access – which was widely
    recognized as the weak link in the rural infrastructure and, hence, a key stumbling block for
    rural development – through a balanced mix of interventions in civil works (Rural
    Transport Infrastructure component) and institutional strengthening (Capacity Building and
    Advisory Services component). Within the civil works, the selection of interventions
    ranged from upgrading of trails and other roads respectively to dry-season and all-season
    standard to construction of trail bridges. On the other hand, the capacity of the DOLIDAR
    – which was then a still a fledgling institution – was sought to be enhanced through putting
    in place medium to long term systems to enhance the quality of planning and asset
    management practices, e.g., District Transport Master Plans, IT-based Road Asset
    Management Systems, Implementation Support, etc. The project was in conformity with
    the then country assistance strategy of the Bank in terms of its emphasis on contributing to
    broad-based economic growth and improving governance via rural transport infrastructure
    investments aimed at bolstering the agricultural sector, rural economy and employment,
    and capacity development of the government institutions at the central and district level.
23. This aspect was also noted by the Quality Assessment Group, which rated the project as
    “Highly Satisfactory” for Quality At Entry (QAE), and particularly commended the project
    for its handling of the elements of risk assessment and risk mitigation, poverty, social
    development and gender aspects and the sharp focus and neat design of the project
    approach (following up on a Learning and Innovation Loan). In relation to the preparation
    process, the Panel also noted a well-developed partnership with other donors, strong
    Borrower commitment and a deep involvement of the community.
24. Yet, with the benefit of hindsight, it appears that the project could have paid more attention
    to two notable factors that seriously impacted the implementation – namely: (i) the price
    escalation of key raw materials; and (ii) the challenges associated with the construction of
    dry-season roads. This eventually led to a shortfall (of funds) in achieving the targeted
    outputs under the original financing. Another area in the project design with scope for
    improvement is the M&E framework, especially with respect to (a) the establishment of
    targets related to enhancement of access; and (b) ensuring sufficient attention to the quality
    of works in the M&E framework and other arrangements. The QAE Panel also identified
    the following areas for the project team’s attention: (a) more disaggregation of M&E
    findings to measure impacts on different groups; (b) close monitoring of quality of

    See previous footnote.



                                                5
    technical audits; (c) close monitoring of the training program to identify skills gaps; and (d)
    following up on the low level of financing of the Road Fund 5 . The targets related to
    enhancement of access, in particular, proved to be rather ambitious, especially in the
    districts in the Terai region which already had a relatively high coverage of road network
    and accessibility.

2.2 Implementation
25. The project commenced in 2005 in a difficult environment towards the end of Nepal’s
    decade-long ‘people’s war’, which formally ended following a ceasefire agreement in
    2006. Despite this, the project made good initial progress. It is important to note that the
    project existed in a relatively unstable external environment at many times during
    implementation. The most extreme example of this was the 2007 abduction and killing of
    a project engineer in Siraha district by the Terai People's Liberation Front. Though less
    extreme, the political instability experienced during Nepal’s post-conflict era also posed
    formidable implementation stage challenges including: various attempts to ratify a
    constitution, budget impasses, and frequent transfers of staff.
26. The implementation of the project stands out for demonstrating good flexibility in two
    notable ways. First, it was possible to redistribute funds to program districts with fast
    progress from those with slow progress. This helped to maintain overall progress when, for
    example, local conflicts re-emerged in some of the Eastern Terai districts in 2007. Second,
    the project was able to modify its support to the Trail Bridge Program subcomponent by
    joining in a harmonized SWAp approach with other donors in 2009.
27. The Government, too, recognized the opportunity for additional financing in the project at
    an early stage. The timely application for increased support facilitated the preparation of a
    substantial additional financing. The Mid Term Review was instrumental in improving
    implementation by articulating the case for additional financing to bridge the shortfall in
    original financing and to meet Government of Nepal’s request for expanding the scope of
    project coverage. The consequent restructuring also (a) recalibrated the outcome indicators
    related to CBAS component to take out or recalibrate the elements that were assessed to be
    difficult to achieve (e.g., GIS-based Plan and sector outcome, adoption of conducive
    regulatory and institutional framework for rural transport services); and (b) added a GAAP
    responsive to the local context (e.g., governance and peace filter).
28. The project also received significant benefit in terms of savings, especially after the 2009
    restructuring, in terms of lower-than-estimated prices for all-season road contracts (due to
    e-bidding) and significant increase in the value of US$ vis-à-vis NPR. These savings
    played a critical role in the over-achievement of targets with respect to all-season roads and
    trail bridges.
29. On the other hand, the implementation was hampered by abrupt changes of key
    government staff and an underestimation of the amount of support required to DDCs. For
5
  Note that there was an apparent lack of consistency between the original Development Grant
Agreement and the Project Appraisal Document (PAD). Schedule 1 of the former indicates 100% of the
costs would be financed by the Grant whereas the PAD shows a Borrower contribution of $ 9.94
million to the project costs. However, this did not present a problem during implementation.



                                                6
   example, the sudden change of Project Coordinator in September 2012 had a significant
   negative impact on progress. After some months, the situation improved following the
   appointment of a new Project Coordinator in early 2013. In a similar vein, the lack of
   capacity at DDC-level had adversely affected the dry-season roads sub-component in
   particular. Also, the inadequacy of the original financing to meet the targets fixed at the
   time of appraisal suggests room for improvement with respect to cost estimates. Yet
   another area of concern was the monitoring of quality aspects. The project made notable
   impacts by establishing laboratories at the district level and appointing a quality control
   specialist at the PCU level. However, much more remains to be done to ensure sustained
   attention to quality aspects. This was a key lesson learned that the Association has taken
   into the successor operation.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
30. The project monitoring indicators appeared to be mostly relevant and appropriate for the
    purpose of measuring outputs. Good use was made of the monitoring data to inform
    decision making and resource allocation. This was apparent at the Mid Term Review and
    also at other times throughout the implementation.
31. However, the selection as well as setting of the targets for measuring outcomes also had
    certain important limitations. To begin with, the three key PDO indicators – namely,
    increase in number of trips, reduction in travel time and increase in Annual Average Daily
    Traffic (AADT) – are all focused mainly on the immediate benefits of rural transport
    infrastructure investments and less on the more important outcomes and impacts resulting
    from those investments. The project could have attempted to target next level of outcomes
    which it appears to have had eventually contributed to; the socio economic study carried
    out at the end of project points to several substantive outcomes such as, for example,
    increase in agricultural yields (attributable to better access to inputs) and increase in land
    prices (owing to better access to social infrastructure). On the other hand, the targets set
    for intermediate outcome indicators related to access (within 2-hours of walking distance to
    an All-season standard) in Terai districts – that is, a target of 10% increase in this type of
    access in an area already having a wide road network coverage - had turned out to be
    highly ambitious. This was compounded by issues related to inconsistency in
    measurement, viz., the original baseline did not contain data on all parameters (e.g.,
    numbers and travel times for non-motorized trips) and, in another instance, the
    methodologies used for estimating the data at the EoP were different from those used for
    the baseline. These limitations made it difficult to directly compare the achievements vis-à-
    vis targets, thereby requiring construction of other proxy measures.
32. Also, the results framework appears to have given little or no attention to the quality
    aspects. This makes it difficult to comment on the quality issues that have been raised by
    various stakeholders. Similarly, the community infrastructure sub-component – which
    accounted for only about 3% of the IDA financing and was apparently well-received by the
    stakeholders – lacked indicators making it difficult to assess the degree of its success.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1 Safeguard Compliance
Overall Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
33. Social Safeguards (Satisfactory). The implementation of social safeguards in this project
    was largely successful and the project closed with a satisfactory rating on social
    safeguards. Based on the experience of this project DOLIDAR is preparing a sector wide
    Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) that will be internalized for all
    its projects.
34. A noteworthy feature of this project was the involvement of communities, contributing to
    the land as well as the monitoring of sub-projects. For instance, the community donated
    2.13 million square meters of land, which, at the prevailing market rates, is estimated at
    NPR 5.63 billion (US$ 56.3 million); this is several times more than the NPR 64.4 million
    (US$0.65 million) provided by the project as assistance to the affected persons. Similarly,
    in case of the 237 community assets created by the project with an expenditure of NPR
    217.6 million (US$2.18 million), the communities contributed about 37% of the value, in
    terms of cash/labor. As of February 2014, the project conducted first, second and third
    round(s) of community-based monitoring respectively for 152, 136 and 103 sub-projects.
35. Although the project involved the upgrading of existing roads rather than new alignments,
    some land acquisition was required and there were a number of Severely Project Affected
    Families (SPAF). Implementation of the social safeguard requirements was initially slow
    and such that, by the time of the Mid Term Review, it was rated as “highly unsatisfactory”.
    Amongst other things, this was due to non-payment of compensation to severely project
    affected families because of the absence of the required re-settlement action plan. In
    response, the PCU undertook an assessment of voluntary land donation impacts and the
    numbers of affected families which led to preparation of a Remedial Action Plan.
    Implementation of this Plan brought about substantial improvement in social safeguards
    compliance, resulting in resolution of 97% of the land ownership issues by the EOP
    (                                                                 The remaining land owners
    could not be compensated as they were either absentee land owners or there were
    litigations linked to those land parcels. In total, there were 12,558 affected families out of
    which 204 severely affected families (land 162, structure 37, and livelihood loss 5) had
    received their assistance by the EOP. This improvement resulted in a final rating of
    “moderately satisfactory”.
36. Environmental safeguards (Moderately Satisfactory). Environmental safeguards were
    reported as a concern even until late 2012, mainly due to delays in preparing environmental
    documents such as the Initial Environmental Examinations (IEEs) or Environmental
    Management Plans (EMPs), designing site specific plans for mitigation works, and
    implementation of mitigation measures. Delays in central and district level monitoring
    were also a concern. Environmental performance varied from road to road, typically
    between moderately unsatisfactory to moderately satisfactory. However, it is noteworthy
    that following updating of the ESMF during preparation of additional financing and
    subsequent provision of additional support of environmental specialists at the central and
    cluster levels, there had been distinct improvement in compliance to environmental issues.
    Also, the team was given to understand that the GoN had made necessary arrangements for


                                                8
    funds and human resources for completion of the remaining works by June 2014. With this
    in view, the performance on environmental safeguards is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

2.4.2 Fiduciary Compliance
Overall Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
37. Procurement (Satisfactory). Procurement under the project was carried out in accordance
    with the World Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" and
    the provisions stipulated by the Financing Agreements. As per the project’s
    decentralization objective, the procurement of works was carried by the respective districts
    while the goods and services were procured by the PCU. Considering the nature and size of
    works, almost all the civil works contracts were procured through National Competitive
    Bidding. Some of the small works contracts for the dry season roads subcomponent were
    procured by direct contracting through users’ committees/groups.
38. The PCU played a significant role in verifying/reviewing Bid Evaluation Reports (BERs)
    prepared by districts to ensure their consistency with the approved evaluation and
    qualification criteria. The PCU also checked for any evidence of collusion or coercion or
    limited participation/competition. There were several examples of PCU’s interventions that
    halted the award of contracts where there was credible evidence of potential mis-
    procurement. The introduction of e-bidding considerably reduced the risks of intimidation
    of bidders and non-competitive bidding. This and the training6 provided under the project
    had enhanced the procurement process by the EOP.
39. Financial Management (Moderately Satisfactory). The fiduciary risk rating of the project
    was downgraded from an initial rating of “Moderate” to “Substantial” during the mid-
    course of the project due to some control deficiencies and frequent turnover/vacancy of
    finance staff, which was later bridged with consulting support. The major control
    deficiency noted was inadequate district level monitoring of expenditures and, in the case
    of some districts, the project was not able to immediately furnish requisite supporting
    documents for review purposes. Some of the audit observations reported were mainly
    related to control deficiencies such as (a) large advance payments provided in the last
    month of the fiscal year to avoid freezing of the budget (this raises a question of prudent
    spending as well as on the quality of the outputs), (b) delays in settling advances provided
    by DDCs, and (c) misuse of project’s assets. These limitations were bridged through
    consultancy support, which, along with a computerized Financial Management Information
    System (FMIS), helped to maintain the regular transactions. As a result, both the trimester
    financial monitoring reports and audit reports were submitted mostly on time. The Bank
    followed up on all audit observations and suggested improvements to the control and
    monitoring system as well as the overall quality of financial reporting. Accordingly, the
    financial management performance of the project was rated as Moderately Satisfactory.
40. The challenges faced in this project clearly underscore that the follow-on project would
    need to pay particular attention to (a) establishing an effective system for financial
    monitoring and reporting at the district level; (b) ensuring deployment of qualified and

6
 During the project period, 316 participants were trained on the subject of “Procurement and Contract
Management” alone, through 14 formal programs.



                                                 9
   experienced finance staff (backed by the consultant, if necessary); and (c) updating the
   current FMIS to meet the requirements of the new project.
41. Governance: As part of the additional financing in 2009, following up on a Governance,
    Peace and Security Assessment, the project adopted Governance and Accountability Action
    Plan (GAAP) and “Peace Filter”. The GAAP, covering seven broad areas of operations
    including organizational arrangements, project selection, contract management and
    monitoring and evaluation, gave a significant boost to aspects such as e-bidding, social
    accountability and community participation, which are duly highlighted in their respective
    sections. The Peace Filter, on the other hand, did not seem to have made much headway as
    (a) it did not find strong ownership either among task teams or within implementation
    agencies and (b) because of the divergent views as to what constitutes peace. Overall,
    albeit some significant achievements, the scope of GAAP appears to have been rather
    ambitious especially in committing the project leadership to undertake measures that are
    beyond its capacity or jurisdiction such as, for example, in the case of building capacity of
    local contractors and enforcing the Civil Service Act. Owning to these shortcomings, the
    implementation of GAAP in the project could be rated as moderately satisfactory.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
42. A key lessons learned from RAIDP relates to the challenges of maintaining rural transport
    assets in Nepal. This is a lesson that has also come from other development-partner
    supported rural transport programs in Nepal. For example, DfID’s most recent annual
    review of the Rural Access Program notes that “[A] More strategic approach to road
    maintenance is required for ensuring road sustainability.” Similarly, the recent Nepal Road
    Sector Assessment Study (P124396) identified that maintenance continues to receive less
    priority throughout both Government and donor supported rural transport/road programs.
    These lessons have fed into the IDA-supported project for Strengthening the National
    Rural Transport Program (SNRTP) which was approved in December 2013. SNRTP’s
    design encourages a ‘maintenance first’ approach to rural transport infrastructure by: (i)
    requiring districts to provide for maintenance on their core road networks before obtaining
    project resources for road upgrading or new crossing structures; (iii) supporting the
    development of routine maintenance systems (group-based length persons); (iii) putting
    project districts into regular annual maintenance programming cycles with measurable
    process milestones; (iv) focusing efforts and resources on district level core road networks.
    These features have all come from lessons or pilot initiatives from RAIDP.
43. Another important lesson learned from RAIDP relates to the nascent level of capacity
    within district institutions and District Technical Offices (DTO) in particular. DTOs
    manage civil works programs for a multitude of competing needs (not just transport).
    However they are also in the best position to deliver results in the rural transport sub-
    sector. Plans to reshape Nepal’s government along a federal model may further increase
    their importance. This has informed the design of both Bank and other development partner
    funded initiatives. The institutional strengthening and technical assistance component of
    SNRTP, too, builds on and takes forward the institutional gains made under RAIDP
    through lining up future support to MOFALD, DOLIDAR and participating districts in
    planning and managing the local rural transport system.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
44. The project was formally restructured in 2009 and again in 2013, very near the end of
    project. The PDO was also revised as part of the first round of restructuring. However, for
    the purposes of this ICR, the original and restructured (additional financing) segments of
    the project are considered as a continuum and evaluated as a single project, for three
    reasons. Firstly, the revision of the PDO was not a substantive alteration of the objective
    but essentially to bring more clarity, i.e., the enhanced access to social service and
    economic opportunities to be achieved through the project is that which could be
    reasonably attributable to the project’s interventions 7 . Secondly, a number of works
    initiated under the original financing were telescoped into the period after restructuring,
    duly consuming a part of the support extended through the additional financing. Thirdly,
    the (baseline) data for some of the key indicators were measured through studies carried
    out during the additional financing period thereby making it difficult to distinguish – and
    separately assess – the achievements in and attributable to the pre and post-revised
    segments of the project. As regards the second restructuring in November 2013, although
    the targets for various civil works were revised at that time, these were not taken into
    consideration for the purposes of the ICR evaluation as they were set almost at the end of
    the project period.

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation (Satisfactory)
45. Relevance of Objective: The revised development objective “for residents of participating
    districts to utilize improved rural transport infrastructure and services in order to have
    enhanced access to social services and economic opportunities” was, and is, highly relevant
    to Nepal’s development objective of broad-based economic growth 8 , for which lack of
    access to rural areas remains a significant constraint.
46. The project was relevant to the Bank’s country strategy as it sought to address two of the
    three pillars of the Interim Strategy Note (June 2009), namely, enhancing equitable access
    to services and social inclusion and creating an environment conducive to sustainable
    private-sector led growth and employment generation. It also remains consistent with
    current development objectives of the Bank, and is in line with the two out of the three
    pillars of Interim Strategy Note FY 12-13, aimed at supporting the GoN to build a
    peaceful, prosperous and just Nepal, viz., (i) enhancing connectivity and productivity for
    growth; and (ii) promoting access to better quality of services.
47. The initial premise was that improved transport access created by rural roads would result
    in overall development of the areas while the local residents would experience
    improvements in their livelihoods. A recent Study has confirmed the economic impact of

    rural transport access by showing a correlation between higher farm profits and proximity
    to north-south road linkages in Nepal9.
48. Relevance of Design and Implementation. The project design had a mix of rural transport
    infrastructure improvements and capacity building and advisory services (CBAS). There
    was awareness at the project design stage that there would be various capacity constraints
    and process gaps to implementing infrastructure improvements and the local level. The
    chosen mix of components enabled these constraints to be addressed, in partnership with
    other development partners, through the CBAS component. The project was well-designed
    in complementing support provided to the rural transport infrastructure sub-sector by other
    development partners through its geographical coverage. The implementation, though
    lagging at times, was mostly effective in terms of identifying and addressing both
    challenges and opportunities, as evidenced in the analysis of the Mid-Term Review and the
    consequent adaptive and opportunistic restructuring of the project to provide additional
    financing to (a) cover the shortfall in achieving the original targets (due mainly to price
    increases in civil works); and (b) respond to the GoN request to increase the scope of
    various categories of civil works in the existing districts and cover 10 new districts. A
    shortcoming of the design was the M&E framework, particularly in relation to setting
    targets for enhancing access, lack of adequate focus on monitoring quality and use of
    different methodologies for assessing the outcomes at the beginning and end of the project.
    In view of these minor shortcomings, the relevance of objectives, design and
    implementation is rated as Satisfactory.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

49. PDO Indicators: Overall, the project was successful in achieving its targeted PDO
    indicators, viz., increase in trips, reduction in travel time and increase in traffic. The Socio-
    Economic Impact Study 10 carried out towards the end of the program showed that the
    target of a 20% increase in motorized and non-motorized traffic was fully achieved with a
    145% increase in motorized-trips (per household per month) and 77% increase in non-
    motorized trips (per household per month) on 22 sampled roads between 2011 and 2013.
    Here, it is important to note that these achievements are measured against an alternative
    set of baseline numbers from a Socio-Economic Impact Study carried out in year 2011.
    This is because, at the time of project appraisal in 2005, the baseline values were provided
    only for the motorized trips. Hence, in order to consistently measure the achievements
    w.r.t. both motorized and non-motorized trips, the ICR team relied on the Socio Economic
    Study Reports carried out in 2011 and EoP, which contained data for both modes for
    traffic. The same Study showed a 48% reduction in travel time for motorized trips and 35%
    reduction for non-motorized trips compared to the target of 20% reduction.
50. Regarding the achievements on the indicator of traffic, too, a note of clarification would be
    in order. At the time of appraisal, the targets related to traffic were set out w.r.t. increase in

     the Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) for three different modes of transport, buses,
     trucks and jueeps/micro-buses. However, the EoP study provided data only for Average
     Daily Traffic (ADT).11 A comparison of the baseline and EoP numbers of Average Daily
     Traffic– that is, without any seasonal adjustment – indicates an increase of 55%, 41% and
     29% for buses, trucks and jeeps/micro-buses respectively. Although this compares
     favorably with the target of a 30% increase in each of these transport modes, it would be
     difficult to conclusively establish the achievement of the target as it was set for AADT and
     not ADT (which does not include seasonable adjustments).
51. Intermediate Outcome Indicators: The project sought to assess its achievement with
    respect to enhancing accessibility, through two intermediate outcome indicators, viz.,
    increasing the percentage of population living within four hour’s walk of an all-season road
    in the Hill districts and two hour’s walk in the Terai (Plains) districts. The ICR team could
    not make a clear assessment of the achievement with respect to these indicators because the
    Accessibility Mapping Report12 produced towards the end of the program period used a
    different methodology to that used for establishing the baseline at the beginning of the
    project.13
52. However, an attempt has been made to use the Accessibility Mapping14 methodology used
    at the end of project to “estimate” the impact of the RAIDP network using population
    numbers from 2011. For example, in the original 11 Terai districts, the existing network
    was within 2-hours of walking for nearly 6.7 million (92.8% of a total 7.2 million), and the
    additions to the network due to RAIDP have brought 6.9 million (94.5% of total) within 2-
    hours of walking to a road network. Going by this metric, the achievements of increase in
    access in Terai districts are: 1.7 percentage points (92.8% to 94.5%) in the original districts
    and 4 percentage points (91.1% to 95.1%) in the Additional districts, and both are below
    the target of 10% increase envisaged at the time of appraisal and additional financing. In
    contrast, in case of Hill districts, the target of a 15% increase in the number of people

  It is to be noted that the team could not arrive at AADT from ADT because of lack of
enough information.

   EoP studies used a different methodology given the following weaknesses in the 2005 baseline
studies: (i) the logic used for the calculation of time was rather weak (aerial distances; use of a factor in
the case of hills for factoring up access time); (ii) road-heads as opposed to the whole road lengths were
considered for the estimation of access time; (iii) the use of incomplete road related information. The
revised methodology in EoP study was based on terrain modelling, updated road information in the
estimation of access time.
14
   “Accessibility Mapping of rural roads is the visualization of the level of accessibility of the local
people to all-weather rural roads. This is measured basically through the time to reach the nearest road
head from the individual households or settlements. Accessibility level thus depends upon the spatial
distribution of the settlements and the road alignments and it can be well mapped and analyzed with the
application of GIS” – from the report, entitled “Preparation of Accessibility Mapping and finding out
the increment of population due to intervention of RAIDP Roads in the zone of influences”, by Binod
Prasad Dhakal, in December 2013, for RAIDP.



                                                     13
     within 4-hour walk of an all-season road was almost equaled (65.5% to 79.6%) in original
     districts and exceeded (54.1% to 75.3%) in Additional districts.
53. The apparent under-achievement in the Terai districts appears to be due to an initial under-
    assessment of the baseline and limited analysis at Entry of what was realistically
    achievable. The relatively dense network of roads and easier terrain in the Terai meant that
    most of the population already lived within two hours walk of an all-season road before the
    RAIDP roads were upgraded15.
54. Output Indicators: The project’s achievement on output indicators related to the Rural
    Transport Infrastructure component – that is, outputs directly linked to investment flows
    – have exceeded targets in all sub-categories of civil works, except the upgrading of
    tracks/roads to dry-season standard.
55. All-season roads: The total number of kilometers upgraded to all-season standard
    significantly exceeded the target. By 31st December 2013, a total of 1,741 kilometers of
    road had been fully upgraded compared to a revised target of 1,165 kilometers set at the
    time of the Additional Financing Agreement. In addition, there were a further 16 roads
    totaling 133 kilometers in length that were under construction and expected to be
    completed within 2-3 months of EOP. This strong result was mainly due to the utilization
    of savings from lower bidding costs and foreign exchange rate gains as well as a
    significantly improved rate of progress during the later stages of the project.
56. Dry-season roads: The total length of trails upgraded to dry season standard motorable
    roads was 141 km. This was about 30% below the target of 211 km. The main reasons
    given for this were the long delay in procuring consultants – who were to assist the local
    communities in design – and the weak management at DDC level.
57. Trail Bridges and Other Bridges: The total number of trail bridges constructed was 745,
    which was significantly above the target of 317. The total achieved included 164 bridges
    fully constructed with RAIDP funds and an additional 581 bridges for which RAIDP
    contribution was limited to steel fabrication parts. This shift to “fabrication only” – a result
    of the shift to the SWAp approach for this activity – was the main reason for exceeding the
    target by such a large margin. Even so, adjusting the achievement figure based on the
    proportion of fabrication costs to total construction costs gives a total ‘equivalent’
    achievement of 404 trail bridges, at least in financial terms, and thus appears to have well
    exceeded the target.
58. Maintenance: The number of kilometers of rural road maintenance achieved in the
    program districts by the EOP was 4,622, slightly above the target of 4,500. The
    maintenance was carried out using Government of Nepal funds and the reported length was
    based on information provided by the participating DDCs.
59. All 204 seriously project affected people (SPAF) had received the planned financial
    assistance by the EOP, as against the target of at least 90% of SPAF receiving the planned
    assistance.


15
  A reduction in the target percentage and/or a reduction in the walking time measure would have
produced a more appropriate target.



                                                14
60. Under the Capacity Building and Advisory Services component, which accounted for 12%
    of the total support, most of the revised targets were achieved, with the notable exception
    of implementation of the Road Asset Management System and MIS modules by EoP.
    However, since EoP, Road Asset Management System and MIS modules are being
    implemented in 9 districts. The District Transport Master Plans were prepared for 25
    districts as against the revised target of 10 districts; 5 more DTMPs were almost completed
    by the EOP and reportedly DTMPS for the remaining 5 districts too were completed
    thereafter. The introduction of e-bidding for works contracts proved highly successful as it
    was spread beyond the original target of adoption in 9 DDCs and has been introduced in all
    74 DDCs and 17 Municipalities. The targets for the preparation and implementation of a
    road asset management system and MIS modules were achieved only partially; in both
    cases the systems were substantially completed but had not been fully implemented by the
    EOP.
61. In summary, the achievement on most outcome indicators and investment linked outputs
    appear to be mostly satisfactory, except the following shortcomings: (a) 30% shortfall in
    dry season roads target (6% of budget);(b) lack of clearly comparable baseline and EOP
    analysis in certain outcome/intermediate outcome indicators; and (c) low achievement on
    implementation of MIS modules. Considering these shortcomings as moderate, the
    achievement of the project development objectives is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

3.3 Efficiency
62. The Cost-effectiveness and Cost-Benefit Analyses of RAIDP Roads Report of January
    2014 showed that all projects surveyed were well within the cost effectiveness ceiling of
    $100 per beneficiary with the majority at $50 or below. The cost effectiveness (that is,
    investment cost per person) of almost all roads surveyed was also lower than the original
    estimates. One of the reasons for this was that the contract prices achieved were
    significantly lower than estimated due mainly to fierce competition among local
    contractors.
63. The same report included a Cost-Benefit Analysis of a small sample of upgraded roads.
    This indicated a satisfactory economic justification for the investments with all roads
    showing an Economic Rate of Return (ERR) in excess of the minimum benchmark of 12%.
    The Analysis showed an average first year ERR of 28 percent with a total Net Present
    Value of $8.6 million for the whole program.
64. Also, in case of upgrading to all-weather standard – the largest sub-component in the
    project accounting for about 50% of the total costs by EoP – the project achieved almost
    50% higher output than the target of 1,165 kilometers. For this particular activity, the cost
    per kilometer for the original project roads totaling 648 kilometers in length was $23,157.
    This figure did not change significantly for the additional project where the average cost
    was $23,382 for a further 1,104 kilometers. Similar good progress was achieved to time
    and budget for the Trail Bridge subcomponent where the construction of 750 bridges was
    supported. The average cost per meter span of the trail bridges was approximately $390
    with little change between the original and the additional finance projects.
65. Most of the civil works, which accounted for the majority of the financing support, were
    thus constructed within the original thresholds for the cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit


                                               15
      analysis and the budgeted estimates and also the sample set of projects yielded an
      Economic Rate of Return higher than the 12% benchmark. In view of this, the efficiency of
      the project is rated as Satisfactory.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
66. The PDO remains highly relevant to the economic and social development situation of
    Nepal. The modification of PDO in 2009 was essentially to bring about more clarity about
    the objective. The targets were adjusted at the same time to take into account the changed
    scope but with no change to the parameters. The targets for outcome and output indicators
    have been achieved and in many cases exceeded within the project period. The design of
    the project proved effective in completing almost all of the rural infrastructure
    subcomponents within the planned costs and time period. The CBAS component provided
    effective and relevant support that complemented the rural infrastructure component and
    strengthened both DOLIDAR and local authorities’ ability to manage the rural road
    network.
67. The project has thus been rated “Satisfactory” with respect to its relevance and efficiency,
    and “Moderately Satisfactory” in achievements with regard to the project development
    objectives, as assessed through its performance vis-à-vis targets for various indicators of
    the results framework. Combining all these factors, the overall outcome has been rated as
    “Moderately Satisfactory”.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
68. The Impact Study clearly indicated the perceived benefits of enhanced access in the project
    areas. Ease of access to service centres and increasing awareness about health and hygiene
    appeared to be factors for an increase in the frequency of trips by men and women. In the
    Focus Group Discussions, women acknowledged that they were able to visit health centres
    more often after the improvement of the roads since they could use public transport
    including buses. There was an overall average increase in trips of 30% but an 86% increase
    in trips to hospitals.
69. There was a significant increase in agricultural production in the project areas due almost
    entirely to an increase in yields per hectare (e.g. from 36 to 42 quintals per hectare for
    paddy rice). Farmers reported the reason for this was easier and timely access to
    agricultural inputs. Moreover, farm households in the project areas reported a shift in
    strategy from one of production for home consumption to production for the market.
70. Land prices increased in the project areas in most cases because of the improved transport
    infrastructure and associated developments (e.g., proximity to markets, schools, hospitals,
    etc.). The price for Khet land and house/residential plots were reported to have risen by
    more than 150% while the price of Bari land had increased by 30% 16 . This was
16

                                                 16
      accompanied by a slight decrease in average landholdings in the project areas. Focus
      Group Discussions suggested that some households in the project areas were selling some
      of their land after road improvements to neighbours or to the new settlers (i.e., in-migrants)
      and making investments in other gainful businesses like poultry, fisheries, tea-shops, etc.
71. Another critical aspect of the project was the harnessing as well as enhancement of the
    capacity of the communities through their substantial involvement in terms of (a)
    participation in identification, building and/or monitoring of civil works; and (b)
    contribution in the form of land, cash and/or labor.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
72. The development of the capacity of the government implementing institutions was one of
    the major benefits brought about by the project. At commencement, DOLIDAR was a
    relatively new institution and the RAIDP was the largest project that it had managed.
    However, through the capacity building and experience gained through this project, it
    became able to manage other large projects. This includes the ADB-funded Rural
    Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Sector Development Program (RRRSDP), which has
    recently been successfully completed, and the Bank funded Strengthening the National
    Rural Transport Program (SNRTP), which has been recently launched with a total budget
    of $175 million over 5 years.
73. The gains in capacity at DDC level have been more modest but also important as these will
    increasingly become the key institutions for the implementation of infrastructure
    development projects in their respective geographical jurisdictions. In the program
    districts, these institutions have developed such that they are able to manage local contracts
    with the necessary facilities and procedures for site supervision and quality control albeit
    with some resource constraints and management weaknesses.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts
74. Increased environmental pollution was the major negative impact of the project roads
    reported by rural residents. This was because most of the roads were improved to gravel
    standard and this, with increased motorized traffic, caused a lot of dust. In a similar vein,
    safety – particularly for the children – was reportedly often cited as a major concern for the
    households adjoining the project roads.
75. Another unintended outcome of the project was an increase in people working outside the
    village. The March 2012 impact study on the original project roads showed nearly twice as
    many working outside the village but within Nepal and over three times as many working
    outside Nepal in the project areas compared to the control areas17.
76. A positive outcome that was not specifically targeted was that many of the project’s
    procedures and approaches have become DOLIDAR’s standard nationwide, e.g., e-bidding
    process, ESMF, etc.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
77. The team conducted a half-day workshop in Kathmandu on 10th March 2014 in order to
    gain an understanding of the perceptions of the project among the various stakeholders,
    mainly drawn from the implementation agencies at the central and district levels. The
    workshop participants were generally satisfied with the achievements of the program and
    particularly the good progress with the upgrading of roads to all-weather standard. They
    reported positively on the benefits in terms of travel time savings and easier access to
    social and economic services. They highlighted some concerns with the standards and
    quality of the program roads. Some participants were dissatisfied with these aspects while
    others felt that the planned standards should have been better communicated to the
    beneficiaries. The fixed ceiling on per kilometer costs imposed by the project was felt to
    have contributed to the problems with inadequate technical standards. Several participants
    also noted how the irregular flow of funds from the government to the DDCs had disrupted
    progress.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
78. The implementation of the RAIDP has demonstrated the crucial importance of good
    leadership and management. The sudden and seemingly unplanned transfer of key staff
    continues to be a risk to sustainability of the development outcome of improved rural
    access. This risk may progressively diminish as the Government now has a larger pool of
    experienced with enhanced capabilities acquired through implementation of large-scale
    programs such as RAIDP and SNRTP at several geographical locations and levels of the
    rural transport infrastructure institutional architecture.
79. Yet another major risk to sustaining the development outcome is the likely neglect of
    maintenance of the improved roads. Existing government systems for rural road
    maintenance are weak and resources allocated are low compared to the needs. Without
    regular and timely maintenance, the low-cost rural roads produced by the RAIDP are
    vulnerable to rapid deterioration due to heavy monsoon rains, steep gradients and unstable
    slopes. Adequate budgetary support from Government both for road maintenance and
    management of the road network remains a risk to sustaining the Development Outcome.
    With the many pressures on the government budget, this is likely to remain a threat.
80. The RAIDP recognized this risk and sought to address it through several measures
    including: (a) the requirement that DDCs allocate 20% of the investment cost for
    maintenance from their own resources established a flow of financial resources for road
    maintenance at district level through the life of the project; (b) the shift to otta seal
    surfacing for some of the higher-trafficked all-weather roads reduced the vulnerability to
    surface attrition and washing out that occurs with gravel surfacing; (c) testing and
    development for improvements to basic otta seal road designs that helped increase
    durability; (d) a system of routine maintenance by length-persons on trial sections was
    initiated in three districts, with support from ILO, to establish a practical system for the
    regular maintenance of district roads; (e) designing and piloting a road maintenance related
    decision support system has been designed and piloted by RAIDP; and (f) use of concrete
    edge blocks in Terai on an experimental basis.



                                              18
81. In addition to the aforementioned measures, the risk of lack of future road maintenance is
    further mitigated through the follow-on “Project for Strengthening the National Rural
    Transport Program (SNRTP)”, as it provides enhanced support to road maintenance in
    these districts through an output-based approach. In particular, the length person schemes
    that RAIDP piloted are being scaled up to all SRNTP project districts.
82. Considering the aforementioned risk factors and the measures in place for mitigating them,
    the risk to development outcome is rated as Moderate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
83. The Bank’s performance during the preparatory period was rated highly satisfactory by the
    QAE panel mainly on the basis of the project’s strategic relevance and approach. ICR
    team’s analysis and conclusions regarding the strategic relevance of the project (detailed in
    Section 3.2) also supports this understanding. With regard to project design too, an
    appropriate mix of investments in dry season roads, all-season roads and trail bridges was
    selected for achievement of the PDO. This was combined with important capacity building
    support to improve planning procedures and build management capability. Also, the main
    lessons learned from the previous support to the subsector appear to have been applied and
    the RAIDP built on the achievements of the previous RIP project.
84. A notable area of limitation at the time of preparation was the results framework. As
    highlighted in the Section 2.3 on Monitoring and Evaluation, the selection as well as
    setting of the targets for measuring outcomes had significant scope for improvement. To
    begin with, the PDO indicators focused mainly on the immediate benefits of rural transport
    infrastructure investments and less on the more important outcomes and impacts resulting
    from those investments, e.g., improvement in the incomes and/or quality of life of
    households. The targets in some cases such as, for example, improvement of access in
    Terai districts, were also rather ambitious. These limitations were further compounded by
    issues related to availability of relevant data and consistency in measurement.
85. Also, the subsequent events during the implementation suggest that the attention given in
    project preparation turned out to be inadequate at least in case of two major risks – post-
    conflict environment and weak institutional capacity of implementation agencies,
    especially at the operational level – indicating the scope for improvement in the area of
    design measures for mitigating them.
86. In all, the aforementioned limitations have affected the project’s implementation as well as
    its case for fully and more accurately presenting and claiming credit for some of its
    contributions and achievements. Considering this shortcoming, the Bank’s performance in
    ensuring quality at entry is rated as “Moderately Unsatisfactory”.




                                               19
(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
87. There was good engagement between the Bank, the Borrower and the Implementation
    Agency throughout the project period. Regular supervision missions were carried out with
    the active involvement of all relevant disciplines. The Bank staff was proactive in the
    identification of potential issues and engaged with the Borrower and Implementation
    agency in finding appropriate solutions. A case in point is the way in which the challenges
    and poor performance in several components and functional disciplines were duly noted,
    analyzed and addressed through appropriate remedial actions, e.g., community
    contributions in terms of land and monitoring (social), e-bidding (procurement), additional
    financing (civil works) and restructuring (recalibration of the CBAS component). Again,
    it is important to note that project implementation took place during a period of post-
    conflict transition and political instability in Nepal. This added an additional layer of
    complexity to the inherent challenges of supervising decentralized implementation, in
    terms of disruptions due to insurgency activities, physical threats and unsafe operating
    conditions for field staff in several districts.
88. The Mid Term Review carried out by the Bank proved helpful in re-focusing some of the
    project components where progress was slow and targets elusive. It also identified
    opportunities through the project to work in harmony with other development partners by
    adopting a SWAp approach for the Trail Bridge component.
89. A notable limitation in the implementation, however, was the apparent lack of recognition
    and reporting of the savings arising out of lower bid prices and variations in foreign
    exchange rates. Ideally, these savings should have been appropriately highlighted by the
    Bank supervision team at an early stage to trigger a re-planning of the project budgets and
    targets; in the absence of such proactive action, these savings appear to have automatically
    found their way into supporting the upgrading of more roads whilst critical maintenance
    tasks remained only partially addressed. In part this reflects very strong beneficiary
    demand for new all-weather connectivity. This demand combined with additional resources
    available eventually resulted in superlative performance of a major sub-component and
    thereby furthered the achievement of the project’s development objective. Accordingly,
    this is considered as a moderate shortcoming, and the Bank’s performance during the
    supervision is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
90. Normally, a combination of “Moderately Unsatisfactory” and “Moderately Satisfactory”
    ratings of Bank’s performance respectively at Entry and Implementation would suggest an
    overall performance rating of “Moderately Unsatisfactory”. However, it is important to
    recognize that, despite the shortcomings at Entry, the project eventually achieved an
    overall “Moderately Satisfactory” outcome and, in line with the ICR guidelines for such a
    context, the overall Bank performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.




                                                   20
5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
91. Initially, there was a high level of commitment to the project from the Government side
    and this greatly facilitated the project preparation and guidance. For instance, in the initial
    phases of the project, despite the difficult context of post-conflict environments, the
    government showed good flexibility in allowing the project to quickly redistribute funds to
    program districts with fast progress from those with slow progress, thereby maintaining the
    overall progress. Also, the Government recognized the opportunity for enhancing the scope
    of the project, and thereby paved the way for ensuing restructuring and additional
    financing.
92. The government support, however, was not entirely consistent and has been significantly
    lacking during the critical phases of implementation. In particular, the implementation was
    hampered by abrupt changes of key staff and inadequate provision of financial support to
    DDCs. A case in point is the large level staff rotations in DDCs in the fall of 2005 and a
    few other sudden change of the Project Coordinator in subsequent periods. Yet another
    example is the lack of capacity at DDC-level to undertake technical designs that had
    adversely impacted the implementation of the dry-season roads sub-component. Although
    the Government eventually rectified this in the latter stages of the project period,
    considering the adverse impact of delay in achievement of PDOs, the Borrower
    Performance is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
93. The project was the largest that had been managed by DOLIDAR to date and the first time
    that significant responsibility for implementation had been given to DDCs. Also, the
    project had to be implemented in the difficult context of the post-conflict environment in
    2005, very weak capacity of several ground-level implementation agencies (DDCs),
    intermitted disruptions due to insurgency activities in several project districts, formation of
    strong cartels adversely affecting and even hindering procurement of certain civil works
    including through physical threats, etc.
94. Despite these myriad factors, DOLIDAR rose to the challenge well and steadily improved
    in their management capability. The DDCs, starting from a weaker position, also improved
    but required more support. Both DOLIDAR and DDCs progressively enhanced their
    respective capacities, albeit to a varying degree, and lend themselves capable to implement
    other similar large-size projects such as the ADB-funded RRSDP and the Bank-funded
    SNRTP. Because of these improvements in management capability, the implementing
    agencies were able to eventually catch up on progress that had been lagging such that
    almost all project targets were achieved by the EOP. Accordingly, the performance of the
    implementation agency has been rated as Moderately Satisfactory.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance




                                                21
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
95. Here, too, a combination of “Moderately Unsatisfactory” and “Moderately Satisfactory”
    ratings of respective performances of government and implementing agencies would
    suggest an overall performance rating of “Moderately Unsatisfactory”. Again, considering
    the overall “Moderately Satisfactory” outcome at the project level, the overall borrower
    performance has been rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
96. On the basis of project experience the following lessons were learned that could be useful
    for similar projects in future, and, in particular, the recently launched follow-on project,
    entitled Strengthening the National Rural Transport Program.
97. Adequate and effective maintenance of infrastructure is the major challenge to sustaining
    the project benefits. The lesson learned is that the development of projects involving local
    (low-cost) rural infrastructure should address maintenance as a first and top priority step in
    the process.
98. The financial cost per kilometer of works should not be constrained by a specific ceiling
    when there are sound technical reasons for higher investments that remain economically
    viable. A project-imposed cap on contract costs per kilometer led to short term cost savings
    at the design stage, such as the under-provision of cross drainage structures and omission
    of road safety measures, with consequent higher whole-life costs for the roads. The lesson
    learned is that investments should meet minimum technical and safety criteria as well as
    economic viability.
99. DDCs need support in the preparation and management of contracts that ensures their
    ownership and accountability. The junior engineers provided as extra support to each
    district under the RAIDP tended to be left by the District Technical Officer without
    adequate supervision and assigned responsibility such that the DTO sometimes did not feel
    accountable for managing the project. The lesson learned is that where support is provided
    to the district level this should be done in such a way that the district authorities remain
    fully responsible and accountable.
100. In a rural infrastructure project spread across a wide geographical area, institutional
   strengthening, especially at the lower rungs of government such as DDCs, requires not
   only significantly more resources and attention but also needs to be tackled early on to be
   able to better assess the actual improvements achieved. For instance, under RAIDP, there
   the Institutional Strengthening measures and these too were mostly focused on outputs
   such as, for example, completion of e-procurement, asset management system, RuTIMs,
   etc., and most of these were implemented during the final phases of the project. Such an
   approach leaves no clear indication of the effectiveness and/or sustainability of these
   systems and how these systems, in turn, actually resulted in improving the capacity of the
   DoLIDAR and DDCs. Anecdotal evidence suggests that although technical and fiduciary
   systems in place, these were often not followed in practice at the district level as there has
   been little or no ownership of these from DDCs and DTOs. The lesson learned is that (a)
   training is required to ensure district officers are aware of the systems that they are to
   follow; (b) there are procedures in place to verify that these systems are followed; and (c)
   all such issues should ideally be addressed during the early phases of the project.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

101. The implementation agency and borrower have shared the following comments on the
   draft ICR vide their email dated May 15, 2014:
      Intermediate outcome indicator should be verified with borrower's ICR report on
       accessibility because some data are not matching.
      DTMPs of all 30 districts have been completed.
      RuTIMS software is prepared and is being implemented in 9 districts.
      There is increase in value of project output indicators even though there is cancellation
       of 6 MUSD project cost because of low construction cost (low bidding through e-
       procurement system) and change in exchange rate of Dollars and Nepali Rupees.
      Target of dry season roads was reduced to 140 Km in 2013. The project feels that the
       target in dry season roads is also met considering this new value.
      Quality aspects were not omitted and there was no compromise on quality aspects from
       the districts and it was regularly monitored by the project. Although there were some
       queries regarding the quality of works completed in short period of time in a half day
       workshop in Kathmandu on 10 March, 2014, the sub projects in the districts have met
       the standard quality as specified which can be observed in the field and from the
       documentation (test results) also as compared to the low investment cost & other
       similar projects in the districts. The project feels that there has been great improvement
       in the quality of works in the districts through the intervention of RAIDP.
      The project feels that it may not be justifiable to rate as MS by considering only minor
       shortcoming as explained in para 61. There are appreciable major achievements gained
       by the project as compared to other similar infrastructural projects in our context.
      The reimbursement of IDA fund is almost complete within the grace period.
102. The factual information/corrections provided vide the comments of the Borrower have
   been duly incorporated in the final version of the ICR.

For the economic evaluation of the RAIDP, the project road works were classified into two
categories: (a) road works that improved a track or road to provide basic dry-season motorable
road access and (b) road works that provided a higher level of service than basic dry-season
road access, for example, by provision of an otta seal. All roads were subject to a Cost-
Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) and the roads that were improved to provide a low-cost
bituminous surface such as otta seal were subject to a Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) using the
World Bank’s Road Economic Decision Model (RED).
Based on the available budget and the rural population density in Nepal, a maximum CEA of
USD 100 per person was set as the threshold point above which road works would not be
financed. The costs were derived as the minimum for bringing each road from its existing
condition to one where it would be passable to motor vehicles in all seasons. The number of
persons was derived from the number of households in the zone of influence and an average
household size.
The RED model used in the CBA adopted a consumer surplus approach in which project
benefits were calculated based on road user cost savings. The minimum threshold for
economic viability was set at an Economic Rate of Return (ERR) of 12 percent. The
calculation of The Net Present Value was carried out over a period of 15 years at a discount
rate of 12 percent and an assumed future traffic growth rate of six percent per annum.
2      Ex-ante Results at Original Appraisal (May 2005)
The CEA was carried out for the road schemes that commenced in first year program of the
Original RAIDP Project. This comprised 24 roads in 13 districts of total length 602 kilometers.
An estimate population of 776,000 was served by these roads at an average investment cost of
USD 18,173 per km. The calculated CEAs fell in the range of USD 3.9 to 41.8 per person with
an overall average of USD 17.0 per person. These results were well within the threshold of
USD 100 per person. The full results are shown in Table A1.
The CBA was carried out for a representative sample comprising 15 first year program roads
with motorized traffic above 50 vehicles per day. For analysis purposes, it was assumed that
upgrading would be to sand seal in the Terai and otta seal in the hills. It was further assumed
that sand seal would increase the upgrading cost by USD 3,500 per km and Otta seal by USD
6,000 per km. The evaluation showed that this representative program would have an overall
ERR of 28 percent with a total Net Present Value of USD 6.8 million. It was calculated that the
ERR would fall to 23 percent with a 20 percent increase in investment costs, and to 22 percent
if benefits were 20 lower than estimated. The switching value analysis showed that for the
ERR to fall to 12 percent, costs would need to be 2.2 times higher, or benefits 47 percent lower
than estimated. This indicated a satisfactory economic justification for the roads meeting the
ERR criteria as well as for the overall representative program. The full results are shown in
Table A2.

3              Ex-ante Results at Additional Financing (November 2009)
As part of the preparation for the Additional Financing in 2009, a CEA was carried out for the
additional financing program road works comprising 60 road sections in 29 districts. The
average estimated beneficiary population was about 2,960 persons per kilometer. The CEA
indicated that (i) all roads had an investment lower than the threshold of USD 100 per person;
(ii) the average investment was USD 15.4 per person; and (iii) the average investment costs
were around USD 45,600 per km (USD 36,300 per km in the Terai and USD 53,400 per km in
the Hills). The full results are shown in Table A3.
Three roads that were to be improved under the Additional Financing to otta seal standard were
subject to a CBA using the RED Model. The analysis was similar to that carried out for the
Original Project but with updated construction and road user costs. The evaluation showed that
the three roads would have an overall ERR of 29 percent with a total Net Present Value of
USD 1.8 million. It was calculated that the ERR would fall to 25 percent with a 20 percent
increase in investment costs, and to 24 percent if benefits were 20 percent lower than
estimated. The switching value analysis shows that for the ERR to fall to 12 percent, costs
would need to be 2.2 times higher, or benefits 55 percent lower than estimated. These results
indicated a satisfactory economic justification for the investments. The full results are shown
in Table A4.

4        Ex-post Cost Effectiveness of RAIDP Roads (January 2014)
Towards the end of the project period, the CEA and CBA were repeated for some of the
project roads using actual construction costs and updated benefits data.
CEAs were carried out for program works in 24 roads in 13 districts under the Original Project
and for 55 roads in 29 districts under the Additional Financing. These were the same roads that
were analysed at the time of the appraisals. All the 24 roads analysed in the Original Project
had been implemented but only 55 of the 60 roads analysed for the Additional Financing had
been implemented. Therefore, there was a slight difference in the sample size between the ex-
ante and ex-post analyses.
The end of project population figures per kilometer for each road implemented were estimated
by projecting forwards the figures used at the Appraisal dates (2005 and 2009) using the
average population growth rate for the relevant district according to the censuses of 2001 and
2011. The population in most hill districts had decreased slightly while in most Terai districts
it had increased over the project period.
The estimated investment costs at appraisal were inflated to 2013 prices using the Construction
Materials Price Index. Consequently, the estimated investment costs for the Original Project in
2005 were inflated by approximately 80 percent and those at the time of the Additional
Financing in 2009 by about 20 percent. These adjusted investment cost estimates together with
the projected population figures per kilometer were used to establish an updated CEA figure
for each project road. This was compared with the CEA based on the actual project costs,
inflated to 2013 prices using the same construction price indices, divided by the population
figures projected to 2013.
For the project roads under the Original Project, the actual cost per head of all roads was well
below the set threshold of USD 100. Compared to the ex-ante estimates, 21 of the 24 roads
showed a lower actual cost per head. Three roads showed increases in cost per head ranging
from 2.8 to 6.9 percent. The actual cost per head for each road varied from USD 3.9 to 59.9.
The full results are shown in Table A5 below. The results are shown graphically in Chart 1.
The main reason that the end of project CEAs were lower than the original ex-ante estimates
was that the actual construction costs were significantly lower than the estimates.

For the project roads under the additional financing, all roads analysed had costs per head
lower than the project estimates. One road, Sandhikharka-Balkot-Tamghas Road, had an actual
cost per head of USD 123.6 i.e. above the USD 100 threshold. However, this was still below
the ex-ante estimated cost per head inflated to 2013 prices. The cost per head of the other roads
ranged widely from USD 1.3 to USD 80.6. The full results are show in Table A6 below and
graphically in Chart II.

As for the roads under the Original Project, the main reason that the end of project CEAs for
most roads were lower than the ex-ante estimates was that the actual construction costs were
significantly lower than the estimates.
5      Ex-post Cost Benefit Analyses of RAIDP Roads (January 2014)
Of the 15 roads for which a CBA was carried out at the commencement of the Original Project,
only 11 were completed to the required standard by December 2013. Similarly, of the 3 roads
analyzed at the commencement of the Additional Financing in 2009, only one had been
completed to the required standard by December 2013. Therefore, the CBA was only repeated
for the 13 roads from the original CBAs that had been completed.
Actual financial costs were converted to economic costs by applying standard conversion
factors (SCFs) that had been calculated during a Study for the Economic Assessment of Four
Sample roads under RAIDP in 2012. Consequently, an SCF of 0.76 was used to convert
financial costs to economic costs for upgrading a road to gravel standard. Similarly, an SCF of
0.84 was used to convert financial costs to economic costs for upgrading to otta seal. A similar
approach was used for future road maintenance costs.
The same mix of vehicles was used to calculate road user costs as that for the CBAs at
commencement. However, the economic costs were recalculated using updated data. During
2013, classified manual vehicle counts were carried out on the 11 completed roads. This data
was used to derive estimated Annual Average Daily Traffic on the Project roads. For the
economic analysis, a 6 percent annual traffic growth was assumed – the same as that used for
the original calculations.
A summary of the CBA results is shown in Table A7. The range of ERRs for the Original
Project roads was from 14.4 to 73.4 percent with an average of 44.9 percent. For the one road
analysed under the Additional Financing, the ERR was 15.7 percent.
The actual traffic volumes at completion were below that originally estimated for 7 roads,
above for 3 roads and the same for 1 road. However, the effect on the economic analysis of
lower traffic volumes was generally outweighed by the lower investment costs per kilometer.
Therefore, overall the CBAs based on actual costs and traffic showed marginally higher returns
than the original ex-ante calculations.

Annex 5. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

As part of the preparation of the ICR Report, a half-day workshop was held at the Annapurna
Hotel in Kathmandu on 10th March 2014 with a range of stakeholders including:
      DOLIDAR Staff
      DDC staff from some of the project districts
      Consultants who had worked on the project
      World Bank Kathmandu office staff who had worked on the project
The Director General of DOLIDAR opened the meeting. The ICR Team Leader then explained
that the purpose of the workshop was not that of an audit but a reflection and frank exchange
of views on the implementation of the project. The data on the project inputs and outputs was
already available. Therefore, what was required was to give the ICR Team a flavor of the
challenges faced during implementation and how these were overcome as well as comments on
the quality of the results.
This was followed by three presentations that set the scene for the subsequent discussions.
These were:
      Key Achievements and Challenges
      A presentation on the Capacity Building Component
      A presentation on the Safeguards Issues
The key issues that emerged during the subsequent discussions are summarized below:
a. Outcomes: Several participants commented on the easier travel now between villages and
   District Headquarters. In a number of cases, the number of trips had decreased because
   more services were available/accessible at village level reducing the need to travel to the
   District Headquarters.
b. Progress: There was general appreciation from the participants of the good rate of progress
   in the latter stages of the project such that the targets for road upgrading, which had been
   lagging, were eventually exceeded. It was noted that the overall project achievements were
   good despite the fact that there was no elected local district bodies throughout the project
   period.
c. Quality: There were numerous comments on the final quality of the roads improved under
   the project and the reasons for this. These included:
      The planned quality of the roads to be improved under RAIDP had not been properly
       communicated to the beneficiaries and this led to a degree of disappointment over the
       final quality of these roads compared to other Department of Roads projects;
      The upper limit of cost per kilometer set by the Bank resulted in poorer quality roads
       due to, in some cases, cost saving measures such as the omission of side drains,
       structures and surfacing;




                                              39
      It was questioned whether the increased rate of progress towards the end of the project
       period was achieved by compromising on quality;
      Inadequate field supervision meant the quality of works was not assured;
      Quality suffered due to very low bids of some winning contractors;
      DDC laboratories were not fully equipped and outside laboratories were not very
       effective;
      Low capacity of some consultants and contractors revealed weak capacity of the local
       industry.
   Against this, other participants felt that “the quality of work was good in comparison to
   work done in other roads in the district” and the “otta seal pavement was far better than
   expected in comparison to the earlier existing road condition hence people were satisfied
   with the pavement work”.
d. Procurement: Some DOLIDAR staff felt that the procurement challenges should be
   highlighted, particularly the delays in procurement at district level. However, there was
   general agreement amongst all the participants that the introduction of e-bidding had been a
   success although some DDC staff were concerned that the very keen bids received had
   sometimes led to a reduction in the quality of work carried out (see above). A number of
   DDC staff remarked on the difficulty of taking action against non-performing contractors.
e. Capacity Building: The DG of DOLIDAR noted that RAIDP was the first big project in
   DOLIDAR requiring various activities like IEE, EIA, and procurement of
   consultants/contractors and resulted in on the job training to department staff. With such on
   the job training on this project, another large project from ADB was successfully
   completed: Also as a result of capacity building, DOLIDAR is taking up the SNRTP $100
   million project. In addition, he noted that the DDCs were active for the first time in
   managing the implementation of a project of this magnitude and gained valuable
   experience. Several participants reflected on the hiring of fresh graduates under the project
   to support the DDCs. Despite the wider benefits of this, DDC staff expressed their need for
   more experienced staff at district level.
f. Road Maintenance: The lack of proper maintenance was noted as a challenge faced by the
   project. Some DDC participants felt that the sustainability of the road improvements was
   questionable due to the low standard of road construction. One DTO felt that the
   maintenance of otta seal by pre-mix carpet will be costly.
g. Safeguards: Participants felt that more time should be allowed for land deed transfers to
   allow for the process required and possible delays due to budget constraints. Some felt that
   the environmental requirements should be more flexible. Several participants remarked on
   the environmental problems caused by the use of heavy equipment to widen narrow road
   tracks particularly where the approach of stage construction was not adopted. The
   importance of ownership of Environmental Management Plans by the DDC/DTO was also
   emphasized.
h. Impact Study: The opinion was expressed that the Baseline survey not done properly. It
   was felt that this had less priority by the Bank and there were no specific guidelines from
   the Bank. A logical framework should have been there with fixed indicators. An


                                              40
   assessment of beneficiaries before road construction should have been carried out as well
   as a mid-term evaluation.
i. Community Infrastructure: Community infrastructure projects were not fully approved
   and implemented as requested by the communities and more income generation activities
   were needed for better impact.
j. General: Despite the comments given above, there was general agreement amongst all the
   participants that RAIDP had been one of the most successful projects carried out on the
   district road system to date.

II     INTRODUCTION
Background: In August 2005, the World Bank approved a full grant of US$ 32 million
(original finance) towards the Rural Access Improvement and Decentralization Project
(RAIDP) and in December 2009 the World Bank approved a grant and credit of US$ 45
million (additional finance).

Project Objectives, Outcomes and Indicators1: See footnote.
Project Districts: During the first (original) phase 20 project districts were grouped into four
clusters and 10 more districts were included during Additional Financing Phase. The trail
bridge construction sub-component was implemented in 58 districts, 30 from RAIDP road
districts and 28 other non-roads served districts.
Implementation Arrangements: DOLIDAR, under the MOFALD, is the main central level
implementing agency for the project execution. A central Project Coordination Unit (PCU)
was established at Kathmandu to implement/ coordinate the project activities with a project
coordinator and full-fledged administration, technical, and financial staff from GoN side. The
PCU coordinated with the MOFALD, DOLIDAR, all the related 30 DDCs/ DTOs, and the
Bank staff for implementation of project.
The participating DDCs/ DTOs were responsible for planning, design, and procuring activities
related to project’s civil works components and community infrastructures. To support the
DDCs/ DTOs in technical and safeguard issues the project employed number of individual
consultants namely Planning and Design Engineer (PDE) for technical, Social Development
Consultant (SDC) for safeguard issues, and Environmental specialists along with cluster level
environmental Expert (CLE) for environmental safeguard.
In case of dry season roads PCU employed a separate design and supervision consultants
namely M/s. BDA - GEOCE JV and M/s. IDRS - Soil Test JV for original phase and M/s.
SILT-ERMC JV for additional financing phase. These consultant’s service was procured,
monitored and supervised by the PCU
District Road Coordination Committee (DRCC) was formed at district level for coordination
and to make necessary decision. DRCC comprises of LDO, DTO, representatives of political
parties of the district and district chiefs of line agencies. Village Road Coordination
Committees (VRCC) was formed along each VDCs of the road corridor to coordinate and
manage on project related issues. Local Road User Committees (LRUC) was formed to each
road to facilitate, coordinate and manage the road works.
III    ASSESSMENT OF IMPLEMENTATION EFFECTIVENESS AND OUTCOMES
The Project performed to achieve its oveall Project Development Objectives (PDO) which was
"Residents of participating districts utilize improved rural transport infrastructure and
services and benefit from enhanced access to social and economic opportunities".

A      Component-Wise Achievement

 The Project Objectives, Outcomes and Indicators are identical to the information given in the main
ICR text and, hence, not repeated here.



                                                43
A.1    Rural Transport Infrastructure (RTI) Component
a) All Weather Road Sub-Component: In this sub-component existing dry-season roads
were upgraded to all-weather standard. All the candidate roads were subjected to the technical,
social and environmental screening. During original phase 800 km dry season roads were
targeted to upgrade to all weather roads.
During Additional Financing phase, total target of all-weather roads revised to 1,165 km. Later
in restructuring on November 2013 the total target was revised to be 1,350 km. The main
reason for increase in the target length was due to savings from the CBAS component and
competitive bidding in the contracts. In overall project period the length of achieved upgraded
road is 1,654 km which is even higher than the revised target.
b) Dry Season Road Sub-Component: In this sub-component existing rural trails and tracks
were upgraded to dry-season road standard in remote hill districts. Though the original target
was 200 km it was revised to 211 km in Additional Financing phase and further revised to 140
km while restructuring in November 2013. The revision to reduce the target was mainly due to
delay in procurement of services of the consultant which subsequently delayed the survey and
design activities. Under the overall project period total 141 kms of dry season road in eight hill
districts has been upgraded from existing trail to dry season road.
c) Rural Road Maintenance Sub-Component: As per original financing the project districts
carried out road maintenance (routine and recurrent) of 3,500 km of maintainable rural roads.
The source of funding the road maintenance was from district’s own resources and could
include central government block grant and Roads Board Nepal. In the additional financing
this target was increased to 4,500 km and further it was made necessary that all project districts
allocate and spend a minimum of 20% of the project costs for the maintenance of district roads
from their own resources.
To improve the planning and implementation of maintenance and to establish the road asset
management system, project developed Road Rural Transport Information Management
System Consultant (RuTMS).
Piloting length person system for executing routine maintenance works has been started with
the technical support from ILO in three districts.
d) Community Infrastructure Sub-Component: This is demand driven subcomponent.
Grants to the communities have been provided for construction, repair and improvement of
small scale infrastructure sub-projects identified by the proponent communities. Recipient
communities also contribute partially-paid labor, local materials and other kind contribution. In
all, 584 community infrastructure works have been taken up with a total cost of NPR261
million.
e) Trail Bridge Sub-Component: Construction of 350 short span trail bridges was one of the
main components of the project’s original phase where SDC was also supposed to provide
parallel financing of 2.1 million USD. In the preparation of additional financing the Trail
bridge sub-component of the project was agreed to be implemented under the Government’s
SWAp approach. As per the project reporting the total numbers of bridges constructed under
project financing is 745 of which 164 was fully financed and 581 were financed for fabrication
of steel parts. These trail bridges were spread over 58 districts.



                                               44
f) River Crossing Structures Sub-Component: This sub-component of river crossing
structures (under the Rural Transport Infrastructures) was added during additional financing
mainly to enhance accessibility during rainy season. The project target was ten river crossing
structures based on priority plan for the project districts. Due to high demand from the project
districts seventeen river crossing structures were started in twelve project districts. Almost all
the bridges are RCC beam having span varying from 15 to 40 m (total length 385 m). Among
them total twelve bridges are reported to be completed by end of the project period.
A.2    Capacity Building and Advisory Services Sub-Component (CBAS)

a) Training sub-component: During the project period the project conducted 28 training in 6
major disciplines to build the capacity DDC, DTO, DOLIDAR and the project. Altogether 657
officials were trained. Besides the training within Nepal the project also supported
international training and observation visit to the officials. Altogether, 59 officials were
supported to participate in 8 international training and observation visit.
b) Institutional Strengthening sub-component:
b.1)Technical Assistance and Advisory Services: Project support consultant’s (PSC) team
and few additional experts were hired at the central level PCU as a Technical and Advisory
Support to plan and implement the project. In addition, field based technical experts and
support staff (SPDE, SSDC, PDE, SDC, EC) were hired and assigned to each DDC/DTOs and
cluster.91 field based experts/consultants were hired and deputed for 30 project districts to
implement their programs. Some additional Lab technicians were also hired to support
operation of district’s laboratory and to conduct on the job training to the district lab
technicians.
b.2) Institutional Strengthening and Action Plan of DOLIDAR: In the original financing
phase, the Institutional Strengthening Action Plan (ISAP) of DOLIDAR was being considered
to be supported by the project. In the additional financing the scope of this subcomponent was
limited to developing IT based data system within DOLIDAR and the DDCs including road
asset management system, and some support to the ISAP of DOLIDAR.
Under this subcomponent the following were achieved during the project period:
    Improved Financial Management Information System (FMIS), a software based on
       Microsoft Access is prepared and operated at project level assumes to serve as financial
       data bank of the project. Financial data are received from districts and fiscal report is
       prepared in RAIDP. This system is yet to internalize in DOLIDAR.
    Final Report on LID Strategic Action Plan has been approved by the Ministry and
       endorsed by DOLIDAR;
    Development of implementation of e-bidding system in DOLIDAR, 74 DDCs and 17
       municipalities.
    Developed Rural Transport Infrastructure Management System (RuTIMS) to be used as
       asset management system which also consists of planning tools, rate analysis, contract
       management, and ARMP.
    Establishment and operation of Material Testing Laboratory in all project districts.
c) Planning: Under the project implementation GIS based DTMPs has been prepared for all
the 30 project districts. These DTMPs were prepared as per DTMP guidelines 2010.



                                               45
d) Rural Transport Services Study and Policy Development: A major accomplishment of
this sub-component was that the project conducted the planned “Rural Transport Services
Study and Policy Development” and a report was prepared in September 2011.
e) Socioeconomic Impact Monitoring Study: Socioeconomic base line studies for the
districts under original financing as well as additional financing were conducted to fix the base
data for impact studies. Two socioeconomic impact studies were carried out one after
completion of original financing completion date (in year 2011) and another near completion
of additional financing date (in end of year 2013). It is to be noted that there will be another
impact evaluation study to be carried out after 2 to 3 years after closing of project i.e.:
tentatively in year 2016. This impact study shall be carried out by the DOLIDAR and the study
outcomes shall be shared with the Bank.
f) Implementation Support: Under this subcomponent a team of Project Support Consultant
and individual experts were hired to support the centre level PCU. A number of additional
individual consultants like S/PDEs, S/SDCs, ECs, NGOs were hired to support the DDCs/
DTOs at district level implementation support. In case of dry season roads a separate
consultant’s teams were hired for the necessary survey, design, and supervision of works being
implemented through community contracts. For implementation support 30 supervision
vehicles and 60 motorcycles are provided to the project districts. Necessary logistic support for
day to day works like computer, printer, photocopy were also provided to enhance the
efficiency as well as to support the E-bidding being introduced in project’s procurement. To
improve the quality assurance and control in the project works, various lab equipment and
accessories were also provided to project districts to establish and operate the laboratory

B      Governance and Accountability Action Plan (GAAP)
With an objective to contribute in strengthening of governance mechanisms in the rural road
sector and increase in the demand for transparency and accountability at the local government
level the project used specific GAAP approach.

C      Social and Environmental Safeguard
a) Social Safeguard: All social safeguard activities have been completed in time, including
land transfers, implementation of Voluntary Land Donation Impact Mitigation Plans
(VDIMPs), Vulnerable Community Development Plans (VCDPs) and Remedial Action Plan
(RAP) for all schemes under the original as well as additional financing. The project as a good
practice provided incentive for voluntary land donation and all those donating land more than
10% of their land holding were compensated for the extent of land donated beyond 10% of
their holding. The transfer of donated land titles has been completed for 97.1% under
additional financing primarily due to non-availability of land owners and few disputed cases.
Based on the experience of this project DOLIDAR is preparing sector wide ESMF that will be
internalized for all projects under DOLIDAR.
Public Consultation and Disclosure: The Environmental and Social Management Framework
of RAIDP has provisions of consultation with project affected peoples and disclosure of the
documents through LRUC/VRCC about the proposed actions. Project awarded letter of
appreciation to all land donor (11,866) and displayed their names in public places including
offices of DDC and VDCs of the project area. The project affected people, local communities



                                               46
and user committees were consulted during the preparation and implementation phases of a
subproject.
Grievance Management: Grievances were redressed by a Grievance Hearing Committee
(GHC) formed in each project district. The project received 921 grievances across all the
project districts of which total cases were satisfactorily resolved. A few grievances were
remaining to resolve because of the delay in implementation of VCDPs which resolved after
VCDP training. The ICT based grievance redress mechanism will be internalized for all
DOLIDAR projects.
Social Safeguard Management Capacity: A Social Development Expert (SDE) Twenty Social
Development Consultants (SDC) and 10 Senior Social Development Consultants (SSDCs)
were hired to support RAIDP in the management of social safeguards. PCU further recruited
social mobilisers (SM) in all the districts. These appointments helped project in mobilizing the
community for land donation, coordination with line departments and land transfer,
preparation of VDIMPs and VCDPs.
Monitoring and Supervision: The project has conducted first round CBPM of 152 sub-
projects under construction, 136 second round CBPM, and 103 third round CBPM. The CBPM
reports show that almost all social issues are recorded and addressed properly according to the
principles described in the ESMF of the project.
In addition, HELVETAS under Partnership for Transparency Fund (PTF) has hired the
services of NGOs to strengthen the capacity of Community-based Organizations or CBOs
(such as LRUC and VRCC) for monitoring civil works and contracts process under RAIDP
and to inform the concerned agencies of their grievances.
Monetization of the donated land and Community role and contribution in community
infrastructure component (as of October, 2013): The community has donated 2,178,491sqm
of land for the purpose of roads. Given the prevailing market rate, the value of land donated
stands at NPR 5630 million (USD 56.30 million). The project however provided NPR 67.40
million (USD 0.67 million) as assistance
The community has contributed 37% in cash / labour towards community infrastructures
created under the project. The project created 237 community assets spending NPRs 217.56
million (USD 2.18 million) of which community’s contribution was NPR 58.98 million (USD
0.59 million).
Skill Level Training to project affected people as per VCDP: Livelihood Enhancement
Training at local level was conducted to 1058 participants in 167 events; the vulnerable people
were defined as SPAFs, women headed households, Dalits and marginalized groups and poor
and designed skill development and income generation training as per the discussion with the
groups at local level. Areas covered were:
   Skill development training such as , driving, anvil work, mechanics, hair cutting, plumbing,
    masonry, carpentry, handicrafts, sewing, etc.
   Income generation training such as micro-enterprise, vegetable production, poultry,
    piggery, etc.
   Safe motherhood, women empowerment, leadership, health and hygiene,
   Nursery establishment, plantation of fruits and fodder and so on, and
   Other appropriate skill development and vocation training as per the need of the people


                                              47
b) Environmental Safeguard: Environmental Screening (ES) and Environmental Management
Plan (EMP) of 145 (all weather) and 7 (dry season) road subprojects and bridges in 30 Terai
and Hill districts were prepared and the EMP activities are implemented either by contractor or
by user committees. The study of Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) was also
undertaken for 3 different road sub project while it was noticed that the road passes through
buffer zone area. Similarly, 5 improved bio-engineering site plan including higher risk roads, 1
improved Quarry site plan, 7 improved tipping site plan were prepared, approved and taken
into implementation. Furthermore, the outstanding issues (not addressed in EMP) and
identified during construction of road sub project were addressed by preparing EMP
documents and was prepared and implemented for 37 road sub projects of 19 districts. Final
environmental status reports of all road sub projects (145 all weather and 7 dry season) were
prepared after the sub-project was issued with the letter for DLP. Altogether 59 orientation and
awareness programs for DTO personnel, workers, users and staffs were given on
environmental safeguard issues. Some of the EMP works of 32 road sub projects of 19 districts
are remained and Government has agreed to continue the remaining work even after 31st Dec
2014.

D         Impact Study and Results Framework
The impact study report (2012) for the roads under Original financing showed that the
upgrading of RAIDP roads has reduced the travel time to reach the nearest town and social
amenities. Similarly, travel behavior of the beneficiaries has changed considerably due to
easier access to work place and nearest town.
Traffic volume also increased in most of the RAIDP roads compare to baseline data. Overall
growth of social amenities in the project area is 12 percent and due to road upgrading works
the people have got timely treatment in case of the emergency.
Significant positive impact has been also reported in agriculture sector. Though the reasons for
increase in production could be several such as timely monsoon rain, easy access to
agricultural inputs, improvement of irrigation facilities but improvement of market access
through project roads may have a significant effect.
According to the GIS study the number of population increments in hill districts (within 4 hour
accessibility) due to project road improvement works is found to be 16.52 percent. The
percentage increases in people’s accessibility under original and additionally financed hill
districts are 14.12 % and 21.19 %, respectively. Similarly the total population increase within 2
hour accessibility in Terai district is calculated to be 2.36 percent. The percentage increments
in people’s accessibility under original and additionally financed Terai district are 1.69 % and
4.02 % respectively.
Results Framework2

IV        KEY FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOME
Procedural Delays: During the initial stage, design and procurement was slow and hence a
few contracts received delayed approval for the implementation. Delays were experienced in

2
    The Results Framework is as reported elsewhere in the ICR Report and is not repeated here.



                                                    48
receiving the bid evaluation reports from districts resulting in necessity of extension of bid
validity period as well as cancellation of bids. Some of the road sub-projects which were in
influence of national park and reserve forest were delayed due to need for environmental
compliance. Necessary environmental studies and, approval process took quite long time and
resulted in delay implementation.
Fund Release: Project funds/ budget were not released on time due to delays in approval of
national budget especially in year 2013 when the project works at high and the lack of budget
affected progress of works. Once the budget is sent to respective DDCs the delegation of
budgetary authority for RAIDP works from DDC to DTO also took time as well as resulted in
some conflict among the DDC and DTO.
Planning and Design: Selection, survey and design of some of the road sub-projects and river
crossing structures was delayed such that most of the implementation was accumulated to the
last two fiscal years 2011/12 and 2012/13, respectively. The Dry season road output was much
affected due to substantial delay in selection of consultant for survey, design and supervision.
Considering the monsoon up to September and followed by annual festivals (Dashain/Tihar) in
October/ November, national election, there was almost no working period when the project
closed at end of December 2013.
Procurement: The weak procurement management of the districts because of the under
capacity and ignorance of the officials towards the time limit for the procurement activities
have considerably delayed the project implementation. Also it is reported that due to delay in
the bid evaluation report preparation and approval 15 contracts could not be awarded near end
of the project which were to be taken in the next phase.
Implementation and Supervision: Non availability of quarry site for sub-base material,
mostly due to restriction of forest offices or DDCs delayed sub-base laying work. Lack of
adequate monitoring and supervision for implementation, quality assurance and day to day
contract management by the officials of DDC/DTOs were also major factors affecting
implementation of project. Also, the officials of DTO being responsible for many other district
level projects and at the same time non-fulfillment of all technical posts in DTO office affected
the implementation of project activities. Considering the physical distance of road sub-project
and bridge sites the necessary vehicular support for effective supervision were noticed to be
insufficient in the districts.
Conflict and Insurgency: Though the conflict created by Maoist ended during initial phase of
project, local conflicts continued due to identity crises. The most affected were Terai districts
where Madhes Andolan took flight and continued for years. One of the engineers from
DOLIDAR was killed by armed group of Terai while he was on duty in one of the training
program under RAIDP. At one point all the project activities/ works were suspended in Terai
districts that were affected by Madhes Andolan. Conflict among the groups and lack of elected
local government also caused a lot of uncertainties and delay in the public service delivery.
Governance: Conflicts and insurgency in the project districts highly affected good governance.
In addition the lack of elected local body at the local level also created environment for
degradation of good governance. In many districts the planned stakeholder mobilization and
participation were not possible as envisioned in the project preparation.




                                               49
Timely fulfillment of the necessary posts in the DDC/ DTO offices was seen a major problem
due to threats from the local groups. Very frequent transfer of project staffs, LDO, and DTO
chiefs in the project districts affected highly in implementing the project activities not only
Terai districts but also in the hill districts. In some cases financial audit also could not take
place in a few Terai districts. In year 2012/2013, it is worth to note that the Ministry and CIAA
took action and even filed cases against district staff of 4 Terai districts for misappropriation of
DDC funds.


V      ASSESSMENT OF GOVERNMENT OF NEPAL AND WORLD BANK
       PERFORMANCE
Performance of Government of Nepal: Government of Nepal as a borrower and recipient
and DOLIDAR as an Executing Agency put its effort to function smoothly in implementing
the RAIDP and to achieve the objective set for the project. RAIDP was a major project of
DOLIDAR funded by IDA in rural transport sector. On GON side, release of fund to the
project from Ministry of Finance was delayed due to budget approval process in a few fiscal
years. This problem was not for RADIP alone, but a national problem. The MoFALD,
DOLIDAR and the PCU remained engaged in coordinated manner with the project throughout
and provided assistance and inputs as were required. Senior members of the Ministry
participated in key decision meetings (including during the regular Review Missions) and
senior staff within DOLIDAR maintained a close interest in the project progress. Staffing
levels within the PCU were maintained throughout the project and the rotation of staff was not
a major concern.
GoN Staffing at the District level was moderately satisfactory and was to some extent
complicated by the lack of officially constituted local bodies. The project required the
establishment of a RAIDP Units fully deputed by one dedicated engineer in each District,
within the DTO. For sometimes in some districts the DTOs posts were vacant which resulted
delays in implementation. Project hired engineers, social development consultants,
environmental experts and central level experts/consultants and supported DTOs in the
planning and implementation of project components. Projects coordinators during 2005 to
2008 of original phase were transferred frequently (four persons). There was lack of
coordination between ministry of environment and ministry of federal affairs and local
development resulting approval and management of quarry sites problematic ultimately
construction work was delayed and complicated. Approval of environmental report (IEEs)
from the concerned ministry took lots of time which affected the construction of sub projects
timely. At the end of the project, government of Nepal accepted it as a model project in rural
transport sector.
Performance of the World Bank: Management of the Project within WB was delegated to
the Nepal Resident Mission (NRM). The World Bank remained cooperative and supportive for
the implementation of RAIDP. Regular six-monthly Review Missions were held, throughout
the project implementation period. Routine contact was maintained – and regular meetings
held – with the project coordination unit (PCU) in Kathmandu and with adequate field visits
also whenever necessary and issues were resolved. Sometimes, there was higher intervention
from bank side in some cases.



                                                50
More than fifteen Review Missions were held, from 2005 and the final mission in November
2013. A Mid-Term Review was conducted in May 2009, which was the basis for the
Additional Financing. Each mission included field visits to a number of Project Districts to
view progress at first hand and to discuss issues and problems with the implementing agencies,
local affected populations and contractors. The bank also played positive role while approving
the budget and program form MoF, NPC, MFALD and transferring it to districts in close
coordination with the concerned authorities. Reimbursement of withdrawal application was
done timely after getting some clarification (if felt).
WB clearance and concurrence was required at a number of key stages during the project
implementation process. Specifically, WB’s prior review and NoLs for DPRs, bid evaluation
and safeguarding processes were necessary in respect of each of the Rural Road Sub-
Components and these approvals were generally received in a timely manner with only few
exceptions and did not lead to any disruptions or delays to the implementation process.
However, WB agreed for post review of most of these processes in the AF, keeping in view the
enhanced capacity of PCU.
The project could not complete 21 sub projects by 31, December, 2013 and they have to be
taken by GoN. If project time extension of about 3 month could be done, these sub projects
might have completed.
The World Bank's follow up and cooperation was instrumental in achieving its target and
project objectives. The World Bank also initiated its new follow up project - Strengthening
National Program for Rural Transport (SNPRT) and completed the formal negotiation and
Board approval. The overall performance of the bank is found satisfactory from the result of
successful implementation of RAIDP ultimately resulting in the development of a similar
project (SNRTP) with increased volume of investment.


VI     LESSONS LEARNT
Social Safeguard: All roads to upgrade under additional finance are existing roads and caused
minimum negative social impact. Hence, the project did not displace a single individual but
provided assistance, livelihood enhancement allowance and skill development and income
generation training to the affected people. Moreover, the good thing the project has done is
transfer of land ownership that already donated to the road and exempted people from the land
tax which is appreciated by the people. The good practices or lessons learnt are listed as
follows:
1. Preparation of VDIMP: Preparation of VDIMP is a good practice which addresses the
impacts of voluntary donation of land by providing assistance and land transfer incentives to
the affected people.
2. Preparation of VCDP: Preparation of VCDP is accepted by locals as a good practice
because it helped 1257 SPAFs and vulnerable individuals by offering them income generations
and skill development trainings. Almost all participants of the training are gaining their
livelihood by utilizing the skills and knowledge of the training.
3. Recognition to Land Donors: another good practice of RAIDP is recognition to land
donors by offering them letter of appreciation and keeping their names in the hoarding board.



                                             51
4. Definition of Impact Corridor (CoI): RAIDP defines CoI in the beginning of a subproject
selection. In the presence of an engineer of District Technical Office, the locals define impact
corridor of the road and therefore the process of land donation begins of the CoI only.
However, the project informs the locals about restriction of the construction of permanent
structure in RoW. Due to the definition of CoI, the land affected people are ready to donate the
land voluntarily. As a result, 98 percent land donors (except absentee) have transferred the land
ownership on time.
5. Exemption from the Land Tax: The locals were paying the tax of the land for the existing
land. However, the project has completed the legal process of land ownership transfer to GoN.
As a result, the locals who have donated land to the road long time back are exempt from the
land tax now.
6. Roads shown in cadastral maps: All the road subprojects upgraded and constructed by
RAIDP has now shown in cadastral maps after completion of the land ownership transfer.
Moreover, 217.8 ha lands received by GoN by voluntary donation.
7. Budget for land Transfer: During implementation, the budget for land ownership transfer
and VDIMP implementation was not sufficient. Adequate budget for land transfer activities,
VDIMP implementation and recruitment of social mobilizers should be allocated for future
projects so that the coordination of land transferring task could be done effectively.
8. Coordination of land transfer process: The land transfer process from the land revenue
office and survey office at district and field level was found very difficult and sometimes
became a burden to all the stakeholders. For effective coordination among the land revenue
office and land survey office, it is recommended to have a central level coordination committee
which could help the project in transferring land ownership more effectively.
9. Community Infrastructures (CI) supporting local participation: Provision of CIs has been
found to be very effective tools to get support from the community which ultimately enhances
participation of local users while implementing main components of the project.
Environmental Safeguard: Participation of local people in implementation of environmental
safeguard activities is found effective due to involvement of local people in each activity of
road subproject. The present ESMF document needs to be reviewed and amended based on the
findings of the project implementation (RAIDP-Environmental Safeguard Completion Report,
2014).
Planning, implementation and supervision of environmental safeguard activities could not be
highly effective due to lack of experiences and capacity of DDC/DTO as well as DOLIDAR
since there is no central Environmental and Social Unit. Compliance monitoring needs to be
frequent and strengthened to improve the implementation of EMPs and IEEs.
Awareness raising programs and discussions on environmental safeguard was found to be
effective for enhancing precautionary measures. Frequent supervision by the field level staff
and compliance monitoring from Department and Ministry is essential to improve the
implementation.
Environmental Friendly Road Construction in dry season roads: Participatory approach of
roads construction helped in generating local employment which ultimately enhanced the local
economy. Ownership feeling was developed among local communities that empowered them
which could help in effective operation and maintenance of the completed roads. Environment-

friendly approach of road construction helps to adopt Indigenous technologies for managing
environmental impacts during road construction.
Local people have learned the efficient method and safe work practices in construction.
Orientation on environmental safeguard and construction safety to local people became very
important tool for effective implementation of the Concept.
Institutional Strengthening: Though there were no elected local bodies in the districts, effort
was made to implement the sub-projects by utilizing the existing and available mechanism in
district through the DDCs/DTOs. Close consultation was made and a decision making
mechanism was established with the local political parties which had positive role in planning,
execution and monitoring.
E-bidding system was introduced at local level to prevent the collusion among the bidders,
which enhanced transparency and created environment for open competition. It also improved
the capacity of DOLIDAR, RAIDP PCU and DDCs in managing the procurement and contract
management system. Still the local level implementing agency’s capacity in procurement and
contract management in terms of meeting the prescribed time and managing contract records
needs improvement.
Maintenance Directive of DOLIDAR is not fully followed for planning and implementation of
maintenance. Most of the DTOs are unaware and or not following the Annual Road
Maintenance Plans (ARMP) Guideline.
Capacity enhancement of the DDCs/DTOs and project using the individual consultant’s
support is questionable in context of sustainability. No convincing indication has been
perceived to assure sustainability of the enhanced capacity in absence of the project supported
consultants. Rather sustainability on institutional part lies on DDC/DTOs capacity to procure
and manage the service, works and goods.
Social mobilizers need to be trained on the ESMF requirements and to be mobilized by the
DTO/DDCs at the beginning stage of implementation. Similarly, members of Grievance
Handling Committees need to be trained at initial stage of the project.
Quality Control: Material Testing Lab has been widely accepted and established in all
districts. But still commitment of adequate resources from DDCs is required to make it fully
functional. Only a few contractors established material testing laboratory at field. When field
level laboratory from the contractors' side is required, then the contract needs to include the
necessary cost to establish such labs.
Regular supervision needs to be improved from the DDC/ DTO to assure the quality of works.
Additional field level supervisors should have been recruited at local level to overcome such
deficiencies. A regular monitoring on the contractor’s technical/ managerial personnel is
required to assure the quality and progress of implemented work.
It is recommended to strictly verify the compliance and or control testing of materials and
works implemented by the contractor. Timely approval or rejection of materials and works to
be followed by the engineer in charge is essential to get the required quality output. Quality
Assurance Plans are to be prepared, approved, followed, and monitored to assure the quality of
materials and works. Training on quality assurance plan is also felt necessary for district and
field level staff.

Technical Audit: Introduction of technical audit in the implementation stage through NVC
has been good experience among the local as well as central level implementing agencies.
Technical audit process and the reports on non-conformation of various subprojects has
initiated discussions on the specification, design, quality of implementation, variation in cost
and time, payments, and contract management issues. This needs to continue and if possible, a
separate technical audit for designs and procurement process also needs to be introduced to
enhance the value of works. All the Technical Audit reports have indicated the weaknesses in
construction supervision and hence the major cause for poor quality works and workmanship,
particularly the structural works.
Low Cost Sealing (Otta/Sand Seal): Use of Otta Seal as low cost sealing over the sub-base
has been found to enhance the mobility of traffic in rural roads. It reduces maintenance cost
and life cycle cost compared to gravel surface. It provides reliable and effective service
delivery. It preserves the assets (particularly surfacing materials e.g. gravel). It helps in
productive gains on adjoining agricultural lands. It reduces the adverse effects, especially the
dust pollution on adjoining residential properties.
However, it is also noted that otta seal surface over the sub base course has been found to be
not effective where heavy trucks ply and when the grade is high in hill roads. Proper water
management is very essential to protect the deterioration of surface.
People have the perception of Otta Seal as standard black top bituminous pavement and expect
the same performance. Whereas, it is only low cost measure to improve the gravel surface for
the reason mentioned above. Due to this perception, people have generated negative feeling,
where otta seal surface is damaged due to use of heavy trucks. So in cases where there is
potential for generation of truck traffic due to quarry operation or road serving as shortest by
pass road it is recommended to design the pavement thickness, accordingly.
Maintenance: Most of the roads do not have systematic maintenance mechanism in place.
Implementation of an effective maintenance system by DDCs/ DTOs in rural roads, do not
exist except in roads where the project piloted length person system using technical assistance
from ILO. The maintenance works at present are in ad-hoc basis. When the road is already
damaged, then maintenance works are done, not to prevent the potential damage in future.
DOLIDAR Maintenance Directives is not followed properly. ARMP introduced by RBN to
make the maintenance operational is not followed fully.
On the basis of past experiences of Department of Roads in strategic roads and few pilot length
persons in rural roads, similar approach could be followed for routine/recurrent maintenance of
rural roads. However it is to be noted that, now DOR length persons have formed large unions
and turned to be a similar to regular government staffs to some extent. Whereas field works in
the site is expected to be based on output and result basis. As there is already LRUCs for each
road involving the LRUCs, managing and carrying out maintenance work could be done
through these committees. Local user’s group does know the need for regular maintenance but
lacks in the required resources and involvement in maintenance. Maintenance contract could
be piloted in some rural roads generating high traffic volume and hence the fund on trial basis.
