Some lessons learned included: adequate and\n            effective maintenance of infrastructure is the major\n            challenge to sustaining the project benefits. The financial\n            cost per kilometer of works should not be constrained by a\n            specific ceiling when there are sound technical reasons for\n            higher investments that remain economically viable. District\n            development committees (DDCs) need support in the\n            preparation and management of contracts that ensures\n            ownership and accountability. In a rural infrastructure\n            project spread across a wide geographical area,\n            institutional strengthening, especially at the lower rungs\n            of government such as DDCs, requires not only significantly\n            more resources and attention but also needs to be tackled\n            early to be able to better assess the actual improvements achieved."}, "docdt": "2014-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
