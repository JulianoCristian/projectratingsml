The review had three\n            objectives: (i) to review the progress in achieving the\n            project\u0092s intended results; (ii) to identify the key\n            implementation issues and actions that are necessary for\n            satisfactory project implementation; (iii) to kick-start the\n            process of orderly project completion including the\n            initiation of an Implementation Completion and Results (ICR)\n            report. The Team has visited a number of RAIDP roadwork\n            sites to briefly assess the roadwork quality and contracts\u0092\n            implementation status. This review is particularly\n            significant as it is potentially the penultimate review that\n            the Bank will carry out for RAIDP. This Aide Memoire\n            summarizes the main review findings, meeting decisions,\n            agreements reached, and recommendations made. It also\n            reflects discussions that took place at a wrap-up meeting\n            held on September 20, 2013 at the Ministry of Federal\n            Affairs and Local Development (MoFALD). As per the World\n            Bank\u0092s Access to Information Policy and the wrap up meeting\n            decision, this Aide Memoire will be classified as a public document."}, "docdt": "2013-09-18T00:00:00Z"}
