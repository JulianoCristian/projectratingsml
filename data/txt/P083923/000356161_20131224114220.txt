                                        Implementation Review
                                         September 9-18, 2013
                                          AIDE MEMOIRE

I.     Introduction and Acknowledgments
1.     A World Bank team1 (Annex 1a provides a team members’ list) carried out an implementation
review of the Rural Access Improvement and Decentralization Project (RAIDP) during September 9-
18, 2013. The review had three objectives: (i) to review the progress in achieving the project’s
intended results; (ii) to identify the key implementation issues and actions that are necessary for
satisfactory project implementation; (iii) to kick-start the process of orderly project completion
including the initiation of an Implementation Completion and Results (ICR) report. The Team has
visited a number of RAIDP roadwork sites to briefly assess the roadwork quality and contracts’
implementation status. This review is particularly significant as it is potentially the penultimate
review that the Bank will carry out for RAIDP.
2.     The Team would like to thank the Government of Nepal (GON) for the hospitality extended to
it, especially by counterpart agencies and officials (Annex 1b provide the list of persons met). This
Aide Memoire summarizes the main review findings, meeting decisions, agreements reached, and
recommendations made. It also reflects discussions that took place at a wrap-up meeting held on
September 20, 2013 at the Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development (MoFALD). As per
the World Bank’s Access to Information Policy and the wrap up meeting decision, this Aide Memoire
will be classified as a public document.

III. Achievement of Development Objectives Status
3.     The progress towards achieving the Project Development Objectives (PDO) remains
“moderately satisfactory.” Results of an impact study show that the project has surpassed targets in
the original 20 project districts (see Annex 2). The PCU has also completed baseline data collection
activities in new districts taken up under the additional financing. The target date for study
completion is mid-December, 2013. Based on initial findings and the Team’s estimates, RAIDP
appears likely to achieve its objectives.

    As of September 4, 2013

                                                                                                           1
IV. Current Implementation Status
Rural Transport Infrastructure Component
4.      The overall rating of this component has been judged as “moderately satisfactory”.
5.    The project is on track to meet its target for all-season roads. RAIDP has upgraded 1,322km
against a revised target of 1,350km. Funds for the increased length will be covered from prior savings
under previous contracts. The Bank is restructuring the project to accommodate these changes.
6.    The project’s revised target of 140 km of dry-season roads looks achievable. So far the project
completed approximately 131km (92%) of this target. Annex 3 provides details on the dry-season
roads’ progress.
7.     Trail bridge fabrication is on track to achieve RAIDP targets. RAIDP’s target for trail bridges
includes supporting full completion of 164 bridges plus fabricating steel parts for a further full
completion 486 bridges. The PCU reports that outstanding fabrication activities for the final 100
bridges of this target will reach completion before December 31 2013. DoLIDAR is handling bridge
installation under the Trail Bridge Sector-wide Approach (TB-SWAp). Current plans show these
bridges will be installed by July, 2014. The Team requests the PCU to monitor the progress of these
bridges and report the progress in monthly reports.
8.    Action is needed to fully achieve targets for Community Infrastructure schemes . RAIDP has
completed 505 of a targeted 583 community infrastructure schemes. Roughly 22 of the remaining 43
schemes are showing no progress. The PCU and DTOs in these districts need to take immediate
action to ensure that work completes by December 31, 2013.
9.     Several remaining river-crossing structures may not reach completion before project close.
RAIDP is supporting 17 river crossing structures. Of these, six contracts are 75% complete, nine
contacts are between 50% and 75% complete, one contract is less than 50% complete, and one
contract is only 10% complete. The Team has concerns about whether all river crossing structures
will reach completion before December 31, 2013. Annex 3 provides progress details for river crossing
works. The Ministry of Finance (MoF) and MoFALD may wish to make alternative budget
arrangements to compete bridges once RAIDP funding is no longer possible.
10. RAIDP may encounter a budget shortfall in the region of NPR 550m during this fiscal year.
This is primarily due to the impact of expenditures carrying over from the previous fiscal year due to
Nepal’s budget impasse. The Team would like to request close collaboration between MoF and
MoFALD to ensure that project implementation does not stall for lack of funds.
11. Slow progress under 52 road upgrading projects is a cause for concern. The PCU and districts
need to take immediate actions considering RAIDP’s impending closure. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Team wishes to note that no IDA reimbursements will be possible for expenditures incurred after
Dec. 31 2013. This deadline is firm and unchangeable. The Team strongly recommends for the PCU
and districts to organize one-to-one meeting with the contractors in order to proactively manage their
performance as this deadline approaches.
12. Progress in strengthening laboratories has been encouraging. 30 districts have set up material
testing laboratories with RAIDP’s help. These laboratories are capable of performing roadwork
related basic material tests. The project has now started the procurement process for additional testing
equipment required for more sophisticated testing related to concrete strength. The Team is pleased
to note that this will greatly help districts to during RADIP’s follow on project which includes a
greater focus on structures work.
13. A field visits to five districts3 (between May and September, 2013) identified implementation
issues that require the PCU’s intervention. These include: (i) slow progress or time overruns; (ii) late
mobilization following the end of monsoons break; (iii) poor quality work; and (iv) inaction on the

                                                                                                      2
part of districts where contractor performance is lagging. These issues need immediate attention to
ensure that GON derives the full value from RAIDP investments.
14. Maintenance is on target with respect to RAIDP target quantities but the maintenance culture
in districts is lagging. RAIDP reports that DDCs have, so far, maintained a total of 4,290km of rural
roads against a target of 4,500km. This progress is satisfactory from the prospective of quantity.
However, field observations suggest that many upgraded roads are not being maintained properly and
have already begun to fail. RAIDP’s successor operation is actively aiming to address many of the
core issues underlying this lagging performance. However, the Team is pleased to note that several
length-person-based pilots for routine maintenance have delivered heartening results (with help from
the International Labor Organization, or ILO). The roads under these pilot initiatives are now being
well maintained.
Capacity Building and Advisory Services Component (CBAS)
15. The overall rating of the CBAS component remains “moderately satisfactory” in line with the
prior review.
16. Progress in preparing 20 District Transport Master Plans (DTMPs) has been very slow.
Consultants engaged to complete these plans could not deliver within their contract period which
ended in July, 2013. RAIDP has now set up a new deadline for completion of all DTMPs (end-
November, 2013). The Team requested the PCU to monitor the DTMP consultants’ progress closely
and to initiate corrective action if deadlines slip further. Failing to complete the outstanding DTMPs
will negatively affect RAIDP’s successor project.
17. The progress to operationalize the Rural Transport Infrastructure Management System
(RuTIMS) has been slow. A revised implementation plan was agreed with the consultants carrying out
this task during the last review. However, the consultant could not achieve the revised targets. The
Team notes that RuTIMS software is still not fully functional and requires further revisions. The
Team has requested the PCU to review the consultants’ progress on a weekly basis and to initiate
contractual remedies if necessary.
15. Sustainable funding for laboratories is essential but yet to materialize. RAIDP has trained
laboratory staff and procured equipment. However, a solution to provide long term funding for
laboratory operations remains elusive. One option could entail the introduction of testing charges.
The Team has requested MoFALD/DoLIDAR to provide sufficient operational costs to DDCs to run
the laboratories, until a longer term solution has been agreed.
18. A MoFALD/RAIDP delegation visited India as part of international learning - The Team is
pleased to note that a delegation comprising officials from DoLIDAR and MoFALD has visited India
(Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Delhi) to observe the maintenance operations under the Bank-
supported Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY)4. The observation tour was organized and
financed by the International Labour Organization (ILO).
Safeguards Performance
19. Social Safeguards. The social safeguard implementation progress rating has now been upgraded
to “Satisfactory” given the significant progress achieved by RAIDP. Most of the last review agreed
actions have been complied with. All social safeguard activities under original project scopes have
been completed, including land transfers. RAIDP has prepared Voluntary Donation Impact Mitigation
Plans (VDIMPs) and Vulnerable Community Development Plans (VCDPs) for all 157 schemes under
the AF and they are at different stages of implementation. RAIDP has completed land ownership
transfer of 88% of land donors. The status of implementation of VCDPs is the following: 60
completed and remaining 97 being implemented. Field visits (Nuwakot and Rasuwa districts) also
confirmed the satisfactory VDIMPs and VCDPs implementation progress. Nonetheless, the following
activities require immediate attention: (i) quick progress on land ownership transfer process in
Dhanusha district (current progress is only 6%); (ii) implementation of all VDIMPs and VCDPs by

end-October, 2013. While Annex 7 provides details of the social safeguard performance, Annex 6
provides the agreed actions.
20. Environmental Safeguard. The Environmental safeguard management rating has been assessed
as “moderately satisfactory”. The last review assessed it as “moderately unsatisfactory”. The project
has completed the Initial Environmental Examinations (IEEs) of three roads located in buffer zones.
They were also approved. IEE recommendations are either already implemented or under
implementation. The project confirmed that no civil works were undertaken in the buffer zone
sections of these roads till the formal approval of the IEEs. As per the agreement of the last review
RAIDP has prepared site plans for tipping, quarrying and bio-engineering. They are now being
implemented (Annex 5). The Team has observed some delays in the implementation of mitigation
measures in the case of dry-season roads as well as in some road upgrading works and has identified
some issues (see Annex 7). RAIDP has agreed to complete the implementation of mitigations
measures by November 2013. There are still a few outstanding mitigation works or issues as per the
final environmental status reports of completed works. The project has agreed to complete them as
soon as possible. The Project has also agreed to review the final environmental status of remaining
roads and to closely follow up the implementation of all environmental mitigation works. It has been
agreed that an assessment of landslide/erosion problems in Bogatitar-Simple-Bhorle-Parchyang and
Nuwakot-Bageshori-Urleni roads will be done and detailed mitigation plans will be formulated. While
Annex 7 provides details of the review findings, Annex 6 identifies agreed actions.
Governance, Accountability and Peace Filter
21. Most RAIDP Governance and Accountability Action Plan (GAAP) actions are continued.
Community participation in project activities is adequate. Technical audit findings (carried out by the
National Vigilance Centre or NVC) have been shared with the project and are being followed up. The
Grievance handling system (especially at the project site level) is continued to function satisfactorily,
with close coordination from LRUC and Village Rural Coordination Committee (VRCC). However, it
is noted that the follow-up actions at the district level are weak. This could still be improved through
appropriate staffing and enhancing their capacities (through training and orientation). The Partnership
for Transparency Fund (PTF) has been helping RAIDP to enhance the effectiveness of the third-party
monitoring. Sixteen districts have been selected under this initiative. Lesson learned and information
on the effectiveness of this approach is expected to improve in designing a third-party/beneficiary
monitoring mechanism in the SNRTP.
22. A conflict-sensitive approach has been adopted in handling RAIDP activities. Transparency in
project operations has helped to avoid misperceptions about project activities. A number of steps have
been undertaken by RAIDP to enhance transparency (e.g. VRCC/LRUCs orientation programs on all
upcoming activities; public display of information on the budget, contractors, and implementation
arrangements). RAIDP is procuring all contracts using e-bidding. Since introduction in RAIDP
districts the E-bidding is now being used by almost all districts (74 out of 75 districts), although the
target under the project was to introduce it to 9 districts, only. The status of GAAP actions are
presented in Annex-10.
V.    Procurement, Disbursement and Financial Management
23. Procurement. The overall progress rating of procurement activities has been continued to be
“satisfactory”. There were no significant procurement activities since the last review. RAIDP has
updated the procurement plan. All dry-season road contracts with Local Road Users’ Committees
(LRUCs) are now concluded. RAIDP also completed the procurement of individual consultants
(national and international) for the preparation of SNRTP. The Team advised the project to finalize
laboratory equipment and relevant accessories award decisions (two packages) by 25th September
2013. To support the SNRTP project preparation, design and RAIDP implementation activities the
Team agreed with the project’s proposal for additional consulting services linked to: GIS-based
accessibility analysis, updating of the technical guidelines, and preparation of a manual for quality
assurance and management. These activities will be included in the updated procurement plan. Annex
8 provides a list of procurement activities carried out between mid-May and end-August, 2013.


                                                                                                       4
24. Financial Management. The financial management related progress has been assessed as
“moderately satisfactory”. RAIDP completed all last review agreed actions but one: linked to the
training, which the project plans to carry out by mid-October, 2013. The project submitted reports on
time. However, the report quality deserves more attention.
25. Disbursements and AWPB. Total disbursements, as of September 4, 2013, are $54.10m (71% of
the allocated amount). The net use of resources is approximately 68% (after a deduction of the
Designated Account balance). RAIDP has not yet documented roughly $2.13m Designated Account
advances. Funds under IDA Grant H171-NP have been fully disbursed. Total disbursements under
IDA Grant H525-NP are $14.86m (76% of the allocated amount). Total disbursements under IDA
Credit 4664-NP are $6.51m (28% of the allocated amount). The Team has noted outstanding
reimbursement claims of NPR 790.33m ($7.75m), as of September 4, 2013. The on-going project
restructuring has been proposing a cancellation of $6m loan. This has been worked out with RAIDP.
However, a formal request from GON in this regard is required by the Bank. It is highly unlikely that
RAIDP will be able to utilize the entire credit/grant amount. The proposal took into consideration the
following: pervious years’ absorption rate, FY 2013/14 approved budget, and exchange gain. The
disbursement situation will again be assessed in early November and further cancellation may be
made depending on the disbursement status. RAIDP has been advised to monitor the following key
project closure issues: (i) establish works, goods and services that have been delivered and accepted
by the closing date (December 31, 2013). They will only be eligible for IDA financing. Expenses
beyond the closing date will be funded by the Government; and (ii) arrangements need to be made (in
FY 2013/14) for financing incremental operating costs and other expenses beyond the closing date.
VI.   Key Issues in Implementation
   i. The overall implementation progress remains “moderately satisfactory” with static trends. Good
      progress has been made in social and environmental safeguard areas. However, progress in
      project management and other areas remains unchanged;
  ii. The performance of the Rural Transport Infrastructure Component rated as “moderately
      satisfactory” with static trends. RAIDP needs to closely monitor the slow-performing
      contracts/sub-projects so that they are completed before the project ends. They include: 52 road
      upgrading contracts, 78 community infrastructure sub-projects, and 11 bridges;
iii. The performance of Capacity Building and Advisory Services component also remains
      “moderately satisfactory” with static trends as well. RAIDP requires to take quick actions to
      conclude the following contracts given that their performance is linked to the performance of
      the follow-up project: preparation of 20 DTMPs and the development of RuTIMS;
 iv. Owing to the good performance, social safeguard rating has now been upgraded to
      “satisfactory” status. However, RAIDP needs to follow-up on the following issues closely: (a)
      completion of remaining land ownership and land transfer processes; (b) implementation of
      remaining VDIMPs and VCDPs by October, 2013;
  v. Environmental safeguard performance has also improved considerably. Its rating has now been
      elevated to “moderately satisfactory”. Issues that require RAIDP’s attention include: (a) quick
      implementation of remaining environmental mitigation measures in dry-season roads; (b)
      completion of remaining environmental mitigation works or disposal of issues as identified in
      the final status reports; (c) completion of final environmental reports of remainder roads;
 vi. The performance of financial management remains “moderately satisfactory” with improving
      trend. It is noted an outstanding reimbursement claims of about $7.75 million as of September
      4, 2013. Considering Project’s possible savings due to low absorption rate and exchange gain
      the Project needs to make a realistic estimate of expenditures to be incurred within project
      closing date i.e. December 31, 2013. Accordingly, a formal request from the Government will
      be sent to Bank for necessary cancellation and restructuring of the project;
vii. It is to be noted that RAIDP funding will only be available for works/activities completed on or
      before the project closure date (December 31, 2013). Incomplete works/activities will not be
      financed by IDA; and


                                                                                                    5
viii. To ensure the quality of works the Project needs to field the professionals including the Project
      support consultants, quality management expert, lab technicians to field level monitoring and
      supervision especially works associated with Otta seal pavement and bridges.
VII. Project Closure Investment Completion and Results Report (ICR)
26. The Task Team Leader (TTL) who will lead the ICR process from the Bank side has been
identified. DoLIDAR needs to prepare a Borrower’s Project Completion Report. The Team has drawn
a plan for the ICR completion process (Annex 12). The Bank’s corporate requirement is to complete
ICR within six months of the closing date of the project (i.e. end-June, 2014). The ICR process is
expected to be completed by June, 2014. The Government has assured the Team of all possible
support in the ICR completion process.
VIII. Follow-Up Project Progress
27. Substantial progress has been made in the preparation of a new follow up project (Strengthening
National Program for Rural Transport, or SNRTP). The Team is pleased with the support that is being
provided by MoFALD/DoLIDAR in this regard. A Bank mission already conducted the project’s pre-
appraisal. GON’s contribution in the project will be substantial (roughly $60m or a third of the project
costs). SNRTP is expected to be approved by the Bank Board in end-December, 2013.
IX. Proposed timing and focus of Next Mission
28. RAIDP closes within four months’ time. It has been agreed that the last review will be held in
end-November, 2013. The review will focus on: (i) the achievement of project results based on the
impact study findings; (ii) the physical implementation status of the project including an assessment
of the likelihood of the use of loans/grants; and (iii) the status of the implementation of actions agreed
during this review.

Ten District Transport Master Plans (DTMPs) has been completed following a consultation workshop
held in December, 2012. Preparation of another 20 DTMPs started in July 2012. The progress of the
preparation of 20 District Transport Master Plans (DTMPs) has been very slow. The consultants could not
complete the activities within the contract period (July, 2013). Field survey works completed for 19
districts (except Baglung district). The second level workshop is complete in 15 districts and the
workshop for additional 4 districts is scheduled to be complete by end of September. The Consultant has
agreed to submit the Draft Report for 5 districts by 18 September 18, 2013, another 9 districts by October
4, 2013 and for the remaining districts by end October, 2013. As per the recent review and detail
discussion the project has set up a new deadline for completion of all the final DTMPs by end of
November, 2013. The Team requested RAIDP to monitor the progress of the consultants and agreed
target days for draft DTMPs closely and to take appropriate actions if the consultants fail to make
satisfactory progress, as per the contract agreement. The delay in the DTMP preparation may have
considerable effect in the planning of next follow-up project. It is also noted that the DoLIDAR’s
guidelines for preparing the DTMP has further changed to Core road network rather than class A, B and
or C roads.
 Rural Transport Infrastructure Management System (RuTIMS) consultants have though completed the
initial version of the software and have presented in a workshop long time back, no further significant
progress was found in finalization and implementation part. A revised implementation plan was agreed
with the consultants during last review. However, the consultant could not achieve the progress targets as
planned. In this period the RuTMS consultant have populated 17 DTMPs and demonstrated the developed
application/ software to 9 participants from PCU and DoLIDAR (from 12 to 15 August 2013) at PCU as
part of testing and training program for implementation of the software. The Team noted that the software
is still partially functioning and undergoing through corrections based on the last demonstration/ training.
The consultant has agreed to correct and finalize the software, and make final release of software by end
September, 2013. Further, training to the district officials and support for maintenance and operation will
be continued. The Team has requested the project to review the consultants’ progress on a weekly basis.
In spite of these efforts if the consultants fail to make satisfactory progress then appropriate actions need
to be initiated against the consultants
Regarding the project support manpower the services of Quality Management Expert, Senior Laboratory
Technicians, Project Design Engineers (PDEs), Senior PDE, Senior Social Development Consultant
(SSDC), SDCs, and Cluster-level Environmentalist (CLE) are continued till end of the project. . However,
in cases of DDC and DTO key persons it is noted that there were numbers of transfers and also some of
the posts are not fulfilled. Non fulfillment of DTO chief by SDE, engineers, and sub-engineers may
directly affectthe effective supervision, contract management, and quality of works.
 With the aim to strengthen the district laboratories the RAIDP has assessed requirements for the
additional laboratory equipment mainly needed testing concrete and road works, and has already started
procurement process for major and minor equipment. Though the procurement is started there has been
significant delay in award of contract. The project has agreed to finalize the award by 25 September 2013.
Once these laboratories equipment are installed and calibrated the functioning the DDC laboratories will
have capacity to undertake necessary tests for all concrete and road works except some specialized tests.
The Team recommends that the DDC/DTO to provide sufficient operational costs to run the laboratories.
If necessary, Ministry and/or DoLIDAR is to help the DDC to raise the operational costs by charging the
tests.
Bank Team’s field visits to 5districts (between May and September, 2013) have identified a number of
implementation issues. They include: (i) slow progress or time overrun observed in many contracts


                                                                                                Annex P-44
including the failure in the timely review of the progress and the preparation of the revised work plan; (ii)
non-mobilization of appropriate resources after monsoon break (equipment, managerial and technical
manpower etc.) in some of the contracts causing delays in contract implementation; (iii) the lack of proper
attention in the implementation of quality assurance plan, quality of works and materials; and (iv) non-
action on the part of the districts against non-performing or slow-progressing contractors. The Identified
issues need close attention from districts, as well as from RAIDP. RAIDP/ DDC/DTO has agreed to
arrange a management meeting with such slow progressing contractors and DDC officials to re-start or
expedite the pace of implementation of the non-performing or slow-progressing contracts. If necessary,
the DTO/DDC will issue instructions/ warnings quoting the contract provisions. The review team cleared
that the remaining works which is not accounted till December 2013 will be beyond the project’s bank
financing fund. Considering the quality of materials, bitumen and procedural works to be highly sensitive
for Otta seal works and it’s sustainability the project mobilized at least one experienced key person from
the project or region to train, monitor, and control the Otta seal activity.
As an support for the future project planning and implementation the project team agreed to engage
separate consultants to prepare/ update the existing technical standard / guideline for the project and to
develop a manual/ guideline for quality assurance and control. These consultants are expected start by end
of September 2013 and complete these documents by end of November 2013.

RAIDP Phase I
The implementation of Remedial Action Plan for Phase I has been completed. RAIDP/PCU has
transferred 100% of land titles by January, 2013. Land title transfer for Makwanpur district could
not be completed due to absence of landowners so the remaining cases have been handed over to
District Development Committees (DDCs) as per the law of the country.
RAIDP (Phase I) adopted a Community Based Performance Monitoring (CBPM) to ensure the
quality of development works under the project and to enhance community’s ownership of the
project outcome. CBPM is being conducted by Village Road Coordination Committee (VRCC) /
Local Road User Committee (LRUC) in coordination with District Development Committee
DDC), Social Mobilization Officer (SMO), Social Development Consultant (SDC), Cluster Level
Environmentalist and other line agencies. The project has completed CBPM for 11 RAIDP roads
as per the plan and necessary actions have been taken based on their outcomes.
The CBPM in roads that required remedial action were carried out after distribution of the
remedial assistance. The aim of this CBPM was to assess satisfaction level of the affected
community regarding the construction and assistance distribution. CBPM in the additional
financing roads will be compulsorily conducted three times in each road as per the ESMF.
Overall, the Team noted that the progress in social safeguard implementation is satisfactory under
RAIDP Phase I.
RAIDP Phase II [Additional Financing (AF)]
Social management plans prepared. PCU has received social screening reports for 150 all -
weather road sub-projects identified in the procurement plan for additional financing. According
to the PCU out of total 150 sub-projects 43 do not have any social impact. Of the 107 sub-
projects that have social impact 9 road sub-project affect only structures.
RAIDP/PCU has prepared VDIMP for both the All Weather road packages as well as Dry-season
road packages. It was reported that VDIMPs and VCDPs has been prepared for all 150 all-
weather road subprojects for which social screening has been completed. Although not all the
road sub-projects have social impacts, still VDIMPs have been prepared for record. The fifth
VDIMPs has been revised and implemented. The VDIMPs and VCDPs for 7 dry-season roads
have also been prepared.



                                                                                      Annex P-52
The progress achieved so far is satisfactory in terms of social screening of the sub-projects. While
the social screening reports have been prepared for majority of the total planned road subproject
for additional financing, the VDIMP and VCDP are prepared for 100% of the total subproject
having completed the social screening.

Implementation of VDIMPs & VCDPs
VDIMPS
The Team was informed by PCU that all the 107 VDIMPs prepared for all weather roads having
social impact are being implemented and they are in different stages of implementation. It is
noted that all 98 subprojects that require land ownership transfer have initiated land ownership
transfer process. Approximately four fifth (89%) of the total Project Affected Families (PAFs:
11,312 Households) identified in 98 VDIMPs have transferred land titles and received assistance.
RAIDP has also completed distribution of assistance to 204 SPAFs identified by these projects.
Almost 141Ha of land has been obtained through voluntary donation from a total of 10076 HHs.
In 9 road sub projects only structures are affected and the disbursement of assistance has already
been completed. The Team has noted with concern that implementation of VDIMP in Dhanusha
district is extremely slow.
The Team is pleased to note that 7 VDIMPs prepared for dry-season road are being implemented
and project has completed disbursement of additional payment based on revised VDIMPs for all
8 districts. It has been reported that implementation is complete for 5 out of 7 road sub-projects.
In the remaining 2 road subprojects land ownership transfer process is ongoing. It is expected to
be completed by end- October, 2013.
RAIDP has achieved good progress in distribution of assistance to SPAFs and land title transfer
incentives to PAFs. The project has distributed NPR 48.7 million as cash assistance and land
transfer incentive in these 114 sub-projects. RAIDP has adopted an innovative practice to deduct
the extent of land donated from the land registration certificate so that the donors save on the tax
paid for the land holding. However, there are cases where the project needs to expedite the
implementation of VDIMPs. The Team has expressed its concern over non transfer of land
ownership before the start of civil works. The Team has observed that although civil works have
started in Dhanusha district, VDIMP implementation is very slow. Till date only 6% of the PAFs
have been provided assistance and land ownership has been transferred. Lack of cooperation and
coordination from the local government staffs (DDC, DTOs, CDO, DLRO and DLSO) has been
cited as the main reason for delay.

The Team is pleased to note that Parsa, Banke and Saptari district has made considerable progress
in disbursement of assistance and land ownership transfer. It is expected to be completed by the
end of October, 2013.
VCDPs
Out of the total 157 VCDPs (150 all-weather + 7 dry-season roads) prepared and approved, 60
VCDPs has been implemented till date. Altogether 86 skill development and income generation
trainings as per the provisions of ESMF were given to 621 vulnerable families. The PCU has
already procured an NGO for the implementation of 46 VCDPs. For the remaining 51 VCDPs (44
All-weather+ 7 Dry-season) PCU has released Request for Proposals (RFP) and plans to
implement it by the end of October 2013.
Public Consultation and Disclosure
The Environmental and Social Management Framework of RAIDP has provisions of consultation
with project affected peoples and disclosure of the documents such as ESMF and impact
mitigation plans through effective means of communication. There is a provision of consultation
with the affected people by SMO/SDC through LRUC/VRCC about the proposed actions. The
project has translated ESMF into Nepali and published the name list of the land donors in public
places including offices of DDC and VDCs of the project areas. Local communities, user
committees were consulted during the preparation and implementation phases. The Team noted
that in both Rasuwa and Nuwakot districts, the community has been consulted and informed
about the project procedures. ESMF in Nepali has also been distributed to the PAFs and SPAFs.
Grievance Management
RAIDP has clearly outlined Grievance Hearing and Redress Mechanism in the ESMF.
Grievances are redressed by a Grievance Hearing Committee (GHC) formed in each project
district. GHC is a three member committee comprising of a nominee of District Road
Coordination Committee, Planning, Monitoring and Administration Officer in DDC and Social
Development Consultant (SDC). GHC is established on the premise of the DDCs and their
decision is final for the project.
GHCs have been formed in the projects districts and registers have been maintained to register
grievances and record all the process of hearing and resolutions. The Team found fairly good
RAIDP grievance handling mechanism. In many districts, GHCs have been successful in
handling grievances. So far project has received 836 grievances across all the districts and about
80% of the grievances have been satisfactorily resolved.
During the field visit the Team noted the community is not aware of the existence and role of
Grievance Redress Committee in the district. The affected community, however, filed their
grievances with the LRUC and the SDC who maintained the grievance register. Most of the
grievances received are related to delay in construction works and damage suffered due to
construction related work. It was noted that the most of the grievances are resolved in the
community level and in some cases taken up to the district level.
The Team is pleased to note that the SDE is aware of ongoing grievance management in the
districts and has been following it up. The PCU has maintained a database of grievance received
from all the RAIDP District. RAIDP/PCU has also started covering the grievance redress in the
monitoring and progress reports since March, 2013.
Social Safeguard Management Capacity
RAIDP has appointed a Social Development Expert (SDE) who is responsible for the overall
management of social safeguards in 30 RAIDP districts. 20 Social Development Consultants
(SDC) and 10 Senior Social Development Consultants (SSDCs) have also been hired to support


                                                                                     Annex P-54
RAIDP in the management of social safeguards. The Team was informed that PCU has conducted
cluster level orientation training for SSDCs and SDCs. It was reported that at least first round of
orientation has been completed for all the SSDCs and SDCs.
Appointment of SDCs and SDE itself is a commendable action of RAIDP. A high level project
staff specifically appointed to oversee social safeguards has eased the implementation of SMF.
The Team also learned that SDE is actively involved in overlooking the implementation of social
management plans by SDCs and participating/projects districts. The SDE is particularly involved
in overseeing the serious cases that come up during the implementation process like the cases of
delay, large scale impacts, and disputes.
The Team is pleased to note that the PCU has recruited social mobilisers in 29 out of 30 districts.
The social mobilisers have also been oriented in 29 districts. The Team was informed that due to
disagreement between DDC and DTO, the Social Mobilisers could not be hired in Saptari district.
The district however, has completed land transfer of more than 98% of the identified PAFs.
Monitoring and Supervision
Until July, 2013, the project has conducted first round CBPM of 122 sub-projects under
construction, 80 second round CBPM, and 36 third round CBPM. The CBPM reports show that
almost all social issues are recorded and addressed properly according to the principles described
in the ESMF of the project. The only problem shown in the CBPM is delay in the process of land
ownership transfer. The project has internalized CBPM of sub-projects and regular reports are
being generated. The Team was further informed that on the basis of the CBPM reports sent from
the districts, a database has been maintained by the PCU as per the recommendation from the last
review, thus allowing an easy reference to take necessary actions.
The monitoring and supervision mechanisms established under RAIDP are good and effective to
monitor the mitigation status of social impacts in each road subproject. All levels of stakeholders
are involved in one way or other in monitoring and supervision of RAIDP activities.
In addition, HELVETAS under Partnership for Transparency Fund (PTF) has hired the services
of NGOs to strengthen the capacity of Community-based Organizations or CBOs (such as LRUC
and VRCC) for monitoring civil works and contracts process under RAIDP and to inform the
concerned agencies of their grievances. NGOs hired are working in 16 selected districts and are
specifically responsible: (i) for providing support to more than 80 CBOs for understanding the
policy and principles mentioned in ESMF and their roles and responsibilities; (ii) for capacitating
CBOs for understanding quality of construction work by providing training based on specific
training Manual and also for monitoring labor contract process and payment of the contractors;
and (iii) for supporting the CBOs for easy and productive access to report the grievances.
2.0 Environmental Safeguards
Roads in Protected Area Buffer Zones. Project informed that IEEs of the three roads (viz;
Hetauda-Padampokhari in Makawanpur, Bageshwori-Urleni in Nuwakot, Alokchakrapath in
Nawalparasi districts) located in buffer zones have been approved by the Ministry of Federal
Affairs and Local Development, and IEE recommendations are being implemented. There was no
civil works in the buffer zones until approval of the respective IEE. Project is monitoring
construction works regularly.
Bioengineering Site Plans. Site plan for bio-engineering have been revised and improved for the
following roads: (i) Daldale-Dhauwadi Road (05+225-11+700 & 11+700-19+350), Nawalparasi
District; Nuwakot-Bageshwori-Urleni Road (10+010-23+480), Nuwakot District; Hetauda-
Padampokhari-Handikhola Road (00+000-13+119), Makwanpur District; Sandhikharka-Balkot
Tamghas Road(19+280-27+000), Arghakhanchi District; and Bogatitar-Simle-Bhorle-Parchyang



                                                                                      Annex P-55
Road (00+000-06+000), Rasuwa District. All bio-enginering works in these sites are under
implementation and will be completed by November 2013.


Tipping Site Plans. Improved tipping site plans have been prepared for the following roads:
Aryabhangyang-Rampur, Sandhikharka-Balkot-Tamghas, Sandhikharka-Dharapani-Chujathati,
Bhimdhunga-Lamidanda, Nuwakot-Bageshwori-Urleni. Below is a typical sketch (cross-section)
of an improved tipping site. The tipping sites will be closed by December 2013.

Quarry Site Plan. In most roads, construction materials were obtained from quarry sites of which
IEE has been approved or materials purchased from suppliers from outside the project area.
Quarry site plans have been prepared for the quarry in the Aryabhanjyang-Rampur Road
(38+060). A sketch site plan of this quarry operation and closure is given below. Project informed
that, in Bhimdhunga-Lamidanda Road, quarry material is being extracted from private land in
agreement with the land owner. The review advised the following: obtain written agreement with
the land owner, and prepare/ approve site plan of operation and closing.

Dry-Season Roads' Environmental Management Plan (EMP). Second joint walk-through was
carried out along the seven dry-season roads by Environmental Specialist, site-in-charge,
consultant engineer and Users: main observations of which are summarized below.
Road                            Main findings/ suggestions/ agreements
Lachhyang-Sarmasthali-          The foot trails demolished during construction activities are being
Patikharka-Yarsa Road Project   reinstated. Compensatory plantation is being carried out in different
(0+000-10+270)                  chainages. Further, dry wall has been provided in the various sections of
                                the road alignment in order to protect the agricultural land. Similarly, bio-
                                engineering measures are being applied in possible mass failure areas for
                                the protection of hill slopes. Highly significant adverse impacts have been
                                observed or anticipated. However, many small and medium scale


                                                                                              Annex P-57
                              landslides were observed in various sections of the road alignment
                              damaging the natural drain, road and agricultural lands. These are being
                              managed.
Dharapani-Rupsepani-          Foot trails demolished during construction are being rehabilitated. Gabion
Bhadaure-9, Bhorle Road       breast wall is needed for the protection of school building at 05+460. Dry
Project (0+000-6+000)         wall has been provided to protect the agricultural land in most sections of
                              the road. Similarly, bio-engineering measures are being applied for the
                              protection of hill slopes. Compensatory plantation is also being carried
                              out yet in different chainages. there was no impact on the Chautari/
                              resting place and was no mourning site which was wrongly mentioned in
                              the previous monitoring.
Kahunkhola-Melbot Road        Drinking water supply pipes were exposed at various section of road. The
Project (03+520-10+780)       road alignment was not shifted, but the construction took care of the water
                              supply pipe lines, on-site adjustment of the design was done and
                              protection was provided to the pipe lines. Bio-engineering has been
                              carried out in the landslide areas at chainages 04+310 and 07+000..
                              Around 500 tree saplings have been planted in different chainages under
                              the compensatory plantation scheme. No highly significant impacts have
                              been observed. Labour camp were not needed as only few outside
                              workers were involved, who stayed in the rented space.
Rudrabeni-Dhuseni, Padigaon   About 80% construction work is completed. However, many of the
Road Project (0+000-9+400)    environmental mitigations included in the EMP has been just initiated
                              including drain management, gabion works, brush layering, tree
                              plantation and other bioengineering works outlined in EMP of the Road.
                              Foot trails demolished during road widening have already been
                              rehabilitated. Altogether 450 number of tress has been planned initially as
                              compensatory plantation. This is not adequate as per the forestry
                              guidelines and EMP recommendations (actual number of trees felled is
                              62. For every single tree felled, 25 trees needs to be planted. Hence actual
                              number of plantation should be 1550. Spoil generated in this road section
                              has been properly managed with the application of bio-engineering
                              measures. There was no impact to the electric poles. A number of
                              crossing (hupe pipe) were provided for irrigation canals. . The Ram
                              Mandir from the chainage 00+600-00+900 has not been affected – no
                              spoil disposed near the temple. Cause ways were provided for the
                              perennial springs/sources of water.
Patihalne-Bafukhola Road      The initial 3 km length of the road is already motor able, which is being
Project (0+000-5+000)         widened to make its 5 m and for construction of drain. However the
                              remaining of section, 2km is complete new construction where track is
                              being opened. It passes through forest with Rhododendron dominant
                              spices. Compensatory planation has been carried out. Currently
                              bioengineering work is being carried out in sensitive slope failure areas
                              for the slope stability. Drinking water tap (2+440) and drinking water
                              supply pipelines at 2+350 are only public infrastructure affected by during
                              road construction activities: these have been rehabilitated.
Dasharathpur-Dandagaon Road   Road track already exist. Hence major construction works are widening,
Project (0+000-8+000)         drain construction and grade correction. Drinking water supply pipes and
                              irrigation canals were seen at various section of road. Drinking water
                              pipelines for Ramkot and Dashrathpur village pass along the road and
                              across the road in many sections. These pipes will be disturbed during
                              road widening. Similarly, irrigation schemes are also likely to be affected.
                              Chainages of such public infrastructure is recorded and mitigations are
                              incorporated in EMP cost. These are being implemented. Excess of debris
                              material is seen to be managed at this road. Toe wall and retaining
                              structures are provided already to manage excess spoil with the
                              application of bio-engineering measures. Further, foot trails demolished


                                                                                           Annex P-58
                               during widening are being rehabilitated. Excavated material during
                               widening is likely to be sufficient to supply quarry materials – hence there
                               is no need of quarrying. The road is being constructed by the local user
                               group: hence there is no need of labour camps.
Bahane-Lung VDC Ward No. 7     Major activities in this road are road widening, construction of drainage
Road Project (0+000-5+000)     and breaking of cliffs. Road crosses two major streams/ kholsies so it is
                               necessary to protect river from scouring. Meantime, seepages and spring
                               at some chainages also require proper drainage management. EMP works
                               has been just initiated including Gabion works, Brush layering, tree
                               Plantation and other Bioengineering works outlined in the EMP of the
                               Road. Neither of the foot trails mentioned in the EMP have been
                               demolished yet. 52 numbers of trees have been planned initially as
                               compensatory plantation. As the number of trees felled is 161, additional
                               planation is necessary (compensatory plantation @ 1 tree felled: 25 tree
                               planted. Hence number planation required in this case is 4025). No
                               protected species are felled.
Environmental Status of Completed Roads. Final environmental status has been prepared for 12
additional roads since previous review. These includes: Puspa Lal Marga, Puspalal Marga Slice
II, Laxmana-Ganeshpur Slice I, Laxmana-Ganeshpur Slice II, Chyama-Sanjhanachowk-Khajura-
Radhapur (Khajura-Radhapur Section), Titihiria – Sonpur - Sitapur, Ridi-Rudrabeni-Wamitaksar,
Aryabhanjyang-Rampur, Bastari-Jhadewa-Gothadi, Harthok-Chhahara-Tingire, Dhadingbesi-
Salyantar Rural, and Naudanda-Karkineta Road. The status report indicates that almost all
mitigation measures included in the EMP have been implemented except minor few. The
outstanding mitigation works, for example includes, plantation to control erosion is outstanding in
Puspa Lal Marga, turfing is not completed around structures in Laxmanpur-Ganeshpur Road,
reclaiming of few small borrow pits still outstanding and some hupe pipes seems necessary at
9+500 in Laxampur-Ganeshpur Slice II, construction site remained to be closed in Titihiria –
Sonpur - Sitapur, outstanding mitigation works in Aryabhanjyang-rampur Raod include
compensatory planation, rehabilitation of quarry site (Chundunga) and contractor’s storage yard,
some bio-engineering and plantation works is outstanding in Harthok-Chhahara-Tingire Road. .
PCU/PSC will continue to prepare Final Environmental Status of the roads as and when they are
complete (before issuing Final Completion Certificate to the contractor and start of Defect
Liability Period).
Orientations and awareness. PSC/PCU informed that environmental orientation and awareness at
sites to site staffs of contractors and project have been carried out in 59 roads since February
2103. The target group of these orientations include road building groups, members of LRUC,
road engineer, overseer, social mobilizer etc. The orientations will continue as needed.
Environmental Monitoring and High Risk Roads. PSC Environmental specialist visited following
three higher risks roads since the last review. Observations from the site visit is summarized
below.
     Road                          Observation
1.   Bogatitar-Simle-Bhorle-       The Road is earthen and passes through Laharepauwa, Dhaibung and
     ParchyangRoad (00+000-        Bhorle VDC of the District. The existing width of the road varies 3
     06+600)                       to 4.5 m with the average width of 3.5 m. Currently the road is
                                   earthen. Cultivated farm land and unstable vulnerable slopes are in
                                   the close proximity throughout the road alignment. Gabion and dry
                                   stone masonry are necessary with road side drainage to stabilize
                                   unstable slopes throughout the alignment. There are two major
                                   landslides at Simle (00+350) and Gardang (4+983). Bio-engineering
                                   plan has been prepared for the protection of these slopes and is
                                   implementation phase. The alignment also passes through different



                                                                                            Annex P-59
                                 seepage area where drainage management plan is necessary. No
                                 highly significant adverse environmental impact has been observed
                                 along the road alignment. Until date, demolished foot trails have
                                 been rehabilitated temporarily at 00+800, 02+581 and 06+173, other
                                 environmental mitigations outlines in the EMP is to be implemented.
2.   Nuwakot-Bageshwori-Urleni   Currently the road is earthen. The road passes through the buffer
     Road (10+010-23+480)        zone of Langtang National Park frrom 16+500-23+480. The road
                                 passes through two community forests, Shri Lamrang Jaspati
                                 Samudayik ban (10+500-11+000 & 12+50013+00) and Gumba ban
                                 (15+400-17+280). Since the road passes from the buffer zone of
                                 Langtang National Park, approval of IEE was one of the major issues
                                 for the construction of the road. Now the IEE is approved and
                                 mitigation measures proposed in the IEE report is being carried out.
                                 About 40 trees have been felled during widening activities. The sites
                                 for compensatory plantation have been identified in the community
                                 forests at 15+600-15+900 & 16+400 to 16+700 and will be
                                 completed. However, monitoring by CLE reported about 40%
                                 mortality. This will be replanted by November 2013. Other
                                 Environmental mitigation works included in EMP such as
                                 rehabilitation of foot trails (10+175-23+480), construction of
                                 tapstand (15+300), provision of high density polythene pipe
                                 (22+300), mitigation of landslide (10+720), provision of gabion wall
                                 for the protection of school (22+495) and rehabilitation of Chautaras
                                 (16+850, 17+290 & 22+490) have not been implemented yet. These
                                 will be implemnetd by November 2103. Bio-engineering plan has
                                 been prepared for the mitigation of landslide located at 10+720 and
                                 is under implementation phase, and public tap stand has been
                                 constructed at 15+300.The alignment also passes through different
                                 seepage area where drainage management plan is necessary. No
                                 highly significant adverse environmental impact was observed.
3.   Mandredhunga-               Both slices of the road are earthen in surface type. The major
     Khadgabhanjyang-            environmental impacts in both slices include scouring, erosion and
     Gorshyang-Dangsing Road     water logging. The demolished foot trails (03+590, 04+150, 04+394,
     (00+000 to 06+369) and      05+380, 05+733, 05+955, 06+340 & 06+366), public tap stands
     (06+369 to 12+687)          (04+525 & 04+540, and Chautara (05+380) in the 1st slice have
                                 been rehabilitated. Further, the first slice of the road passes from the
                                 community forest from 01+880 to 03+200 and about 50 trees have
                                 been felled during widening. About 1250 number of tree saplings
                                 will be planted in barren land and community at 2+720 to 2+820 &
                                 5+600 to 5+750 by the end of November 2103. Similarly, the
                                 demolished foot trails at different chainages, public tap stands
                                 (12+380), exposed water supply pipe lines (08+300, 08+590,
                                 10+805, 12+350, 12+360 & 12+670), irrigation canal (07+290 &
                                 08+290) and Chautara (10+475 & 10+485) in the 2nd slice have
                                 been rehabilitated. There are two landslides at 06+960 and 09+000.
                                 Gabion breast wall and bio-engineering measures have been
                                 provided to stabilize these landslides. The road also passes through
                                 the community forest from 06+770 to 08+390. Around 55 trees have
                                 been felled during the widening activity. Barren lands at 02+680 and
                                 07+100 are selected for compensatory plantation and will be
                                 completed by the end of November 2013. At chainage 10+150, the
                                 earthen drain has transformed into a deep gully damaging the
                                 existing road section and the issue is being mitigated and
                                 rehabilitation of PCC causeway at 03+290 is complete now through
                                 additional EMP. The contractor is extracting stone from Bhayakure

                                      the major environmental issues during widening activity. Now the
                                      spoil is being managed safely at tipping site after continuous
                                      monitoring.
4.   Hetauda-Padampokhari-            The major environmental impacts in the sub-project include soil slip,

     to 13+539 & 3+580 to             Major portion of the road alignment passes through settlement area
     11+580)                          followed by small portion of community forests at 06+100-06+500,
                                      07+750-08+400 and 08+900-09+200. Part of the road also passes
                                      through the buffer zone of Parsa Wildlife Reserve but there is no any
                                      sensitive environmental zone along the road alignment. Since the
                                      road passes through the buffer zone of Parsa Wildlife Reserve, IEE
                                      has been carried out for the sub-project and approved by the
                                      Ministry. Around 15 trees will be felled during widening activity.
                                      About 3750 tree saplings will be planted as compensatory plantation
                                      06+400-11+600 by the November 2013. A environmental problems
                                      observed was along Makari settlement area where a Radhakrishna
                                      temple, a Chautari and a wooden house (09+300) is in danger due to
                                      the drainage outlet in this area. According to local, large volume of
                                      water is discharged through this outlet during rainy season resulting
                                      in erosion. A permanent drainage structure is necessary in order to
                                      protect these structures.
5.   Daldale-Dhauwadi          Road   There is no public utilities to be relocated along the road alignment.
     Slice-I and Slice-II ( 05+225-   However, hill side soil slip and erosion of filled slope were observed
     11+700 & 11+700- 19+350)         at various sections of the road (06+650-06+675, 07+300-07+325,
                                      07+650-07+675 &08+700-08+725) in the 1st slice and at 11+900-
                                      12+000, 12+960-12+980, 13+000-14+400, 14+780-14+820,
                                      17+260-17+290 & 17+330-17+370 in the 2nd slice. The erosion
                                      problems are being mitigated by valley side plantation of grass,
                                      shrub and turfing at bends with the items included in Bill of
                                      Quantities (BoQ) by contractor and additional bioengineering by
                                      VRCC. The road alignment passes through the community forests
                                      from 06+500-10+300. Contractor is extracting quarry materials from
                                      13+180-13+240. Protection wall has been proposed in the BoQ for
                                      the rehabilitation of quarry site. Further, smaller slides due to recent
                                      torrential rainfall are being cleared by contractors.
6.   Sahid        Alokchakrapath      Alignment from 04+500-08+100 of this road lies in the buffer zone
     (Chormara Kholuwa section)       of Chitwan National Park. Since the road passes from the buffer zone
     and        Daldale-Dhauwadi      area, IEE has also been carried out for the sub-project. The road
     Munde tp Kumsot Section          alignment passes through Laligurans Community Forest (00+270-
     (0+000 to 8+100 and 5+225        01+485), Durga Community Forest (01+485-02+860) and
     to 7+425 )                       Janchetana Community Forest (06+07+425). The width is sufficient
                                      in this section and felling of trees is not necessary. Around 150
                                      number of trees (included in BoQ) will be planted along road side
                                      with preference to protection species as an environmental
                                      enhancement measures including turfing works. Further, plantation
                                      of 4500 number of trees of different species along with barbed
                                      fencing and information board has been proposed in the IEE for the
                                      enhancement of wildlife habitat and income generation to local
                                      people. 5 number of ponds of different size have also been proposed
                                      in the IEE for the enhancement of wildlife habitat by constructing
                                      water pond for wildlife. These activity will be completed by
                                      November 2013. The buffer zone area is guarded by electric fence to
                                      check escape of wildlife in cultivated land and settlement area.

                                   Hence the impact due to road construction activity in wildlife along
                                   buffer zone section is less likely. There is no any impact on existing
                                   Chautara trees along the road at 00+270 and 01+160 that were
                                   expected to be demolished during widening activity. There will be
                                   obstruction to cross the storm/flood/irrigation water (00+300,
                                   01+300, 01+900, 02+500, 03+654, 04+265, 04+700 and 06+470)
                                   during widening activity, HPC has been proposed for uninterrupted
                                   flow of water.
7.   Sandhikharka-Balkot-          The major portion of the road passes through highly weathered
     Tamghas(19+280-27+000)        sedimentary rocks and there are high chances of scouring and
                                   erosion. Grass plantation, brush layering and bamboo plantation have
                                   been proposed in BoQ in order to mitigate these impacts. The
                                   contractors are currently planning for undertaking these bio-
                                   engineering works Widening activity will not lead to the felling of
                                   trees in this road. There is one major landslide located at 20+420 and
                                   is being mitigated through additional mitigation measures by VRCC.
                                   These activity will be completed by November 2103. Besides the
                                   major landslides located at 20+420, there are few other smaller slides

The total approved budget for FY 2013/14 is a decrease by about 70.70% over FY 2012/13
budget. The allocation under Recurrent Budget is NPR 715.75 million of which IDA’s share is
NPR 668.73 million. The allocation under the Capital Budget is NPR 84.00 million, of which
IDA’s share is NPR 70.40 million. Out of the total approved budget, allocation under IDA source
is NPR 739.13 million (92.42%) and the counterpart fund is NPR 60.62 million (7.58%). Out of
the total allocation, NPR 684.80 million has been allocated for Rural Transport Infrastructure
Improvement Component, NPR 84.00 million for Capacity Building and Advisory Services
Component, NPR 20.50 million for Capacity Enhancement and Training, and NPR10.45 million
for supplies expenses.
Expenditures of FY2012/13: The details of expenses incurred by the Project in the FY 2012/13
are as follows:
Budget                Approved Budget             Expenditure NPR (in million)        Percentage

Total                              2,729.24      225.83     1,641.90     1,867.73         68.43%
The Team reminded that the Project has to constantly monitor for ensuring completion of all on-
going activities and maximum use of the available resources. The absorption rate in FY 2012/13
is only about 68.43% which is mainly because of delay in announcement of full budget, increase
in budget by more than 100% and slow progress of construction activities.
Disbursements: Total disbursements as of September 4, 2013 are $54.10 million, which is about
71% of the allocated amount. The net use of resources deducting the balance in the Designated
Account is about 68%. About $2.13 million advanced to the Designated Account is yet to be
documented. Funds available under IDA Grant H171-NP have been fully disbursed. Total
disbursements under IDA Grant H525-NP as of September 4, 2013 are $14.86 million, which is
about 76% of the allocated amount. Although Additional Financing was effective on July 14,
2010, disbursements started only from June 14, 2013 from credit allocation. Total disbursements
under IDA Credit 4664-NP as of September 4, 2013 are $6.51 million, which is about 28% of the
allocated amount. The Team noted an outstanding reimbursement claims of about NPR 790.33
million (approx. $7.75 million) as of September 4, 2013. Based on the absorption rate of previous
years, amount of budget approved for FY 2013/14, and exchange gain, the Project will not be
able to absorb the remaining undisbursed balance by the closing date of December 31, 2013. It
has been agreed that the Project will make a realistic estimates of expenditures to be incurred
within project closing date i.e. December 31, 2013 by September 30, 2013, and estimate the
possible amount of savings. The Bank team will then restructure the Project and will proceed for
cancellation of possible savings.
Key Points to be Noted for Closure. The Team discussed key points that need to be carefully
monitored at closing and reminded the following actions:
        Works, goods and services which have been delivered and accepted by the closing date
         December 31, 2013 within the scope of the project will be eligible for financing. Any
         expenses beyond the closing date will not be eligible for IDA financing and will need to
         be funded by the government source.
        Arrangements will be made for increasing counterpart funding for incremental operating
         costs and other expenses to cover the period beyond December 31, 2013 in FY 2013/14.

Financial Management. The Team noted that the Main and Subsidiary Grant Registers have
been properly maintained using the computer system. The SOE ledger has also been maintained
using computer software. In addition to the SOE ledger, the spreadsheet of source wise
expenditure record of expenses incurred for each civil works (road, community infrastructure and
Trail Bridge) and their summary sheets are maintained in the computer linking the information of
source wise expenditure to the summary sheet. Similarly, expenses incurred for goods,
consultancy services & training and incremental operating costs are also recorded in the
spreadsheet at the time of claim of reimbursable expenses. These spreadsheets serve the purpose
of SOE ledger. Amount of reimbursement claimed under SOE and the total amount of
reimbursement outstanding for claim are available from these spreadsheets when all data are
entered in the individual spreadsheet of each category.
SOE Review. A SOE review was carried out on September 5, 2013. During the review, the Team
advised to obtain supporting documents of reimbursable expenses to be paid based on actual
expenses incurred from consultants. The Team also advised that retention amount should not be
claimed to the Bank until the works are completed and can be claimed only upon the Bank
guarantee of the contractors.
Training. The Team advised to arrange procurement and financial management training
sometime within October 15, 2013 to alert all officials about the points to be monitored prior to
project closure.
Implementation Progress Report. There are no outstanding progress reports. The Team is
reviewing the third trimester IPR of FY 2012/13. The next first trimester implementation report is
due on 31st December 2013.
Audit Report. There are no overdue audit reports. The Team reminded that the unaudited
account for FY 2012/13 is due on October 15, 2013 and the audited account on January 15, 2014.

GAAP
Most GAAP actions proposed for RAIDP are continued. Community participation in project
activities is ensured through Village Road Coordination Committees (VRCCs) and Local Roads
Users Committees (LRUCs), who are involved in identifying and selecting projects for DTMP.
While RAIDP only supports projects included in the DTMP, which is good practice, it is yet to be
fully recognized by other Government agencies as the only source of projects in the district. This
has eroded the effectiveness of the DTMP process. The Project has been following up on the
observations of a majority of technical audits conducted by NVC. However, the capacity of NVC
itself needs to be strengthened to improve the effectiveness of the audit process. RAIDP also has
a functioning grievance handling system, especially at the project site level. Follow up on
reporting on GAAP actions at the district level should improve through appropriate staffing
which also means the need for enhancing staff capacity through training and orientation.
RAIDP has taken a conflict-sensitive approach to handling its activities. Transparency in project
operations has helped to avoid misperceptions about Project activities. For example, the Project
undertakes orientation programs for VRCC/LRUC s on all upcoming activities. Also, information
on the budget, contractors, and other implementation arrangements is displayed publicly.
Specifications of a particular project are also available so that the public can examine whether the
actual work is consistent with what was agreed in the document. Any variations are
communicated to the public in time. And, VRCC/LRUC representatives are invited to see for
themselves the final measurement of construction work done for payment. In addition, the Project
recruits social mobilizers (SMOs) for all projects at the community level. All SMOs come from
the same community, which helps to build relationship with the community. An SMO could also
be mobilized to improve communication between project authorities and the community,
especially in situations when ‘rumors’ circulate to undermine community confidence in the
Project. Employment opportunities created at the community level also contribute towards
building peace.
With the help from the Partnership for Transparency Fund (PTF) Helvetas has appointed an NGO
Sky Samaj Nepal to develop awareness to the local community groups such as VRCCs, LRUCs
and make them understand the project works and monitor the expected quality of services. It is
expected that such actions will help local community groups to discharge their responsibilities
more effectively and will help achieve the required work quality. After orientation to their
Community Enhancement Officers (CEOs) the Sky Samaj has mobilized seven CEOs to the
targeted 16 districts under the project. This initiation in line with third party or beneficiary
monitoring concept is expected to help the improvement of overall quality of output of the
project. Experiences gained in the RAIDP and lessons learned shall be used in planning for ne
follow-up project.

                                        Field Visit Report
A World Bank team comprising Deepak Shrestha (Senior Transport Specialist) and Keshav. B
Thapa (Consultant) visited Nuwakot and Rasua District from August 10, 2013 to August 11,
2013. The team was accompanied by Mr. Shankar Pandit, RAIDP Project Co-coordinator and Mr.
Bindeshwar Shah, PSC Team leader. This report summarizes the findings of the field visit.
1. Nuwakot District
  i) There are four ongoing road contracts in two roads. All the contracts are delayed. The
     status of the contracts is as follows:

                     Road Contracts              Progress Status (%)     Extended Completion
                                                 Physical Financial             Dates

     The first package of Nuwakot- Bageshwori- Urleni Road was inspected during the visit.
     Except for 300m section of the road, where the locals have not allowed the contractor to lay
     sub base, the contract's work of this package is substantially complete. If the sub base
     laying in this road section is not completed in the remaining 300 m section then it will be
     very difficult for vehicles to ply in this section during the monsoon. Therefore, the DDC
     needs to take up this issue urgently with the locals and LRUC members to facilitate the sub
     base laying work in this road section.
  ii) It was reported that in the remaining contract packages, the contractors are yet to re-
      mobilize (after the monsoon break) to start the construction work which was stopped during
      the monsoon. In view of the remaining project period and the past poor performance of
      these contractors, immediate start of the work with adequate resources is necessary to
      complete the work. In the meeting at DDC it was agreed that the DDC/DTO with support
      from PCU, if necessary will immediately call one to one management meeting with each
      contractor and review their resources and revised schedule to complete within December
      2013. As all contracts have been overrun the targeted completion date necessary
      instructions/ warnings may need to be issued to the contractors quoting the contract
      provisions and reminding the contractor regarding follow up actions will be taken as per
      contract provisions if instructions are not complied with. The review team cleared that the
      remaining works which is not accounted till December will be beyond the project’s bank
      financing fund.
1. Rasuwa District
  i) One Bridge contract and one road contract in two roads are ongoing in this district under
     the road upgrading component. Both the contracts are substantially delayed in view of the
     original completion date .The status of the contracts is as follows:
                     Road Contracts               Progress Status (%)        Extended
                                                  Physical Financial      Completion Dates


                                                                                    Annex P-77

     Both the construction sites were visited and found that the contractors are yet to re-mobilize
     after the monsoon break. The major remaining work in the road contract is gravel sub base
     but the contractor has not even started collection and sieving of required gravel subbase
     material which also needs to be transported. In view of the remaining project period and the
     past poor performance of these contractors, immediate start of the work with adequate
     resources is necessary to complete the work. In the meeting with the DTO Chief it was
     agreed that instructions will be issued to the contractors quoting the contract provisions and
     reminding the contractor regarding follow up actions to be taken as per contract provisions
     if instructions are not complied with. PCU/ DTO together with the LRUC agreed to
     conduct a management meeting with the contractor immediately and if there is no response
     from the contractor then start the contractual action for non-performance.
  ii) The required revision in design of the bridge approaches has become a critical activity in
      view of fixed control points of the constructed roads and the design level of the deck slab.
      Therefore, the approach road design needs to be completed immediately. PCU/PSC through
      the bridge consultant should assist the DTO to complete the design work.
  iii) The progress in two Dry-season Roads is satisfactory with more than 70 % progress
       achieved so far. The Dharapani- Rusepani-Jibjibe Road was inspected during the visit.
       Overall quality of work was observed satisfactory. However following drawbacks were
       noted for correction by the supervision team:
            Lacing and bracing work in gabion works to be provided as specified,

          Design road formation levels to be followed and continuously checked with
           appropriate level instruments. Any changes at field to be duly recorded in the design
           drawings.

          The hairpin bend at km.4+500 with 6m radius to be improved to achieve the
           designed radius or at least 8.5m radius.

          The design of road section from the bridge end to the dry-season road start point
           needs immediate action from the consultant.

          Besides the use of combination of grass and shrub trees the bio-engineering works
           needs to consider both the water management and slope stability improvement
           aspects.
