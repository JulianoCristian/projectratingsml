This restructuring\n            paper proposes the partial cancellation, as well as a\n            reallocation, of grant and loan proceeds for the Nepal Rural\n            Access Improvement and Decentralization Project (RAIDP). It\n            also proposes changes in output indicators. These changes\n            are necessary in order to adjust with the implementation\n            requirements. The reallocation is necessary to accommodate\n            the following: i) a reduced target for the construction of\n            dry season roads due to delays faced by the project in the\n            procurement of design and supervision consultants linked to\n            this particular sub-component; ii) an increased target for\n            all-weather roads and bridges. They are required to\n            accommodate requests from the Government, which were based\n            on increasing the investment impact; iii) there are savings\n            in the project due to the appreciation of US$ against the\n            Nepalese rupees; and iv) some sub-components require less\n            (e.g. consultants services and training) and some\n            sub-components require more than the allocated amount (e.g.\n            incremental operating costs)."}, "docdt": "2013-11-07T00:00:00Z"}
