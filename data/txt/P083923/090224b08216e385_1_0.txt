                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The PDO is for residents of participating districts of the Recipient to utilize improved rural transport infrastructure and services in order to have enhanced access to
                         social services and economic opportunities. Outcome Indicators. The PDO will be monitored with the following indicators: a) 20 percent increase in motorized and non-
                         motorized trips by beneficiaries by End of Project (EOP); and b) 20 percent reduction in travel time by beneficiaries by EOP. c) 30 percent increase in number of buses,
                         micro buses, jeeps and trucks plying roads.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project's progress towards achieving the Project Development Objectives (PDO) is moderately satisfactory. Impact study results of 2012 showed that values of main indicators
                         (PDO and Intermediate Outcome) had surpassed the end of the project targets in 20 project districts under the original project scopes. For instance, there had been a 60% reduction

                         20% target. An impact and socio-economic monitoring study is now being conducted that will make the comprehensive assessment of PDO indicators. The study covers the full
                         scope of the project.The study is scheduled to be completed before mid-December, 2013.

                         A restructuring of RAIDP has now been completed. The restructuring has cancelled US$6 million (SDR 3.96 million) grant/credit, reallocated funds among component and sub-
                         components. The restructuring was necessary to accommodate actual expenditures against estimated costs and to take advantage of a windfall due to the sudden depreciation of
                         Nepalese currency against US$. The cancellation of the amount will not affect the project’s outcome negatively.

                         RAIDP will formally close on December 31, 2013. The Bank team has been working closely with the project team to ensure orderly closure of the project. The Government has
                         agreed to fund any residual activities from its own sources after the project closure , in the event of non-completion of any activities. The residual activities (if any) will not affect the
                         project’s outcome negatively. The PDO and indicators appear to be relevant even approximately eight years after the start of project implementation.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Key Decisions for Disclosure

                         A restructuring of RAIDP has been completed. The restructuring has cancelled US$6 million (SDR 3.96 million) grant/credit, made reallocation of funds among component and sub-
                         components, and changed some the output level targets. The output targets have been increased in three cases and reduced in only one case. The restructuring has been necessary
                         in order to accommodate the following: i) to accommodate actual costs against the estimated costs; (iii) to take advantage of a windfall due to the steep depreciation of Nepalese
                         currency against US$. RAIDP is in the process of achieving more outputs with a lower funding level compared with resources originally allocated. The main factors for such a gain in
                         efficiency are: (i) low bid rates after the introduction of e-bidding in 2010; (ii) introduction of rigorous and effective mechanism for checking road/bridge designs and estimate.

                         The project will close in December 31, 2013. A new follow-up rural transport project namely Strengthening National Rural Transport Program (SNRTP), which has a total outlay of US
                         $ 175million, has already been negotiated with the Government and is scheduled to be presented to the World Bank Board in end-December, 2013. SNRTP is expected to be
                         effective by February, 2014.
