     RURAL ACCESS IMPROVEMENT AND DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT
                       RESTRUCTING PAPER

A.      SUMMARY
1.      This restructuring paper proposes the partial cancellation, as well as a
reallocation, of grant and loan proceeds for the Nepal Rural Access Improvement and
Decentralization Project (RAIDP). It also proposes changes in output indicators. These
changes are necessary in order to adjust with the implementation requirements.
B.      PROJECT STATUS
2.      The World Bank Board of Executive Directors approved the RAIDP on June 21,
2005 and the project became effective on August 16, 2005. The total grant amount from
the International Development Association (IDA) World Bank was SDR 21.2 million
(US$32 million). The original closing date of the project was December 31, 2010. A mid-
term review of the project was conducted in March 2009. The implementation progress
during the mid-term review was assessed as “moderately satisfactory.”
3.      On December 19, 2009, the project received an Additional Financing from IDA of
total SDR 28.50 million; (US$45 million). This means that the total IDA amount for the
project increased to SDR 49.7 million (US$76 million). The closing date was extended to
December 31, 2013.
4.       Project implementation has proceeded slower than envisaged due to the fragile
political situation in Nepal and other issues. In 2010, the project struggled to implement
activities in a number of project districts that faced violent criminal activity and
insecurity. The project also faced difficulties with procurement. The situation has
improved considerably after the introduction of e-bidding in 2010 and various remedial
management actions. More recent problems faced by the project included the sudden
transfer of the Project Coordinator in September 2012 and budget shortages due to the
Government of Nepal’s inability to approve a full budget during most of fiscal year
2012/13. However, a new Project Coordinator joined the project in early 2013, which
improved proactivity and quality in project management. In addition, a new interim
government approved a new full budget in April 2013. Key implementation issues were
brought to the attention of the Bank management. They were also discussed at different
forums with the Government.
5.      A recent review (May 2013) rated the overall project progress as "moderately
satisfactory" with improving performance trends. It is likely most likely that the project
will achieve almost all its outcome indicators. The up-to-date disbursement rate of the
project is approximately 75% of the committed amount. It is expected that the
disbursements will be substantial before the end of the schedule closing date.
C.      PROPOSED CHANGES
Financing and Project Costs
6.      The restructuring is proposing some adjustments in the project costs. A
cancellation of SDR 3.96 m (US$6.0m equivalent) is being proposed as a part of the
restructuring process. This amount is due to underspend on selected activities and savings
                                            1
in actual vs. estimated expenditures. In addition, there has been a sharp depreciation
(approximately 30%) in the Nepalese rupee since 2012 which has increased the
purchasing power of IDA funds.
Reallocation
7.     The following tables provide the details of the re-allocation of loan/grant proceeds
under different grant/credit heads.

Project implementation progress
12.     The last review (August-September, 2013) rated the overall implementation
progress as “moderately satisfactory” with improving trends. The project is most likely to
achieve its PDO indicators. The project is also likely to achieve its output indicators
barring one (the construction of dry-season roads). In some cases the project will surpass
its outputs indicator targets (e.g. all weather roads). The project has suffered due to the
issues linked to the political fragility of Nepal and due to the untimely transfer of a key
official.
13.    The proposed reallocation is necessary to accommodate the following:
      a) A reduced target for the construction of dry season roads due to delays faced by
         the project in the procurement of design and supervision consultants linked to
         this particular sub-component;

      b) An increased target for all-weather roads and bridges. They are required to
         accommodate requests from the Government, which were based on increasing
         the investment impact;

      c) There are savings in the project due to the appreciation of US$ against the
         Nepalese Rupees; and

      d) Some sub-components require less (e.g. Consultants services and training) and
         some sub-components require more than the allocated amount (e.g. incremental
         operating costs).
