The reallocation is necessary to\n            allow disbursement of remaining International Development\n            Association (IDA) funds to the microfinance institutions\n            (MFIs). The commercial banks no longer meet the eligibility\n            criteria for withdrawing further funds from the credit lines\n            and have expressed very little interest in lending to\n            agriculture.  A slowdown in lending activities in late 2008\n            early 2009, lending by microfinance institutions has fully\n            resumed, and the MFIs have taken a series of appropriate\n            measures to safeguard the health of the institutions. The\n            current allocation of funds to MFIs has been fully\n            disbursed.  MFIs have all expressed a strong interest in\n            drawing more funds from the project, particularly in local\n            currency for which supply remains difficult."}, "docdt": "2011-03-23T00:00:00Z"}
