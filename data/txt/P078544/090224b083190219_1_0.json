As a part of an effort backed by the World Bank\n            to boost development of farming in the country, the line of\n            credit was offered to farmers around Georgia to make it\n            easier for them to expand production. The conditions offered\n            under the project offered farmers an opportunity to get\n            loans with good interest rates. Cattle and dairy farmers,\n            greenhouse owners, orchard growers and others have obtained\n            credit on interesting terms through the program. Defaults\n            were less than one percent. With help from the line of\n            credit, Georgia's farmers, agri-business owners and\n            food processors boosted production, exports and the livelihoods."}, "docdt": "2012-04-09T04:36:04Z"}
