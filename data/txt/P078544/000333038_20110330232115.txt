2. 
The Project Development Objective (PDO) continues to be attainable, with 
noteworthy results and positive outcomes already achieved.  However, due to 
implementation delays and lack of disbursements under the credit line, the Project has 
been rated Moderately Satisfactory for progress towards PDO and implementation 
progress. Project implementation is progressing well, with USD 8.07 million or 80% of 
the IDA credit already disbursed. Financial management performance is satisfactory with 
good internal controls and there are no overdue audits.  Financial covenants have been 
complied with. 
3. 
The proposed reallocation is necessary to allow disbursement of remaining IDA 
funds to the microfinance institutions (MFIs). The commercial banks no longer meet the 
eligibility criteria for withdrawing further funds from the credit lines and have expressed 
very little interest in lending to agriculture.  Following a slowdown in lending activities 
in late 2008- early 2009, lending by microfinance institutions has fully resumed, and the 
MFIs have taken a series of appropriate measures to safeguard the health of the 
institutions. The current allocation of funds to MFIs has been fully disbursed.  MFIs have 
all expressed a strong interest in drawing more funds from the Project, particularly in 
local currency for which supply remains difficult.
