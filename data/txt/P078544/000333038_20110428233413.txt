SUMMARY
The proposed change is necessary to remove the limit to maximum lending to non-bank
financial institutions (NBFIs), and will increase the borrowing limit from 50% to 70% of
their equity. This change will complement the recent reallocation done on March 23,
2011 to allow disbursement of remaining IDA funds to NBFIs.


PROJECT STATUS
The Project Development Objective (PDO) continues to be attainable, with noteworthy
results and positive outcomes already achieved. Project implementation is progressing
well, with USD 8.3 million or 83% of the IDA credit already disbursed. However, due to
implementation delays and lack of disbursements under the credit line, the Project has
been rated Moderately Satisfactory for progress towards PDO and implementation
progress. Financial management performance is satisfactory with good internal controls
and there are no overdue audits. Financial covenants have been complied with.


PROPOSED CHANGES
In addition to the recent reallocation, the maximum lending to NBFIs has to be revisited.
According to paragraph (v), Section II of the Annex to Schedule 4 of the Credit
Agreement, each NBFI may currently borrow no more than 50% of their equity. This
provision was stipulated in order to reduce the exposure of the government to fairly
unregulated institutions at a time when their experience in agriculture was limited, some
of the NBFIs were still new and there was some uncertainty as to how they would
perform in the long-term. However, the Project experience has demonstrated that the
NBFIs have performed particularly well, despite some difficult economic times, and have
shown that they were able to serve this market, maintain a healthy portfolio, while
remaining sustainable.

The increase of this limit was discussed with the counterparts, and the financial health,
disbursement forecasts and interest of the NBFIs have been reviewed. The increase of the

                                           2
maximum limit to lending will allow disbursement of remaining IDA funds to NBFIs by
the closing date. The Credit Agreement will be amended accordingly.
