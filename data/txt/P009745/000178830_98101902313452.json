Project is intended to address the agricultural problems\n            specific to individual agro-ecological regions of the\n            country and to narrow the gap between research programs and\n            the needs of farmers for new technology and information. The\n            project will strengthen and reorient research at SAU and\n            strengthen ICAR's ability to support, guide, coordinate\n            and monitor agricultural research at the state level. The\n            project will focus on research on higher yielding, more\n            disease and pest resistant varieties of grain and oilseed\n            crops, and on improved cropping patterns and agronomic\n            practices, particularly for rainfed areas. Research results\n            will benefit both large and small farmers living in the\n            different ecological regions within participating states."}, "docdt": "1978-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
