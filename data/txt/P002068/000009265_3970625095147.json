Project is\n            designed to improve the performance of key transport\n            parastatals and assist the Federal Government in its initial\n            efforts more generally to reform transport parastatals. The\n            project will provide funds for three components. The first\n            includes technical assistance and training for the Nigerian\n            Ports Authority and the Nigerian Railway Corporation to: (i)\n            improve internal financial controls, accounting and\n            management information systems, (ii) define financial\n            targets, (iii) carry out revenue/cost studies, (iv) assist\n            in manpower planning and development, (v) assist in\n            improving workshops and operations, and (vi) promote more\n            effective use of computer facilities. The second component\n            involves the acquisition of computer, workshop and training\n            equipment and spare parts in support of the above-mentioned\n            technical assistance. Finally, the last project element\n            provides technical assistance and consulting services to the\n            Federal Ministry of Transport and Aviation to carry out a\n            range of policy studies including: (i) the future options\n            for other transport parastatals, (ii) defining the\n            respective roles of Nigeria Airways and private operators in\n            domestic aviation, and (iii) assessing the feasibility of\n            inter-modal transport."}, "docdt": "1986-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
