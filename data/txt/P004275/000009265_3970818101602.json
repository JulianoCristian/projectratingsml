It is designed\n            to:  (a) increase the supply of technicians and skilled\n            workers; (b) further improve the quality of training and\n            strengthen management of training; and (c) improve manpower\n            development planning.  It would provide for:  (i)\n            construction and equipping of three polytechnics, at Kota\n            Bharu, Kuching and Port Dickson, with a total enrollment of\n            4500 and a planned annual output of about 2200 technicians.\n            Within this component, the project would further finance\n            introduction of new training courses to meet industrial\n            needs; training for polytechnic staff; and strengthening of\n            management.  In addition, the project would include; (ii)\n            construction and equipping of two industrial training\n            institutes, at Alor Setar and Kota Bharu, with a total\n            training capacity of about 1000 places (at any time) and a\n            planned annual output of about 1300 skilled workers.  This\n            component would further involve the introduction of new\n            training programs to meet industrial needs; training for\n            industrial training institute staff; and strengthening of\n            management; and (iii) improvement in manpower development."}, "docdt": "1985-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
