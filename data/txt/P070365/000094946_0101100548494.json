to assist the recipient to test the reform of the water\n            sector in the Gjakove-Rahovec area. The objective will be\n            achieved through a) the sustainable and efficient provision\n            of water supply services in the project area; b) supporting\n            urgent repairs to infrastructure; c) the demonstration of\n            the viability of private sector participation in the\n            provision of water supply services; and d) the development\n            of a model for integrated water resources management in the\n            project area. There are two project components: 1) The urban\n            water supply improvement component will improve the quality\n            and efficiency of water supply provision through three\n            sub-components - the urgent infrastructure repairs\n            sub-component, the management improvement sub-component, and\n            the infrastructure rehabilitation fund sub-component. These\n            sub-components will support works and goods to resolve\n            urgent system repairs needed as a result of damage from the\n            conflict and lack of maintenance and for infrastructure\n            improvements. 2) The integrated water resources management\n            component will finance activities to develop a framework for\n            integrated water resources management for the project area,\n            focused primarily on the issue of allocation of water\n            between water supply and irrigation users."}, "docdt": "2000-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
