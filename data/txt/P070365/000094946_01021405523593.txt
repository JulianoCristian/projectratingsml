C. ENVIRONMENTAL INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING
1. Eaultment Purchases:
No new additional instruments and/or meters are intended to be purchased within the project.
2. Trainina/Studv Tours
Training will be set up for operators and other specialists if the monitoring equipment and instruments will be replaced. Duration of the training will be according to
recommendation and requirements from the supplier.
3. Consultant Services
No consultants are planned to be involved in the environmental institutional strengthening
D. SCHEDULE
The activities are identified in the Project Implementation Plan.
E. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR GJAKOVE-RAHOVEC WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Collection of data: Computerized supervision system for collection, storage, handling of data as charts, statistics, historical values etc.
Analyze of data: Analyze of data is performed by the chief of plant, chief of production and chief
of maintenance by visual review and check of collected data. Data is filed in the activities register.
Reportina: Normal procedure is that the report with filed operational data is sent to the Technical Department once a month. If the data diverge from the ordinary,
the report immediately is sent to the chief of Department for appropriate measures.
Decisions: The decision to take action, to authorize expenditures, to shut down etc. is performed by the General Director.
