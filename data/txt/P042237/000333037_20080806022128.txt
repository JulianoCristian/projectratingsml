F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives
The objective of the Project is to assist the Borrower to strengthen the local institutional
capacity, and rehabilitate and upgrade critical basic infrastructure of its remote northern
Provinces of Oudomxay and Phongsaly, so as to reduce the poverty conditions and
improve the standard of living and socioeconomic potential of the poor inhabitants of
these provinces and gradually integrate them into the Borrower's national economy.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

At the time of project preparation, key development challenges at the provincial level in
Lao PDR were the rudimentary state of basic infrastructure and its negative effects on
agricultural productivity. The lack of year-round road access in many rural areas and the
absence of basic public transport, electricity, and safe water, were hampering the
opportunities for enhanced market integration and economic production that were part of
the Country's and market integration along with the country's broader development goals.

The dominant mode of transport in the Lao PDR was and still is road transport, followed
by civil aviation. At the time of project appraisal, though the rehabilitation of the
backbone national road network was to be completed within the next two years, the
provincial and district roads were in a serious state of disrepair, incapable of providing
the rural population with year-round weather access to social services, markets, and
income-generation and employment opportunities, preventing the achievement of country
to achieve a higher levels of economic development and poverty alleviation for the Lao
PDR.

The Provincial Infrastructure Project (PIP) represented the continuation of the support the
International Development Association (IDA) had been giving to the Country's rural
areas through the Luang Namtha Provincial Development Project (Cr. 2579-LA). The
PIP was designed to address the main sector issues of rehabilitation of basic provincial
and rural infrastructure, improving the quality of the investment plans, and strengthening
local institutional capacity, all in order to achieve key objectives of the 1996 Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS).       The CAS attributed poor physical integration of the
country's sixteen provinces (half of the country's villages were found to have no access
to the main road network, and half of the network was impassable in the rainy season) to
the limited progress in reducing poverty and improving living standards in rural areas
(the national incidence of poverty was very high at 46 percent, and was particularly acute
in rural areas at 53 percent), and advocated a stronger focus on rural infrastructure and
rural development.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The objective of the project was to assist the Borrower strengthen the local institutional
capacity and rehabilitate and upgrade critical infrastructure of its remote northern
provinces of Oudomxay and Phongsaly, so as to reduce the poverty conditions and
improve the standard of living and socio-economic potential of the poor inhabitants of
these provinces and gradually integrate them into the national economy.

The key performance indicators for assessing the outcome/impact towards meeting the
development objectives were:




                                            ­ 1 ­

1.      Increase in number of staff who were trained in the field/subject concerning
        planning, budgeting, management, and specific technical areas;
2.      Number of provincial staff who have experience in budgeting and project
        management; and
3.      Reduction in time spent for traveling and transporting goods and services.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators were not revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The project investment strategy targeted beneficiaries on the selected provinces of
Oudomxay and Phongsaly (where, based on the 2005 census, population was 265,179
and 165,947 habitants, respectively). The principal aim was to provide year-round access
to the two provincial capitals and several districts, and to improve related town and rural
water and sanitation practices. Local government staff from the provincial departments
of: communication, transport, post and construction; public health; and planning and
investment also benefited from the project through capacity development and training.

The investment in treated water supply and sanitation in two major towns provided
sufficient good quality water to reduce the time people spend obtaining it, and
significantly improved basic health and hygiene, and more generally enhanced the living
conditions of residents of remote rural communities.

The project sought to build provincial-level administrative capacity to plan, design and
budget, implement, supervise and monitor development initiatives, thus reducing
dependency on for technical support from central units.

In addition, the Road Maintenance Vehicles and Equipment sub-component in Part B of
the project was cancelled after the Phongsaly DCTPC recognized that it was more
efficient to contract out civil works and decided against buying maintenance equipment.
The funds originally allocated for this purpose (US$600,000) were reallocated to the
rehabilitation of priority urban roads in Phongsaly.

1.7 Other Significant Changes

Closing Date Extensions. Two extensions of the closing date were granted, for a total of
seven months. The first extension, from November 30, 2006 to March 31, 2007, was to
complete the remedial works to the township water supply in Muang Khoua, conclude
institutional strengthening program for the provincial governments' staff, and to prepare
the results table and the final implementation report. The second extension, from March
31, 2007 to June 30, 2007, was granted to ensure the provinces' finalization of the
implementation completion report (see Annex 7).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The overall quality at entry is rated satisfactory. This assessment is based on:

Consistency with country priorities and the CAS. The project was consistent with the
Government's priority of reducing poverty. As reflected in the CAS, the strategy and
priorities were aimed at promoting growth, creating social and physical infrastructure and
targeting intervention to vulnerable groups and regions. The project objective was to
enhance connectivity among regions through better transport infrastructure, as well as
provide access to clean water and improved sanitation to encourage services and
employment opportunities to the benefit of the communities. Thus, the Bank's strategy
was to support the Borrower in designing and implementing a plan to develop rural
infrastructure ­ one that would ensure that quality was achieved at the lowest cost ­ and
facilitate capacity building through a specific technical assistance component.

The project was also consistent with the country's resolution to invest in well-focused
rural development projects, and to draw maximum participation from local authorities
and communities in accordance with the decentralization policy. The objectives of the
project were kept relatively modest by concentrating its intervention in three different
sub-sectors, which were appropriate given the limited financial and institutional capacity
of the local governments at the onset of a decentralization policy.

The emphasis given to road works were in line with the country's priority to urgently
address the lack of year round road access to certain rural areas and the absence of other
basic infrastructure needed to stimulate production and market integration. This was
relevant to the northern most Phongsaly and Oudomxay provinces, which were among
the poorest, most isolated provinces in the country, and were facing difficulties attracting
donor investment and other forms of support. Despite potentially significant preparation
and implementation costs due to the remoteness of Phongsaly and Oudomxay provinces,


                                             ­ 5 ­

IDA pioneered a decentralized, multi-sectoral operation, as it was considered critical to
the provinces' ability to attract investments and realize their economic potential through
provision of basic access to roads and water supply.

Nevertheless, there was still room for improvement in the project design with regard to
the strategic definition of road rehabilitation and on the projected capacity requirements
for the township water supply. The objective of the road rehabilitation design strategy
was to improve the roads to normal service standards at the least cost, based on the
condition and visual assessment of the distresses on each road section without detailed
designs of the road works. The first four roads rehabilitation packages, which followed
the strategy, resulted in contracts with large quantity and cost escalation. In 2002, the
rehabilitation strategy was reviewed to include systematic testing of the underlying layers
of the existing pavements, revised traffic projections, detailed geometric and structural
designs, and revised technical specifications.

Similarly, the project started in both provinces without a realistic assessment of the
districts' capacity to manage the project. The units were seriously understaffed without
key engineering positions, and the available staff were often newly appointed young
graduate engineers. In 2001-2002 the project management units were restructured and
decentralized and the key positions were filled with support from the engaged Road
Construction and Maintenance Specialists (RCMS) consultants.

According to the initial design of the township water supply for Muang Khoua, the water
treatment plan was to produce 1,100 cubic meters per hour at full capacity to cover a
service area population estimated to be 5,894 people in 1998, and a projected population
of 11,000 residents at the end of the design period of 20 years. In 2004, the population in
town was 2,625 people and the projected population to 2014 is 2,872 people, well below
the estimated number at the design stage.

Similarly, the technology chosen at project design for the water supply system comprised
an intake on the Nam Pak River with an infiltration gallery and a pumping station that
would bring raw river water and the old spring source to the new water supply. This was
neither appropriate nor efficient for the quality of water in the river and the institutional
and economic capacity of the town. The naturally high turbidity of the water, combined
with inappropriate pump specifications that did not account for this siltation, created
onerous maintenance requirements and resultant mechanical failures. A water supply
crisis in Muang Khoua ensued in 2002 and thereafter, the system could only supply water
two hours or less per day, and was further exacerbated by the inability of the water tariffs
to cover operation and maintenance.           Although the water treatment plant was
overdesigned, the water production was much lower than anticipated. The provincial
DCTPC, assisted by the Bank, proposed additional works which included a spring surface
water source with reduced operation and maintenance demands. The remedial works
were completed in 2006.

Lessons taken into Account in the Project Design

The conclusion of the May 1995 Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR)
indicated that projects focusing on a few key objectives and whose interventions were
limited to a few geographic areas had the best chance for success. Implementation
problems were found to be a result of lack of capacity and unrealistically high
expectations (by both the Government and the Bank) with regard to objectives and time
frames. The lessons incorporated in the project design reflected the experiences from two
ongoing rural infrastructure projects, the Upland Agriculture Development Project
(UADP) (Cr. 3047-LA) and the LNPDP. These included:

Carefully defined, prioritized and focused investment scenarios. The project design was
simple; the investment was focused in two poor Northern provinces and activities were
limited to constructing roads and water supply systems.

Capacity building focused on strengthening provincial administration of operations was
an integral part of the investment. To strengthen the provincial governments'
administrative functions, the project also included a major capacity development
component to support the decentralization agenda. During project design, technical
assistance and a training plan were focused on building capacity of the local authorities to
plan, coordinate and implement infrastructure investments, such that the project would be
part of daily operations and not a special unit created solely to supervise donor projects.
The responsibilities for project management, including monitoring and reporting,
financial management, procurement, and social and environmental safeguards, were
assigned to line departments within the provinces. This was the first IDA project in the
provinces and the scope was intentionally limited to implementing the infrastructure
works and strengthening the local institutional capacity.

However, expectations were not realistically established in a country dealing with a
shortage of qualified personnel. The intervention, in terms of the training program and
the technical assistance, was not well aligned to the limited resources and institutional
and human capacity of the provinces. As such, the assessment of the capacity of the
provincial departments to manage the project may have been overly optimistic and of the
specific needs for further development could have been more refined.

Consultation with provincial work units and beneficiary groups was central to project
planning, implementation and operation and maintenance (O&M). The project activities
were prepared and implemented following close consultation with the provincial
authorities and local beneficiaries. The incorporation of greater local participation,
mainly in the water supply components, encouraged ownership of the beneficiaries for
O&M of the systems.

Close coordination with provincial and National Planning Committee and Ministry of
Finance.    The roles, responsibilities, incentives, and staffing of the implementing
agencies and the national and provincial institutions involved were not well defined and




                                           ­ 7 ­

could have been coordinated to facilitate implementation procedures and shifting
decentralization of more responsibilities to the provinces.

Project Risks

The overall risk rating at entry was Moderate. A risk rating of substantial would have
been more realistic given the project was engaging provinces with rather limited
institutional capacity. The project related risks and the mitigation measures that could be
influenced by the project were identified as follows:

Lack of Government and private contractors experience to implement an externally
financed project (Moderate risk). This risk was to be minimized through a training
component and more frequent supervision during early years of project implementation.
There was also insufficient institutional capacity of the implementing agencies in terms
of skills and numbers. The risk could have been further mitigated by conducting a more
thorough capacity assessment to develop a targeted, comprehensive training and capacity
development program and requisite technical assistance. In addition, an incremental
approach to procurement with fewer contracts during the earlier years would have
facilitated a smoother learning curve. In hindsight, a Substantial rating would have been
more appropriate.

Lack of counterpart funds (Moderate risk). This risk was to be reduced by placing
emphasis on least cost technical solutions and incorporating close communication among
implementing agencies during annual budget preparation. In addition, the counterpart
fund requirement was limited to a maximum of ten percent of the civil works project cost.
In the latter stages of project execution, implementing agencies' requested assistance with
recurrent expenditures, highlighting the apparent shortage of funding for sustaining
certain operating costs. Experience with other projects in the portfolio at that time would
suggest that a Substantial rating would have been more realistic.

Poor monitoring and accountability on the use of the funds (Moderate risk). With the
proposed mitigation measure through independent auditing of project accounts,
particular attention should have been given to the skills needs and reducing the
knowledge gap at the project onset in the following main areas: procurement, financial
management, in addition to accounting and project management. A Substantial rating
would have been more realistic.

2.2 Implementation

The Mid-Term Review conducted in May 2002 concluded that, despite some cost over-
runs in the road works, the estimates of Credit commitments indicated unused funds in
contingencies that would support more than US$3.0 million of additional project
activities (within the original Project cost of US$31.1 million equivalent). In joint
discussions with the Provinces, IDA agreed to the following criteria for selecting
additional activities: consistency with project objectives, maximum impact on poverty,
satisfactory economic return, and capacity building impact. From lists presented by each



                                            ­ 8 ­

Province, the Bank gave provisional clearance for preparation of a program of about
US$3.51 million, as detailed in Table 1 above.

The implementation of the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (RWSS) component was
less successful for service delivery to primary schools and health centers in both
provinces, as in overall it reached less than 40 percent of the target. Details of the
beneficiary numbers, by Province, are provided in Annex 2. The factors contributing to
the less successful outputs in the RWSS component are summarized below:

    · The original baseline data on the schools and clinics collected were not accurate.
        For example, the actual number of clinics in Phongsaly province was only four,
        not 18. The number of schools and clinics was overestimated during project
        preparation, per requests or pressures from local government, as it included
        schools and clinics the provinces were hoping to build in the target districts
        during implementation.
    · There were some overlapping projects in some target villages in Phongsaly. Some
        of the school and clinic RWSS facilities were provided by other donors working
        in the provinces.
    · Based on the detailed technical feasibility survey, the construction of WS
        facilities was very difficult in some school and/or clinic locations, especially those
        in highland areas. Following consultations with the villages and local authorities,
        some of the WS facilities/taps were installed in nearby village areas or provided
        to the new villages instead.
    · Due to the remoteness/long distance and lack of teachers, some of the primary
        schools in those villages close to each other were consolidated.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Due to a lack of existing data sources for monitoring project progress, a project-based
M&E system was designed during project implementation. In addition, the institutional
capacity strengthening and follow-up surveys were designed such that they would
provide more in-depth assessment of the project outcomes in the provinces and a sample
of villages. There was still room for improvement in the design of the indicators ­for
example, identifying indicators for which a base line already exists or reducing the total
number of indicators to reflect only the most appropriate. The supervision team made
strong efforts to develop and improve the format and to provide recommendations for
data collection. However, reporting was delayed on a number of occasions and the
information available did not meet the requirements for M & E. This was particularly
noticeable as the project was winding down; it was difficult to maintain the provincial
authorities' engagement and to act on long term follow-up review and evaluation of the
project's impacts.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguard Compliance. The treatment of the safeguard issues for this project, classified
as category B because of its potential for adverse impacts from the construction or failure
to protect the water resources, was appropriate for the Laotian conditions and the type of


                                            ­ 9 ­

intervention. Since most of the project civil works were of rehabilitation within the
existing right-of-way, no significant impact on the physical environment activities was
expected and the environmental mitigation plan allowed the project to meet the
environmental policies. In expectation of modest land acquisition and resettlement
impacts during implementation, a Plan for Land Acquisition, Compensation and
Resettlement was developed, agreed and applied in conformity by the respective
province.

Some slope erosion protection techniques using bioengineering were tried on sites in
Oudomxay. Despite partial failures at certain locations, the practice has shown excellent
results with important savings. The provinces have been encouraged to continue using
the recently experienced low cost technique for other slope protection needs.

Fiduciary Compliance. The accounts of the implementing agencies were independently
audited for all project years. However, timely submission was often impaired as a result
of lack of interest from potential auditing firms. All audit reports were reviewed by the
Bank and considered acceptable. Some financial management and disbursement issues
were noted during project implementation, including slow disbursements, delay or lack of
counterpart contributions, and incremental operating cost overruns. To address these
issues, the disbursement division and Department of Roads worked closely to improve
reconciling accounts, recruiting auditors and preparing disbursement requests.

Procurement was carried out efficiently by the provincial authorities in accordance with
Bank policies.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The civil works were properly performed and the roads are fully operational and assumed
by the provincial departments.       The private sector participated through national
competitive contracting procedures and is capable of supporting the preservation
activities. The Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT) has prepared a National
Rural Transport Policy which will provide a framework for sustainability of the
preservation of the local roads (provincial, district and rural). Although the Ministry is
applying an improved mechanism for distributing scarce funding for road maintenance,
approval of the Policy is urgently needed to ensure adequate funding for the local roads.

The Rural Water Supply and Sanitation component of the project was designed to apply
the Lao National Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Strategy (originally launched
in 1997). The strategy was prepared by the National Centre for Environmental Health
and Water Supply (commonly known as Namsaat) under the Ministry of Health (MOH)
in a participatory manner by establishing inter-institutional working teams. In line with
the decentralization process, the project was designed with a demand responsive
approach that involved communities through a participatory assessment that would
enable them to own the facilities. These developments gave careful attention to the
arrangements after implementation and support for continued operation of the systems.




                                          ­ 10 ­

The MPWT, in consultation with the participating provinces, has been giving attention to
the transition arrangements for the town water supply, and is preparing a policy
framework within the decentralization agenda. Water tariffs are being regularly collected
and are able to cover operation and maintenance costs, although the tariffs in Phongsaly
have not been consistently updated. Stronger efforts are required from the provincial
auhtorities to keep the levels of tariffs according to the actual costs of service provision.

The institutional strengthening activities started under this project will be partially
continued for the roads sector under the IDA financed Second Phase of the Road
Maintenance Project.

With the support of the Public Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) grant
approved in 2004, the Bank assisted MPWT in assessing different management models
utilized in the region With support from the Output Based Aid Facility (OBA), additional
grant funding approved in 2006 also assisted in drafting model management contracts on
performance-based terms into its scheme designs and developing transparent bidding
processes for twenty-one small towns that currently lack access to piped water.

The Government requested Bank support in 2003 for a second provincial infrastructure
operation with similar objectives in four additional poor and remote provinces in the
Northern part of the country. The project, which was aligned with the National Growth
Poverty Eradication Strategy, was expected to build upon this operation and the
successful IDA experiences in the two previous provincial projects. Due to other
competing priorities within the available resource allocation, preparation of the project
did not proceed further. The central and provincial authorities remain eager to invest in a
second provincial/rural roads and small towns/rural water supply operation; IDA funding
is tentatively planned for 2010.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The project remained consistent with the country's National Growth and Poverty
Eradication Strategy goal of reducing poverty. The project's development objectives also
remained aligned with Bank priorities related to social service delivery and investments
in infrastructure (1996 CAS, and 1999 CAS), and sustained growth, improved social
outcomes, and reduced vulnerability (2005 CAS). In addition, despite being prepared
prior to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the project is consistent with the
global priorities and targets for the MDG. The project helped the Government to focus
on working towards these global targets, and keeping relevant the need for discussions
and actions for reform, notably in the development of alternative private sector
management models for water supply facilities.

The project design supported improvements to the backbone of the road network in the
two provinces, while simultaneously addressing the lack of year-round road access to
district centers and villages. The inclusion of air transport infrastructure contributed to



                                            ­ 11 ­

improved accessibility, particularly for emergency care and business needs. This in turn
reduced isolation of the poor and improved the living conditions and access to essential
services and markets.

By the end of 2006, there were still some 97 small towns and 2000 villages lacking
access to safe water supply and improved sanitation. Providing these services remains a
priority. The project has made available procedures and lessons and has raised the profile
of the water supply sector. Results have been encouraging and replication of the project
approach may be a suitable way forward to reach the NGPES, and the MDGs. However,
further investments in WSS are still required.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

ICR rating: Satisfactory.

Assist the Borrower to strengthen local institutional capacity. The capacity building
provided by the project proved highly effective at increasing knowledge among staff of
the provincial Departments of Communications, Transport, Post and Construction
(DCTPC), Planning and Investment, and Health, as well as local contractors and villagers.

Through the courses funded by the project, 1,930 staff from provincial departments,
districts and villages received management, financial and technical training. (Further
details of the beneficiary numbers, by province, are provided in Annex 2.) Following
training, staff gained further experience in project management and budgeting through
direct involvement on the project. Provincial staff trained through the project contributed
to the overall development and sustainability of the provincial departments and gained
experience through the day to day activities. The communities learnt to develop work
plans and village action plans, and to conduct community dialog processes and
assessment of hygiene awareness at village level.

Considerable knowledge and experience were gained in the DCTPC in contract
management and administration, and technical designs through organized courses and by
the RCMS. This is most evident in the provincial ownership of the civil works programs,
as well as their performance in undertaking the procurement process and supervision
during execution. The strengthened coordination and partnership between the central
ministry and provincial counterparts is demonstrated by the level of efficiency in the
selection and approval of proposed work programs. The knowledge and experience
acquired reinforces other general contracting activities undertaken by provincial
authorities.

However, communication and coordination between the Provincial National Center for
Environmental Health and Water Supply (Namsaat), the Department of Public Health
(DoPH), the district Namsaat and Public Health implementing agencies had marked
deficiencies. There was not a systematic approach to monitoring and evaluation of
implementation by the Provincial Namsaat and DoPH. Project reports were often not
submitted on time and the district did not make opportune communication of the
problems and issues to the Provincial Namsaat and DoPH.


                                          ­ 12 ­

Staff trained continued to work on the project and applied their new skills in management
of the project. Both provinces now have a core of competent staff that is capable of
managing the provincial activities and donor funded projects with less reliance on central
government support. However, accounting and budgeting, monitoring and reporting of
the project implementation activities were moderately acceptable.            The provincial
departments assigned a very limited capacity of the staff (in number and skills) to the
project; this had, in a few instances, impacts on project implementation. The provinces
must ensure that staffs are retained such that the knowledge and procedures developed
under the project are of future use.

Rehabilitate and upgrade critical infrastructure of its remote northern provinces of
Oudomxay and Phongsaly.

Road Rehabilitation. The rehabilitation of the two national road sections (roads No. 2 E
and W and 19), which form part of the backbone of the road network of the provinces,
has had a major positive impact by providing better roads, which in turn have facilitated
improved transport services for the population within the vicinity of those roads, travelers
within the provinces and the rest of the country, and traders and tourists from China and
Vietnam. Before the project, Road No. 2 was hardly passable and the trip from Muang
Xay to Muang Pakbeng took 10 hours; it now takes 2.5 hours (70 percent time savings).
For instance, in Muang La District in Oudomxay, prior to the rehabilitation there was
little or no ownership of motorized transport, with two buses daily passing through from
Muang Khoua. Following rehabilitation, there is now higher traffic within the district
and public transport has increased to six buses per day to Muang Xay. Similar substantial
time and vehicle operating costs reductions and traffic increases are recorded on Road No.
19 (see Data Sheet).

The improved road connections have also opened up new public transport routes with
daily service to China (via Road 1A) and to Vietnam (via Road No. 2 Muang Khoua -
Taichang) which has already increased trade and tourism in the provinces. The expected
outputs were exceeded by 13 percent (316 km of roads were rehabilitated versus 280 km
planned). Further details of the beneficiary numbers, by province, are provided in Annex
2.

Cable Ferry in Muang Khoua. Since the cable ferry was opened in 2005, there has been a
substantial traffic increase (see table below), which has facilitated transport movements
along an important regional route to Vietnam. In addition, the ferry fee has been reduced
as a result of the fuel efficiency gains enabled by the cable crossing, as the ferry benefited
from having to navigate less against river currents. The 200 percent increase in traffic
since 2003 demonstrates a significant demand for the crossing and increased economic
activity.

The Boun Neua Airport opened on December 28, 2002, with an average of two flights
per week, according to the season. However, the airport was closed for six months in
2007 as Lao Airlines retired three aircraft. A recent development is the helicopter service
from Vientiane to Phongsaly, which services two flights per week. The airport provides
prompt, year-around access to the province and its convenience is appreciated by
business people, government officials, and by the locals on emergency trips.           The
passenger traffic the last five years is averaging 1,000 passengers per year (see table

The Urban Water Supply outcomes are satisfactory as the objectives were fully achieved.
Both systems were implemented on time. By the end of the year 2006, 19,330 people in
Muang Xay and 2,376 in Muang Khoua had access to improved piped water supply. The
treated water quality is satisfactory meeting the World Health Organization (WHO) water
quality standards and is monitored monthly and annually.

The Muang Xay water supply system is making good progress towards sustainability
through proper management, good operation and maintenance of the system, and full cost
recovery by updating the water tariff to meet the expenditure needs.

At project preparation, the team guided the provinces to adopt engineering design
standards to supply water at low cost. However, in Muang Khoua the system design was
not of a rational standard as the expected demand for piped water supply was
overestimated and the system did not meet the technical design expectations. As a result,
the price of providing water to households in Muang Khoua is higher than expected.
Nonetheless, the urban water supply management in Muang Khoua would need to make
efforts to attain the level of operation and maintenance and financial stability by
increasing the water tariff to cover actual operating and management costs.

As part of the final evaluation a rapid beneficiary survey/interview was conducted. The
survey found that prior to the provision of the water supply through the connections;
households were spending significant time collecting water. Households were spending
an average of 25 minutes in Munag Xay and 45 minutes in Muang Khoua per day,


                                            ­ 14 ­

depending on the season, collecting water. Hence, the time previously used to collect
water can now be used for more productive purposes, childcare or leisure. The details of
the beneficiary surveys are provided in Annex 5.

The rural water supply schemes built under the project are meeting the WHO water
quality standards and servicing more than 71,400 villagers in 193 villages; and have
improved sanitation and health behavior through education and small investments
provided to 71,000 people in 181 villages across both provinces. Further details of the
beneficiary numbers, by province, are provided in Annex 2.

Other project achievements demonstrated the application of the national rural water
supply strategy in remote areas, increased the local awareness for environmental health
issues, and promoted participatory practices. As part of the final evaluation a rapid
beneficiary survey/interview was conducted. The survey highlighted improvements in
key water-related health behaviors as a result of the provision of the sanitation campaign
and investments. Overall health behaviors have improved; from the interviews it was
observed that over 60 percent in Oudomxay and 54 percent in Phongsaly of the
respondents currently follow safe practices for hand washing; and over 44 percent in
Oudomxay and 40 percent in Phongsaly of the respondents follow safe practices cleaning
and washing of cooking/eating utensils. Detailed results of the survey are provided in
Annex 5.

3.3 Efficiency

Economic Rate of Return

Road Rehabilitation Investments.      The ex-post economic evaluation of the road
rehabilitation sub-component was prepared by the Bank using the Roads Economic
Decision Model (RED) version 3.2. The model was developed by the World Bank for
the economic evaluation of low volume roads, which estimates project benefits in terms
of reduction in road user costs (vehicle operating costs plus passenger time costs). The
project roads were rehabilitated and sealed with Double Surface Treatment and the
average rehabilitation cost was US$59,614 per km. It is worth noting that this cost is
considered low when compared with the regional average.

The table below presents the economic evaluation results per contract and for the overall
rehabilitation program. The analysis assumes a 15 year evaluation period for all roads at a
discount rate of 10 percent to be consistent with the ex-ante economic evaluation. The
overall program Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is 24 percent and a Net Present Value
(NPV) of US$17.1 million suggests that the road rehabilitation strategy, as applied,
provided an economic approach, given the condition of the old pavement and the traffic
projections under the assumption of normal loading of heavy vehicles.        Four sections
presented low returns (IRR at or <9 percent) for they sustain very low traffic; however,
these sections represent important regional or international links. (See Annex 3 for
further details).




                                         ­ 15 ­

The road rehabilitation strategy outlined at appraisal was based on the requirement to
rehabilitate and improve selected roads. It was not possible to compare the appraisal
stage economic rate of return with the re-calculated IRR as the estimates of traffic and
road rehabilitation cost, per road section, are no longer available.

Boun Neua Airfield. The existing runaway was upgraded with a new alignment, as its
safety made it the most viable option. This option had a cost of US$1,120,000 (ten
percent higher than the original estimate, but represents less than four percent of the total
project cost). As described in the previous section, the traffic statistics indicate an
average annual traffic of 1,000 passengers in and out of Phongsaly, which is well below
the appraisal estimate. However, due to problems with commercial aircraft service, we
are unable to estimate the growth pattern of air traffic and to determine the economic
viability of the airfield beyond the fact that it provides convenient access to the province.
Although it is expected that the service will improve, we would not know yet that the
airfield will be economically viable in the future.

Urban Water Supply (UWS) Systems in Muang Xay and Muang Khoua. The estimated
at appraisal and actual costs at completion of Muang Xay and Muang Khoua water
supply are depicted in the following table. As can be noted, the actual completion cost of
the UWS systems are ten and thirteen percent lower than its estimate at appraisal for
Muang Xay and Muang Khoua, respectively.

The population growth rate, population served, number of connections and current water
tariffs in Muang Xay and Muang Khoua are presented in the table below.

                           Table 6: Urban Water Supply System Attributes

Current household water tariffs   1,291 Kip/cum                   1,050 Kip/cum

Both Muang Xay and Muang Khoua UWS systems utilized the standard least-cost
effectiveness methodology which incorporates technical, environmental, financial, and
social criteria into the decision-making process. At project closing, people from both
towns were benefiting from reliable supply of safe piped water.                 The number of
beneficiaries in Muang Xay is 23 percent less than estimated at the time of appraisal; and
it is 61 percent less in Muang Khoua for the design shortcomings described in the
previous section.

The systems have been managed relatively well, although operation and maintenance has
suffered from the reluctance of the provincial authorities to raise the tariffs and this is a
source of concern. Muang Xai has adequate capacity and revenue for the near term and
has no specific plan for post completion operation. On the other hand, due to over-design
of Muang Khoua water supply system, it would need additional technical and financial
support to expand capacity of its water supply distribution networks, with final goal of
achieving full cost recovery to meet its operation and maintenance expenditures.

The systems are still on their early days, they are running with seven days a week 20 to
24 hours service to the towns households; it will be important to carry on a detailed
economic reevaluation once data becomes available.

Cost Effectiveness

Actual project costs were within five percent of the estimates, and contingencies were
reallocated mainly to extend the quantity of the works. This reallocation, combined with
the savings resulting from the competitive bidding processes, allowed for an increased
number of staffs trained and for the rehabilitation of a longer length of road than
originally planned. While most of the costs were equal to or lower than expected, the
cost of administering the project was higher than it should have been, largely due to the
lack of experience of the government staff in the process. In addition, IDA's flexibility
in providing additional resources for incremental operating costs greatly facilitated the
provinces' ability to implement the project, which would have otherwise faced
difficulties.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

The overall outcome is rated Satisfactory. This overall rating is based on the review of
achievements of the main project objectives (Section 3.2), the compliance with the
safeguards (Section 2.4) and the ex-post economic evaluation of the project (Section 3.3).

The key aim of strengthening the local institutional capacity was achieved for a
significant number of staff. The physical components for rehabilitation and upgrading of
basic transport and water supply and sanitation infrastructure in the project provinces
enabled time savings for both travel and water gathering. Completion of the cable ferry
crossing and airport rehabilitation were crucial linkages in facilitating connectivity and
ensuring access. Though also attributable to many other factors, the project contributed to
reducing the conditions associated with poverty by improving the standard of living and
socioeconomic potential while gradually integrating rural communities into the Laotian
economy.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The project aimed at assisting Lao PDR to reduce the poverty conditions of the
inhabitants of two remote Northern provinces of the country. It was designed to provide
access to transport and social services; and to reduce the travel time for people and goods.
The project assisted in reducing the time poor villagers were spending collecting water
from raw sources. Access to safe water and appropriate sanitation and hygiene services
led to health benefits to the poor.      In addition, improved health resulted in more
productive workdays and in savings to the poor households from reduced medical
expenditures. The project also provided school water supply and latrines with hand
washing facilities and health education activities.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

See Section 3.2 above.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

The poor population of the project provinces of Oudomxay and Phongsaly are reaping
benefits from the project roads, as there has been a significant increase in agricultural
production, with produce being exported to China and Vietnam. Although this is not an
outcome of the project investment, the improved vehicle access has contributed to this
development and the increment of the rural communities' incomes. Conversely, these
production activities are happening with very little control. The new areas opened for
agricultural produce are mostly mountainous areas, which are sensitive to deforestation
and soil erosion. The central and the provincial authorities should ensure that any
development is carried out in a sustainable manner and with minimum impact to the
environment and the existing infrastructure. Towards this end, the authorities should
create conditions to manage the land use problem through strong laws and institutions.



                                           ­ 18 ­

While the provision of improved water supply has promoted social and economic
development of Muang Xay and Muang Khoua, the untreated waste water has potential
negative consequences if not dealt with properly. The long-term development horizon of
the sector should recognize the need for ensuring delivery first, with waste water and
sewage addressed during latter stages, given the resource constraints that may determine
a phased approach. The local government and related departments would have to ensure
proper management and handling of the waste water generated, to avoid causing
detrimental impacts to the environment.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

According to the beneficiary survey results, 70 percent of interviewees in Maung Xay
and 33 percent in Muang Khoua hold the view that their income has increased due to the
township water supply. Most notably, all respondents agree that the services are
supplying good quality water and of sufficient volume. Furthermore, all respondents
agree that there has been a marked improvement in individual health benefits. However,
the survey results for the rural water supply component suggest that there has only been a
modest change in behaviors related to sanitation practices, the handling of water and the
general knowledge of associated water-born illnesses.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

The risk to development outcomes is considered Substantial. The assessment is based on
consideration of the institutional capacity at project completion, technical considerations,
and financial viability of the investments.

A robust road maintenance regime and adequate maintenance funding must be
internalized if access and level of service are to be maintained. There is now a healthy
local contracting industry available for the ongoing maintenance program and for future
road rehabilitation works. Both the provincial authorities and contractors have developed
skills in bid preparation and contract management and have demonstrated the advantages
that competitively bid works bring in terms of cost efficiency. The central Government
and Provinces confront a difficult challenge in the need to address a substantial financial
gap for road maintenance in the medium term, and to control heavy transport and road
safety. Although the roads have been built to standards, the current level of funds
provided by the road fund and the allocations from the provincial budgets are not enough
compared with the road preservation needs. In order for the Government and the
Provinces to meet these needs, incremental additions of the revenues earmarked for road
maintenance and to the provincial road maintenance budget are required.

In addition, a related issue is the heavy loaded truck traffic on the project roads. Roads
completed by the project are exposed to daily overloaded trucks transporting various
agricultural and other goods, particularly on the roads connecting to neighboring China
and Vietnam. The Oudomxay and Phongsaly DCTPC supported by the MPWT should
exercise stricter control of overloaded traffic to reduce and eventually eradicate this
practice. A failure by the authorities to act promptly will result in shortening of the
useful life of these roads and higher maintenance costs.


                                           ­ 19 ­

Lao PDR's strategic decentralization efforts must continue to focus on skills
development, quality control and operational management aspects. This is particularly
true for improving the management of Nampapas in terms of water tariff setting, financial
management and accounting practices, and operation & maintenance activities. Staff
retention and life time training of water supply plant managers, accountants and operators
is critical to the sustainability of the rural and town water supply schemes.

The financial viability of the water supply and sanitation services remains tenuous.
Both Muang Xay Water Supply Enterprise of Lao (Nampapa) and Muang Khoua
Nampapa imposed one time water connection fees, monthly water meter rental fees, and
water tariffs to cover water production costs, operation and maintenance (O&M) only.
While the Oudomxay Nampapa has increased water tariffs annually to enhance cost
recovery, financial reports indicate that it only achieved the O&M cost recovery
milestone at the end of 2006. Financial sustainability of the Oudomxay Nampapa is
likely.

The Muang Khoua Nampapa has maintained the same water tariffs since 2001. The
combination of Muang Khoua water treatment plant over-design (the plant is operating at
about 45 percent of its actual design capacity), the household income levels of both its
users and potential customers, and the outdated tariff levels, are the main reasons why the
system has underperformed. The financial accounts of the Muang Khoua Nampapa have
shown deficits since the commission of the new water supply system in 2001, therefore,
financial sustainability of Muang Khoua Nampapa would require strong efforts from the
Province to make it likely.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

IDA's performance in the preparation stage is rated Satisfactory. During preparation, the
task team ensured that the development objectives and the project scope were consistent
with the country's priorities and the CAS. The team properly assessed the sectoral issues
and needs of the provinces, the overall context in which the project was to be
implemented and designed well-focused project components. However, the initial
assessment of capacity needs lacked a realistic plan to cover the skills gap and would
have been useful in developing an appropriate capacity development plan, thus resulting
in a scattered approach to training initiatives. The team complied with relevant safeguard
policies and assessed the economic viability of the project's major road works, airfield,
and the urban water supply systems.

Prequalification of contractors commenced after effectiveness of the Credit and
contracting started eight months later. Work on the first two road contracts commenced
in November 1999. The contracts were extended for six months in Phongsaly and 20
months in Oudomxay, with substantial increases in quantities mainly due to changes in
pavement specifications. The project design of the road rehabilitation and the Muang


                                               ­ 20 ­

Khoua township water supply shortcomings could have been avoided if IDA had required
a comprehensive detailed design of the road and township works and assessed the client's
readiness for implementation prior to project approval.

(b) Quality of Supervision

IDA performance during supervision is rated Satisfactory.        IDA conducted regular
supervision missions, averaging two missions per year; the expertise of the team
members was high and usually included an appropriate skill mix, supported by the
Bank's Vientiane, Bangkok and Hanoi offices. The World Bank Water and Sanitation
Program (WSP) team provided extensive support on the water supply and sanitation
aspects of the project.

Most missions made field visits and were able to provide technical and other advice to
resolve issues based on actual conditions. The early supervision missions concentrated
on implementation facilitation such as construction standards, procurement, quality of
works and safeguards. Later missions looked after results such as project management,
reporting, capacity development targets, accounting, health education and hygiene
promotion activities and models for piped water supply. An important benefit of the
support provided by the Bank was sharing lessons on the possible private sector
participation, made possible with PPIAF and GPOBA grants. However, it was not
always possible to integrate a water supply specialist in the project activities to
sufficiently and efficiently respond to outstanding issues, as would have been the task
team preference.

There were three different task managers; the last of which supervised about half of the
project duration. At the Mid-Term Review, having observed improved performance of
the provinces, IDA: cleared acceleration of remaining work on National Road 2E for
Oudomxai DCTPC; supported expansion of the UWS component in Oudomxay and in
Muang Khoua; and identified needs for improvements in the management of the RWSS
component, thus demonstrating flexibility in administering the project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

IDA overall performance is rated Satisfactory. The PIP was a follow up project from the
Luang Namtha Provincial Development Project, but was the first IDA project for the two
northern remote provinces. Furthermore, the Bank attended to client requests in an
appropriate manner as issues emerged, proactively engaged with the implementing
agencies, both in the capital and in the provinces, provided regular supervision of
procurement and FM aspects and supported project implementation, hence contributing
to achievement of PDOs.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance




                                           ­ 21 ­

The Government performance is rated Satisfactory. Under the country's decentralization
policy, the project was executed by the two provinces with limited involvement by the
central authorities. For technical needs, the provincial governments received advice from
the concerned line ministries (e.g. MCTPC for road and township water, and the Ministry
of Health for rural water). However, further improvements could have been made earlier
to the institutional arrangements for more effective management by further decentralizing
responsibilities to the provincial and district level.

Project implementation was affected by weak institutional capacity, and decision making
sometimes was cumbersome. At the provincial level, many issues had to be brought up
to the Provincial Department of Planning and Investment (DPI) for decision.            For
example, DPI was the coordinator for the capacity development program and the
consolidated financial management; this was operated with unclear instructions and
unfamiliarity with the work.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

The overall implementing agencies performance is rated Satisfactory.

DCTPC. The DCTPC carried out the major civil works with quality and within budget,
though not in the time frame for reasons out of its control. The starting date of the
second batch of contracts was delayed over two years as a result of the need to strengthen
limited institutional capacity and the need for assistance from consultants. The civil
works were supervised by capable international consultants who supported provincial
capacity and transferred best-practice knowledge to public and private sector engineers
and technicians while also helping to sustain the pace of project delivery. Good
cooperation occurred among the implementing units of DCTPC, particularly with the
township water supply management.

It is essential that the DCTPC alerts the MPWT and other concerned authorities about
current truck overloading incidents in order to ensure effective counter measures, as the
current situation is causing serious damage to the project roads. The use of mobile scales,
in addition to the permanent weigh stations that are being supported by the IDA financed
Road Maintenance Program (Phase 2), can be used to carry out spot checks at different
locations.

The Water Supply Enterprise of Lao (Nampapa Lao), which reports to the DCTPC, was
responsible for the implementation of the township water supply. The Oudomxay and
Muang Khoua Nampapas completed all planned investments in a timely manner and were
adequately staffed. Although the Nampapas face financial difficulties, local government
support is required to ensure cost recovery and to maintain water tariffs at an adequate
level to meet the operation and maintenance cost.

The Provincial National Center for Environmental Health and Water Supply (Namsaat)
and the Department of Public Health (DoPH). The Rural Water Supply and Sanitation
activities were implemented under an innovative approach to service provision by a
demand responsive approach. The decentralization policy was supported extensively by


                                            ­ 22 ­

the Namsaat Central through clear policies and training to the provincial and district staff.
Community dialogue led to good community mobilization and represents a best practice
case as an effective method of community participation and mobilization.

However, communication and coordination among the Provincial Namsaat, DoPH, and
the district Namsaat in project implementation had some limitations. There was no
systematic monitoring and evaluation of implementation approach by the Provincial
Namsaat and DoPH. Project reports were often not submitted on time and the district did
not communicate in an opportune manner the problems and issues to the Provincial
Namsaat and DoPH.          Greater support and oversight by the provinces could have
strengthened and improved the implementation and monitoring of the schemes and
latrines for better operation and maintenance.

Department of Planning and Investment. The project management and coordination role
of the DPI at the local level was particularly important for project implementation. The
progress of the project relied a great deal on the DPI response. The complexity involved
in parallel implementation in two provinces caused delay from time to time of required
accounting activities, training event clearances and general reporting. The Bank's Mid-
Term Review mission, as well as subsequent missions, noted the improvement in
accounting capacity, as evidence of strengthened institutional ability. However, the
improvements were not always constant and the reporting results were spotted. This was
noticeable as the project was winding down, and ownership of the provincial authorities
was very low for the long term follow-up review and evaluation of project results.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

The overall Government performance is rated Satisfactory. Significant physical outputs
outperforming the original targets have resulted, along with recognizable capacity
enhancement at all levels in the project provinces. IDA consistently rated project
implementation satisfactory for good project performance and attention to fiduciary and
safeguards issues. The local governments implemented the project satisfactorily; except
for the accounting and project activities monitoring and reporting which was not always
conducted according with the agreed guidelines.

6. Lessons Learned

The multi-sectoral approach and the implementation delegated at the provincial
level proved to be efficient. The project adopted a multi-sectoral implementation
approach for road transport, urban water supply, rural water supply and capacity
development, through sector based provincial units. The organizational arrangements and
coordination among components were challenging at times, for they required changes in
the working methods to constant and open communication among the various units.
However, synergy was created particularly on the road, town and rural water components
for cooperation and fulfillment of common interests.

Accessibility to project financing for the provinces should be through a competitive
process based on performance. The project allocated funding per province based on the


                                            ­ 23 ­

needs and the perceived capacity of the provincial institutions, with the stronger province
acting as the project coordinator. The incentives for good performance diminished as the
Credit resources became scarcer, and completing the final activities for the dependent
province was extremely challenging. In future projects funding should be allocated using
a programmatic approach; with provisions for each province to act independently and for
funding in subsequent years allocated according to a previously agreed rating based on
performance.

The project design and cost estimate for civil works should include detailed design
for proper assessment of the material and monetary resource needs.                   Project
preparation was based on visual assessments and a few road materials samples, and that
main engineering decisions would be made on site jointly by the supervising engineers
and contractors. This practice provided inadequate information on the condition of the
existing pavements and in consequence ­ together with the low capacity of the provincial
staff ­ required changes in the rehabilitation design and escalation of quantities and cost
of the road works.

Upfront consideration to the increased waste water produced by the new water
supply system needs to be given. At the time of project preparation, one of the urgent
basic infrastructures needed in the provinces was reliable water supply in quantity and
quality. The project financed the construction of water supply systems and schemes, but
a system to collect the used water or sewage was not included. The additional water use
as a result of the project produced free outside running water which is unhealthy and
damages the surrounding structures and landscape. A plan on how to handle the used
water has to be taken in consideration at the same time as the town water supply system
is being contemplated for funding support.

Appropriate measures for preventing truck overloading are critical to extending
road life cycles and reducing maintenance costs on the newly rehabilitated road
investments. The project roads were designed as low volume, low cost roads with
pavements strengthened to withstand increased normal traffic generated after the
rehabilitation. However, the pavements have been continuously exposed to the impact of
high contact stressing due to heavily overloaded trucks transporting various agricultural
and other goods. Overloaded trucks were observed on NR-02 from Muang Xay to Pak
Beng during the maize harvest from September to January each year, and on NR-19 from
Pakkha to Ban Yo during the sugar cane harvest. Overloaded trucks have also been
observed on NR-19 traveling from the Chinese border through Phongsaly to Vientiane.
Failure from the Government to take proper measures to prevent such overloading will
result in shortening of the useful life of these roads and increase maintenance costs.

Key reflections shared and discussed include the following:

·      Each province has developed sufficient capacity to implement projects by external
       (international) funding (e.g. contractor management, procurement), thus in the
       future, per-province project financing should be pursued from the view point of
       efficiency and optimal project management.
·      Multi-sector approach has proven to be effective in both provinces, and PIP
       model should be advocated.
·      Fund management at the province level provided a good opportunity for
       developing capacity of the provincial staff.
·      Closer supervision by the World Bank, particularly at the initial stage of
       implementation, would have enabled smoother operation.
·      From the technical perspective, central government (Ministry of Public Works
       and Transport) played an important role in providing advice as required; however,
       all the administrative arrangements were made by the Governors' Offices and
       these arrangements provided provincial government staff with opportunity to
       acquire skills required for project management.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

I.     Transport Access Component (Appraisal estimate US$23.31 million; actual
       US$23.47 million)

1.     The component activities aimed to improve physical access through road
rehabilitation and maintenance of roads in Oudomxay and Phongsaly Provinces, and also
provided for the reconstruction of Boun Neua airfield and a ferry crossing over the River
Ou in Muang Khoua. The expected outputs were successfully achieved, the details of
which are highlighted below.

(i)    Road Rehabilitation, Maintenance and Spot Improvements (Appraisal
       estimate US$21.84 million, actual US$22.03 million)

2.     In total, 316 km of roads were upgraded and rehabilitated exceeding the target by
13 percent. In Oudomxay Province, a total of 199 km of roads were rehabilitated along
Road No. 2W between Muang Pakbeng and Muang Xay (144 km); Road No. 2E between
Muang Xay and Phongsaly border (52 km); and a hospital access road of 2 km. In
Phongsaly Province, 117 km of roads were rehabilitated along Road No. 2E between
Oudomxay Border and Muang Khoua (48 km) and Road No. 19 between Boun Nua and
Ban Pakha - China Border (60 km); and 8.5 km of urban roads in Phongsaly Municipality.

3.     Thirteen road maintenance, spot improvements and emergency maintenance
contract packages covering a total length of approximately 327 km were tendered in both
Provinces. Although 18 contracts were originally envisioned for spots improvements, the
original target of 329 km was completed in terms of road length covered. In Oudomxay,
five contracts were awarded for maintenance and spot improvement of badly damaged
sections of Road No. 2E and on Road No. 2W (covering 218 km); and 5 km of urban
roads. Two additional emergency maintenance contracts were awarded for the removal of
landslides affecting Road 2W. In Phongsaly, six maintenance contracts covered 110 km,
including the repair of the drainage structures along 50 km of the road Muang Khoua to
Taichang ­ Vietnam Border. An additional package per province was awarded for traffic
signage and markings for 101 km of Road No. 2 E and 83 km of Road No. 19.

4.     The sub-component also provided for the construction of the materials testing
building in Oudomxay and an office building and materials testing laboratory in
Phongsaly provincial departments of Communications Transport, Post and Construction
(CTPC). At the mid-term review, an agreement was reached to finance the construction
of a meeting room in Oudomxay and the CTPC district office buildings in seven districts.
The project went beyond its target of constructing an office and laboratory building for
Phongsaly DCTPC only.

(ii)   Boun Neua Airfield (Appraisal estimate US$1.25 million, actual US$1.12
       million)

5.     The sub-component financed the reconstruction of the Boun Neua airstrip in
Phongsaly Province; a new runway (900 m long and 18 m wide) was constructed. At the



                                          ­ 27 ­

commencement of construction the runway was re-aligned to avoid and minimize
obstacles on takeoff and landing. The 350 m access road and an 800 m bridge crossing
over the Nam Boun River were also built. The procurement and installation of the air
navigation equipment was added after the mid-term review. At the present time, the
airfield is operated by a private operator with helicopter services, twice a week from
Vientiane to Phongsaly.

(iii)   River crossing system (Appraisal estimate US$0.22 million; actual US$0.32
        million)

6.      The subcomponent financed the construction of a cable river crossing over the
river Ou, linking Road No. 2E in Muang Khoua in Phongsaly Province. The scope of
works involved the construction of a new ferry crossing and the reconstruction of the
ferry ramps on both river banks. The improvement of the ferry was key for the re-
establishment of the road traffic with neighboring Vietnam. Annual traffic in 2006 was
5,475 vehicles.

II.     Township water supply (TWS) (Appraisal estimate US$3.96 million, actual
        US$3.57 million)

7.      The component provided township water supply systems in Muang Xay
(Oudomxay) and Muang Khoua (Phongsaly), including the facilities and infrastructure to
deliver sufficient water supplies of reliable quality. The project outputs of putting into
operation piped water supply systems was largely completed as detailed below:

8.      For Muang Xay Nampapa, the outputs attained include: (i) a new water supply
plant (complete with chemical dosing, rapid and slow mixing, sedimentation, filtration,
and disinfection facilities) with a capacity of 3,800 m3/day; (ii) a new river intake on
Nam Ko River capable of pumping 79 m3/h (cubic meters per hour); (iii) a new clear
water reservoir with 1,860 m3 capacity and a new bulk flow meter; (iv) an improved
water distribution network extending service to Muang Xay residents and a hospital; and
(v) a new service reservoir (120 m3 capacity) and booster pump (26 m3/h) in Houikhoum.

9.      In 2005, the Muang Xay Nampapa management made a number of improvements
to the system by purchasing, with its own funds to provide water 24 hours per day, a new
pump set (spec: 80m3/hr) and an extra pump set and additional motor for back-up (95-
110m3/hr). The number of benefited residents who are served with quality project-
supplied water by 2007 is 19,330 persons (28 above the target by the end of the year 2004
of 15,000). The water quality has been reported satisfactory in the past years.

10.     For Muang Khoua Nampapa, the outputs attained include: (i) a new water supply
plant (complete with chemical dosing, rapid and slow mixing, sedimentation, filtration,
and disinfection facilities) with a capacity of 1,000 m3/day; (ii) a new river intake on
Nam Pak River with pumps and pipelines which bring new raw Nam Pak water and the
old spring source to the new water supply plant; (iii) a new clear water reservoir and bulk
flow meter; and (iv) a new water distribution network extending service to Muang Khoua
residents. The number of benefited residents who are served with quality project-



                                          ­ 28 ­

supplied water by 2007 is 2,376 persons (72 percent of the number of projected
beneficiaries using a projected population of 3,300 at the end of the project). As noted in
Section 3.2 during project design the original number of habitants was overestimated
leading to further miscalculation in the 20 year design period population forecast. The
water quality has been reported satisfactory in the past years.

11.     As per agreement at the mid-term review the Muang Khoua Nampapa added a
new stream source (Houay Song Nam Mun) that flows to the water treatment plant by
gravity, with an intake and a pipeline 3 km long. The civil works were finalized and the
system started operating with the new water source in 2006.

III.    Rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS) (Appraisal estimate US$2.92
        million, actual US$1.94 million)

12.     The component provided water supply and to more than 71,400 people in 193
villages, including sanitation services and hygiene awareness promotions for 71,000
people in 181 villages across both provinces. The achievements exceeded the targets of
42,000 people covered by 38 percent for water supply and 37 percent for sanitation.

13.     In Oudomxay's Beng, Houn and Pakbeng Districts the rural water supply services
reached 52,006 persons in 117 rural and remote villages, more than doubling its initial
target of 24,000 people in 90 villages. Like wise, the Province installed rural sanitation
services for 56,807 persons in 126 villages.          The project also assisted with the
construction of one provincial and three district Namsaat offices. Less successful was
RWSS service delivery to primary schools and health centers, where the project reached
4,812 students in 31 schools (from its goal of 7,680 students in 64 primary schools) and
seven health centers (from its goal of 18 health centers) while failing to provide any
connections to schools or health clinics (from its original plan to provide services for 64
schools and 18 clinics).

14.     In Phongsaly's Boun Tai, Khoua and Mai Districts the rural water supply services
reached 19,360 persons in 76 remote villages, slightly more than its initial target of
18,000 in 75 villages, while also installing rural sanitation services for 12,975 persons in
55 villages. Less successful was Rural Water Supply service delivery to primary schools
where the project reached 655 students in 16 schools (from its goal of 6,240 students in
52 schools), and installed rural sanitation services for 1,272 students in 23 schools, while
failing to provide any connections to health clinics (from its original plan to provide
services for 18 clinics).

IV.     Institutional strengthening (Appraisal estimate US$0.90 million, actual
        US$1.19 million)

15.     The component supported developing technical and administrative capacity
within provincial government offices for planning, implementing and operating
infrastructure investments. An expanded capacity development program was
implemented by means of on-the-job training, formal courses, workshops and study tours.



                                           ­ 29 ­

A capacity development program for each sub-sector (roads, urban water supply and rural
water supply) was also implemented.

16.     The table below shows the results of the training program under the project by
number of participants. Overall the achievements of the institutional strengthening
component are: a total of 143 courses were attended by 1,930 participants, where 707 and
1,223 persons belong to Oudomxay and Phongsaly provinces (Department of
Communications Transport Post and Construction; Department of Planning and
Investment, Department of Health, Department of Finance, Urban Water Supply Office,
Rural Water Supply Office, and the districts), respectively. The long term studies at the
local and regional universities were mainly on the subjects of finance, accounting,
economics, marketing, and engineering, for a total of 78 bachelors and three master
degrees.

17.     The transport access teams training was provided by the road construction and
maintenance specialist in the areas of road design, procurement and preparation of bids,
contract supervision and quality control, and English language; for a total of 13 events
with 77 participants. Training materials, short seminars and on-the-job trainings were
also attended by the supervising and contractors' staff.

18.     The provincial departments of Planning and Investment led a comprehensive
capacity development program with 37 events, and a bachelor and master degrees
program. The main areas of study were Commerce, Engineering and English language.
The trainings benefited 1,160 staffs and villagers from the provinces.

19.     For the urban water supply, 60 studies and training courses (including a study tour
to Malaysia and Indonesia) were organized for the provinces of Oudomxay and
Phongsaly for a total of 90 persons receiving training. Related to rural water supply and
sanitation 33 courses, workshops and study tours were conducted. A total of 603 persons
were trained, of these 13 percent were women and 51 percent were from the villages.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Ex-post Evaluation Assumptions

The ex-post economic evaluation of the road rehabilitation sub-component was prepared
by the Bank using the Roads Economic Decision Model (RED) version 3.2. The model
was developed by the World Bank for the economic evaluation of low volume roads, that
estimates project benefits in terms of reduction in road user costs (vehicle operating costs
plus passenger time costs). The project roads were rehabilitated and sealed with Double
Surface Treatment and the average rehabilitation cost was US$59,614 per km. The table
below presents the adopted representative vehicle fleet characteristics based on a
preliminary 2007 update of the Lao Road Management System unit costs parameters.

The economic evaluation considered the road rehabilitation of 314.7 kilometers
representing a total investment of US$18.8 million under sixteen contracts. The table
below presents the average section characteristics per contract. The 2003 average traffic
of the roads is 117 vehicles per day with, on average, 49 percent of trucks and buses and
46 percent of motorcycles. The project roads were bituminous roads in very poor
condition that were constructed to a bituminous paved standard over 20 years ago. The
rehabilitation method of the project roads was to strengthen the pavement with a 20 cm
thick sub-base course layer, followed by a 10 cm base course layer, and a double

The table below presents the actual financial road works unit costs per contract. The
average actual rehabilitation cost is US$59,614 per km, while the unit cost estimated at
appraisal was US$49,600 per km. Project cost were 20 percent higher than the estimates.
This is explained by the increased thickness of the sub-base and base pavement layers
and the large amounts of sub-soil soft material that had to be removed in some sections
which were not accounted for in the original designs. Most road works started in 2002-
2003 and the construction period was on average two years. It is worth noting that the
cost per km is considered low when compared with the regional average.

Economic Internal Rate of Return of the Investments

The table below presents the economic evaluation results per contract and for the overall
rehabilitation program. The analysis assumes a 15 year evaluation period for all roads at a
discount rate of 10 percent to be consistent with the ex-ante economic evaluation. The
overall program Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is 24 percent and a Net Present Value
(NPV) is US$17.1 million, suggesting that the road rehabilitation strategy, as applied,
provided and economic approach given the condition of the old pavement and the traffic
projections, under the assumption of normal loading of heavy vehicles.       Four sections
presented low returns (IRR at or <9 percent) for they sustain very low traffic, however,
these sections represent important regional or international links.

The road rehabilitation strategy outlined in the PAD was based on the requirement to
rehabilitate and improve selected roads. It was not possible to compare the appraisal
stage economic rate of return with the re-calculated IRR as the estimates of traffic and
road rehabilitation cost, per road section, are no longer available.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

As a part of final evaluation, rapid beneficiary surveys/interviews were conducted in
March 16 ­ 22, 2007 for Township Water Supply (TWS) and from June 15 to 23, 2007
for Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (RWSS) components.

1. Key Findings from Beneficiary Rapid Survey: Township Water Supply (TWS)

A rapid survey of the TWS component beneficiaries was conducted and key findings
relevant to the TWS component objectives are summarized in the table below:

2. Key Findings from Beneficiary Interviews: Rural Water Supply and Sanitation
    (RWSS)

An assessment on sustainability and impacts of the RWSS on the target communities was
undertaken through beneficiary interview and observation covering 43 sample
beneficiary households in 9 target villages of three districts. The findings of the
assessment are as follows:

Oudomxay Province. A summary of the impacts of the activities on hygiene behavior
and health are listed below:

    · Boiling water for drinking is a unique water cleaning practice of the communities.
         Most of the surveyed households boil water for drinking when they are at home
         but only 23.5% of the households handle safe water practice regularly; with the
         other 73.5% still drink un-boiled water when they are working out side of the
         village.
    · Most of the selected interviewees like and have gotten used to using a latrine. The
         households who do not have latrines are mostly disadvantaged new settler



                                              ­ 37 ­

       households and people who mostly live in their farmed land far away from the
       village.
   · From the interviews, it is observed that over 60% of the interviewees currently
       follow safe practices on hand washing, and 44% on cleaning and washing of
       cooking/eating utensils.
   · Diarrhea and skin disease cases reported by the surveyed households, is identical
       only at 18%.
   · Over 55% of selected interviewees have considerable knowledge on both diarrhea
       infection in human and diarrhea prevention; but conversely about 70% of the
       households have poor knowledge on skin disease prevention.
   · Household methods for diarrhea treatment has considerably changed, about 53%
       of surveyed households gained full access to public health service at village and
       district level and the other 26% take modern medicine only.
   · The hygiene education team made significant achievement; the assessment
       indicated that 63% of the surveyed households get information about disease
       prevention from the project health workers.

Operation and maintenance interviews indicated that:

   · The selected interviewees have a good sense of responsibility for operation and
       maintenance (O&M) of RWWS facilities and strong commitment to bearing all
       O&M task and related costs;
   · 98% of surveyed households are able to pay the water fee; the rest does not want
       to pay because their water supply system is seriously broken and can not supply
       water to their community during the year;
   · Almost 82% of selected interviewees observed that the village water supply
       volunteers are able to handle basic maintenance works; but
   · Only 52% of surveyed households reported that preventive maintenance (PM)
       activity has been carried out regularly, another 48% expressed that the PM is
       undertaken only if there is no water at tap stands;
   · Only 55.5% of the selected schemes have regularly performed water fee
       collection.
   · From the assessment, it is observed that the water and Sanitation Committees
       (WATSAN) are not functioning to full capacity and need more support from both
       government and donor agencies for a certain period.

Phongsaly Province. A summary of the impacts of the activities on hygiene behavior and
health are listed below:

   · Boiling water for drinking is unique water cleaning practice of the communities.
       Most of the surveyed households boil water for drinking when they are at home;
       but only 2% of the households follow safe drinking water practice regularly; with
       the other 88% often drink un-boiled water when they are working out side of the
       village and other 10% still handle unsafe Drinking water practice.




                                          ­ 38 ­

  · The assessment indicated that 56% of the interviewees have moderately followed
      safe practices on hand washing, and 40% for cleaning and washing of
      cooking/eating utensils.
  · Number of surveyed households having access to project sanitation is rather low.
      The percentages of adults and children using latrines are identical at 51%. Main
      reason why the surveyed households do not use latrines is most of them are
      unable to build latrines without support from the project.
  · Diarrhea and skin disease cases reported by the surveyed households are 42% and
      5% respectively.
  · According to the assessment, it is indicated that over 70% of selected
      interviewees have poor knowledge on both diarrhea and skin disease prevention.
  · Household methods for diarrhea treatment has moderately changed, about 25% of
      surveyed households gained full access to public health service at village and
      district level, 20% of the households take modern medicine only and other 42%
      still take traditional medicine.
  · The hygiene education team made reasonable achievement; the assessment
      indicated that 55% of the surveyed households get information about disease
      prevention from the project health workers. Nevertheless, refreshing courses on
      hygiene education still to be provided to the beneficiary households to fulfill the
      project objectives.

Operation and Maintenance interviews indicated that:

  · From the assessment, it is observed that the selected interviewees were
      moderately confident to take responsibility and bear all operation and
      maintenance activities and related costs.
  · 88% of surveyed households are able to pay the water fee; the rest does not want
      to pay because their water supply system is not working properly or seriously
      broken.
  · Almost 81% of selected interviewees observed that the village water supply
      volunteers are able to handle basic maintenance works; but
  · Only 47% of surveyed households reported that preventive maintenance (PM)
      activity has been carried out regularly, another 53% expressed that the PM is
      undertaken only if there is no water at tap stands.
  · Only 22% of the selected schemes have regularly performed water fee collection
      and
  · O&M Fund of each User Group rarely exists. Consequently, it is implied that the
      RWSS User Groups are rarely functioning.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

1. Transport Access and Strengthening Institutional Capacity

Background. The Provincial Infrastructure Programme, implemented by the provinces of
Oudomxay and Phongsaly and supported by an IDA Credit was launched in 1998 and
will close at the end of June 2007.

The project was designed to help raise living standards in Phongsaly and Oudomxay. In
particular it would:
   (a) Provide year-round access to rural communities.
   (b) Provide treated water to major towns.
   (c) Provide low-cost water and sanitation to rural communities.
   (d) Build local government capacity.

Implementation. The following outputs were achieved through the Transport Access
component:

Oudomxay
   · 199 km road rehabilitation
   · 217.6 km of routine and emergency maintenance
   · Road signs and markings on 101 km of national roads
   · Improvements to DCTPC office and testing laboratory

Phongsaly
   · 117 km road rehabilitation
   · 193 km routine and emergency maintenance
   · Construction of Boun Neua Airfield and access road and supply of navigation
       equipment
   · Cable ferry at Muang Khoua
   · Construction of DCTPC and 7 district office buildings, fully equipped

The RCMS provided technical assistance in the areas of road design, preparation of bid
documents, procurement, contract supervision and quality control.         Training was
provided to technical staff through external courses and classroom / on-the-job training
by the RCMS.

Implementation of institutional strengthening component provided the following training:

Benefits. The project achieved the required outputs as detailed in the key performance
indicators as follows:
Formal training courses in management, financial and technical training were held for
more than 1,100 staff from DCTPC, DPI and DoF. Staff who were trained continued to
work on the project and applied their new skills in management of the project.

All construction and maintenance contracts were managed and supervised by DCTPC
staff assisted by the consultant.

A total of 187 km of roads in Oudomxay and 137 km in Phongsaly were upgraded and
rehabilitated as well as the construction of the airfield and cable ferry in Phongsaly. As a
result of the road rehabilitation works a significant reduction in travel time was achieved
as follows:
    · M. Xay to M. Pakbeng reduced from 10 hours to 2½ - 3 hours.
    · M. Xay to M Khoua reduced from 5 hours to 1½ hours
    · M. Boun Neua to B. Pakha reduced from 2 hours to about 40 minutes

Other benefits accrued from the project include:
    · Economic growth through improved access
    · Improved ferry crossing at M. Khoua
    · Airport at Boun Neau, now with 2 airlines operating
    · Equipment and facilities at DCTPC for future project management
    · Development of local contracting industry

Economic analysis. A review of the economic analyses provided in the PAD gave the
following conclusions:

The road rehabilitation strategy as applied on this project provided the most economical
approach given the condition of the old pavement and traffic projections - all under the
assumption of normal loading of heavy vehicles. What it could not predict was the
serious overloading problem, which could affect the life of the road and consequently the
benefits accruing.

The airport at Boun Neua will remain economically viable only as long as the road from
Pak Nam Noi to Ban Yo remains unimproved

Social/environmental Issues. The Road rehabilitation works have had no adverse impact
on the environment. However, paving the roads has reduced the dust problem through
villages. Land acquisition was required for the airport construction as detailed in the PAD,
however no resettlement was required.

The increased traffic volumes and speed could cause road safety problems. Road signs
and markings have been provided on most project roads, the remainder being provided in
the near future by MCTPC.

Factors affecting outcome. Several factors have been identified that affected the outcome
and could affect the long term sustainability of the project as follows:
    · Factors outside government control:            Road closure and damage caused by
        landslides, embankments, culvert washouts, underground springs.
    · Factors subject to government control:            Maintenance, overloading, retaining
        skilled staff
    · Factors affecting cost: Cost increases due to design assumptions

Lessons learned. Many lessons were learned from implementation of the project relating
to the following:
Technical
    · Pavement assessment/design
    · Road alignment design
    · Retaining wall design
    · Procurement

Institutional
    · Detailed study of capacity needed before project start
    · Allow gradual expansion of activities to allow time for staff training
    · Supervision resources must relate to size and complexity of contracts
    · Financial management needs to be strong and in place at project start

Conclusion and Recommendations

The project has achieved the required outputs as detailed in the PAD. These include:
    · 316 km of roads upgraded to all weather bituminous pavement
    · Construction of airfield at Boun Neua
    · Construction of cable ferry crossing at Muang Khoua
    · 52 staff have obtained university degrees at international and national universities.
        A further 28 staff received under-degrees at national institutions.
    · 335 staff have been trained in planning, financial management, technical
        management and English language
    · Altogether 1,170 people at province, district and village level have received
        education and training through the project.

The project can therefore be rated as successful. However due to the conditions existing
at the start of the project in terms of transport infrastructure and institutional capacity, the
scope of the project was insufficient to fully address all the needs of the provinces.

There are therefore some key areas remaining for further development. In summary these
include:
    · Priority provincial roads in Oudomxay and Phongsaly
    · Further staff development
    · Further contractor development



                                             ­ 43 ­

    · Road maintenance by village groups (more focus on poverty alleviation in rural
        communities)
    · Road and traffic management (including implementation of load restrictions)

Program Impact.       The project outputs have resulted in significant benefits to the
provinces and to road users which will aid future development in the region. The project
has also provided improved institutional capacity in planning, financial management,
contract management, quality control etc.

Sustainability. The large investment in the project roads will only provide the expected
benefits if access is maintained throughout the whole design life. This can only be
achieved if there is a robust maintenance regime in place backed up by adequate
maintenance funding.

Providing these staff remain in their posts and continue to gain experience through the
provincial activities, both provinces can be confident that they will have the capacity to
manage future projects and provincial works with minimal outside assistance.

Finally, there is now a healthy local contracting industry available for the ongoing
maintenance programme and for future rehabilitation works. These contractors have
developed skills in bid preparation and contract management and have demonstrated their
ability to compete with the international and other larger Lao contractors

Recommendations. To ensure the sustainability of the assets provided under this project
and the further development of the provincial economies, the following recommendations
are made:
    · MCTPC must continue to provide adequate maintenance funds for the project
        roads and other priority roads in the provinces.
    · The overloading issue must be addressed urgently.
    · Road signs and marking must be provided on the remaining project roads.
    · Trained staff in key positions must be retained in the provinces and used on future
        projects.
    · The provincial authorities should try to ensure that any agricultural development
        is carried out in a sustainable manner and with minimum impact on the
        environment.
    · The construction manual prepared by the RCMS should be reviewed by MCTPC
        with a view to its adoption as a standard reference manual for all provinces and
        donor funded projects.
    · A follow-on project should be considered to provide for the continuing economic
        development of the two provinces

2. Urban Water Supply (UWS)

Background. UWS is one of the four components under the Provincial Infrastructure
Project (PIP) which is supported by an IDA Credit and was launched in 1998 and will
close on 30 June 2007.


                                           ­ 44 ­

The objectives of the UWS component were to (a) provide sufficient urban water
supplies of reliable quality to residents in Muang Xay of Udomxai Province and in
Muang Khoua of Phongsaly Province that save their time for water fetching and meet
their basic health and hygiene needs, and (b) offer benefits for government staff from the
departments and the Nampapa managers, accountants, and operators from the project
through training and capacity building.

The outcomes/objectives of the UWS component were satisfactorily achieved as
supported by its outputs and KPIs.

Outputs. The achieved outputs of the UWS component are depicted below:

Muang Xay Nampapa, Udomxai Province
    · A new river intake on Nam Ko River with pumps @ 79 m3/h and pipelines which
        bring new raw Nam Ko water and the old spring source to the new water
        treatment plant.
    · A new water supply plant with a capacity of 3,800 m3/day, and completed with
        chemical dosing, rapid and slow mixing, sedimentation, filtration, and
        disinfection facilities.
    · A new clear water reservoir with a capacity of 1,860 m3 and a new bulk flow
        meter.
    · An improved water distribution network extended services to Muang Xay
        residents.
    · A new booster pump @ 26 m3/h and service reservoir at Houikhoum of 120 m3.

Muang Khoua Nampapa, Phongsaly Province
    · A new river intake on Nam Pak River with pumps and pipelines which bring new
        raw Nam Pak water and the old spring source to the new water supply plant.
    · A new water supply plant with a capacity of 1,000 m3/day, and completed with
        chemical dosing, rapid and slow mixing, sedimentation, filtration, and
        disinfection facilities.
    · A new clear water reservoir and a new bulk flow meter.
    · A new water distribution network extended services to Muang Khoua residents.

Institutional Strengthening/Capacity Building. The following study, study tours, and
training courses have been organized and conducted for better planning and improved
operational ability of the local governments to execute, operate and sustain the Muang
Xay Waterworks and Muang Khoua Nampapas:
    · Degree Study
    · Study Tours
    · English Language Study
    · Computer Studies
    · Training Courses in Planning for UWS
    · Training Courses in Water Supply Technologies



                                         ­ 45 ­

   · Training Courses in Financial Management and Computerized Billing Systems
       for UWS
   · Training Courses in Project Management and Procurement for UWS
   · Training Courses in Operation and Maintenance of UWS

Benefits. The UWS component achieved the planned outputs as detailed in the following
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
   · Number of Benefited Residents: The number of Muang Xay residents who are
       served with project-supplied water is 19,330 persons which are 88% of the
       targeted number of beneficiaries (i.e. 22,000 persons), and the number of Muang
       Khoua residents who are served with project-supplied water is 2,376 persons
       which are 34% of the targeted number of beneficiaries (i.e. 7,000 persons).
   · Time Reduction of fetching Water: It was recorded that 71% of the households, i.e.
       4,559 households and 390 households in Muang Xay and Muang Khoua
       respectively, have reduced significant time for fetching water and time saving are
       used for farming and other business activities.
   · Water Quality Monitoring: Both Muang Xay Nampapa and Muang Khoua
       Nampapa conduct pH and Jar Test of raw water daily, residual chlorine test in the
       water distribution systems monthly and detailed water quality analyses annually.
       No incident on poor water quality had been reported in the past years.
   · Number of Studies/Training Courses Conducted: In total 60 studies and training
       courses were conducted for UWS component during 1999 to 2005 inclusively.
   · Number of Staff Received Training: The numbers of staff who had attended study
       tours/training courses regarding UWS were 69 and 21 persons from Udomxai and
       Phongsaly Provinces respectively. 82 % of the staff (74 out of 90 persons) who
       have received training remain working in the UWS sector in Udomxai and
       Phongsaly Provinces.
   · Use of Appropriate Modern Technologies: Computerized billing systems are
       introduced and used by both Muang Xay Nampapa and Muang Khoua Nampapa.

Economic and Financial Analysis. In the PAD, the investments in Muang Xay and
Muang Khoua Nampapas showed Financial Internal Rate of Return (FIRRs) of 11.52%
and 10.28% respectively. In light of very limited available data, no FIRRS were
calculated after completion of the sub-projects.

Both Muang Xay and Muang Khoua Nampapas utilized the standard least-cost/cost
effectiveness methodology which incorporates technical, environmental, financial, and
social criteria into the decision-making process. The rationale for adopting a cost
effectiveness methodology is that for UWS project benefits are difficult to quantify in a
reasonably reliable manner, especially those pertaining to the main health benefit of
UWS which was not collected under the project, and also the environment.

While more than 70% of the households who have received and are using the project
water supply facilities have saved 20 ­ 60 minutes per day from fetching water. This time
can be used by households for various more productive activities, however, it is very hard
to put precise figure on the saving in time to money value of poor residents from Muang


                                          ­ 46 ­

Xay and Muang Khoua. Nevertheless, qualitatively the economic value of time saving
and health benefit are sufficient to justify investment costs in Muang Xay and Muang
Khoua Nampapas.

Social/Environmental Issues. The UWS component of the PIP had no adverse impact on
environment. The adverse impacts during construction were minimal. Land acquisition of
two households and resettlement of one household were satisfactorily compensated in
line with the Bank's OD 4.30 June 1990 on Involuntary Resettlement for construction of
river intake facility at Muang Xay. While the provision of improved water supply has
promoted social and economic development of the Muang Xay and Muang Khoua, the
untreated waste water has potential negative consequences if not dealt with properly. The
local government and related departments will have to take a long term and
developmental view to manage the use of water resources and to ensure that waste water
generated would be handled properly without causing detrimental impacts to their
environment over pursuing social and economic benefits in the short term.

Implementation. Factors outside the control of government or implementing
agency:    There was no factor which affected implementation which was outside the
control of government or implementing agencies.

Factors subject to government control: A number of key sector policies and plans issued
by the central government have been particularly favorable to project implementation,
such as government's decentralization policy and strengthening local government, as well
as speeding up development in the northern region and taking step to participate in the
Economic Quadrangle cooperation agreement that includes China, Thailand, Myanmar
and the northern region of Lao. Clear specific target for improvements in safe water
supply has also been set by Government. However, the sustainability of Nampapas, and
better service and water quality management still requires further attention.

Factors generally subject to implementing Agency Control: The project management
was reasonably effective and the coordination role of the central and local governments
was particularly important for the project implementation. The progress of the sub-
projects relied a great deal on the enthusiasm of the local government staff and the time
they devoted to working with the Nampapas. If further project funds could have been
provided to capacity building activities, greater support could have been given to
improving the management of Nampapas, in terms of water tariffs setting, financial
management and accounting practices, and operation & maintenance of Nampapas.

Sustainability. The two Nampapa impose one time water connection fees, monthly water
meter rental fees, and water tariffs to cover water production costs (O&M only). The
Oudomxay Nampapa which supply safe water to Muang Xay urban area has increase
water tariffs annually to enhance cost recovery. Financial sustainability of Oudomxay
Nampapa (O&M only) is likely.

The Muang Khoua Nampapa has maintained same water tariffs for domestic consumers
and commercial users since 2001. The over design of Muang Khoua water treatment



                                          ­ 47 ­

plant and the poverty of its users are two main reasons which make cost recovery very
difficult for Muang Khoua Nampapa. Financial sustainability of Muang Khoua Nampapa
has to inject more efforts to make it likely.

UWS Component Costs. The estimated and actual costs of Muang Xay and Muang
Khoua water supply sub-projects are depicted as following:

Lessons Learned.         Key lessons learned from the UWS component are shown as
followings:
    · The design of water supply plants must be based on demand to minimize over-
        design. Demand assessment must be conducted at the project preparation stage
        and must take into consideration that poor people will still continue to use
        existing un-safe water sources for washing and bathing, other than drinking and
        cooking purposes.
    · All possible water sources must be considered for the water supply schemes and
        the life time cheapest and reliable water sources should be recommended. Failure
        to consider this issue, could lead to either abandon of the proposed water source,
        or jeopardize the sustainability of the facilities constructed.
    · The cost of operation and maintenance (O & M) must be considered in project
        preparation stage. During project preparation, it must avoid recommendations
        for any high cost systems of O & M which the financially constrained Nampapa
        and the majority poor town residents could not afford them.
    · The principle of user financing has worked well in Muang Xay and Muang Khoua.
        However, for the very poor residents specific guidelines for reaching them,
        including subsidies and lower services levels should be considered. It is clear that
        there are still significant barriers preventing households within project areas from
        connecting to the project--supplied water. A specific set of procedures need to
        be adopted to ensure that coverage is maximized.
    · Better coordination amongst the concerned departments with responsibilities for
        the sector would help to improve the efficiency of the UWS component and the
        skills available for implementation. Experience from the UWS component has
        shown that where there has been a good working relationship between different
        departments this has resulted in improved implementation of the UWS component
        in terms of either efficiency or the ability to mobilize wider funds for further
        activities with the project areas.
    · Attention to both construction and management has helped ensure sustainable
        development. The emphasis that the Bank gave to post-construction management



                                             ­ 48 ­

       was greater than for national projects and has had a positive impact on
       sustainability.
   · The focus on skills development, quality and management aspects has had a great
       impact on the sustainability of investments. Life time training of water supply
       plant managers, accountants and operators is critical to the sustainability of the
       UWS component. Government funding must be made available initially to ensure
       adequate training is taking place.

Conclusions and Recommendations

The UWS component of the PIP has achieved the required development objectives and
outputs as detailed in the PAD. A "satisfactory" overall outcome rating of he UWS
component is justified on the following grounds:

   · The relevance of the PDO to country and provincial priorities, and consistency
       with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy.
   · Provision of sufficient urban water supplies of reliable quality to Muang Xay and
       Muang Khoua.
   · Provision of subsidies to Muang Xay and Muang Khoua Nampapas to sustain
       their operations, and subsidies to Nampapas reflect a reducing trend.
   · Muang Xay Nampapa has maintained annual water tariff increment since 2001
       and it is likely to achieve financial sustainability by the end of 2007.
   · Local governments priority to expand water supply services and coverage to their
       residents, even though financial viability have not featured high on the list of
       priorities.

Overall Bank performance is rated "satisfactory" for the following reasons:
   · Project formulation based on sector work.
   · Project design and preparation was supported by a team of experts with a range of
       appropriate skills.
   · Introduction of cost recovery and computerized billing system to the Nampapas.
   · Quality of supervision Aide Memoires satisfactory, identifying comprehensively
       implementation problems, and recommending solutions.
   · Supervision of social and environmental safeguards, procurement and financial
       management.

Borrower performance is rated "satisfactory" due to:
   · The local government's effective coordination role of the project, guiding and
       assisting Muang Xay and Muang Khoua Nampapa in implementation issues.
   · Completion of all planned investments of UWS component timely.
   · Contribution of project outputs to achievement of project development objectives.
   · The local government and the Nampapas are also adequately staffed, despite the
       financial difficulties faced.
   · Local government's support to ensure cost recovery and to maintain water tariffs
       at a level adequate to meet O&M costs.

To ensure the sustainability of the assets provided under the UWS component of the PIP,
the following recommendations are made:
    · An urgent need to improve both the numbers of trained people and the quality of
        training. Such progress will require focusing national development efforts on
        formal and non-formal education, including language, vocational and skills
        training.
    · Training and skill development of Nampapa staff must be life long activities as
        they have great impact on the sustainability of investments, the Nampapas might
        not have available funding meeting the need initially, local government could
        consider to subsidy training and skill development on regular basis which will
        eventually pay off.
    · Retention of trained staff should be emphasized as it will enhance the
        sustainability of the water plants.
    · Muang Khoua Nampapa should make a concerted effort to extend water
        distribution networks in order to meet design capacity. In addition, the Nampapa
        should also improve its standard of financial record keeping.
    · Assistance is still needed from International Organizations, in particular in
        training and skill development of local Nampapas and in Lao language where
        more Nampapa staff could benefit from the activities.
    · Training courses for their managers and operators in "Business Management of
        Water Supply Utilities"; "Water Losses and Control"; and "Improved Operational
        Efficiency of Piped Water Supply Systems" are urgently needed.

3. Rural Water Supply and Sanitation

Oudomxay Province Executive Summary

Oudomxay Province is in the north of Lao P.D.R., a mountainous area where several
ethnic minorities live, particularly Lao Theung communities. The province borders
Bokeo, Luang Namtha and Phongsaly Provinces of Lao P.D.R., and is situated at a
strategic crossroad with neighboring countries - China, Myanmar, Cambodia, Thailand
and Vietnam. The Oudomxai province, with population totaling 264,838, consists of
seven districts comprising 7 small towns and 585 villages. The 12 ethnic groups living in
this province are mostly subsistence farmers and cultivate highland crops in an area that
IS 65% mountainous. Average GDP is approximately US$408 per capita. The existing
coverage of water supply and sanitation services in Oudomxai province is about 68% and
43% respectively.

Oudomxai is an isolated Province, typically poor, and had a little or no basic
infrastructure services before 1994, with a minimum investment support from external
support agencies and NGOs. Therefore,         on 21 December 1998, Oudomxay and
Phongsaly Provinces jointly signed a credit agreement with the International
Development Association (IDA) of the World Bank Group for the Provincial
Infrastructure Project (PIP). Principally a roads and transport infrastructure project, the
PIP also aims to improve urban water supply in Xay Town, Oudomxay, and Khoua Town,
Phongsaly; provide rural water supply and sanitation services to remote villages in 3


                                           ­ 50 ­

districts of Oudomxay (Beng, Pakbeng and Houn) and 3 districts in Phongsaly (Mai,
Boun Tai, and Khoua); and focus on the institutional and capacity strengthening aspects
of each component.

The ODX PIP had four components:
    1. Transport Access Component (or Road Component),
    2. Township/Urban Water Supply Component (UWS),
    3. Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Component (RWSS),
    4. Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building.

This 'Component Implementation Report' is focused on the Rural Water Supply and
Sanitation (RWSS) Component of the ODX PIP. The RWSS component is called the
Hygiene Awareness, Sanitation and Water Supply (HASWAS) sub-Project.

Similarly other components will also separately produce the ICRs to integrate all four
ICRs in to a 'Project Completion Report', which will be compiled by the Oudomxai
Department of Communication, Transport, Post and Construction (DCTPC) for
submission to the Province and World Bank.

The HASWAS sub-project included elements of all four main Provincial Infrastructure
Project components:
    1. Capacity-building/ strengthening of local governments;
    2. Delivery of basic rural infrastructure;
    3. Development of local private contractors; and
    4. Effective formation of community user groups.

The HASWAS sub-project comprised of the following elements:
    1. Promoting hygiene-related behavioral changes in communities, health centers,
        and schools;
    2. Encouraging appropriate demand-based, community-managed investments in
        water supply and sanitation, and piloting subsidy schemes to benefit the poorest;
    3. Strengthening personnel and institutional capacity in six focus districts and two
        provincial centers in hygiene promotion and service delivery and support;
    4. Applying the Lao Sector Strategy and Guideline National Framework, with
        continual refinement through a participatory learning process. At the same time,
        modeling pilot approaches to (a) community-based hygiene, sanitation and water
        supply improvements, (b) appropriate capacity building and (c) structured
        learning, for replication in other districts and other provinces;
    5. Strengthening intra and inter sectoral collaboration and coordination, and building
        up local private enterprise.

Phongsaly Province Executive Summary.

Phongsaly Province is the northernmost province of the Lao People's Democratic
Republic (Lao PDR). The province shares border with Oudomxay and Luangprabang
Provinces of the Lao PDR, with La District, Yunnan Province of China and with Dien
Bien Phu district, Laichao Province of Vietnam. The Phongsaly province, with
population totaling 165,947 people, consists of seven districts comprising 7 small towns
and 606 villages. The 23 ethnic groups living in this province are mostly subsistence
farmers and cultivate highland crops in an area that is 99.6% mountainous. Average GDP
is approximately US$238.37 per capita. The existing coverage of water supply and
sanitation services in Phongsaly province is about 11% and 3% respectively.

Phongsaly is an isolated mountainous Province, typically poor, and had a little or no basic
 infrastructure services before 1994, with a minimum investment support from external
 support agencies and NGOs. Therefore, on 21 December 1998, Oudomxay and
 Phongsaly Provinces jointly signed a credit agreement with the International
 Development Association (IDA) of the World Bank Group for the Provincial
 Infrastructure Project (PIP). Principally a roads and transport infrastructure project, the
 PIP also aims to improve urban water supply in Xay Town, Oudomxay, and Khoua
 Town, Phongsaly; provide rural water supply and sanitation services to remote villages
 in 3 districts of Oudomxay (Beng, Pakbeng and Houn) and 3 districts in Phongsaly
 (Mai, Boun Tai, and Khoua); and focus on the institutional and capacity strengthening
 aspects of each component.

The PSL PIP had four components:
   1. Transport Access Component (or Road Component),
   2. Township/Urban Water Supply Component (UWS),
   3. Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Component (RWSS),
   4. Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building.

This 'Component Implementation Report' is focused on the Rural Water Supply and
Sanitation (RWSS) Component of the PSLPIP. The RWSS component is called the
Hygiene Awareness, Sanitation and Water Supply (HASWAS) Sub-Project.

Similarly other components will also separately produce the ICRs to integrate all four
ICRs in to a 'Project Completion Report', which will be compiled by the Phongsaly
Department of Communication, Transport, Post and Construction (DCTPC) for
submission to the Province and World Bank.

The HASWAS sub-project included elements of all four main Provincial Infrastructure
Project components:
   · Capacity-building/ strengthening of local governments;
   · Delivery of basic rural infrastructure;
   · Development of local private contractors; and
   · Effective formation of community user groups.

The HASWAS Sub-Project comprised of the following elements:
   · Promoting hygiene-related behavioral changes in communities, health centers,
       and schools;
   · Encouraging appropriate demand-based, community-managed investments in
       water supply and sanitation, and piloting subsidy schemes to benefit the poorest;
   · Strengthening personnel and institutional capacity in six focus districts and two
       provincial centers in hygiene promotion and service delivery and support;
   · Applying the Lao Sector Strategy and Guideline National Framework, with
       continual refinement through a participatory learning process. At the same time,
       modeling pilot approaches to (a) community-based hygiene, sanitation and water
       supply improvements, (b) appropriate capacity building and (c) structured

         learning, for replication in other districts and other provinces;
     · Strengthening intra and inter sectoral collaboration and coordination, and building
         up local private enterprise.
