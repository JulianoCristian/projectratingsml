          satisfactory, risk to development outcome was moderate, Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, and borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            within a broader national and international context of\n            buoyant economic growth, new and upgraded infrastructure can\n            help integrate poorer remote areas of a country and\n            contribute to reduce their poverty. This project's\n            improved road infrastructure gave the beneficiary provinces\n            better access, allowing them to keep pace with South-East\n            Asia's rapid economic growth, contributing poverty\n            reduction. Infrastructure that foments economic growth can\n            also trigger unexpected demands for the infrastructure\n            itself. This requires continuous monitoring to identify\n            problems and inform appropriate responses. In the case of\n            this project, the success of economic integration means that\n            the roads are carrying much heavier trucks than they were\n            designed for. More intense maintenance, strengthening the\n            pavement or restricting vehicle weights are among possible\n            responses. The chosen response has to be within local\n            financial and management capacity constraints. On-the-job\n            training prepares local officials and professional cadres to\n            carry on the work of development assistance after a project\n            has closed. It could be eligible for project funding. Formal\n            training programs and courses have roles to play, too, but\n            project design and implementation should ensure that the\n            learning from them is relevant to achieving an\n            operation's intended outcomes."}, "docdt": "2011-06-10T00:00:00Z"}
