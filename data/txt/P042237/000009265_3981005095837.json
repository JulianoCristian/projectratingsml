Infrastructure Project is to assist the Borrower to\n            strengthen the local institutional capacity, and\n            rehabilitate and upgrade critical basic infrastructure of\n            its remote northern provinces of Oudomxay and Phongsaly, so\n            as to reduce the poverty conditions and improve the standard\n            of living and socio-economic potential of the poor\n            inhabitants of these provinces and gradually integrate them\n            into the Borrower's national economy. There are four\n            components: a) Transport Access - improving physical access\n            including rehabilitating and maintaining roads and\n            constructing an airfield and river crossing as well as\n            developing local private contractors; b) Township Water\n            Supply - providing sufficient water supplies of reliable\n            quality; c) Rural Water Supply and Sanitation - providing\n            water and sanitation to rural areas and promoting hygiene\n            awareness as well as forming user groups to manage and\n            maintain the facilities provided under the project; and d)\n            Institutional Strengthening - capacity building of local\n            governments, improving the planning and operational ability\n            of their technical and administrative organs to execute and\n            monitor provincial investment projects."}, "docdt": "1998-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
