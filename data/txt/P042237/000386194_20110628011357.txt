                 IEG Mission: Improving development results through excellence in evaluation.


About this Report
     The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank Group for two
purposes: first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is
producing the expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through
the dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20-25 percent of the
World Bank’s lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to
those that are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those
for which Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to
generate important lessons.
      To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower
for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers' comments are
attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has
been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive
at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
information is available on the IEG website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to
development policy operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately
Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High,
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing agency
or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and agreements,
toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government performance and
implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly Satisfactory,
Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) of the Lao People’s
Democratic Republic (PDR) Provincial Development Project (Cr3131) for which the
World Bank approved a Credit of US$27.8 million on September 22, 1998. The Credit
was 98.4 percent disbursed. An amount of US$493,816 was cancelled and the Credit
closed on June 30, 2007, seven months later than planned.

The report is based on a review of project documents, including the Implementation
Completion Report, the Project Appraisal Document, legal documents and project files,
and on discussions held with Bank staff involved in the project in Washington DC, and
Vientiane. An IEG mission visited the Lao PDR in November 2010 to review project
results and met with more than 20 interlocutors, including Lao PDR officials and
representatives of the project provinces of Oudomxay and Phongsaly. The mission
conducted field visits to project sites in Oudomxay, where it met with many project
beneficiaries. As the mission schedule did not include a visit to Phongsaly, a team of
officials from that province kindly agreed to travel to Oudomxay to meet with IEG. IEG
gratefully acknowledges the courtesies and attention of all these participants, and their
keen interest in the project evaluation process.

IEG selected this operation for a PPAR field assessment to verify its results three years
after completion. This project evaluation will also serve as an input into IEG’s ongoing
review of infrastructure sustainability worldwide.

Following standard IEG procedures, copies of the draft PPAR were sent to government
officials and agencies for their review and comments. Comments are included as Annex
B.

Summary
The story of the performance of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic (PDR) Provincial
Infrastructure Project is a story of how the country’s two poorest and most remote
provinces became linked to Southeast Asia’s rapid economic development during the
decade-long project implementation period (1998-2007).

The project provinces of Oudomxay and Phongsaly are the Lao PDRs’ most northerly,
located some 400-500 km from the capital, Vientiane. Prior to the project, overland
access to other parts of Laos from Phongsaly had to be through neighboring China.
Integrating them nationally (and internationally) through roads investments would likely
benefit their majority poor populations. This was not the first province-level Bank
assistance to Laos. The project drew lessons of an earlier operation in the nearby Luang
Namtha province, rated satisfactory by IEG.

The objective of this project, to help strengthen local institutions and upgrade
infrastructure to reduce poverty and better integrate these provinces into the national
economy, was substantially relevant to several priorities spelled out in successive Bank
Country Assistance Strategies and Lao PDR policies up to and including the current 7th
Socio-Economic Development Plan 2011-2015. Bank and Lao PDR priorities included:
making local institutions more effective partners in development; integrating remote
mountainous provinces; and reducing inter-regional disparities of income and
development. The project design, too, was substantially relevant for including
interventions—on-the-job training, improvements and better maintenance of roads, urban
and rural water supply—in the country’s poorest and most remote provinces likely to lead
to the desired outcomes through the results chain.

Implementation was timely, impressively so given the wide geographical spread of
project interventions across remote provinces working with the Bank the first time on
infrastructure. Actual disbursements matched planned disbursements quite closely. The
Bank’s reputation for strict enforcement of its procurement and disbursement rules set the
standards expected of work delegated to the provinces in these areas. Both provinces
made excellent progress in managing sub-project planning, supervision and financing.

For roads, physical targets of kilometers to upgrade or rehabilitate were met or exceeded,
and, for the most part, project investments stayed within budget. Eliminating unnecessary
investments through carefully re-surveying real needs helped contain rising costs. In
other words, implementation was efficient. Two smaller transport investments by this
project, the Boun Neua airfield and the cable ferry crossing of the Nam Pak River were
implemented on time, albeit with minor cost overruns. Urban water supply systems were
built in the towns of Muang Xay (Oudomxay) and Muang Khoua (Phongsaly) below
expected costs. Small-scale water supply and sanitation works were carried out in 78
villages in Oudomxay and 76 villages in Phongsaly. Most of the project’s US$1.2 million
for Institutional Strengthening (for both provinces) was spent on formal training courses
for provincial staff. The formal training delivered, through 143 courses for 1,930 local
officials, was on a much larger scale than planned. But most training took place on-the-
                                            x


job, while provincial staff helped implement the project. Regular project accounting did
not capture the costs and benefits of this learning by doing.

The project helped strengthen local institutional capacity in three areas. First, hands-on
project implementation experience enabled both provinces to take on greater
responsibilities for the procurement and the maintenance of infrastructure, as well as
related financial management. Second, they could apply these project-acquired
capabilities to their own much larger investment operations—expanding fivefold during
the project in Phongsaly—made possible by much stronger provincial finances driven by
increased own-revenues and transfers from central government. Third, IEG learned that
greater professional skills in these areas enhanced the self-esteem of technical staff.

Results were substantial. Thanks in part to this operation, both Oudomxay and Phongsaly
provinces are now better endowed with infrastructure than they were before the project.
Oudomxay’s paved highway network is now twice what it had been before the operation,
and Phongsaly’s is four times as extensive. The project’s 314 kms of improved roads
account for 63 percent of the present highway network of both provinces. These
improvements assured year-round access and cut average journey times by between 50-
75 percent, as the project intended. Road maintenance was carried out effectively through
performance-based contracts between the provinces and private operators. Phongsaly’s
airfield was improved as planned in late 2002, and regular air services by small airplanes
began, but were interrupted when the aircraft were withdrawn. At present, there is no
service. The cable river crossing was implemented and is now operational. Urban water
supply to the towns of Muang Xay and Muang Khoua was upgraded by introducing
treatment, expanding the distribution network to 4,350 more households, some 16 percent
of the urban population. It also reduced unaccounted-for water by introducing consumer
metering. Rural water supply benefited more than 8,000 households in 154 villages,
about 15 percent of the rural population, with safe water at public standpipes.

As a share of all households, poverty fell more sharply during project implementation
(1998-2007) in the project provinces than in the Lao PDR as a whole. In Oudomxay it
fell from 66.1 percent to 25.0 percent and in Phongsaly it fell from 57.9 percent to 22.0
percent; while for the Lao PDR as a whole, the fall was from 39.1 percent to 26.0
percent. While there were no specific data on the income levels of project beneficiaries,
IEG met many households benefiting from the project who had escaped poverty through
rising incomes. The improved roads allowed low-income farmers for the first time to get
their products to distant markets—in China and Vietnam, especially.

Over the same period, provincial GDP per capita in both provinces rose at a similar rate
to the national average, pointing to the integration of the provinces within the national
economy. Also, Laos’ international trade through the provinces with neighboring
Thailand, China and Vietnam grew rapidly, faster than the average national rate in the
case of Vietnam. By linking producers and suppliers to neighbors’ rapidly expanding
markets, especially in China, improved project roads made this growth in trade possible.

The overall outcome of the project is rated Satisfactory, through achieving its
substantially relevant objective with only minor shortcomings, thanks to a substantially
relevant project design that incorporated actions and interventions that linked to
                                            xi


outcomes through a results chain. With results obtained across the board—stronger local
institutions, upgraded infrastructure, reduced poverty and greater economic integration—
efficacy was substantial. While IEG could not definitively link the project’s outputs to
poverty reduction, poverty in the two provinces did decline substantially and it is likely
that the expanded road investments contributed. Efficiency, too, was substantial with
adequate economic rates of return (ERR) from most of the project investments. The
ERRs might have been higher if agricultural value added made possible by the better road
access was counted as a benefit instead of the savings of vehicle operating costs and
travel time conventionally used in this case. The risk to development outcome is rated
Moderate. Project benefits were still flowing at the time of the PPAR mission three years
after completion, and are likely to continue into the future, thanks to the well-built and
maintained infrastructure, strong provincial finances and the start up of cost recovery.
Overall, Bank performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. While the Bank created a
realistic design and provided diligent and regular supervision in remote parts of the
country, it did not ensure a strong enough results framework and M&E system. Borrower
performance is rated Satisfactory, both for the Government’s support and for the
efficiency with which the provinces implemented the project. M&E is rated Modest, with
a weak design that did not specify performance indicators and targets for all the results.

LESSONS

      Within a broader national and international context of buoyant economic growth,
new and upgraded infrastructure can help integrate poorer remote areas of a country and
contribute to poverty reduction. The improved road infrastructure gave the beneficiary
provinces better access, allowing them to keep pace with South-East Asia’s rapid
economic growth and contributing to their fast pace of poverty reduction.

       Infrastructure that foments economic growth can also trigger unexpected demands
for the infrastructure itself. This requires continuous monitoring to identify problems and
inform appropriate responses. In the case of this project, the success of economic
integration means that the roads are carrying much heavier trucks than they were
designed for. More intense maintenance, strengthening the pavement or restricting
vehicle weights are among possible responses. The chosen response has to be within local
financial and management capacity constraints.

      On-the-job training prepares local officials and professional cadres to carry on the
work of development assistance after a project has closed. It could be eligible for project
funding. Formal training programs and courses have roles to play, too, but project design
and implementation should ensure that the learning from them is relevant to achieving an
operation’s intended outcomes.

1. Background to Support for Laos’ Remote Provinces
1.1      In upgrading basic infrastructure, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic (PDR)
Provincial Infrastructure Project reviewed here aimed to link what were two of the Lao
PDRs’ poorest and most remote provinces, Oudomxay and Phongsaly, to the dynamic
economic growth of Laos itself and to neighboring South East Asian countries. Laos’ annual
GDP growth averaged 6.5 percent during the 1998-2007 implementation period of the
project. China’s and Vietnam’s growth rates were even higher at 10.0 percent and 7.2 percent
respectively. Prior to the project in 1998, Laos’ GDP per capita was only US$247. By 2009,
it had risen to US$940, but still a measure of a low-income country.

1.2     Like most donor assistance to Laos since the mid-1990s, this project supported the
country’s modest pro-market reforms adopted by the Lao People’s Revolutionary Party in
1986. The path to reform has not been an easy one, though. Its pace has not always met
international expectations (Phraxayavong 2009 p. 260). Up to 2000, very high inflation
meant volatile markets and foreign exchange rates—one US dollar was worth Kip 2,100 in
1998 and then Kip 10,655 in 2005. Construction costs rose rapidly. Corruption is still
perceived as a major challenge, with Laos ranked 158 out of 180 countries surveyed by
Transparency International in 2009, alongside the Central African Republic and Tajikistan.

1.3     The project provinces of Oudomxay and Phongsaly are the Lao PDRs’ most
northerly, located some 400-500 km from the capital Vientiane (Annex C). More than from
distance alone, remoteness came from their poor infrastructure. The small populations,
currently Oudomxay’s 283,969 and Phongsaly’s 166,635, and their location outside Laos’
―lifeline‖ of the southern Mekong valley where most of Laos’ 6.8 million inhabitants live,
underscore their remoteness (Rehbein 2007). But Oudomxay and Phongsaly border dynamic
zones like China’s Yunnan Province and northern Vietnam, with whom trade increased more
than fivefold over the project period.

1.4     The project focused upon improving the inadequate infrastructure of these two
provinces where poor roads left them inaccessible for half the year during the rainy season.
Inadequate water supply put public health at risk in both the towns and rural areas. The poor
in particular suffered most from these shortcomings. Surveys in Laos show people in the
lowest two quintiles of the income distribution are the least served by the country’s weak
infrastructure. If Oudomxay and Phongsaly did not participate in Laos’ economic growth
their poor populations would remain poor. In the prior (1993-2002) Laos Luang Namtha
Provincial Development Project (Cr.2579), rated Satisfactory by IEG, the Bank had a model
to emulate and a source of experience to draw from.


2. Project’s Relevance to this Support
2.1     Relevance of objective: Substantial. The project’s single objective (Box 1),
expressed identically in both the project appraisal document (PAD) and development credit
agreement (DCA) is substantially relevant to Lao PDR and Bank priorities and policies in
several respects. Aiming for a stronger local institutional capacity was consistent with
                                                                 2


successive country assistance strategies’ (CAS) calls to make local institutions more effective
partners in development (1996 CAS and 2005 CAS—the current document). The same is true
of the project aim to upgrade basic infrastructure, particularly to help integrate remote
mountainous areas of the country whose development is a Lao PDR government (GOL)
priority. Reducing poverty and improving the standard of living and socio-economic
potential of the poor are consistent with the poverty focus of GOL’s current 7th Socio-
Economic Development Plan 2011-2015. The project’s aim of integrating the two provinces
into the national economy relates directly to the 2005 CAS’s priorities for helping to reduce
inter-regional disparities of development and access to employment opportunities as well as
social services (Figure 1).

2.2     Relevance of design: Substantial. Seven features of the design enabled the project to
achieve its intended objectives. First, it incorporated a results chain laying a progression
from shorter-term results to longer-term outcomes—from upgraded infrastructure to regional
integration, for instance. Second, the project design included on-the-job learning for the
professional staff of the provinces as, for the first time, they became fully responsible for
procuring, contracting, financing and implementing large construction works in accordance
with Bank standards. This helped achieve the institutional capacity objective, as it had done
in the earlier Luang Namtha Provincial Development Project. Third, when preparation was
completed, the project scope was restricted to just two provinces, making implementation
manageable.1 Fourth, it selected the country’s most remote provinces, where project
infrastructure would help those most in need of integration into rapid national (as well as
international) development. Fifth, the design focused on two sub-sectors of infrastructure
only, namely transport and water supply, particularly needy in these provinces. Sixth, the
design also addressed sustainability in each sub-sector; through maintenance arrangements
for roads and through cost recovery for water. Seventh, the population of the chosen project
provinces included a large share of poor people; those sections of the population typically
deprived of infrastructure services.
1
 Earlier in project preparation, the Bank had proposed working in four provinces, Oudomxay and Phongsaly
plus Huaphanh and Xayabury. Concerned that this might stretch project interventions too far and thin, GOL
urged that only two provinces be included. The Bank subsequently agreed to that. Laos’ more developed
southern provinces were not considered as, by definition, they were already more integrated.

2.3     If there were shortcomings to the project design, they were only minor. IEG heard
from GOL officials, for instance, that the project should have been larger to have a greater
impact—evidently, they wanted more! But whether enough capacity existed to execute a
larger scale operation than the one agreed must be in doubt. Phongsaly province was so
remote and inaccessible for several other donors that they decided not to initiate any
programs there, fearing that they would not be cost-effective to supervise. But the experience
of this project proved them wrong.2



3. Project Implementation Experience
3.1    Project implementation kept pace with the planned schedule, quite an achievement for
an operation spread over such a large geographical area in provinces without prior experience
of working with the Bank. Throughout implementation actual credit disbursements matched
planned disbursements quite closely. Even so, the closing date of the credit had to be
extended by seven months in order to fully disburse a US$1.0 million remainder of the credit.


2
 Phongsaly’s past inaccessibility, requiring day-long boat trips up the Nam Ou River, for instance, or a
diversion through Chinese territory by road, is legend even among Bank staff and consultants.

Figure 3. Maize Cultivation—more after the project road improvement

3.2    Implementing the project required an unprecedented level of sub-project planning,
supervision and financing by the provinces, neither of which had implemented a Bank-
financed project before. Both made excellent progress.

3.3     During site visits along more than 75 kms of road in Oudomxay, IEG saw project
works completed to a high standard. Officials from Phongsaly informed the IEG mission—
with photographic back-ups—that the quality of the construction had been good and that
other roads not visited by IEG were in good condition, too. At implementation completion,
key physical output targets had been met or exceeded. In Oudomxay, 198 kms of the Muang
Xay to Pak Beng road had been upgraded, 7 kms more than targeted. In Phongsaly, 83.5 kms
of the R-19 road had been upgraded, 1.5 kms more than planned. All other road sections
upgraded were the same lengths as planned. Altogether, the project made improvements to
more than 63 percent of the two provinces’ main highways. There was no reported shortfall.

3.4      As well as sticking to schedule, the project kept to its budget for the most part during
implementation. Overall, final project costs (in US dollars) were close to the appraisal
estimates (Table 3.1). Devaluations of the Kip helped stem rising construction costs in US
dollars. Project implementation saw a creative technical response to rising costs. In
Oudomxay the earliest road works had seen sharp price rises and cost overruns, prompting
provincial engineers to thoroughly re-survey existing road conditions to be sure that full
rehabilitation was really necessary. If not, it was eliminated. These actions kept actual costs
below those expected in Oudomxay—even with a 3 percent increase in kilometers of road
                                               6


improved. In Phongsaly, which did not adopt this approach, road cost overruns were 22
percent—with just 1.2 percent more kilometers of road improved than planned.

3.5     Two other transport investments in Phongsaly were implemented on time, with only
minor cost overruns. The project successfully upgraded the Boun Neua airfield by extending
and paving the runway and building an access road. But, at this writing, the ready-for-
operation airfield is not working because of the lack of aircraft to operate from it, issues
discussed in the next chapter of this report. The cable river crossing of the Nam Ou River,
not visited by IEG, was also implemented as planned and is operational, according to reports
by Phongsaly officials who met with the IEG mission in Oudomxay.

3.6     Urban water supply systems were implemented in the towns of Muang Xay
(Oudomxay) and Muang Khoua (Phongsaly) as planned and at below expected costs. Small-
scale water supply and sanitation works were carried out in 78 villages in Oudomxay and in
76 in Phongsaly, according to the ICR. The IEG mission did not visit all of these locations.
The investments typically included a small water intake and collection point built around a
stream up-hill, a pipeline was installed to carry the water down to the village, and a small
number of public standpipes. The sanitation typically consisted of individual sheltered pit
latrines—in use by villagers, as IEG saw during its field visits. Those villagers (and local
officials too) told the IEG mission that beneficiaries had participated in the design of their
own water supply and sanitation systems. They said that helping determine the location of
                                                                 7


the standpipes and latrines, as well as the water catchment points, gave them a stake in the
investments. The final scale of implementation was similar in both provinces.

3.7     Most of the project’s US$1.2 million for Institutional Strengthening (for both
provinces) was spent on training provincial staff through formal courses on accounting,
procurement and project management. Most courses were held in the provinces themselves,
but a few were given in Luang Prabang and Vientiane. Additional training effort under the
roads component focused upon procurement, spending US$1.4 million to ensure that
provincial engineers were well prepared to manage it locally. Some of the training was given
in neighboring countries, notably Malaysia, where eight trainees even received bachelors’
                                                                  8


degrees. But most training of all was on-the-job, as provincial staff helped implement the
project, even though project accounting did not capture it as such.

4. Results Achieved
4.1    The efficacy of the project in achieving its objective to strengthen local institutional
capacity and rehabilitate and upgrade basic infrastructure so as to reduce poverty and
improve the standard of living and socioeconomic potential of poor inhabitants of Oudomxay
and Phongasly provinces and gradually integrate them into the national economy is rated
substantial.

STRENGTHENING LOCAL INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY

4.2     Evidence points to important changes in three areas: stronger provincial finance,
greater provincial responsibilities and better quality human resources. Looking beyond the
project’s chosen performance indicator, the number of staff trained, shows that the
governance and management of both provinces is stronger at the present time than it was
prior to the project in 1998. This section reviews how the improvements observed can be
attributed to the project interventions.

Development Indicators.

4.3      Stronger Provincial Finances: Phongsaly’s own revenues grew more than threefold
during the implementation of the project, almost reaching the level of the much larger
Oudomxay province (Table 4.1). Most of this increase came from five to sevenfold hikes in
GOL transfers—obviously not the direct result of the project itself. More closely indicating
the provinces’ greater financial capacity and management were the sharp increases that both
experienced in generating their own local revenues. Just to properly control a three to four
times larger fiscal space in 2008/09 than in 1998/99—on both the revenue and expenditure
sides—required both provinces to step up to the plate to expand and deepen their financial
management capabilities. IEG learned of no financial mis-management that would have
pointed to shortcomings in local institutional capacity in this regard. Much greater project
infrastructure assets themselves required more costly operations and maintenance, something
that itself may itself have spurred the search for greater provincial revenue. On the
                                              9


expenditure side, Phongsaly’s infrastructure spending was nearly five times greater after the
project than before—a direct result of the project’s US$2.0 million annual investments there.
Oudomxay, a bigger spender prior to the project, saw a smaller increase in investment
spending. Executing the project during 1998-2007 helped prepare both provinces meet the
greater responsibilities they acquired thereafter.

4.4     Greater Provincial Responsibilities: From having been among the weakest provinces
of the Lao PDR, Oudomxay and Phongsaly excelled in assuming far greater responsibilities
for managing their own development and infrastructure needs under the project. GOL
ministries in Vientiane delegated more and more tasks to the country’s provinces. Greater
provincial responsibilities meant that Oudomxay and Phongsaly staff had to manage
procurement, disbursement and maintenance, formerly carried out in Vientiane. It did not
amount to a full decentralization, however, since hierarchical line reporting to central
ministries from their delegated staff in the provinces continued.

4.5      Oudomxay directly managed, for the first time under Bank rules, the procurement of
more than 20 works contracts—eight of them over one million US dollars each—and ten
technical assistance and training operations. The province dealt with all aspects, from the
detailed planning and programming of the jobs, financial planning and budgeting, calling for
bids, and adjudicating winners. Officials from Phongsaly—not visited by IEG—reported
similar experiences to the IEG mission. The project itself supported these new provincial
activities through technical assistance by visiting procurement advisors, courses and
opportunities for on-the-job learning coming directly from the hands-on practice.

4.6     Implementing the project gave both provinces unprecedented opportunities for
broader and more intense financial management. Phongsaly, especially, had to manage a
much larger budget than before. Both provinces had to assess and approve disbursements on
a larger scale than anything done prior to the project. During its mission, IEG found both
provinces ready and able to analyze and provide data on their own finances and on project
transactions. Triangulation, double checking data from different perspectives, showed
province-provided information to be fairly consistent with that from other sources, such as
Bank reports. Using the provinces’ own data IEG was able to evaluate this project at the
province level for the first time.

4.7     The project’s new upgraded infrastructure required the provinces to assume
responsibility for operation and maintenance on a much bigger scale than before. For the first
time both provinces engaged private firms to carry out road maintenance through
competitively bid performance-based contracts. The project reviewed here provided
important opportunities to use this innovative instrument introduced through the later Bank-
financed Lao PDR Road Maintenance Project (P064821). Oudomxay and Phongsaly officials
spoke to the IEG mission very positively about their experiences with these contracts. The
IEG mission could see good results on the ground through site visits to 75 km of upgraded
roads that pointed to no failure of maintenance. Maintenance of the urban and rural water
works obtained good results too, thanks to cost recovery from users. Local residents told the
IEG mission that they paid their water tariffs regularly. Local officials said that these
payments covered the operation and maintenance costs of the water systems, but were not
enough to finance the investment costs incurred. IEG had no access to the detailed
                                                      10


documentation of these financial transactions, however. But, whatever the details, IEG could
see that the systems inspected were in full operation.

4.8     Greater provincial responsibilities and capabilities had the important, yet unforeseen
consequence of enhancing the self-esteem of local staff in Oudomxay and Phongsaly. They
told IEG how they now treated visiting project consultants on an equal professional footing
and themselves. Before, they saw them as purveyors of instructions from the center to be
blindly followed—a major paradigm shift for them.

4.9      Provincial Human Resources: The project provided considerably more training for
provincial officials than initially planned. But these numbers can measure inputs, not project
outcomes or impacts. These would be better measured through evidence of the application of
that training to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the institution to which the
trainees belonged. That said, through 143 courses the project trained 1,930 local officials—
707 from Oudomxay and 1,223 from Phongsaly—ten times the number targeted.3 To better
know the outcome of this, however, we need to learn more about what the trainees learned
and how they are using their new knowledge in practice. In the absence of formal survey data
on this, the IEG mission heard from former trainees. All confirmed that they found the
training relevant and useful to their present job (to which they returned after the training).
Senior staff found English language skills they acquired through training in Malaysia to be
particularly useful—important in aid-dependent Laos. The IEG mission itself benefited from
this. Several provincial staff told IEG that they had been promoted since the training.
Provincial officials responsible for the training told IEG that they expected trainees to return
to their jobs and apply their new knowledge to their work. IEG did not find specific data on
the retention of trained staff, but noted that there was a strong motive for a trainee to stay at
his or her provincial post: the guarantee of lifetime employment.

REHABILITATING AND UPGRADING INFRASTRUCTURE

4.10 With the help of this operation, both Oudomxay and Phongsaly provinces are now
better endowed with infrastructure than they were before the project (Table 4.2).

4.11 Road Upgrades: Oudomxay now has nearly twice the paved highway length—
overall and not just the project’s—than before the project. Phongsaly, with very little paved
highway prior to the project, saw a fourfold increase (Table 4.2). The project impact on this
result was significant. The project’s 314 kms of improved roads (up from the 280 km
planned) account for 63 percent of the present highway network in the two provinces. While
overall traffic flows are still below design capacity, many individual 20-25 ton trucks impose
an enormous strain upon a road pavement designed for a maximum load of 11 tons. During
its field visits, IEG saw no evidence of major structural failure arising from this traffic.
Growth of the economy and of trade, however, is likely to see an increase of this heavy
traffic. Measures to restrict it are unlikely to succeed while ASEAN regulations call for the
free movement of heavy vehicles across the countries of this region. In the medium term, the

course is unknown.

road pavement will have to be strengthened in order to accommodate the inevitable. This
may be a more realistic approach than attempting to curtail overloaded vehicles (without
adequate local capacity to control them) as recommended by the ICR (p. 24)

4.12 Road Maintenance: As already noted under institutional strengthening, the project
provided an opportunity for the provinces to apply the performance contract approach to road
maintenance. Through these contracts, both provinces required continuous M&E of the
roadway and preventative and corrective maintenance to keep it operational. Increasing costs
of this contracting made the provinces keen users of the government’s Laos Road
Maintenance Fund (RMF), introduced by the Lao PDR Road Maintenance Project.
Oudomxay Province officials told the IEG mission that they considered the RMF a
                                              12


―masterpiece‖ of Bank assistance. They valued its rapid processing of requests for
withdrawals and had been using it intensively since 2006 to fund contracts with two firms for
maintenance covering the entire length of the improved roads.

4.13 Air Transport Improvements: The project did upgrade Phongsaly’s Boun Neua
Airfield by paving and extending its runway to 900 meters, and building an access road,
While this allowed Lao Air to begin a twice weekly flight from Vientiane using a twin engine
11 seat aircraft, the service was withdrawn shortly thereafter with the retirement of the
aircraft for safety reasons. Lao Air did not have a replacement plane in its fleet, although IEG
learned that the airline is seeking to procure additional aircraft.

4.14 Other Transport - Cable
river crossing: Phongsaly
officials told IEG that the cable
river crossing—whereby a ferry
boat is harnessed to an overhead
cable to secure its passage across
the strong currents of the 300
meter-wide Nam Ou River (and
also save fuel), was well built and
able to operate at full capacity of
up to 3 tonnes of motor bikes,
farm trucks, bicycles and
passengers. This was to replace
an earlier ferry that had been
destroyed during the 1996 river
flood. The Phongsaly officials
produced photographs showing
the operation, but data on the
number of people and vehicles
transported were not available.

4.15 Urban Water Supply:
Directly as a result of the project,
urban water supply coverage and
volume produced doubled in
Oudomxay and more than
quadrupled in Phongsaly (Table
4.2). The water production plant      Figure 5. Using a water standpipe
and expanded distribution in the
towns of both Muang Xay and
Muang Khoua, but not to the extent intended. It expanded the distribution network to cover
4,350 households, some 16 percent of the urban population. It also reduced unaccounted-for
water by introducing consumer metering for the first time. A poorly conceived water intake
in Muang Khoua had to be re-designed for adequate production. Service quality was
upgraded, too, through introducing chemical treatment for the first time in both provinces.
IEG did not have access to time series data of water quality indicators that would definitely
                                                                       13


                   demonstrate any improvement in water quality over the time of this project. Users told the
                   IEG mission, however, that water quality had improved, citing its appearance (less turbid)
                   and fewer cases of stomach ailments among their children that they attributed before the
                   project to contaminated water.

                   4.16 Rural Water Supply: The project significantly upgraded local infrastructure by
                   providing a safe water supply to more than 8,000 households in 154 rural villages, about 15
                   percent of the rural population (Table 4.2). IEG visited two such systems in the company of
                   local officials and one without. In all three locations, residents confirmed that the road and
                   water supply had changed their lives for the better. The road eased access to social services,
                   particularly schools and health, and the water supply systems cut the time users spent
                   collecting water, as per the performance indicator chosen by the project. Users willingly pay
                   annually adjusted charges that cover the operating and maintenance costs of the systems.
                   Although it did not involve major project expenditures, the operation also made important
                                                                                             Photo by Roy Gilbert
                   contributions through hygiene and sanitation awareness campaigns—washing hands, for
                   instance. Evidence of them was clear from posters the IEG mission saw during its field visits
                   (Figure 2) and from comments by villagers themselves. Data on health indicators at the
                   village level that might be affected by these campaigns were not available.

                   REDUCING POVERTY

                   4.17 Poverty
                   fell more
                   sharply in both
                   Oudomxay and
                   Phongsaly
                   provinces
                   during the
                   implementation
                   of the project

                   living below

                   than the national
                   average for that indicator—quite an achievement for provinces that had been among the Lao
                   PDR’s poorest before the project4 (Table 4.3). That Oudomxay and Phongsaly reduced their

                   4
                     According to the LDR National Statistical Center, among Lao PDR provinces, Phongsaly and Oudomxay had
                   the largest shares of their villages that were reckoned to be poor in 2003, 94.4 percent and 91.6 percent
                   respectively, compared with a national average of 76.7 percent (World Bank 2004 p. 31). An earlier paper
                   sponsored by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) indicates even higher levels of poverty for these provinces,
                                                                 14


poverty at a faster than average rate calls for province-specific explanations for the results
observed here. They include, of course, the project infrastructure that helped integrate these
provincial economies into the 7-10 percent annual GDP growth of neighboring Vietnam and
China, as well as of the Lao PDR’s own 6.5 percent. Roads improved under the project
permitted farmers to get their products to market, thereby allowing international trade
through (and originating in) the provinces to take off. Exports of agricultural products,
particularly of maize to China, were reported to have multiplied.5 During its field visits, the
IEG mission could see new areas under maize cultivation along the roadsides (Figure 3). The
mission also met with several farmers reporting how increased agricultural output had
translated into higher incomes, the evidence of which was immediately obvious to a visitor in
improvements to their village homes. Without the road access upgraded by this operation,
these farmers would not have been able to get their produce to market—precisely the
constraint they faced before the project when access was very difficult if not completely
impossible for most of the year.

4.18 During its field visit the IEG mission inquired about the existence of poverty
reduction programs exclusively aimed at Oudomxay and Phongsaly provinces that may have
accelerated poverty reduction there, but did not learn of any. Significantly, neither of two
poverty reduction strategy papers (PRSP) prepared by the Bank during project

namely 73.2 percent for Oudomxay and 64.2 perent for Phongsaly in 1998, while a figure of 38.6 perent for the
Lao PDR, similar to the value reported in Table 4.3 here (Kakwani 2001 p.9).

 Already by 2004, just after the project’s midterm, maize production accounted for 64 percent of the region’s
cash crop production, up from 44 percent in 2001 (Thongmanivong 2006).

implementation refers to the existence of such programs (World Bank 2004 and 2008),
although there are references to small anti-opium production projects in Oudomxay and
Phongsaly provinces6 (World Bank 2004 Table 3.7).

INTEGRATING THE PROVINCES INTO THE NATIONAL ECONOMY

4.19 There is no one indicator that can measure the integration of these provinces into the
national economy that the project intended. This PPAR therefore looked elsewhere for
evidence of this result. Economies, or parts of them that are integrated, can be expected to
grow at a similar pace, as illustrated by the similar increases in GDP per capita in the
provinces as in Laos as a whole (Table 4.3). The cases of Oudomxay and Phongsaly point to
continuing integration with the national economy at a steady pace—no more, no less.
Integration can also be measured by the provinces’ participation in Laos’ international trade
(whose growth was made possible by the project’s road improvement) with neighboring
countries, namely Thailand, China and Vietnam. Expansion of trade with China and Vietnam
was driven by the dynamic growth of those countries’ economies. Data show that, after
project completion in 2009, trade into and out of the provinces was much higher than before
the project in 1999, but the Lao PDR’s trade as a whole with these countries followed a
similar pattern, pointing to the provinces’ economies developing hand-in-hand with the
national economy. There was one big difference. Oudomxay and Phongsaly exports to and

imports from Vietnam grew much more rapidly than they did for the nation as whole. All
roads upgraded by this project were sections of highways connecting the Lao PDR to the
neighboring trading partners. During its field visit, the IEG mission saw this integration in
action illustrated by the heavy commercial trucks exporting maize to China and Vietnam. It
was also clear how Muang Xay, the capital of Oudomxay Province, had become an important
entrepot where traders from neighboring countries sold their goods or engaged in other
business in the town.

EFFICIENCY IN ACHIEVING RESULTS

4.20 The efficiency of the project road investments, that accounted for 77 percent of total
project costs was mostly substantial as reflected in the completion estimates of economic
rates of return (ERR) of were 9-61 percent for Oudomxay and 9-27 percent for Phongsaly
(ICR p. 34). These are somewhat lower than the ERR estimates reported by the PAD of 20.7-
62.3 percent for Oudomxay’s and 14.4-15.9 percent for Phongsaly (PAD p. 54). Both
completion and appraisal ERRs apply similar variables and parameters; benefits from savings
in vehicle operating costs and travel time spent by passenger, from low baseline traffic
counts (Table 4.2) projected to grow rapidly at 7-9 percent per annum. Both provinces
reported 50-75 percent savings in journey times by road—the project’s chosen performance
indicator. IEG learned from several residents and drivers that travel times had been much
longer prior to the improvements—some travel could not take place at all during rainy
seasons that blocked road sections by flooding and/or landslides. Recent ERRs were lower
than PAD estimates because actual traffic flows in 2009 were lower than appraisal
projections; in Oudomxay, actual flows were 260 vehicles per day against 432 projected,
                                               17


while in Phongsaly, actual flows were 52 vehicles per day against 79 projected. (Table 4.2).
In spite of these lighter flows than expected, the trucks actually plying the project roads were
twice as heavy as planned, meaning that they could carry as much produce as the projected
larger flow of smaller vehicles. If instead of adopting the traditional focus of transport
cost:benefit analysis of operating costs and time savings, the benefits of agricultural value-
added made possible by the road had been assessed, they would likely yield higher rates of
return than those reported by the ICR.

4.21 The efficiency of Phongsaly’s airfield investment, that accounted for only 4.3 percent
of the total project cost, has yet to be demonstrated. At this writing, there is no regular air
service to Phongsaly and therefore no benefits yet accrue from the component. At appraisal it
was expected to yield an economic rate of return of 9.0 percent, based upon 20 passengers
per day using the facility and passenger traffic growing at 5 percent p.a. (PAD p. 57). The
ICR candidly acknowledged (ICR p. 16) that it could not re-estimate an ERR. Even under the
temporary operation during the 18 months after the airfield’s completion when a 11-seater
aircraft operated twice a week, maximum passenger flows were less than one-third of the
appraisal scenario. IEG found expectations in the region and in Vientiane, however, that
service would resume shortly. Lao Air may shortly acquire the necessary aircraft and GOL is
investing in air transport expansion in the region, as plans for a new terminal building at the
busier Oudomxay airport indicate.

4.22 The efficiency of the urban water supply was reflected in appraisal ERR estimates of
11.5 percent for Muang Xay and 10.3 percent in Muang Khoua (in Phongsaly). The principal
benefits were measured by incremental water sales expected to grow at about 3.0 percent per
annum, close to the projected at actual population growth over the 1999-2009 period. ERRs
were not re-estimated at completion, however. The ICR reported that the systems were ―in
their early days‖ and that ―it will be important to carry out a detailed economic re-evaluation
once more data become available‖ (ICR p. 17). To date, the recommended re-evaluation (that
IEG supports) has yet to be carried out. Whether the resulting project investments were more
or less efficient than the appraisal ERRs indicate will depend upon reported cost savings
(Table 3.1) being more or less than the reported shortfall of benefits.

5. Ratings
OUTCOME

5.1      Rated Satisfactory. The project achieved its substantially relevant objective with
only minor shortcomings. Thanks to a substantially relevant design that incorporated
infrastructure and institutional development components that were instrumental in achieving
the project’s objective, the operation obtained important results across all four aspects of the
objective assessed by this PPAR. First, local institutional capacity in the provinces of
Oudomxay and Phongsaly was substantially strengthened, as provincial finances and
responsibilities increased and technical teams enhanced their professional skills of
procurement and maintenance of infrastructure investments in particular. Second, the project
substantially upgraded and rehabilitated provincial infrastructure, particularly roads that gave
reliable year-round access for the first time. It also improved water supply with likely health
benefits. Third, poverty reduction, underway in the Lao PDR as a whole, proceeded faster in
                                               18


the provinces than the national average, according to provinces’ own data, facilitated by
improved access to markets. It was clear from IEG mission field visits that the poor were
among the direct project beneficiaries. Fourth, through improving local roads providing
better access to markets for agricultural produce especially, the project helped integrate these
remote provinces into the national economy. This is well illustrated by the active
international trade they practice with neighboring Thailand, China and Vietnam, trade that
had barely existed prior to the project. IEG’s observation of the use and condition of the
roads—that account for 72 percent of project costs—as well as preliminary ERR estimates of
investments in them point to substantial project efficiency. Other components may not have
performed as well as expected—the Phongsaly airfield, for instance—or still await
completion ERR estimates—such as rural water supply—but they do not carry sufficient
weight to affect the overall efficiency rating of the project.

RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

5.2      Rated Moderate. Infrastructure improvements made by the project, particularly
rehabilitating and upgrading the roads, are likely to continue to yield benefits into the future.
The infrastructure was well built and remains resilient to the use by much heavier vehicles
that it was designed for. Performance-based contracts with private operators have already
assured reliable maintenance for a three-year period since completion, and that is likely to
continue. Indeed, fielding the PPAR mission at this time allowed IEG to confirm the recent
sustainability of the project investments. The much stronger provincial finances after the
project guaranteed adequate resources to fund them. Also, provincial officials reported that
cost recovery from users of rural water supply systems contributes to the sustainability of
each one’s service, although detailed village-level data on this were not available. IEG did
hear from several beneficiaries that they willingly paid user fees for the service. Most
important was that three years after completion, the infrastructure was functioning well.

BANK PERFORMANCE

5.3     Rated Satisfactory. Quality at entry is rated moderately satisfactory. The Bank teams
used the successful experience of the prior Luang Nampa Provincial Development Project to
design the new operation focused on a few infrastructure sub-sectors only. This was to keep
the project manageable. IEG did not find the Bank’s reported lack of attention to the
provincial ―skills gap‖ (ICR p. 20) to be a significant over-estimate of provincial capacity.
On the other hand, the Bank’s original plan had been to cover four northern provinces, a
number reduced to two only, at the request of GOL. The project results framework and M&E
design, however, fell short of what was needed to adequately monitor achievement of
development objectives. Supervision was satisfactory with sufficient budget for regular
missions to the project’s remote and inaccessible parts of the country. With support from the
Bank’s Bangkok and Hanoi offices, Bank supervision missions provided contracting and
construction advice highly appreciated by the local provincial teams, even from Bank water
supply specialists who were in short supply for this project. Judging from the excellent
Borrower implementation performance, the Bank addressed implementation issues promptly
and effectively. Project implementation ratings were realistic. Overall Bank performance is
rated moderately satisfactory. Had monitoring and evaluation (M&E) design and
implementation been stronger, then Bank performance would have warranted a higher rating.
                                             19


BORROWER PERFORMANCE

5.4      Rated Satisfactory. Government performance is rated satisfactory. The project
benefited from full support by GOL and top authorities of the two provinces, notwithstanding
the limited resources and staff that they were able to deploy at project startup. Implementing
agency performance is rated satisfactory. Project management units under the provincial
Departments of Water and Transport (DPWT) were diligent in implementing the project,
acquiring much experience that contributed significantly to their institutional learning and
consolidation. There has been further consolidation of provincial performance since the mid-
2008 ICR. Thus the IEG mission could work closely with informed technical teams and
develop a meaningful dialogue with them on project evaluation. IEG was also impressed by
the positive and collaborative response of the teams in Oudomxay and Phongsaly in
assembling project baseline and endline data in response to requests that IEG had made
earlier from Washington. The provincial NAMSAAT and NAMPAPA also worked very well
in improving water supply, and correcting earlier design shortcomings of the investments.
Overall Borrower performance is rated satisfactory.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION (M&E)

5.5     Rated: Modest. The quality of M&E design was less than needed to fully assess the
impact of the project. Key aspects of the project objective had no related performance
indicators at all, or indicators focused more upon inputs than outcomes. For measuring
reducing poverty and the integration of the provinces into the national economy, there were
no designated indicators. The M&E proposed counting the number of provincial staff trained
to measure local institutional strengthening. But that training was an input into the
strengthening, not a measure of its outcome. For that, M&E could have focused upon
measures of greater institutional resources, responsibilities and capabilities. On the other
hand, M&E used appropriate indicators to measure infrastructure upgrading, namely less
time taken for road travel and for collecting water. Despite the design shortcomings, M&E
implementation was carried out well by both provinces, and in doing so, it allowed them to
develop their own considerable data collection and assembly capacity. The project had
intended to build up such a capacity within the provinces that they did not have beforehand.
While IEG was unable to gather evidence that M&E utilization provided feedback leading to
provinces to change course during implementation, M&E was certainly used to provide data
for project evaluation, including that used for this PPAR

6. Lessons
6.1    Within a broader national and international context of buoyant economic growth, new
and upgraded infrastructure can help integrate poorer remote areas of a country and
contribute to reduce their poverty. This project’s improved road infrastructure gave the
beneficiary provinces better access, allowing them to keep pace with South-East Asia’s rapid
economic growth, contributing poverty reduction.

6.2     Infrastructure that foments economic growth can also trigger unexpected demands for
the infrastructure itself. This requires continuous monitoring to identify problems and inform
appropriate responses. In the case of this project, the success of economic integration means
                                             20


that the roads are carrying much heavier trucks than they were designed for. More intense
maintenance, strengthening the pavement or restricting vehicle weights are among possible
responses. The chosen response has to be within local financial and management capacity
constraints.

6.3    On-the-job training prepares local officials and professional cadres to carry on the
work of development assistance after a project has closed. It could be eligible for project
funding. Formal training programs and courses have roles to play, too, but project design and
implementation should ensure that the learning from them is relevant to achieving an
operation’s intended outcomes.
