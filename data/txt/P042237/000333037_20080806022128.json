Republic were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the\n            risk to development outcome was substantial, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the\n            multi-sectoral approach and the implementation delegated at\n            the provincial level proved to be efficient. The project\n            adopted a multi-sectoral implementation approach for road\n            transport, urban water supply, rural water supply and\n            capacity development, through sector based provincial units.\n            The organizational arrangements and coordination among\n            components were challenging at times, for they required\n            changes in the working methods to constant and open\n            communication among the various units. However, synergy was\n            created particularly on the road, town and rural water\n            components for cooperation and fulfillment of common\n            interests. The project design and cost estimate for civil\n            works should include detailed design for proper assessment\n            of the material and monetary resource needs. Project\n            preparation was based on visual assessments and a few road\n            materials samples, and that main engineering decisions would\n            be made on site jointly by the supervising engineers and\n            contractors. This practice provided inadequate information\n            on the condition of the existing pavements and in\n            consequence together with the low capacity of the provincial\n            staff required changes in the rehabilitation design and\n            escalation of quantities and cost of the road works."}, "docdt": "2008-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
