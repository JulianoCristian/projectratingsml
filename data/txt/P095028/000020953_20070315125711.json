satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was low or negligible, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Lessons learned were as follows: (1) In Middle-Income\n            Countries with highly skilled government staff, it is\n            critical to adopt a social participatory and consultative\n            process in the preparation of the operations. Continuous\n            dialogue with official counterparts and independent analysts\n            simplified the team's work during preparation, as the\n            main sectors and policies to be supported were clearly\n            identified; (2) the institutional restrictions of a new\n            administration must be taken into account when preparing an\n            operation. The context in which policy reforms are designed\n            and implemented at the time a new government takes office\n            necessarily generates additional restrictions that must be\n            taken in consideration when designing an operation; and (3)\n            a one-tranche DPL can be an effective instrument for the\n            Bank to provide continuity to reform efforts and lay the\n            foundations for programmatic sector dialogue when a new\n            administration takes office."}, "docdt": "2007-02-26T00:00:00Z"}
