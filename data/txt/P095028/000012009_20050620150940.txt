Description          The proposed SPDPL would be a stand-alone, single-tranche
                     development policy loan (DPL) that would (i)     recognize
                     Uruguay's social policy response to the economic crisis of
                     2001and 2002; (ii) past and ongoing structural and
                                          support
                     administrative reforms inthe health, education, and social
                     protection sectors; and (iii)assist the early activities of the new
                     administration invarious social policy areas. The SPDPL
                     would also lay the foundation for a program o f future Bank
                     assistance, as outlined inthe FYOS-FY10CAS, in support of
                     Uruguay's social policy programs through multisector
                     programmatic DPLs, as well as through investment and
                     technical assistance operations. The proposed SPDPL would
                     support specific actions to increase the efficiency, coverage
                     and sustainability of Uruguay's health, education and social
                     protection sectors and programs.
Benefits             The policy measures supported by the SPDPL are expected to
                     lead to: (i)
                                a steeper reduction inpoverty levels inthe
                     aftermath of the crisis, over and above that which would have
                     resulted without the supported measures; and (ii)     improved
                     equity and efficiency of social sector expenditures. While
                     some of the actions proposed would have an immediate
                     impact, others are expected to improve Uruguay's social
                     conditions over time.
Risks                Given that the SPDPL i s single-tranche, the associated risks
                     are considered low to moderate. Riskso f non-compliance with
                     expected actions are considered minimalas they will be
                     complied with before consideration by the Bank's Board.
                     However, there are important sustainability risks, as some of
                     the SPDPL-supported actions represent the starting point of
                     reforms that will require continuation over time to be effective.
                     These sustainability risks can be classified as political,
                     economic, and managerial. Political risks relate to the potential
                     lack of ownership of reforms initiated by the former
                     administration. These risks are expected to be mitigated by the

                   dialogue with the Government. Economic and financial risks
                   relate to the possibility of eventual fiscal restrictions that
                   would limit implementation of proposed reforms, potential
                   debt sustainability problems inUruguay and external shocks
                   causedby unexpected economic downturns in neighboring
                   countries. This risk i s mitigated by the inclusion of program
                   expenditures inthe Government's five-year budget and the
                   expectations that the Government will maintain a sustainable
                   macroeconomic framework. Finally, managerialrisks relate to
                   the possible difficulties inmanaging new sectoral programs
                   and systems because of the potential shortage o f trained human
                   resources. This risk i s mitigated by sectoral ministries' efforts
                   to train their staff at the local levels and b y cross support
                   provided across ministries (inparticular, from the Social
                   Security Fundto the new Ministry of Social Development).

                                        I. INTRODUCTION

1.       The proposed Social Program Development Policy Loan (SPDPL) i s the first of
several operations that will provide support to Uruguay's social sector programs under the
new FYO5-FY10 Country Assistance Strategy (Report No. 31804-UY). The proposed
operation would allow the Bank to continue its long-standing support for social programs in
Uruguay while, at the same time, adapting that support from a crisis to a post-crisis
environment.

2.       After several years of growth, the economic situation in Uruguay began to deteriorate
inthe late 1990s. In2002, a serious crisis hit the economy, triggered by events inneighboring
Argentina. The scope and nature of the crisis i s fully documented in the 2005 CAS and in the
Completion Report for the 2000 CAS, both of which are submitted for consideration by the
Board along with this Program Document. An 11 percent drop in GDP during 2002, along
with an increase in poverty to an unprecedented peak of 31 percent in 2003, are of particular
concern for social sector programs. As a result, exceptional demands were placed upon social
sector programs at the very time when fiscal resources were severely constrained.

3.       The Government of Uruguay's response to the crisis was effective, in a relatively short
period of time, to restore macroeconomic equilibrium and investor confidence. Importantly,
Government's efforts to protect priority social programs and to initiate structural reforms in
the social sectors were successful in avoiding deterioration inbasic social indicators and even
contributed to continued improvements for some important indicators.

4.       The international community responded positively to the economic crisis in Uruguay
and the Bank joined with the International Monetary Fund and the Inter-American
Development Bank in pledging a package of financial support amounting to US$4 billion in
total.

5.       To address the immediate impact of the crisis, Uruguay and the Bank agreed that
structural adjustment lending was to be the preferred instrument of support for the country at
the time of crisis. Two Structural Adjustment Loans (SAL-1 and SAL-2) and two Special
Structural Adjustment Loans (SSAL-1 and SSAL-2) were approved for a combined
commitment of US$556 million dollars. The first SAL, approved in August 2002, and the
second SSAL, approved in April 2003, merit particular attention because they focused
specifically upon social sector issues which serve as a foundation for the proposed SPDPL to
extend further support for additional Government action.

6.      Under the first SAL, the system o f social protection was to be strengthened by
improving management and by safeguarding budget allocations. In addition, unemployment
insurance was to be reformed and training for the unemployed was to be streamlined. The
program goals were all substantially achieved,' and the loan was fully disbursed.


' One action included in the SAL-1 program was the enactment of a new unemployment insurance law, which
was drafted, but not approved by Congress. A waiver of this condition was granted, in view of the fact that the

7.       The second Special SAL (SSAL-2) was designed to be disbursed in three tranches.
The operation aimed at improving the equity and efficiency of public expenditures in health
and education by improving management and by giving budgetary protection to priority
programs. Good progress was made towards those goals and, by 2004, the Government had
complied with all conditions in the social sectors for release of the second and third tranches.
However, tranche release was held up because, when the loan was approved in 2003, a
decision was made to link the release of the second and third tranches with the corresponding
tranches of SAL-2, which was approved on the same date. Progress with the SAL-2, which
related to reforms of infrastructure, has been much slower than had been anticipated. The new
administration i s committed to pursuingthe infrastructure reform agenda and has produced a
roadmap for achieving this, which i s includedinthe new CAS.

8.       Since 2003, the overall situation of Uruguay has changed. The economy has
experienced a strong recovery and GDP grew by 12.3 percent in 2004. In addition, a
significant tightening of spreads and successful renewed access to private markets indicate
that the economic situation i s returning to normal. Inthis context, the new administration and
the Bank have agreed on the appropriateness to redefine the scope and terms under which the
Bank i s supporting the reforms in the social sectors. Given that the emergency situation
during which SSAL-2 was designed has been overcome, and given that new lending
opportunities are available under the new CAS, the Government has requested the
cancellation o f the second and third tranches of SSAL-2, for a combined amount of US$75
million.

9.       Under the new CAS, the Government has requested a Social Program Development
Policy Loan (SPDPL) that would reflect the social reforms and measures that have been
undertaken in a comprehensive manner as well as new actions in the social area to improve
quality, efficiency and equity in social service provision. A number of significant reforms
were introduced by the previous Government in the aftermath of the crisis to improve the
coverage, equity and efficiency of social spending. These include an expansion of the family
allowance system to households whose sole source of income i s from informal sector
employment, the protection of budgets for critical educational programs, and efforts to
improve efficiency in the health sector, among others. The new administration, which
assumed office in March 2005, i s committed to continue these reforms and expand them to
make social programs more efficient, equitable and sustainable.

10.      The proposed SPDPL, a single tranche development policy loan of US$75.38 million,
would be supportive of those efforts. It fits well within the overall strategy of the CAS and, in
particular, within the objective of improving living standards. It would also prepare the way
for further social sector lending. The indicative lending program put forward in the CAS
includes additional operations to be prepared in the next few years (investment, technical
assistance and DPLs), in order to continue Bank support for Uruguay's effort to strengthen its
tradition as a highly equitable country and efficient social institutions, with a view to reduce
poverty in the medium term.




Government made adjustments in the enforcement of existing legislation, which allowed it to reduce
significantly extensions of unemployment benefits. Also, the previous Government introduced a community
work program, albeit with limited coverage.

                         11.     MACROECONOMICENVIRONMENT

11.         Following a decade of macroeconomic stability and steady growth during the
nineties, Uruguay suffered a sharp reversal in 1998 with a recession that persisted for more
than three years before collapsing into a deep economic crisis provoked, in large part, by
events in neighboring Argentina. When Argentina defaulted on its public debt, abandoned the
U.S. dollar as a monetary anchor and devalued its currency to one third o f its previous value,
the effect upon Uruguay was disastrous. There was a rush to withdraw deposits from the
banking system driven initially by the exposure of Uruguayan banks to Argentina's country
risk and later for fear that the Government of Uruguay could follow the example of Argentina
and restrict withdrawals. As a result, the important offshore banking sector and, eventually,
the domestic banking sector came under severe pressure and a number o f banks collapsed,
notwithstanding emergency government support. A ripple effect throughout the economy
caused GDP to fall by 11 percent in 2002 alone, while unemployment rose to almost 20
percent by end-2002.

12.         Although difficult to demonstrate empirically, it i s likely that the outcome of the
crisis would have been much worse had it not been for an effective adjustment effort by the
Uruguayan authorities and the consensual nature of the country's political system. The
success with which Uruguay was able to weather the economic crisis o f 2001-02 owes much
to its prompt and purposeful response to events. Negotiations with creditors led to the
successful conclusion of a sovereign debt exchange in May 2003, raising the average maturity
of bonds by over 5 years without increasing interest rates and without a principal haircut.
Fiscal adjustment resulted in a primary fiscal surplus of 3.8 percent o f GDP in 2004 (a major
turnaround from primary deficits through 1999-2001). Prudent monetary management
enabled the inflationary impact of the 2002 devaluation to be limitedto only 19.4percent that
year. Subsequently, inflation was brought down to single figures.

13.              Although the Uruguayan economy remains highly vulnerable to adverse external
shocks given the high level of external debt and financial dollarization, the country's
macroeconomic outlook has strengthened considerably. Prospects for continued economic
growth in 2005 are good. A modest strengthening of the peso and higher oil prices will not
offset the greatly enhanced competitiveness of Uruguay which resulted from the 2002
devaluation. Rising employment and some increase in real wages i s likely to boost domestic
demand. Real growth o f 6 percent i s projected in 2005 and that would raise per capita
incomes close to pre-crisis levels. At the same time, a disciplined monetary policy together
with a modest appreciation of the peso i s likely to keep inflation within the 5.5-7.5 percent
target range of the Central Bank.A primary surplus of 3.5 percent o f GDP i s targeted in 2005,
slightly down from the 3.8 percent recorded in 2004 in order to accommodate the new
Government's social emergency program.

14.              These macroeconomic projections are predicated upon the assumption that the
Government will continue to maintain a sound macroeconomic framework and pursue its
reform agenda. The projections are not without risk, however. Sensitivity analysis shows that
even modest slippage could reverse the projected downward public debt path, and larger
slippages in performance could increase vulnerability significantly. A slippage in the primary
surplus by one percentage point of GDP relative to the baseline scenario would result in a
projected debt to GDP ratio of 67 percent in 2010, 7 percentage points of GDP higher than
under the base case, although still significantly lower than current levels. A simultaneous
deterioration of fiscal performance and growth performance poses a considerable risk to debt
sustainability. Therefore, it is important to carefully monitor macroeconomic performance and
the reform program.



                                                                     4

15.        The proposed SPDPL forms part of a broader package o f international support for
Uruguay's post-crisis economic recovery and would contribute to meeting the gross public
sector financing needs of more than US$2 billion in 2005. The new CAS presented to the
Board with this proposed loan describes the overall program of the Bank. Also, the
Government has reached agreement with IMF staff on a new three year Standby arrangement
through mid-2008 which i s expected to be presented to the IMF Board in early June. Under
the new program, IMF staff i s proposing access equivalent to 60 percent o f repayments due
over the program period which amount to approximately US$1.9 billion at current exchange
rates. Finally, IADB staff i s preparing a new Country Paper, for presentation to IADB
Management's Programming Committee in June 2005 and presentation to the Board of
Directors possibly inthe third quarter of the calendar year.

            111.      SOCIAL IMPACT OF CRISIS AND GOVERNMENTRESPONSE

  16.      This section describes the social impact of the 2001-2002 crisis, with special emphasis
  on its consequences on access to and quality of social services. The section also presents the
  main actions implemented by the Government to address the crisis' effects and improve
  efficiency in health sector spending, ensure protection of critical programs in education, and
  expand important social protection programs. Overall, while poverty and unemployment
  increased to record levels in the aftermath of the crisis, the Government's response likely
  mitigated a potentially stronger negative impact on both quantity and quality of service
  delivery. Consequently, repercussions on basic social indicators such as school enrollment
  and infant mortality rates were largely avoided, while some social indicators continued to
  improve and inequality in access to social services did not deteriorate significantly.

  17.     Poverty and Unemplovment. The 1998 recession and the subsequent economic crisis
 had a severe social impact, especially on unemployment and poverty. Unemployment
 increased from about 10 percent in 1998 to almost 20 percent at the end of 2002. Duringthe
 period from 1998 to 2002, the proportion of self-employed and of those employed in the
  informal sector also grew and was accompanied by a reduction in real wages in the private
  sector.

  18.     Household income startedto decline in 1998 and fell by more than a fifth in the period
 from 1998 to the end of 2002, as it was negatively impacted by poor performance of the labor
  market in terms of job creation and wage behavior. As a result, poverty increased between
  2000 and 2003 from 17 percent to 31 percent of the population, while extreme poverty also
 doubled to 2.8 percent o f the population during the same period.* Recent poverty estimates for
  2004 show a stabilization of poverty around 31 percent. Despite the impact on household
 income, extreme poverty remained low in Uruguay with respect to other Latin American
 countries and the recent economic recovery should reverse the increasing trend in poverty
 rates.

  19.     The Government of Uruguay recognizedearly on the magnitude of the crisis' effect on
 poverty and unemployment and its potential detrimental impacts on social outcomes and took
  a proactive attitude to protect the population and the most critical services, thus mitigating the
  social impact of the crisis and setting the stage for a more rapid recovery. The main focus o f
 Government policies during the crisis was on (i)          restoring and maintaining macro-economic
  stability; (ii)achieving a swift and comprehensive renegotiation o f the country's outstanding
 debt; (iii) protecting some critical social sector budgets; (iv) improving equity by increasing
 coverage and depth of social assistance with respect to inclusion o f informal sector workers
 and expansion of food programs; and (v) improving the efficiency of public health services
provision. Also, a number of critical administrative reforms in the social sectors continued
 duringthis period.

20.      Health. The 2002 economic crisis in Uruguay affected health outcomes as well as the
resources and organization of the health provision system. First,positive trends inbasic health
indicators, such as infant mortality rates and malnutrition, stopped in 2001-2003. Second, the
health provision system, organized around two basic schemes (one contributory for formal
workers and the other financed by the Ministry of Public Health for informal workers and the
inactive population) suffered a rapid change in its demand structure, as many patients left the
contributory scheme and began demanding services from the public system. Consequently,
the number o f patients usingthe public health system - especially public hospitals - increased
and, as a result, the public share intotal health care provision rose substantially.

21.      The Government responded to the additional demand by promoting higher efficiency
in its institutions, implementing cost saving measures, and generating alternative funding
sources. Three main policies were implemented. First, reforms in the budget allocation to
public hospitals (to favor hospitals with higher production) and in the budget management
systems of each hospital resulted inincreased efficiency. Second, important efforts were made
to reduce hidden subsidies from the public system to private insurers, as significant numbers
of insured individuals used public hospitals without being charged. Finally, the Government
introduced important reforms to the operation of the Fondo Nacional de Recursos (FNR), the
agency in charge of financing high-cost medical procedures. As a consequence, the FNR
improved its financial performance. While FNR ran a deficit for most o f the 1990s and a
record deficit of 16.4 percent o f its revenues in 2000, its financial situation began to improve
in2001 and, by 2003, ithada surplus of almost 7 percent of its revenues.

22.      These reforms allowed the public system to compensate for the decline in coverage o f
formal sector insurance schemes and, overall, Uruguay maintained a high level o f coverage
even through the crisis period (see Table 2). Ambulatory care services provided by public
hospitals grew by 23 percent between 2000 and 2003, and the proportion o f Uruguayans with
health insurance or a regular source o f care, which had increased from 93.5 percent in 1995 to
97 percent in 2001, remained stable during the crisis at approximately 97 percent. Some
critical health indicators (including the infant mortality rate), began to improve again in2004.

23.     Education. In principle, the economic crisis might have affected the coverage, equity,
and quality of education in Uruguay through several channels. Increases in unemployment
and poverty incidence could have affected parents' ability to finance education-related
expenditures, or it might have led to increases in the number o f children who work. These


                                                     7

changes would have likely affected the poorest households, and thus might have led to
increases in inequity in educational opportunities. Also, fiscal restrictions (which resulted in a
decline in real teachers' wages and other education expenditures) could have produced
disruptions due to lack of materials or teachers absenteeism.

24.      Indeed, while public education expenditures as a share of GDP remained stable at
around 3.6 percent during 2001-2003, the sharp decline in GDP translated into a proportional
reduction o f total education expenditures in real terms. Several programs (including plans to
expand access to preschool education as well as expansion of the full-time schools model)
were halted, non-recurrent investments were curtailed, and the maintenance of school
buildings and other neededrepairs were delayed.

25.      While limiting expenditures in some areas, the Government granted budgetary
protection to specific priority programs in 2003 and 2004 with support from the SSAL-2.
These included: basic school supplies, bilingual education, and textbooks and teaching
materials. In addition, the authorities promoted administrative reforms, including the
development o f management information systems for primary and secondary education, as
well as the creation of an internal audit unit within ANEP, the National Administration of
Public Education.

26.      In practice, despite the fall in real expenditures, and in part due to the spending
protection o f basic education inputs, the performance of the education system did not decline
(see Table 2). Instead, enrollment in preschool, secondary, and tertiary education levels
(primary had already achieved universal enrollment prior to the crisis) continued to grow,
albeit at more moderate rates. Student performance in the national assessment, as well as
scores in PISA 2003, suggests that the crisis did not further worsen education quality. Mean
scores in the national assessments show steady improvements through 2002, and the rise in
scores among students from poor socioeconomic backgrounds was greater than the
improvement among students from more privileged backgrounds. As a result, the gap in
achievement between students from high and low socioeconomic backgrounds continued to
narrow, an encouraging result when compared to most countries.

27.      Social Protection. The 2001-2002 economic crisis seriously challenged the social
protection system. Fiscal tightening reduced both funding for the sector and the real value of
social protection benefits, while at the same time demand for these benefits sharply increased.
Although the number of beneficiaries in the pension system i s mostly determined b y long-
term trends and thus was not affected by the crisis, other indicators, such as the real value o f
average pension benefits and the number of contributors, declined by as much as 20 percent
duringthe crisis.

28.      The increase in worker informality resulted in a decline in the number o f contributors
to the health and pension insurance schemes. The number o f formal sector workers' children
covered by the Family Allowances program fell from an average of 400,000 in 2000 to
300,000 in 2003.3 Other programs, such as unemployment insurance, were unable to respond
effectively to the crisis and only 17 percent of the unemployed were able to obtain this benefit
duringthe crisis.

  This trend has reversed since 2003, with the expansion of the Family Allowances program to children of
informal workers and unemployed individuals. As a result, between 2003 and 2004, the number of beneficiaries
of the program rose by 25 percent.

                                                    8

29.      Recognizing that the traditional contributory scheme was insufficient to provide
adequate social protection to the rapidly growing unemployed and informal workers and their
families, the Government extended the family allowances benefits to households with reduced
income, making them eligible for a monthly benefit equivalent 16 percent of the minimum
wage per child to households with unemployedheads or informal workers. Between 2000 and
2004, the number of childrenbenefitingfrom this program increased from 65,000 to 185,000.

30.      In May 2003, the Government created a new workfare program, the Progrumu de
Actividudes Comuniturias (Community Activities Program- PAC). This program provides a
monthly payment of approximately 1,100 Uruguayan pesos (US$40), in exchange for four
six-hour working days per week, in local infrastructure programs. The coverage of the PACs
has been limited (approximately 5,000 beneficiaries) but results have been evaluated as
positive overall.

31.      Finally, Uruguay has had a wide array of food transfer programs for several years,
representing about 0.4 percent of GDP in 2003. The programs had different goals (improving
nutrition, reducing income inequality, and effectively responding to the social emergency) and
target groups (school children, pregnant women, newborns, the elderly and disabled). While
the programs' magnitude i s limited, their flexibility and capacity to expand during the crisis
(when total expenditures grew by 32 percent), on balance, had an overall positive impact on
the target population in spite of substantial leakage (37 percent of the beneficiaries were not
poor). In 2003, it was estimated that 65 percent of households below the extreme poverty line
received some type of food transfer, while 42 percent of the moderately poor were also
beneficiaries.

32.      Bank support. Apart from the overall financing support to stabilize the macro-
economic situation and continuous dialogue and technical assistance, the Bank provided,
through SAL-1 and SSAL-2, specific support for the crisis response of Government.
Importantly, several Government actions to address the detrimental effects of the crisis on the
social sectors went significantly beyond agreed measures. For example, budgeted and
executed amounts for education priority programs in most cases exceeded the amounts agreed
to inthe SSAL-2. As a result, the Government response to the crisis was effective, and can be
credited with having contained its impact on the most vulnerable population. Indeed, the
crisis' impact on coverage and quality of social service delivery was mitigated and, partly as a
consequence, deterioration in health and education outcomes were either minor or quickly
reversed.

    IV.CURRENTSOCIALPOLICY AGENDA AND GOVERNMENT PROGRAM

33.      As the economic recovery is strengthening, several social indicators have begun to
recover. Unemployment, for example, was estimated in early 2005 at 11.8 percent, a level
similar to the average of the late 1990s and well below the maximum of 19.8 percent in late
2002, and the percentage of the labor force contributing to the social security system
increased from 53 percent in 2002 to 59 percent in 2004. The poverty rate, which rose sharply
between 2001 and 2003, appears to be leveling off at around 31 p e r ~ e n t . ~

34.      This section discusses the mainchallenges inthe three social sectors in the post-crisis
scenario as well as how the new administration i s planning to address them. With the most
severe crisis weathered and the increase in poverty halted, the new administration i s
formulating policies to address both the lasting impact o f crisis, especially for the poorest, as
well as underlying structural deficiencies inthe sectors and formulating longer-term policies.

IV.l. THE HEALTHSECTOR

35.      Sector Description. Uruguay has a complex array of health care financing and delivery
arrangements which together provide access to health care services or health insurance
coverage for 97 percent of the population. Roughly 52 percent of the population has some
type of health insurance. Forty-two private, cooperative-type organizations - referred to as
IAMCs (Instituciones de Asistencia MCdica Colectiva) - cover about 85 percent of the
insured. The most important institutional source of insurance coverage is the social security
system (Banco de Previsi6n Social, BPS), and within it, the Directorate for Health Services
(DISSE) accounts for 41 percent of the members of IAMCs and provides coverage for
workers. The remaining 59 percent of individuals with I A M C coverage have plans that are
financed out of pocket. The BPS purchases the vast majority o f the services it finances from
IAMCs.

36.      The Ministry o f Health (Ministerio de Salud Publica, MSP) provides primary health
care coverage to 43 percent of the population. An autonomous institution, the Administrucio'n
de los Servicios de Sulud del Estudo (ASSE), runs the MSP's vast network of hospitals, health
centers, and clinics providing health care-typically           without charge-to the majority of the
poor. The National Resources Fund (Fondo de Recursos Nucionules, FNR) provides coverage
to all Uruguayans for a defined basket of 16 specific, high cost medical services. There are a
host of other, smaller health care delivery systems, including those of the armed forces, the
police and a number of other state agencies and parastatals.

37.      Uruguay has good health indicators and access to health care (public and private) i s
almost universal. Significant improvements in the performance o f public health services have
taken place in recent years. Specifically, both the MSP and the FNR upgraded their
effectiveness and efficiency. MSP expanded health care coverage to low income households
(replacing coverage from the private sector), substantially reduced the average days of
hospitalizations while increasing the number of office visits, and reformed its procedures for
the procurement of medical supplies. Similarly, FNR went from deficit to surplus through
efficiency-enhancing reforms.



 For a discussion of the poverty evolution in Uruguay, see Annex 4.

                                                      10

38.     In spite of these accomplishments, the Uruguayan health care system is considered
excessively costly. In 2003, public and private expenditures in health care in Uruguay were
close to 11 percent of GDP, one of the highest ratios in the world. The high cost of health
services i s driven by (i) an aging population, (ii) unduly complex institutional structure,
                                                     an
and (iii)a mismatch between the health care services provided b y the system and the
population's needs. The fragmentation of the system results in high costs and undermines the
standard o f service. Primary and secondary health prevention i s neglected within the health
care system, thereby increasing the cost of specialized treatment at the tertiary level.
Significant inequities persist in the distribution o f fiscal subsidies for health care which
encompass direct fiscal subsidies paid to the health insurance of the social security institute
and substantial indirect subsidies paidto private insurers (IAMCs).

39.     Government Strategy and Challenges Ahead. In its first weeks in office, the new
administration has focused on three important issues. First, the Ministry of Public Health i s
developing a program aimed at providing basic care to the most vulnerable and hard-to-reach
populations. Second, MSP i s working on a definition of a National Health Insurance System,
which would provide a new strategic framework to coordinate better among the different
health insurance schemes. Third, MSP i s designing a new health care model based on primary
care (preventive rather than curative), with the goal of developing an integrated system that
will ensure more equitable access to services, improved quality of care and increased financial
sustainability.

40.     The new administration i s also considering alternatives to empower health system
administrators at the local and regional levels. One goal involves decentralizing public
hospital administration. Authorities at the MSP are preparing a normative framework to
introduce a new management model for ASSE in which more decisions would be taken by
administrators who are closer to service providers, while the center would maintain control of
the overall, strategic health policy decisions.

41.     Inaddition, the Government has acknowledgedthat there are pending issues regarding
the organization of health services providers, with significant inefficiencies that increase the
overall cost of the system and reduce access. The Government i s planning to introduce
reforms that would empower beneficiaries, giving them the opportunity to select their
providers and contribute to system-wide evaluations and decision making through
participatory mechanisms.

42.     Bank Support. The Bank i s committed to working with the Uruguayan Government
during the CAS period in advancing structural reforms in the health sector. The proposed
SPDPL supports significant actions to enhance efficiency and quality inhealth care provision.

43.     Based on analytical work carried out by the Bank during FY05, the Government has
requested Bank technical assistance and operational support to continue efforts to decentralize
ASSE management, allow transfers of affiliates among health insurance providers, and
improve the integration o f FNR with providers o f primary medical services. As outlined inthe
CAS, the Government and the Bank have already started to prepare a project (the proposed
National Health Insurance and Social Security Support Investment Loan) which could be
presented to the BoardduringFY06.




                                               11

IV.2. THE EDUCATIONSECTOR

44.     Sector Description. The administration of the public education system in Uruguay i s
led by an autonomous institution, ANEP, consisting of three quasi-independent councils (for
primary, secondary, and technical education). They are headed by a four-member Central
Directive Council (CODICEN) appointed by legislative vote, requiring a two-thirds majority.
The President of CODICEN and National Director of Public Education approves the
administrative and budgetary decisions made by each of the councils.

45.    When compared to the rest of Latin America, Uruguay's education system produces
good results. By 2003, 95 percent of children were enrolled in preschool at age five, and 90
percent remain in school to complete the full primary cycle of six grades. Enrollment in
secondary and tertiary education is also rising. Uruguayan students' performance in
mathematics, language, and science in the Program for International Student Assessment
(PISA) in 2003, though substantially lower than the OECD average, was higher than any
other Latin American country. Finally, results from national assessments of student
performance in language and mathematics indicate that the achievement gap between students
from low andhighincome households, though still existent, i s narrowing.

46.    Public expenditure on education in Uruguay amounts to only 3.6 percent of GDP
which i s lower than the Latin American average of 4.5 percent and even lower still when
compared with the average of 5.3 percent in high income countries. Expenditures per student
(at US$1,202 annually per primary student and US$889 annually per secondary student) are
also low in comparison to neighboring Argentina and Chile and other middle-income
countries. Overall, increased investment in education could yield better results in terms of
education quality and equity.

47.    Government Strategy and Challenges Ahead. The current administration i s aware that,
                                           -
as a prerequisite for sustainable and equitable economic growth, increased and better targeted
investments in education are needed. The Government strategy involves expanding coverage
of preschool and secondary education, two levels at which important inequities remain.
Furthermore, the Government i s interested in strengthening the quality o f the education
system and reducing inequality in educational outcomes. Finally, the Government i s
committed to increasing overall investment ineducation.

48.    Importantly, the administration acknowledges that increased education investment
needs to be accompanied by administrative reforms within ANEP. Although the previous
administration launched much needed programs to modernize the administration o f the
education system, these efforts need to be continued and strengthened.

49.    To improve access and equity of education inUruguay, the Government i s focusing on
(i)preschool coverage expansion, as school enrollment among 4-year olds and 5-year olds i s
75 percent and 95 percent, respectively, and children who do not attend preschool tend to
come from low-income households; (ii)       coverage and retention of students in secondary




                                               12

school, as the dropout rates reaches 50 per~ent;~and (iii)               expanding the full-time schools
model (FTS), which i s showing positive impacts on students from the poor and vulnerable
households.6

50.       The Government is also committed to improving education quality. To this end,
CODICEN has approved the continuation of the national assessment system of student
performance and its fourth application in 2005. Importantly, CODICEN has decided that
Uruguay will participate in OECD's Program for International Student Assessment in 2006
andinUNESCO's regional study of student performance inLatinAmerica. Uruguay has been
a leading country in the region in the use of information from student assessments to improve
teaching practices. The Government's resolution to continue and strengthen implementation
of national assessments of student performance and participation in regional and international
assessments i s a clear indication that it i s committed to improving educational quality.

51.       Finally, a key element of the Government's strategy i s to increase transparency and
public accountability in educational policy, by opening education policy dialogue to civil
society. The new administration has launched a process to actively engage teachers and civil
society in the education policy dialogue. Specifically, the administration i s fostering the
implementation of teacher assemblies (Asambleas de Docentes) to involve teacher
representatives in continuous dialogue related to the education sector. In addition, the new
administration has resolved to include teacher representation in the leading authorities o f
ANEP - the CODICEN and the Primary, Secondary, and Technical Education Councils.
Teachers' active involvement in education policy dialogue and decision making i s likely to
contribute to improved design, implementation and sustainability of educationreforms.

52.       Although efforts undertaken to strengthen information management within ANEP are
an important first step to improve educational administration in Uruguay, more i s needed in
this direction. The institutional design of the education system in Uruguay has some
advantages, as it ensures continuity in the leadership o f the public education system, but
ANEP has traditionally been seen as excessively politicized and internally fragmented, thus
unable to respond effectively to the needs of the education system. The new administration
has recognized the need for improving educational administration and i s directing efforts
toward improving the efficiency of ANEP.

53.       Bank Support. The Government has requested Bank support for actions to improve
efficiency, quality, and equity in education under the proposed SPDPL. In the CAS period,
the Government and the Bank also plan to implement an analytical activity focused on
education quality and equity, as well as a new investment operation focused on improving the
educational administration and continuing the implementation of the full-time school model.

IV.3. THE SOCIALPROTECTIONSECTOR


  Two parallel strategies have been adopted to improve coverage and reduce dropout rates in secondary
education: (i)reach the out-of-school population through better coordination with the new Social Emergency
program; and (ii)targeted school-level interventions in schools serving the poor to reduce drop out and improve
educational outcomes.
 With financing from the Basic Education 3 (MECAEP) project, Uruguay implemented the full-time schools
(FTS) model and bilingual education programs during the 1990s and early 2000s. The new administration is
committed to taking to a larger scale the FTS model, and there appears to be widespread support for it among
civil society.

                                                      13

54.      Sector Description. Total spending on social protection during the 1990s (including
both social insurance and social assistance expenditures) in Uruguay i s high compared to the
region and even OECD countries. Social security and assistance expenditures by the central
Government and public institutions rose from slightly over 10 percent of GDP in 1990 to
more than 15 percent in 2000. The public pension system managed by BPS (Banco de
Previsi6n Social) accounts for nearly two thirds o f total social expenditure. The high cost o f
public pensions has crowded-out public expenditures on other much needed social protection
programs, such as unemployment benefits and transfers in kind and in cash to the poor. As a
result, the coverage and effectiveness of these other programs has been uneven.

55.      While expenditures in the pension system have been high, the effectiveness o f the
system i s remarkable. More than 87 percent of the population aged 65 and more receive a
pension inUruguay, and if beneficiaries' spouses are included the rate increases to more than
95 percent. These high coverage rates are the result of decades of high formality in the labor
markets and a relatively accessible pension system.

56.      The 1996 social security reform aimed at introducing a funded component in the
pension system and adjusting some of the parameters in the public scheme. Although the
financial arrangements of the Uruguayan reform were less drastic than those of reforms in
other countries in the region, some of the new parameters (specifically, the requirement of 35
years of contributions to qualify for full retirement) were stricter. The number of retirees
under the main pension program (managed by BPS) declined from 525,000 inDecember 1997
to 504,000 six years later, a 4 percent decline at a time when the growth rate of the population
65 and older was 5 percent.

57.      Public expenditures on pensions have declined over the last few years, due in part to
the impact of the reforms and also to the loss of real value o f benefits (caused by the
indexation rule that adjusts benefits to wages). While some o f the latter may be compensated
inthe next few years, there is adeclining trendinoverall expenditures.

58.      Government Strategy and Challenges Ahead. Shortly after taking office in March
2005, the new Administration announced the creation of a new Social Emergency Program,
called PANES (Plan de Asistencia Nacional a la Emergencia Social). The objective o f the
plan i s to attend to the needs of individualsbelow or inhigh risk of falling below the extreme
poverty line - estimated to include some 200,000 individuals, or 6 percent of the population -
through a set of eight, coordinated programs (basic food, health emergency, minimumwage,
education for critical areas, workfare, two housing programs, and housing for the homeless).
Several o f these programs are not new, but in the past they have not been very effective in
reaching the poor. The emergency plan seeks to overcome past obstacles and reach the
neediest in society, using the structure of existing institutions (such as the BPS) and
volunteers. Enrollment in the program began on April 1, 2005, and nearly 100,000 heads o f
households applied in the first month (they will be individually interviewed and assessed to
identify targeted households). Payments of the minimum income scheme, for approximately
US$50 a month, are expected to start during May/June 2005. Involvement of sectoral
ministries and BPS (where individuals may apply for the program and cash payments will be
made) are important, as the implementing agency i s a new Ministry of Social Development,
which i s still being organized. IADB i s actively supporting the program design and
implementation through a sectoral loan.


                                                14

59.     The Government also acknowledged the need to review the design and operation of
the Social Security system, to ensure maintenance of high coverage rates and fiscal
sustainability over time. As social security is a politically charged issue, the Government has
developed a strategy to promote a transparent dialogue on the most critical problems of the
system. BPS i s also implementing a new transparency policy, disseminating and making
accessible information which was previously not available to the general public. In addition,
the Office of Planning and Budget of the Presidency (OPP) has created a sectoral commission,
with representatives of relevant ministries and agencies, to discuss possible reforms to the
design, operation and supervision of existing programs, as well as a revision o f the financial
situation of private funds.

60.     The new administration i s making a determined effort to reduce poverty incidence in
the short term and develop policies to sustain this reduction over time. The strategy consists
of developing an integrated approach to fight poverty and extreme poverty, providing income
support immediately, but also enhancing education, health and other social programs in order
to preserve and increase human capital and promote integration of the poor into the formal
labor market. Toward these goals, several existing programs will need to be integrated (or at
least highly coordinated) to avoid overlap and inconsistencies, and available resources will
need to focus on key priorities. The new Ministry of Social Development will be in charge of
managing this integration process, which will likely need to overcome operational difficulties.

61.     Bank Support. The Government has requested support for its early actions to improve
efficiency of the social protection system through improvements in targeting and
accountability. The proposed SPDPL would support both increased accountability of the
social insurance system as well as the implementation of monitoring and evaluation systems
for the new Social Emergency Program.

62.     Duringthe CAS period, the Government of Uruguay has requested the Bank's support
in defining a clear reform agenda for its social protection policies. The Bank's team is
actively engaged in discussions with the sectoral commission created by OPP, together with
other multilateral organizations, and a technical assistance operation (the National Health
Insurance and Social Security Support Investment Loan) is included in the CAS program as
part of the assistanceto the Government inthis area.

    V.        THE PROPOSEDSOCIALPROGRAMDEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN

V.l. OPERATIONDESCRIPTION

63.     The proposed SPDPL would be a stand-alone, single-tranche operation that would (i)
support the maintenance of macroeconomic stability; (ii)        recognize that Uruguay's social
policy response to the economic crisis went considerably beyond actions supported by the
Bank under the Second Special Structural Adjustment Loan; (iii)         support past and ongoing
structural and administrative reforms inthe education, health, and social protection sectors to
further improve both efficiency and equity in service delivery; and (iv) assist the early
activities of the new administration in various social policy areas, as a foundation for the
Bank's support for the medium-term Government policies. As such, the loan would also lay
the foundation for the Bank's future support for social reforms, which may include further
development policy lending. The proposed policy matrix would support specific actions inthe
health, education and social protection sectors which are part o f the Government strategy
discussed in the previous section. Expected results in the near- and medium-term would
include consolidation of fiscal improvements in the health sector, increased coverage of pre-
school children, improved efficiency of education administration and continued quality
assessments in the education sector, and expanded coverage and accountability of social
protectionprograms.

Macroeconomic Stability

64.     Bank staff have evaluated Uruguay's macroeconomic framework and have concluded
that it i s appropriate for underpinning implementation of the reform program supported by
this operation. The Government is committed to maintaining an appropriate macroeconomic
framework, as evidenced, for example, by the existence of an active IMFprogram.

Health Sector

65.     The Government i s undertaking important administrative reforms in the health sector,
introducing more transparent procedures that should result in higher efficiency, less inequities
and better incentives for participants. Actions supported b y the proposed SPDPL focus on
management and financing of ASSE and FNR, aiming at increasing their efficiency and
sustainability, and reducing hidden subsidies from the public sector to private insurers, hence
improving equity inthe system.

66.     Prior Actions for the SPDPL. The following three measures have been completed:

             Reforms to improve eficiency in the allocation of health care resources. Public
             hospitals' budgets are allocated usinga per capita and production criteria, allowing
             the introduction of more efficient principles to distribute funds. Inaddition, ASSE
             i s operating a budget administration system in its health facilities. These reforms
             translate into increased budgets for better-performing public hospitals, thus
             improving incentives for efficiency inhealth care service provision;

             Reforms to improve efficiency, quality and equity in health care administration. A
             database o f ASSE beneficiarieshas been developed; it i s operational andregularly
             maintained, allowing identification of duplication incoverage and better resources


                                                 16

            assignment criteria. Inaddition, a billing system for insured in-patients has been
            implemented inpublic hospitals, limiting the incidence of cross subsidies from
            ASSE to the private sector. Also, public hospitals are allowed to use recovered
            funds, generating incentives to increase billing andintroducing some
            decentralization principles. These reforms will enable ASSE to reduce
            fragmentation inthe public healthcare system, decrease hidden subsidies to the
            public sector while generating incentives for cost-recovery and thus improving
            equity and efficiency. Further, by empowering hospitals to use recovered funds to
            directly respond to patients' needs, the reforms should enhance quality;

    (c)     Financial equilibrium and improved management of the Fondo Nacional de
            Recursos (FNR). After years of large deficits, the administrative reforms
            introduced inFNRresulted infinancial equilibrium in 2003 and 2004. Financial
            stability inthe FNR i s a precondition for effective health care administration. In
            addition, administrative reforms to improve management and financial balance o f
            FNRhave been implemented, including estimation and use of unitarycosts and
            utilization rates for planning, fee determination and volume control, validation o f
            service authorizations against a beneficiaries' database, and regular preparation of
            financial projections. These reforms are expected to enhance the quality and
            efficiency of health care services inUruguay.

67.     Expected results of the SPDPL include the consolidation of reforms achieved in the
last few years, leading to a more efficient and financially sustainable public hospitals system.
Equity will be improved, as hospitals continue and expand the billing o f services to private
insurers, and the FNR continues its reform process to ensure sustainability and reduce debt.

68.     Medium-term actions. As the Government advances in its goal of developing an
integrated system, further actions to improve the regulation of the IAMCs, allowing transfers
of affiliates among them, and progressive decentralization of ASSE management, are
expected to be implemented in the near future. Although outside the realm of this proposed
loan, these actions are expected to increase the quality, efficiency, and equity in the health
care system, thus leading to improved health outcomes inthe medium and long term.

69.     Analytic work and capacitv building support. The Bank has provided analytical
                                                 -
support in this area, which has greatly informed the development of the proposed SPDPL,
including a major ESW report ("Towards Breaking the Impasse: Options for Health Reform
inUruguay") currently under revision and to be delivered inFY05, contributions to the Policy
Notes and the Public Expenditure Review prepared during FY05, and the result o f the
continuous dialogue with authorities and staff o f the relevant agencies during preparation o f
these reports, the new CAS, and this SPDPL.

V.2. EDUCATIONSECTOR

70.     While Uruguay has one of the strongest education systems in the region, much
remains to be done with regard to administrative efficiency, expansion of coverage to very
young children and overall quality. Support from the SPDPL focuses on actions that ensure
financing to critical programs, deepen reforms that provide the central administration with
more adequate tools to plan and adjust operations of the system, and advances in the
expansionof coverage as well as improvements in education quality andequity.

71.    Prior Actions for the SPDPL. The following five measures have been completed:

          Budgetary protection of priority educationprograms. Budgets for three critical
           programs (basic school supplies, bilingual education, and books and teaching
           materials) were protected since 2003, ensuring availability of resources for schools
           duringand after the economic crisis. These programs were essential for
           maintaining a basic level of education quality, especially in schools serving poor
           populations;

          Reform of information managementsystems to improve efficiency in educational
           administration. Four new information management systems at the central level
           were designed and implemented. The Central Directive Council (C0DICEN)'s file
           management system and a resolutionfiling system were created and implemented.
          Also, the Secretarias Escolares for primary schools and Secretarias Liceales for
           secondary schools were implemented, which will result in a more efficient
           management of resources and results monitoring. Finally, the National
          Administration of Public Education (ANEP)'s human resource database was
          incorporatedinto the central database of public servants of the Planning and
          Budgeting Office. These systems will enable ANEP and CODICEN to track
           student, teacher, and school characteristics and performance throughout the
           education system, thus fostering improvements inefficiency and quality;

           Creation of an Internal Audit Unit at ANEP to enhance efficiency and
           accountability of educational administration. An Internal Audit Unit at ANEP was
           created andi s operational, to ensure adequate control procedures at the system
           administration. Without an Internal Audit Unit, ANEP had no consistent or
           transparent processes and procedures for conflict resolution. The new Internal
           Audit Unitis expected to improve efficiency and accountability of educational
           administration;

           Continued expansion of preschool coverage to enhance equity of educational
           opportunity. School coverage of 4-year olds continued to expand during the crisis
           and the new Administration has developed a plan to reach universal coverage by
           2010, as investment efforts continued (albeit slower than planned) duringthe crisis
           and the new Government continues to consider this a priority;

           Continued assessment of studentperj5ormanceto raise education quality.
           CODICEN authorities formally committed to continue participation in students'
          performance assessment programs, specifically PISA 2006, UNESCO's regional
           assessment of students' performance and the National Assessment Program.
           Comprehensive and systematic measurements of student performance are an
           important step to improve education quality.

72.    Expected results of the SPDPL include (i) maintenance of adequate educational
                                                     the
expenditures, which both ensures a minimum level of quality and improves equity in
educational opportunity; (ii)the operationalization of information management systems
within ANEP, which will result in increased efficiency of educational administration; (iii)
increased control of education administration through the functioning o f the internal auditing

unit; (iv) expansion of preschool coverage among 4-year olds, which will improve equity of
educational opportunity and outcomes; and (v) education quality andequity improvements.

73.     Medium-term actions. Government efforts in the medium term will focus on
continuing expansion of school coverage of 4-year olds, and the launching of a process of
society-wide consultations (including parents, teacher associations and other civil society
actors) to prepare a new National Education Law. Although outside the scope of the proposed
SPDPL, these actions are expected to further improve education quality and equity, thus
contributing to improve educationaloutcomes inthe mediumandlongterm.

74.     Analytic work and capacitv buildingsupport provided by the Bank in this area, which
has greatly informed the development of the proposed SPDPL, include chapters in the Policy
Notes and the Public Expenditure Review prepared during FY05, and the result of the
continuous dialogue with authorities and staff of the relevant agencies during implementation
of the current investment operation (MECAEP 111) and preparation of these reports, the new
CAS. andthe SPDPL.

V.3. SOCIALPROTECTION SECTOR

75.      Social Protection in Uruguay i s strong, but unbalanced, with the pension system
crowding out other programs. The Government has recognized this issue and has initiated
efforts to reinforce other programs, a strategy that has been continued and deepened by the
new administration. The actions supported by SPDPL focus on expanding access to social
protection programs for poorer families,                 while ensuring overall sustainability and
accountability of the programs.

76.      Prior Actions for the SPDPL. The following three measures have been completed:




                                                       21

                                                                                                      I




            Expansion of coverage of children of unemployed individuals and informal
            workers in the Family Allowances system. A reform of the Family Allowances
            system to include children of unemployed individuals and informal workers, which
            started in2000, was expanded in 2004. As a result, more than 180,000 children of
            poor informal households are currently covered. This increased coverage of
            children from the poorest households has contributed to limit the impact of the
            economic crisis on the poor and i s likely to reduce poverty inthe medium term;

            Reforms to increase transparency in social protection administration. BPS
            adopted a new transparency policy, as its new Board issued resolutions to make all
            statistical and normative information public and promoted other communication
            channels with users, such as access to regional offices managers. Such increased
            transparency fosters accountability and i s expected to result in increased
            flexibility, efficiency, inclusion and fiscal sustainability of the social insurance
            system;

            Design of plan to assess impact of PANES and other social programs. The new
            Ministry of SocialDevelopment created the MonitoringandEvaluationDirection
            and began the design of the system to assess the impact of the new emergency
            program, PANES, as well as other social programs. A solid plan for monitoring
            and evaluation i s needed to ensure efficient targeting and positive impacts of social
            programs.

77.     Expectedresults of the SPDPLcan be identified inthree areas. First,the support of the
SPDPL i s expected to result in an expanded family allowances system, thus providing a
structural protection scheme to children of poorer households. Second, the launching of a
transparent and participatory policy dialogue process regarding the social insurance system i s
expected to lead to a reform proposal that increases accessibility and ensures fiscal
sustainability for the pension system. Finally, the SPDPL i s expected to result in the creation
and implementation of a monitoring and evaluation system in the new Ministry of Social
Development that would cover the new PANES plan and other social programs, thus allowing
for better planning and control.

78.     Medium-term actions. Government efforts in the following months will focus on
continuing implementation of PANES and adjusting its operation as the monitoring results
provide feedback, as well as reviewing all social insurance programs in order to address
problems in design and operation. Although outside the scope of the proposed SPDPL, these
actions are expected to contribute to improve social safety nets in the medium and long term,
especially for the most vulnerable populations.

79.     Analytic work and capacity building support provided by the Bank in this area, from
which this Program Document draws heavily, include a Poverty Assessment (2001) and a
Poverty Update (2003). In addition, a program to build a poverty monitoring system for
Argentina, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay i s being implemented in collaboration with the
National University o f L a Plata in Argentina, and several working papers, including a Poverty
Profile analysis of Uruguay, have been prepared. Also, chapters in the Policy Notes and the
Public Expenditure Review on Social Protection were preparedduringFY05, and the result of
the continuous dialogue with authorities and staff of the relevant agencies during the



                                                 22

preparation o f these reports, the new CAS, and this loan have been critical to identify the
actions includedin the SPDPL.

80.      A policy matrix is includedinAnnex 2. The matrix includes a column onthe medium-
term goals of Government, which are consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy that i s
being presented to the Board together with this proposedDevelopment Policy Loan.

V.4. LINKTO CASAND OTHER BANKOPERATIONS

81.      The SPDPL i s firmly embedded in the Country Assistance Strategy that i s being
presented together with the proposed operation to the Board of Executive Directors for
consideration. As part of the Bank's assistance for improving living standards in Uruguay,
the third pillar of the proposed CAS, the SPDPL constitutes a key element o f support for the
new administration's ambitious social policy. Several actions supported in the SPDPL are
preparatory for policies andprograms to be supported by other operations inthe future.

82.      The World Bank has been active in the social sectors in Uruguay in recent years
through the SAL-1 and SSAL-2 operations approved in 2002 and 2003 and also through
investment operations in Education (Basic Education Quality Improvement I,11, and 111).

                                                     23

Analytical work has been extensive, including in recent years a Poverty Assessment and a
Poverty Update, the ongoing work to build a poverty monitoring system for Argentina, Chile,
Paraguay and Uruguay (which have produced several working papers), the preparation of
Policy Notes in all social sectors for the new Government, and the preparation of chapters for
a PER currently inpreparation.

83.    The CAS identifies and briefly discusses the main issues affecting the three sectors
covered inthis operation, setting the stage for future operations. The program for the next five
years includes the preparation of an ESW report on Equity and Quality of Education, as well
as a programmatic Development Policy Review of the Social Sectors, which will cover
several sectors in a multiyear study. Also, a proposed National Health Insurance and Social
Security Support Investment Loan i s planned for FY06, a proposed Innovation TA loan
(which would include components on education) i s planned for FY07, and a proposed
Education Investment Loan i s planned for FY08. Finally, the future programmatic DPLs
plannedduringthe CAS period are expected to support further social sector reforms.

V.5. PROGRAMIMPACT INDICATORS

84.    The SPDPL i s part of the Bank's broader support program to Uruguay that i s detailed
inthe CAS. As such, the relevant indicators of the impact of the program inthe medium term
are those laid out in the CAS. The Operations Policy Matrix in Annex 2, also presents some
medium term goals and indicators for the SPDPL, which should be evaluated at the end of the
CAS period. These include (i)steep reduction inpoverty levels inthe aftermath of the crisis;
                               a
(ii)
   improved equity and efficiency of social sector expenditures; and (iii) improved indicators
inhealth, education, and social protection.

85.    In addition, several short-term output indicators that may be measured shortly after
SPDPL closing have been identified. Table 6 lists these output indicators as well as the
medium-term impact indicators of the SPDPL, which would be evaluated at the end of the
CAS period.

86.     The Bank will continue monitoring the evolution of the main social indicators in
Uruguay after presenting the proposed operation to the Board.

V.6. COLLABORATIONWITH THE IMFAND OTHER INTERNATIONAL
PARTNERS

87.     During the preparation and implementation of the SPDPL the team worked in close
coordination with international partners. The IMF i s expected to approve a new program for
Uruguay inJune 2005. The macroeconomic analysis presented inthis ProgramDocument and
the assessment of the macroeconomic framework were preparedby World Bank staff in close
consultation with IMFcounterparts.


                                                  25

88.    IADB has an important role in Uruguay, supporting different social policies and
programs. In particular, a sectoral loan for the implementation of the new social emergency
plan PANES is being prepared, which would support the creation of the Ministry of Social
Welfare, and the implementation of PANES. The team has been in close contact with its
counterparts at IADBto ensure consistency inrecommendations.

89.    Also, Bank staff coordinate and collaborate, where possible, on social issues with
various UNagencies. For example, ILO i s providing advice to the new Government on social
security issues, while UNDP has been active in the Social Emergency Programs. In both
cases, Bank and UNteams have maintainedclose contact.




                                              26

                           VI.    OPERATIONIMPLEMENTATION

90.     In line with OP 8.60, the Program Document considers in this section the lessons
learned from previous operations, the program's impact on poverty and social conditions, its
impact on the environment, the role of civil society in the design and implementation of the
policies proposedhere, and the fiduciary aspects.

VI.1. LESSONSLEARNED

91.     One of the lessons learned from previous operations i s the importance to have a
medium-term framework to guide lending operations such as the SPDPL. A medium-term
framework i s necessary in deciding on the prior actions that will be supported, as well as in
determining the expected program outcomes in the medium and long term. Hence, the prior
actions supported by the SPDPL are part of a broader set of ongoing structural and
administrative reforms in the social sectors that are expected to contribute to raise quality,
efficiency and equity inthe provision of social services.

92.     A second lesson learned from previous operations in Uruguay is the importance of
recognizing the political cycles and timetables of the Government. Consequently, in selecting
the prior actions for this SPDPL, the Bank and the Uruguayan authorities have worked closely
to identify actions that can be completed prior to loan approval and contribute to the social
sector goals of the new administration at the beginning of its mandate.

VI.2. POVERTYAND SOCIALIMPACTS

93.     The SPDPL would support improvements in health, education and social protection
that have taken place over recent years, as well as actions taken by the new administration to
further mitigate the impact of the economic crisis on social indicators. The actions supported
by the program are expected to further alleviate the impact of the economic crisis on the
vulnerable groups in Uruguayan society. The SPDPL i s expected to have medium- and long-
term positive effects on both efficiency and equity of social expenditures and investments.
The expected outcome indicators in the medium-term are included in the operation policy
matrix presented in Annex 2, and a more detailed table describing expected impact of each
supported action i s included inAnnex 3.

94.     In health, the actions supported by the program in the medium term are expected to
result in implementation of a national health insurance system, in a reduction of the fiscal
transfers to BPS to better align with the medium term macroeconomic framework, and in
significant increases in the share of health sector expenditures directed to primary and
preventive care services.

95.     In education, the actions supported by SPDPL are expected to result inmedium-term
improvements in primary and secondary coverage and efficiency, universal enrollment of 4-
year olds inpreschool, and in an improved education quality inbasic and secondary school.

96.     In social protection, the actions supported by the SPDPL are expected to result in the
medium term in an expansion of informal workers' access to social insurance programs, in a
more flexible, inclusive and fiscally sustainable social insurance system, and in an efficient
targeting of the emergency program.

                                               27

97.      Several of the supported actions aim at reducing inequities in access to social services,
including for the indigenous and afro-Uruguayan population. It can be expected that these
groups, among the most vulnerable inUruguay, would specifically benefit from the supported
reforms.

VI.3. ENVIRONMENT,FOREST,AND NATURALRESOURCES

98.      The proposedloan will not support specific measures that are likely to have significant
effects on the environment. Actions included in the policy matrix aimed (and are aiming) to
increase quality and access to basic social services by the poor b y improving fiscal and
financial conditions and strengthening the institutions involved in service delivery. As such,
the loan i s not expected to have any significant impact on the environmental situation in
Uruguay.

99.      The Policy Matrix includes actions affecting the health delivery system, which could
have an indirect impact on the environment with regard to practices on health care waste
management. The team and sector specialists judge that the supported actions should not have
significant effects on the environment, as no specific actions regarding micro or macro
management o f health care waste are supported by the proposed loan.

VI.4. PARTICIPATION

100.    The SPDPL program was presented to civil society for discussion together with the
CAS consultations in April 2005. There was broad participation in the meetings, and
responses to Bank proposals were generally positive. Among the main messages received
during this process, civil society representatives indicated the need for broader reforms in the
education sector. Inparticular, civil society representatives mentioned the need to go beyond
punctual interventions and simple pilot projects, and to elicit the active involvement of
teachers inthe design o f future reforms. Also, there was significant concern with regard to the
impact of the crisis on Uruguayan society, as civil society representatives placed special
emphasis on the costs of the crisis in terms of employment, particularly vis-&vis women, the
youth and other vulnerable groups. A more detailed description o f the consultation process i s
included inthe accompanying CAS document.

101.    The new social sector authorities have begun preparing the conditions to ensure
participation. The Ministry of Education, together with the National Administration o f Public
Education and other education stakeholders, i s launching a society wide consultation process
to prepare a new National Law o f Education. Similarly, the transparency actions by BPS
(publishingdata and regulations; granting access to all records to representatives of workers,
retirees and employers; and disseminating information at the local level) will improve
conditions for civil society participation in social policy decisions.

102.    One of the central actions in promoting participation in public affairs i s the
institutional organization of the emergency plan PANES. Besides the formal structure o f the
Ministry of Social Development, authorities are inviting scores o f volunteers to collaborate in
the implementation efforts, usinginstitutions such as the University and local organizations as
the coordination channels. Also, the M D S i s planning to create local, regional, and national
councils with representatives of civil society and beneficiaries to oversee the implementation


                                                28

plan. In addition, the Monitoring and Evaluation system that the SPDPL would support will
include feedback from beneficiaries as a critical input to assess the programs effectiveness.

VIS. PUBLICFINANCIALMANAGEMENT

103.    The World Bank and the IADB finalized a Country Financial Accountability
Assessment (CFAA) for Uruguay. The analysis found that public financial management
(PFM) in Uruguay has several important strengths, but it also identified some areas where
further improvement would be needed and made specific recommendations in that direction.
The overall conclusion i s that Uruguay's PFM fiduciary risk i s considered low due to the
existing accountability policies and practices. Public financial management i s considered
transparent but also to some extent, bureaucratic. In the design o f the proposed operation, the
team took into account the CFAA finding that PFM fiduciary risk i s low and that no
additional conditionality needs to be introduced with respect to budgetary management.

VI.6. DISBURSEMENTSAND AUDITS

104.     This is the first DPL for Uruguay andthe following arrangements were agreed upon:
(a) all withdrawals from the Loan Account would be deposited by the Bank into an account
which the Treasury (Tesoreria General de la Naci6n) maintains in the Central Bank o f
Uruguay; (b) upon the Banks request, the Borrower would have the deposit account audited
in accordance with appropriate auditing principles consistently applied, by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank; and (c) the Borrower would ensure that upon each deposit of
an amount of the Loan into said account, such amount or an equivalent amount i s credited in
the Borrower's Treasury system to finance budgeted expenditures. The untiedbudget support
will be disbursed against satisfactory implementation o f the development policy program and
not tied to any specific purchases. Hence, no procurement requirements will be needed.

105.    To support supervision of the operation, the Borrower will generate appropriate
reports to demonstrate that the DPL proceeds were included in the budgeted sources o f
funding, and that uses of these funds, along with all other sources, were duly recorded and
reported inthe budget execution report.

VI.7. RISKSAND MITIGATINGMEASURES

106.    Because the SPDPL i s a single-tranche policy support operation, the team considers
the overall risks associated with the loan as low to moderate. Risks of non-compliance with
the expected actions are minimal as they have been complied with before consideration by the
Board o f Executive Directors. However, there are significant sustainability risks, as some o f
the supported actions constitute the startingpoint o f reforms that will need to be continued to
achieve the desired impact. These risks can be classified as political, economic, and
managerial.

107. Political Risks: The reforms supported by the SPDPL include processes that were
started by the previous Government and processes that are being initiated by the new
Government. While in all cases the new authorities have explicitly indicated their interest to
continue the ongoing reforms (as indicated in the Letter of Development Policy, attached as



                                               29

Annex 1 of this document), the political transition and associated staff changes in
implementing ministries could result inweaker ownership than i s desirable.

108.     Mitigating measures for this risk include the continued dialogue of the Bank's team
with the Government through the supervision of the investment loan in education, the
preparation of a new operation in health and social security, and the preparation of several
AAA activities (including a DevelopmentPolicy Review of the Social Sectors).

109.     Economic and Financial Risks: As the new authorities designed the reforms, the
reform process enjoys a high degree of ownership. Nevertheless, there are economic and
financial risks to this operation. First, fiscal restrictions due to resource availability might
create problems in the implementation and continuation of proposed reforms. This issue i s of
particular importance in education where the expansion of early childhood coverage will
require additional investment by the public sector. Fundsfor these expenditures would have to
be included in the budget for the following years. Unexpected events could trigger fiscal
tightening and, hence, a reduction in those expenditures. Second, financial risks also exist due
to the high levels of debt, as currently public debt i s equal to some 92 percent of GDP.
Finally, external shocks also constitute a risk: an unexpected economic downturn in one of the
neighboring countries could cause again negative spillovers for the Uruguayan economy.

110.     Mitigating measures for this potential problem reside in the maintenance of a
consistent macroeconomic and fiscal framework.

111. Managerial Risks:The implementation and consolidation of the proposed reforms will
require strong managerial abilities. Components of the reform process could fail if
administrative capacity i s inadequate. Similarly, a substantial risk involves activities under the
Ministry of Social Development, as this new institution i s being organized and its ability to
efficiently deliver social programs remains untested.

112.     Mitigating measures for managerial risks in the education and health sectors include
strong central authorities' support for local capacity building on the use and management o f
new tools. In addition, the Ministry of Social Development is receiving support from
institutions with good track records, such as BPS, to manage the enrollment process o f
beneficiaries and develop information systems. Also, an IADB sectoral operation will provide
strong institutional support for the MDS.

James D.Wolfensohn
President
The World Bank

Dear Mr.Wolfensohn:

    The Government of the Oriental Republic of Uruguay seeks to improve the living
conditions of its population with equity, through a development strategy based on three basic
pillars:

a) An economic program that ensures macroeconomic stability and i s oriented to improving
    the investment climate in order to achieve increased production, investment and
    employment;

b) A Social Emergency Plan to alleviate the economic and social conditions of the most
    vulnerable sectors of society and, in particular, of those who were most severely affected
    by the 2002 crisis;

c) A set of structural reforms aimed at improving the foundations for medium- and long-term
    economic growth and to reduce its volatility and vulnerability.

These pillars will be developed through a democratic and participative administration, with
transparent and efficient government actions that foster mechanisms for citizen participation
and social control of government actions and public policy decision-making.

STRATEGY COMPONENTS

a) The Government of Uruguay has as its main objective to maintain macroeconomic
    stability in order to offer an adequate investment climate that may enable the development
    of policies to foster growth and reduce poverty. Accomplishing this main objective
    implies meeting the intermediate objective of increased investment. Growth targets are
    expressed in terms of the economy's long-term growth rate. During the past 45 years, this
    rate has been below 2 percent, and the Government i s proposing to reach a 3 percent long-
    term economic growth rate.        To achieve this target, the Government i s planning to
    increase to 20 percent the Investment-to-GDP ratio, presently at 13 percent.
    Macroeconomic stability will have two real anchors and a monetary anchor. The real
    anchors comprise an increase in economic global productivity and fiscal discipline. The
    monetary anchor involves a sound monetary policy. The increase in economic global
    productivity i s a function of investment and competitiveness promotion and to
    forthcoming structural reforms, including a financial system reform. The reform of the
    financial system i s aimed at reestablishing basic intermediation functions (which were
    suspended after the 2002 crisis) and to expand the available range o f financial
    instruments. Fiscal sustainability will be achieved through the reduction of the Debt-to-

                                                39

    GDP ratio, through structural reforms proposed in the development strategy, and through
    the increased productivity andefficiency of public enterprises. (The latter also contributes
    to the real anchor in as much as public enterprises in Uruguay produce several goods and
    services of multiple uses in the economy.) Monetary policy will also rely on institutional
    policies that will promote the credibility of the monetary authority (Central Bank of
    Uruguay) in its objective of ensuring low inflation.

    While introducing policies to ensure macroeconomic stability, the Government of
    Uruguay has also set the priority of addressing the social emergency through a transitional
    Plan. The target population of the Plan includes all residents of the national territory who
    are in a situation of poverty, as defined by not being able to satisfactorily cover daily
    nutritional needs. Specifically, the Plan i s targeted to children, teenagers, unemployed
    heads of households, pregnant women, elderly adults and handicapped individuals, who
    experience hardship or extreme poverty.


    The focus of the structural reforms to be carried out by the Government of Uruguay
    duringthis administrationincludes:
    Strengthening of public finances.
    Reform of Uruguay's Central Bank and of the public banking system, and reform of
    public enterprises.
    Improvement of the investment and business climate.
    Strengthening of social and human capital.

The strengthening of public finances will be carried out through (i)         tax reform (ii)  tax
administration reform; (iii)reform of several social security subsectors; and (iv) the
modernization of the budgetary process. The reform o f the Financial Sector i s centered on (a)
sending to Parliament a modification of the charter agreement of the Central Bank of Uruguay
designed to strengthen the Central Bank's credibility and autonomy with respect to monetary
policy; (b) a modernization of financial entities' supervisory powers that takes into account
modern international standards, by sending to Parliament a law proposal that seeks to
institutionally separate supervisory functions from the Central Bank of Uruguay; (c) to send to
Parliament a legal framework project to manage insolvent financial institutions in a less
traumatic way than within the current framework of procedures for the liquidation of financial
institutions; (d) implementation of a recently created deposit insurance system to be carried
out by a new independent agency from the Central Bank; (e) adoption of measures to address
the economy's dependency on the dollar (such as applying differential rates and bank reserves
requirements); (f) institutional strengthening of the Bank of the Republic through actions such
as the incorporation of professional staff into the direction and the redesign of credit processes
(g) strengthening of the Banco Hipotecario del Uruguay; and (h) the search of a buyer for the
Nuevo Banco Comercial.

The improvement in the investment climate and the promotion of competitiveness will be
accomplished through i)an increase in investment opportunities for the private sector in
public services and infrastructure; ii)the promotion o f the domestic capital market; iii)the
protection of property rights; iv) the proposal to Parliament of a project for restructuring
bankruptcy legislation; and v) the promotion o f competitiveness policies, including: the
design and implementation of a National System of Innovation, policies on conglomerates,


                                                40

policies to promote commerce, as well as policies for investment promotion and quality, such
as the development of a single window for investors.

The strengthening of social and human capital will be developed through: i)the
implementation of Salary Councils for collective bargaining with the participation of
representatives from the business, labor and government sectors; ii)the design of a National
Health System and a national health insurance as financing support mechanisms; iii)the
strengthening of public education; and iv) the improvement of low-income populations'
access to housing.

DETAILS ONSOME COMPONENTSOF SOCIALPOLICY

a) Health Sector

The Government program gives priority to strengthening both the private and public health
services, through the creation of an Integrated Health System to be financed by the National
Health Insurance.

The proposal contemplates three main changes:


0   Prioritizing the prevention and promotion of primary health care services (Primary Health
    Care Strategy).
0   In the system of expenditures and financing, ensuring universal coverage, equity and
    solidarity (National Health Service).
0   Inthe management model, through the coordinationof services at all levels.

Inits first year in office the Government will give priority to the strengthening of the public
system as a step in the process of integration into a National Health Insurance. A variety of
strategies inthis direction are planned in ASSE, the private sector, and the National Resources
Fund.

To foster incentive mechanisms for health services provided b y the Ministry of Public Health
and for obtaining resources related to specific services provided, on February 13th, 2003, a
regulation was passed allowing MPH agencies to use, without execution limits, the total
amounts collected.

This possibility results ina useful mechanismto improve the administrative billing of services
and also constitutes an incentive for the heads of units to access new sources of resources
through cost-recovery. This incentive not only results from the cost recovery o f services being
requested, but also opens the possibility of "sale" agreements or the supply o f complementary
services.

Inorder to develop the consolidationprocess of the system andthe NationalHealthInsurance,
a user satisfaction survey will be carried out for public and private services to better
understand the views o f users regarding the level and quality o f attention provided by
different service providers.




                                               41

Another useful mechanism to achieve the reform objectives of the MSP involves the
decentralization of the State HealthServices Administration, ASSE.

With respect to the National Resource Fund (J?NR), there are two objectives: quality
improvement and financial balance of the system. An evaluation of the sanitary significance
and economic impact of the FNR will be carried out with an emphasis on the FNR's effect on
equity of access to health services.

For this reason, the FNR considers it a priority to generate adequate mechanisms for the
review and update of the list of services covered and the content of services provided for each
health risk and the effect it would have on different population groups if modified. The FNR
also is trying to better align available resources, contributions o f the population relative to
their socioeconomic characteristics, and service prices.

During the first year of the administration, a viability study will be carried out in order to
define subsequent actions for the creation of the Integrated Health System as well as its
financing strategy, the National Health Insurance system.

b) Education

The Government's strategy on education i s based on a new legal framework to define a
national education system which articulates and coordinates the different education levels
(pre-school, primary, secondary school, tertiary education) with active civil society
participation from institutional, individual and collective actors. This entails establishing
strategies for the social and political dialogue to take into account a variety of factors in order
to develop an authentic education policy.

The government i s committed to undertake any efforts necessary to increase significantly the
resources allocated to education (only slightly above 3 percent of GDPduring the last 20
years).

Inaddition, the government will implement measuresto improve democratic access to and
retention inthe education system. Inthe medium term, the proposed actions include:

e   To move towards universal initial education (focusing on less advantaged populations) ;
e   To extend full time schools inthe long term, aiming at establishing this system as a
    framework for primary education;
    To reform the administration of ANEP;
    To improve student permanence inthe system;
    To achieve universal access and graduation from the first cycle o f secondary education;
    To extend and strengthen primary and secondary school social protectionnetworks (food,
    transportation, health);
e   To foster professional technical and technological education incoordination with the
   national productive development strategy;
e  To improve teaching quality.

Based on these actions, the Government will be able to address the following medium term
objectives:

                                                42

0    Reach an 80 percent graduation rate from the upper secondary cycle, with the purpose of
     achieving a minimumof 15 years o f formal compulsory schooling (including three years
     of pre-school education);
0   Ensurethat at least 50percent secondary-school graduateshave access to tertiary
     education (university, polytechnic and technological institutes, etc).

To complement the goals of increased access, retention and completion inthe education
system, strategies to guarantee educational quality will also be fostered. The objective i s to
achieve a substantial improvement ineducational outcomes, especially among the least
advantaged populations.

Adequate schooling not only requires that students be ready to learn but also that teachers be
qualified to teach. For this purpose, policies will be introduced to give new significance to
the teacher career in terms of training, professional development, career expectations and
remuneration.

Finally, democratic processes ineducation management will be fostered, thereby
strengthening and improving autonomy and co-management intertiary institutions, and
technical autonomy inthe education system as a whole.

c) Social Protection

As mentioned above, a fundamental pillar of Uruguay's development strategy for the 2005-
2010 period i s the Social Emergency Plan (PANES). The Social Emergency Plan i s to be
carried out by the new Ministry of Social Development, created by law in March of 2005.
Enrollment commenced on April 1 and by April 30 almost 100,000 applications had been
filled out. The first stage of the plan (citizen income) will begin in mid-May with a target
population of 40,000 beneficiaries. Plan components are: (i)    food support for individuals with
nutritional deficits; (ii)
                         conditional income transfers, involving cash transfers in exchange for
meeting work requirements; (iii)   sanitary emergency, focused on prevention and attention at
the first health level in the network of municipal and community hospitals of the MSP; (iv)
temporary community work for unemployed individuals as well as workshop and training
opportunities to facilitate the process o f social inclusion; (v) attention to the homeless; (vi)
educational support in critical areas; and (vii) improvement of slums, tenement homes, hotels
and shacks. The Emergency Plan will have an estimated annual budget of US$200 million for
two years.

The traditional social security network has proved to be insufficient to satisfy the needs of the
population. Social emergency i s the Government's priority and, therefore, the Ministry of
Social Development was created and charged with the implementation of the PANES. The
Ministry of Social Development has in turn created the Direction of Program Evaluation in
order to follow up indetail the implementation and impact of the Emergency Plan.

Additional actions to reinforce the social security system may be also implemented, including:
 0  The extension of coverage of the system o f family allowances, thus deepening actions
     which started in 2000 (and reinforced in 2004) by increasing the number of beneficiaries
     inlow-income households.


                                                43

0  The creation under the Office of Planning and Budget of a Sectoral Social Security
    Commission to carry out a review of the present system in order to identify risks and
    opportunities of improvement in areas such as coverage, costs, efficiency and
    transparency, within the framework of social sustainability. In particular, the new
    authorities o f the Social Security Fund have implemented measures to give transparency
    to the institution's actions. At the same time, the Government i s introducing reforms to
    guarantee fiscal sustainability, including reforms of the public service, police, military
    and bank-staff pension funds. These reforms are necessary so that contributions and
    benefits are in line with the government's transfer restrictions. The reform of the police
    pension fund i s well advanced and will be implemented before the end of 2005. The
    process of reform will be accelerated immediately after this.
0  The implementation of coordination mechanisms between the Social Security Fund, the
    General Tax Direction (Direcci6n General Impositiva) and the Ministry of Labor and
    Social Security in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the tax collection
    system and the inclusion into the system of informal workers through specific
    mechanisms.

 ANNEX 3. POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS OF THE REFORMSSUPPORTED
                                              BY THE SPDPL


  Reforms Supported by the SPDPL                             Poverty and Social Impact


                                          HEALTH     SECTOR

                                     Positive impact expected. The specific actions supported under this
health care resources                reform(public hospital budgets being allocatedusing a per capita and
                                     production criteria as well as ASSE operating a budget administration)
                                     aim to increasethe efficiency and also equity o f available resources
                                     becauseresources would much closer match need. A positive impact
                                     on health service delivery for the poor is expected.
                                     Positive impact expected. The main action being supported concerns
and equity in health care            public hospitals, when treating privately insured patients, to effectively
administration                       bill (and collect the fees due from) private insurance companies. The
                                     reform also supports that public hospitals can hold on to these
                                     repayments from private insurers rather than passing them on to the
                                     general budget. Hence, the measure ensures that the additional funds
                                     actually are available for public health provision. With public health
                                     expenditures having a progressive distribution, the additional resources
                                     would flow disproportionably to poorer health service users of the
                                     public system.
Financial equilibrium and improved   No negative impact expected. The reform supports administrative
management of the Fondo Nacional de  reforms only, including the use o f unitary costs and utilization rates for
Recursos (FNR)                       planning, fee determination and volume control, validation of service
                                     authorizations against a beneficiaries' database, and regular
                                     preparation of financial projections. The promoted reforms introduce
                                     the evolution of actual unitary costs as price adjustments being paid to
                                     health care provider which would foster efficiency in the system as
                                     well as financial equilibrium of the system which i s critical to assure
                                     equitable and sustainable access by all the entire Uruguayan population
                                     to high complexity heath care services.

                                       EDUCATION        SECTOR

Budgetary protection of priority     Positive impact. The SPDPL recognizes the actions carried out by
education programs                   Government inprotection budgets for three critical programs (Basic
                                     School Supplies, Bilingual Education, and Books and Teaching
                                     materials), since 2003, ensuring availability of resources for schools
                                     during and after the economic crisis. These programs were essential fo1
                                     maintaining a basic level of education quality, especially inschools
                                     serving poor populations. Average test scores in the 1996-2002 period
                                     inthese schools rose at afaster rate than in schools serving advantaged
                                     populations.
Information management systems to    Positive impact expected. The SPDPL recognized the implementation
improve efficiency in educational    of a number of new management systems that will enable ANEP and
administration                       CODICEN to track student, teacher, and school characteristics and
                                     performance throughout the education system, thus fostering
                                     improvements in efficiency and quality for the entire education system.
                                     including for poorer students.
Internal control systems to enhance  No negative impact expected. The reform supports the establishment of
efficiency and accountability of     an internal audit system within the national education administration
educational administration           ANEP. This would increase the efficiency and accountability of the
                                     educational administration.

Preschool expansion to enhance equity  Positive impact expected. The SPDPL supports the Government's past
of educational opportunity             actions (during the crisis) and new plans to expand coverage of full-
                                       time schools for 4-year olds. Incidence analysis shows that the full-
                                       time schools benefit poorer households disproportionately and, at the
                                       same time, increase their school performance. For example, the
                                       performance in national assessmentexaminations of students in full-
                                       time schools is very similar to the national average, although these
                                       schools primarily serve disadvantaged populations.
Measuring student learning to raise    No negative impact expected. The SPDPL supports the Government's
education quality                      participation in a number of international student tests, which would
                                       help assess whether wider education investments and reforms (going
                                       beyond the scope of the supported program) would indeed lead to
                                       improvements in significant outcome. No negative social or poverty
                                       impact expected.



Coverage of unemployed individuals     Positive impact. This reform, introduced during the crisis in 2000 and
and informal workers in the main       further expanded in 2004, has a positive impact as it expanded child
social safety net program              benefit payments to children of the unemployed (poverty rate of 48
                                       percent in 2003) and informal sector workers (poverty rate of 55
                                       percent in 2003) which were both at a significantly higher risk of
                                       poverty than the formal sector employees (21.8 percent in 2003).
Reforms to Increase transparency in    No negative impact expected. The reform supports a new transparency
social protection administration.      policy that would make all statistical and normative information
                                       public. The reform also promotes the accessible communication of this
                                       data. Increased transparency and accountability are expected to result
                                       inincreased flexibility, efficiency, inclusion and fiscal sustainability of
                                       the social insurance system.
Reforms to improve impact of social  IIExpected positive impact. The continuous monitoring and evaluation
programs                               ofthe emergency social program PANES would allow for the program
                                       to be adapted if targeting, coverage or impact of the various programs
                                       should arise. Hence, it is expected that the monitoring and evaluation
                                       activities allow for higher positive poverty impact than without such
                                       activities.

    ANNEX 4. BACKGROUNDONSOCIALAND POVERTY CONDITIONS AND
                                                  INDICATORS
In this annex, we present key social indicators for Uruguay in the 1999-2004 period and
discuss the effects of the crisis and the Government's response on the health, education, and
social protection sectors.
In2002, GDP fell by almost 11percent and unemployment rose to its highest level in twenty
years - some 17 percent of the active labor force on average for the year. As a result, real
incomes in 2003 were 23 percent lower than in 2001 (see Table A4.1). At the same time, the
official poverty rate increased from about 15 percent in 1999, to around 31 percent in 2004.
The percentage of the population living under US$2 per day (purchasing power parity) also
doubled, from 2.7 to 5.3 in between 1999 and 2003. The economic crisis appears to have
affected all socioeconomic groups fairly evenly, and thus, although income inequality still
exists in Uruguay (with the top decile earning near 20 percent of the income), inequality
indicators have not increased in the aftermath of the crisis. However, the recession and the
2002 crisis resulted in an increase in unemployment, while the proportion of self-employed
and informal-sector workers within the labor force also appears to have increased.

Although the crisis had a severe impact on poverty and unemployment, its impact on
education, health, and social protection coverage was limited. The Government of Uruguay

recognized early on the magnitude of the effect the crisis had on poverty and unemployment
and its potential detrimental impacts on social indicators. Indeed, the Government inUruguay
took a proactive attitude to protect the population and the most critical services, mitigating the
social impact o f the crisis and setting the stage for a more rapid recovery. The main focus o f
the Government during the crisis was on (i)         restoring and maintaining macro-economic
stability; (ii)
              achieving a swift and comprehensive renegotiation of the country's outstanding
debt; (iii)protecting some critical social sector budgets; (iv) increasing coverage and depth o f
social assistance with respect to inclusion of informal sector workers and expansion of food
programs; and (v) improving the efficiency of public health services provision. Also, a
number of critical administrative reforms inthe social sectors continued duringthis period.

        HEALTH

The 2002 economic crisis reduced health resource availability and led to an increased demand
simultaneously. After suffering budgetary reductions for two consecutive years, ASSE (the
agency responsible for managing all public health facilities) began experiencing shortages in
basic supplies and payment delays to providers mounted to unsustainable levels. In addition,
demand for public health services increased as individuals fell out of formal employment and
thus private healthinsurance schemes. By 2003, The MSP's budget had fallen near 20 percent
(inrealterms) from the 2000 budget (Table A4.2), while public hospitalsincreased their share
inproduction (Figure A4.1).

The Government responded to the funding limitations and increasing demand by promoting
higher efficiency in its institutions, reducing average costs and generating alternative funding
sources. Public hospitals' share of total health care provision increased sharply. Ambulatory
care services provided by these institutions grew 23 percent between 2000 and 2003, while
the production volume for the same services among IAMCs declined by 10 percent. As a
result, public sector participation in health care provision rose from 39 percent to 47 percent
in only three years. Similarly, outpatient services in public hospitals increased from 48
percent of the total in 2000 to 53 percent in 2003.

These reforms allowed the public system to compensate for the decline in coverage of formal
sector insurance schemes, and overall Uruguay maintained a high level of coverage even
through the crisis period. This i s an impressive accomplishment. As Figure A4.2 shows, from
1995 through 2003 the proportion of Uruguayans with health insurance or a regular source of
care, which had increased from 93.5 percent in 1995 to 97 percent in 2001, remained stable
duringthe crisis at approximately 97 percent.

In spite of the impressive efforts to maintain health care coverage, the crisis had a negative
impact on some health indicators in Uruguay. Infant mortality rate showed a slight increase in
2003, and malnutrition indicators appear to have worsened in 2001-2002 with respect to the
1990s averages (Table A4.3). Furthermore, there are signs of growing inequality in terms of
the coverage and quality of health care: vaccination rates, for instance, have declined in some
of the more marginalized areas o f the country inrecent years.

VI.8. EDUCATION

Although public education expenditures as a share of GDP remained stable at around 3.2
percent (see Table A4.5) during the 2001-2003 period, the economic crisis translated into a
reduction in absolute total education expenditures. Table A4.5 shows that education
expenditures (in constant US$) declined in the 2002-2003 years, the aftermath of the crisis.
Although overall spending was cut, certain priority programs were granted budgetary
protection in 2003 and 2004, with support from the SSAL-2. These included: basic school
supplies, bilingual education, and textbooks and teaching materials.

Inspite of the fall inexpenditures, and perhaps inpart due to the spending protectionof basic
education inputs, the performance of education indicators did not decline significantly.
Instead, growth in enrollment in preschool, secondary, and tertiary education levels (primary
had already achieved universal enrollment prior to the crisis) continued, albeit at more
moderate rates (see Figure A4.3).

Student performance inthe national assessment, as well as scores inPISA 2003, also indicates
that the crisis did not have a severe impact on education quality. While mean scores in the
national assessments of student achievement in math and language improved in 2002, the
improvement among students of poor socioeconomic backgrounds was greater than the
improvement among students of wealthier backgrounds. As a result, the gap in achievement
between students from high and low socioeconomic backgrounds continues to be narrowing.
Basic education indicators in 1999-2004indicate that enrollment levels, as well as transition
and completion rates, were not substantially negatively affectedb y the crisis (see Table A4.6).
Incontrast, there were improvementsincoverage inpreschool and secondary educationlevels
(while primary remained in universal coverage) during this period. Nevertheless, plans to
expand access to preschool education as well as expansion of the full-time schools model
were halted. Textbook production duringand inthe aftermath o f the crisis has been limited. In
addition, non-recurrent investments have been curtailed, and as a result the maintenance of
school buildings and other needed repairs have been delayed.

         SOCIAL PROTECTION

The economic crisis of 2002 seriously affected the social protection system, through fiscal
restrictions that reduced both funding for the sector and the real value of social protection
benefits, while it also led to a sharp increase in demand. While the number of beneficiaries in
the pension system i s mostly determined by long term trends and thus was not affected by the
crisis, the average benefit received by retirees b y the end of 2003 was 20 percent below the
1997 average benefit due to a decline in real wages to which benefits are indexed (Table
A4.7).

The number of contributors to social security systems declined rapidly as a result of
unemployment growth and a markedincrease in the share o f workers in the informal sector.
While the number o f contributors reached a maximum of 977 thousand in January 1999, it
began to decline steadily and fell as low as 820 thousand in October 2002, a 20 percent
reduction in 45 months. This reduction will have an impact on old-age benefits in the future,

                                                      59

as individuals who did not contribute during the crisis may not accumulate the minimum 35
years of contributions to retire.
In addition, the increase in informality resulted in a decrease in the number of formal sector
Family Allowance program beneficiaries, as it was mostly focused on formal employees, and
in other social programs such as health and unemployment insurance. The number of formal
sector workers' children covered by the Family Allowances program fell from an average of
400 thousand in 2000 to 300 thousand in 2003, a 25 percent fall (see Figure A4.4). Other
programs, such as unemployment insurance, were unable to respond effectively to the crisis
andonly 17 percent of the unemployed were able to obtain this benefit duringthe crisis.

Recognizing that the traditional contributory scheme was insufficient to provide adequate
protection, the Government enacted Law 17139 in July 1999, extending family allowances
benefits to households with reduced income. The new program aimed at expanding the
monthly benefit of 16 percent of the minimumwage per child to households with unemployed
heads or informal workers. Between 2000 and 2003, the number of children benefiting from
this program increased from 65 to 100thousand.
While the scheme established in Law 17139 opened the family allowances program to poor
households, the strict requirements included in it made it less accessible than originally
expected. In May 2004, the Government issued a new Law (17758), reducing requirements
anddocumentation necessary to obtain family allowances benefits. As a result, approximately
85 thousand new beneficiaries were receiving this benefit by the end of 2004.
In May 2003, the Government introduced the Programa de Actividudes Comunitarias
(Community Activities Program- PAC), a workfare program that provides a monthly payment


                                               60

of approximately 1100 Uruguayan pesos in exchange for four six-hour working days per week
in local infrastructure programs. The coverage of the PACs has been limited (approximately
5000 beneficiaries) but results have been generally evaluated as positive. While it is not clear
whether the new administration will continue this program, the experience obtained i s
applicable to the new workfare program.
Uruguay has had a wide array of food transfer programs for several years with expenditures
for 0.4 percent of GDP in 2003. The programs had different goals (nutrition, income
distribution, social emergency, etc) and target groups (school children, pregnant women,
newborns, the elderly and disable, etc). While their magnitude i s limited, their flexibility and
capacity to expand during the crisis (when total expenditures grew by 32 percent) are
significant. In 2003, it was estimated that 65 percent of households below the extreme poverty
line received some type of food transfer, while 42 percent of the moderately poor were also
beneficiaries. Leakage, however, was significant (37 percent of the beneficiaries were not
poor).
Table A4.8 present trends in social security and assistance indicators. Households in which
the head does not participate in the labor market appear to be much better off than any other
group, and this effect became more pronounced throughout the period. That finding may be
explained by the broader coverage and increased value of pensions since the 1989 reform.
Pensions have become an increasingly more effective insurance against poverty and
households headed by older individuals are less vulnerable to poverty.
Having a head of household with some post-secondary education i s becoming increasingly
important as a protection against poverty. A high school education alone has become less o f
an effective insurance against poverty in recent years. On the other hand, public sector
employment and home ownership both provide an effective protection against poverty.
 Rural poverty poses a different kind of challenge in Uruguay. Although small in absolute
numbers-about     130,000 people living in settlements of less than 5,000 persons and 57,000 in
dispersed rural areas-the    rate of rural poverty exceeds that of urban poverty. In 2000, the
poverty headcount was 25 percent in urban settlements of 900-5000 inhabitants, 28 percent in
settlements of less than 900 inhabitants and 20 percent indispersed rural areas, compared with
an urban poverty headcount of 17 percent. Rural dwellers living in small and medium-sized
towns are highly dependent on wage labor and have lower average income levels than those
living in dispersed rural areas. About half of the rural poor work in agriculture and livestock.
Poverty i s higher among those working in agriculture than among those working in non-farm
activities (mainly the government and transport). Agricultural wages are among the lowest in
the country. Rural poverty affects a high share of children. Some 61 percent o f children aged
15 or younger in settlements of 900-5000 inhabitants are poor or indigent. The corresponding
figures for settlements of less than 900 inhabitants, and for the dispersed rural areas are 53
percent and 36 percent respectively. There is no reliable information on how the crisis
affected the rural poor, because statistics are not collected in the rural areas. Anecdotal
evidence suggests that rural incomes were hard hit by the epidemic of foot and mouth disease,
which reduced beef exports. More recently however, there has been a surge in agricultural
exports across the board as a result of the currency devaluation and this has boosted rural
incomes. The gathering of reliable information on living and working conditions in the rural
areas would greatly assist research and enable policy decisions on rural poverty to be
developed on a well-informed basis.
