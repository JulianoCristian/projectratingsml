decentralization reform process, which\n            involves helping the other states adjust to hard budget\n            constraints, such as reduced federal resources, and\n            strengthened financial mechanisms, but also involves\n            preparing the states with the financial, and technical\n            capability to participate in forthcoming federal reforms to\n            the tax, and transfer system, and for the provision of key\n            social services, namely education and health, already\n            decentralized with transfers to the states. In addition, the\n            project will ensure macroeconomic stability, by reducing\n            poverty, through increased resources for education and\n            health services to the poor. Nonetheless, risks exist: 1)\n            the state could revert to the fiscal imbalances of the past;\n            2) the Federal Government could withdraw its support to the\n            reform program; 3) the state Congress, currently controlled\n            by opposition parties, could block policy initiatives\n            embedded in the adjustment program; and, 4) the reform\n            program could prove too formidable a task for the\n            government's implementation capacity. However, strong\n            government commitments, the appropriate program design, and\n            the accompanying Technical Assistance Project will help\n            minimize those risks."}, "docdt": "2000-11-16T00:00:00Z"}
