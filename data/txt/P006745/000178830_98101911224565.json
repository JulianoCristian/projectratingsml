Advisory services would be built up and\n            linked for farm development and operation; tree planting;\n            soil conservation and produce marketing. Training courses\n            would be provided for staff and farmers at centers and\n            through mobile training units. Credit would be provided for\n            farm and marketing operations and development. Within the\n            project areas, rural roads would be constructed and improved\n            from productive areas to main roads leading to markets.\n            Furniture and equipment would be provided to rural primary\n            schools and a rural health service would be extended to\n            cover 80% of the rural population in the project area.\n            Domestic water supply schemes would be developed in parts of\n            all areas and in one area the rural electricity network also\n            would be extended."}, "docdt": "1976-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
