its Sixth Five-Year\n            Plan. The project will help finance equipment and materials\n            for about 3,500 rural electrification schemes meeting\n            specific eligibility criteria in the participating States,\n            about 100 distribution system improvement schemes, and\n            additional buildings and equipment for a rural\n            electrification training institute.
