MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF HUNGARY FOR
A HUMAN RESOURCES PROJECT
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Hungary for US$150 million is submitted for approval. The
proposed loan would assist the Government in its program to alleviate  'e
unemployment impact of economic restructuring and to invest in human resources
so as to promote Hungary's economic and technological competitiveness. The
loan would have a maturity of 15 years, including a five years grace period,
at the standard variable interest rate.
2.          Background.  Rigid labor markets, an unresponsive training system,
and fragmented and outdated higher education inappropriately linked to
industry and scientific R&D, will severely constrain the success of the
economic reforms and the move to a market economy. New institutions and major
structural reforms are needed to address human resources issues, which include
emerging unemployment, obsolescence of much of the training system, lack of
management and foreign language skills, and the scientific and technological
gap between Hu ary and its competitors. Manpower planning for the command
economy has resulted in complex and rigid management of narrow vocational
training by the Ministry of Culture and Education (MOE) alo..g with many other
line ministries which supervised productive sector enterprises. A more
flexible approach capable of quick adaptation to shifting market conditions is
urgently needed.
3.           The economic stagnation over the past 15 years has resulted in
under-investment in human resources. Some 70% of the secondary school age
population is enrolled in secondary school, but nearly half of this is in
narrow apprentice training with very little general secondary education beyond
the primary school level. Only 15% of the university age population attends
college or university, compared with at least 30% in OECD countries.
Government strategy is to expand secondary and tertiary enrollments, and to
initiate institutional and policy reforms, while refurbishing outmoded
equipment and infrastructure at these levels.
4.          Rationale for Bank Involvement.  As a part of the Bank's
assistance in helping Hungary move towards a market economy, the Government
requested Bank assistance in a broad spectrum of human resources issues
including labor markets, training, higher education and science and technology
research (STR). Following extensive sector work in FY90, the Bank is now well
positioned to support a broad project which provides the initial support for a
larger human resources investment program. The Government sees the framework
adopted in this project as useful for attracting external assistance from
other donors.



2
5.          Prolect Oblectives.  The project would address certain priority
human resources issues which constrain a successful transition to a market
economy. Specific objectives are to: (a) assist unemployed workers to find
jobs and enterprises to find suitable workers; (b) provide relevant training
for youth and adults, especially in relation to item (a); (c) improve the
rasponsiveness of higher education to the new technical and managerial demands
of a market economy, with special emphasis on improving access, relevance,
quality, efficiency and financing; (d) assist in narrowing the technological
gap between Hungary and its competitors by expanding and reorienting the
training of science and technology researchers, improving management of
research and improving the linkages between the academic community and
enterprises; and (e) develop foreign language competence so as to promote
international economic and technological ties.
Project Description
6.          The EmRloyment and Training Program would provide equipment and
technical assistance needed to: (a) develop employment information and
services to promote labor mobility by incorporating lessons from pilot
employment programs in the Third Industrial Restructuring Project
(implementing agency: Ministry of Labor (MOL)); (b) improve the responsiveness
of adult vocational training, by providing specialized occupational training
with strong links to private and public employers and the labor market
(implementing agency: the National Training Council (NTC), a new body with
business, government and worker representation, whose mandate is to organize
the development and delivery of training in response to market signals); and
(c) improve vocational curricula for 14 - 16 year olds by converting
excessively narrow vocational programs into broad based general education
programs (science, mathematics, languages, etc.), coupled with training in
broad clusters of occupational skills as a base for further specialized
training (implementing agency: MOL).
7.          The Higher Education and Research Program would assist: (a) the
recently established Catching-up-with-Higher-Education-in-Europe Fund (CEF) to
implement its mandate to review and select the winners of competitions for
innovative and relevant higher education programs according to agreed upon
criteria and procedures, and (b) the development of human resources for
Science and Technology Research (STR) by supporting research grants for young
scientists, improvement of scientific instrumentation centers shared by the
scientific community and the development of the national R&D computer network.
The criteria for selecting proposals submitted to the CEF would encourage
greater collaboration and resource sharing among specialized universities and
the research institutes of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (HAS) and new
inter-disciplinary programs (e.g., economics and management for engineers and
scientists). This would also include support for practically oriented foreign
language training programs. The STR programs would be implemented by the
newly restructured National Scientific Research Fund (OTKA).

8.          The total cost of the project is estimated at $US 339.8 million,
with a foreign exchange component of $US 150.0 million (44%). A breakdown of
costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.  Amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursements are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Hungary
are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report
(SAR), No. 9183-HU, dated March 1991 is being distributed separately.
9.          Actio is Agreed.  During negotiations the Government gave
assurances that: (a) the system of unemployment monitoring implemented in
January 1991 would be continued on at least a quarterly basis; (b) it would
review with the Bank not later than November 30 of each year the proposed NTC
and RTBs budget and programs for che following fiscal year of the Borrower;
(c) it would staff adequately and provide other resources to the relevant
professional departments of MOL to ensure successful implementation of: (i)
industrial adjustment services, occupational and educational information; (ii)
aptitude and interest assessment, career information systems development and
user training; and (iii) job search and development; and (d) it would staff
adequately and provide other resources to the relevant professional
departments of the MOL to implement the new vocational secondary school
curriculum. These staff (to be appointed by Minister of Labor through
internal redeployment) would act as facilitators and liaison officers across
existing departments and with the staff of the MOE. They would develop terms
of reference for technical assistance contracts and equipment, coordinate
procurement activities among MOE, Government an,i Bank officials, monitor
expenditures and provide reports to the Government and the Bank.
10.         During negotiations the Government also gave assurances that it
would: (a) submit to Parliament by December 31, 1991 draft laws providing for
(i) the autonomy of universities and colleges and a mechanism for their
normative financing, (ii) the autonomy of the HAS, and (iii) the reform of the
system of advanced training for scientists and the awarding of scientific
degrees; (b) carry out and review with the Bank by June 30, 1992 a feasibility
study on revenue generation and cost recovery in higher education and take all
measures required on its part to ensure the improvement of cost recovery on
the basis of the study's recommendations, taking into consideration the
comments of the Bank; and (c) use the agreed criteria, guidelines and
procedures for awards of grants/allocations under the CEF, the Scientific
Instrument Centers and the Young Scientists Support Program and review any
futtre changes to these criteria, guidelines and procedures with the Bank
before they are introduced.
11.         During negotiations the Government confirmed that: (a) progress
reports would be submitted semi-annually; (b) annual audits of acceptable
scope and quality would be carried out by independent auditors satisfactory to
the Bank; (c) annual audit reports for the preceding fiscal year would be made
available to the Bank no later than by June 30th each year; and (d) a mid-
term review of the project's progress would be carried out by the Bank and the
Borrower by November 30, 1993.
12.         Conditions of Disbursement.  Disbursements for goods under the
adult training component of the project would be conditional upon: (a) the NTC



4
budget having been adopted for the borrower's fiscal year ending December 31,
1991; (b) operational guidelines for regional training boards having been
adopted and at least four of these boards having been established and staffed;
and (c) the proposed programs and budgets of these regional training boards
having been adopted for the borrower's fiscal year ending December 31, 1991.
13.         Bgnefits.  The major benefit would be thLe contribution this
project would make to promoting a quick and flexible supply response to the
transformation of the Hungarian economy. Employment services developed by the
project would assist in the alleviation of unemployment and the productive
redeployment of labor. Hungary's base of skilled workers and professionals
would be expanded and improved to assist the country to compete successfully
in a European framework. The national capacity for research and technological
development, with an enhanced capability to respond to changing market needs,
would be increased through the HE and STR components of the project.
14.         Risks.  The major risks are: (a) that the past fragmentation in
the education and training system has resulted in bureaucratic vested
interests which may try to preserve their spheres of control and delay
implementation; and (b) newly created agencies would have inadequate
experience to implement major components. The first risk is being addressed
by providing a sufficient amount of financing to motivate effective
cooperation and sharing of resources, thereby helping to overcome the
fragmentation in the education and training system; the second risk is being
addressed by incorporating technical assistance to strengthen institutional
performance.
15.         Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
