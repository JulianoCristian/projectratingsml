Resources\n            Development Project in Hungary are as follows: overall\n            outcome of the project is rated as highly satisfactory, and\n            the performance of the Bank and the Borrower were rated\n            highly satisfactory. Some of the lessons learned from the\n            project are: (a) the Bank and the Borrower need flexibility\n            in adjusting project design and implementation schedule of\n            the project without formal amendment, provided that the\n            changes are in line with the main objectives of the project;\n            (b) in projects where reform actions are supported, a\n            well-prepared public information campaign could help\n            citizens and institutions understand their roles,\n            responsibilities and opportunities; (c) the project\n            management structure has to be adapted to the project\n            structure. In case of big, multi-component projects, the\n            Bank and Borrower must undertake an analysis during project\n            preparation and find the proper implementation management\n            structure, identifying skill mix; (d) wherever possible,\n            mainly in case of big complex projects, the Bank has to make\n            an effort to have the task team leader and procurement\n            expert settled in the field, or in a geographically close\n            Hub; (e) although the general conditions of the loan require\n            adequate maintenance of equipment, in new loan agreements\n            the Bank should request more specific guarantees from\n            Borrowers that the sophisticated equipment purchased from\n            the loan will be operational during the life of the loan;\n            and (f) the Bank should encourage Borrowers to hire\n            experienced procurement agents to accelerate the procurement process."}, "docdt": "1998-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
