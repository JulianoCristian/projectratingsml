REPORT AND RECOIMiENIDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THEXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA FOR A
THIRD RAILWfvAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to $31.2 million to
the Republic of China, for relending to the Taiwan Railway Administration
(TRA) for a Third Railway Project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        In April 1965 the Bank lent .20 million to the Republic of
China for the TRA to help finance its capital improvements during the
years 1965-68. Traffic rose much faster than expected, leading to a
revision of the investment program and a second $17.5 million loan in
January 1968 for imported rolling stock, motive power and other equip-
ment.
3.        The TRP has recently drawn up a new Capital Investmnent Plan
for the period 1969-72 amounting to `125 million equivalent with a
foreign excnange component of  74 rmillion equivalent.  This proposed
loan would finance the foreign exchange cost of high priority investments
to be made in 1969-70.
4.       The proposed loan would support the Government's efforts to
improve and expand the country's infrastructure, especially in trans-
portation, to the level required for further economic progress. Public
investment in infrastructure has increased appreciably in recent years
but has not kept pace with the rapid development of the directly
productive sectors of the economy.  Accordingly greater emphasis is now
being placed on investment in transportation, electric power, water
supply, telecommunications and education.
5.        Negotiations for the loan were held in Washington from March 28
to April 4, 1969. Representing the Central and Provincial Governments
were Ilr. Martin Wong, Economic iinister and lMlr. T.W. Hu, Economic Attache
in the Embassy.  The TRA was represented by br. S.H. Chen, General
Manager; Mqr. C.F. Chen, Chief of Operations; and ilJr. Tuan, Chief
Engineer.
6.        The Bank has made eight loans to the Republic of China and
the proposed loan would bring the total to $178 million net of cancella-
tions. IDA has made four development credits, totalling $13.1 million
net of cancellations, which are fully disbursed. The following is a
summary staternent of Bank loans and IDA credits as of March 31, 1969:

7.        All the projects financed by IDA and the First Deep-sea Fishing
project have been satisfactorily completed. The implementation of the
projects financed by previous Bank loans is progressing satisfactorily.
Disbursements under the Second Deep-sea Fishing loan (498 CHA) are
related to the construction of fishing vessels which is on schedule.
Disbursements of the Telecommunications loan (506 CHA) are about a year
behind schedule because a major contract had to be retendered.
B.        An appraisal mission for a thermal power project is scheduled
to visit Taiwan shortly and a loan is expected to be presented to the
Executive Directors in January 1970.
9.        China has recently joined IFC, but so far no IFC investments
have been made in the country.

PART II - DESCRIPTION OF TIHE PROPOSED LOAN
10.       Borrower:            Republic of China
Beneficiary:         Tail Ian Railway Administration (TRA)
Amount:              The equivalent in variou.s currencies
of $?31.2 million
Purpose:             To help finance the purchase of
locomotives, rolling stock, track
equipment, signalling equipment and
miscellaneou.s items.
Amortization:        In fifteen and one-half years including
a three and one-half year grace period,
through semi-annual installments
beginning December 15, 1972 and ending
December 15, 1984.

Comrmiitment Charge:  3/4 of 1 percent per annum
Relending Terms:     The same as the terms of the Bank loan
to the Republic of China
PART III - TXE PROJECT
11.       An appraisal repoit entitled "Appraisal of Third Railway
Project, Chlinal (PTR-10a) dated Hiay 9, 1969 is attached.
12.       Inland transport requirements are mostly concentrated w.ritlhn
a corridor stretching the length of the western plain, and containing
most of the country's large cities.  The TRA's main railway line passes
through tlhis 40O 1cn corridor, serving more than 80 percent of tile
population. Road transport of passengers and freight along the route
is still largely confined to short distance and local traffic. Coastal
slhipping on the western coast of Taiwan is almost non-existent, and the
narrow gauge railways operated by the sugar, mining and timber indu.stries
serve mostly as feeders for the TRA lines. The narrow valley on the
east side of the island relies to an even greater extent on the narrow
gauge East Railw¢ay Line. Tnis railway is paralleled by an unpaved road
which can be used throughout its length only in the dry season.
13.       In compliance with the terms of earlier Bank loans a Committee
for Coordination of Transport has been established, consisting of heads
of transport agencies. aeveral short-term problems have been studied
and the Comnittee is now concentrating on the preparation of long-term
development programs.  Current studies u.nder way or to be started
shortly cover the feasibility of railway electrification, proposals for



new port and airport facilities, the proposed north-south expressway
connecting Keelung and Kaohsiung and urban transport problems. Regard-
less of the outcome of the above studies, the items to be financed by
this loan would be required by the railways and are justified.
1h.       The loan would help finance the first two years of the TRA's
Capital Investment Plan for 1969-72, making a total investment in the
years 1969 and 1970 of $86 million, including foreign costs of
$54 million. The proposed loan would cover the cost of imported
locomotives, passenger and freight cars, track and signalling equipment,
and minor miscallaneous items; and additionally would provide for the
foreign excnange cost of consulting services.
15.       Consultants to be finarnced out of the proceeds of thie proposed
loan rould carry out a feasibility study of the electrification of TRA's
main line and help in the establishment of a railway planning unit. The
planning unit will assist TRA's management to plan investments, examine
transport competition, review operational efficiency, traffic costs and
tariff policy. In particular the consultants would help to introduce
modern traffic costing techniques and would instruct TRA's staff in
devising a rate and fare structure based on traffic costs. To ensure
proper staffing of the planning unit to be established the proposed
loan w-rill also cover the foreign exchange costs of training abroad of
suitable TRA staff. The allocation for the feasibility study, the
assistance in planning, and for training arnounts to 300,000.
16.       The goods to be financed would be procured through international
competitive bidding. Local suppliers will probably compete for some
contracts, especially for freight cars and will be allowed a preference
of 15 percent or the existing level of customs duties and taxes, which-
ever is lower. Disbursements from the loan against contracts won by
local suppliers would be for the foreign cost component of the contract.
17.       Arrangements for purchasing 18 locomotives to be included in
the loan have already been made, as Executive Directors have been
advised. This was done last lMarch when at the Bank's suggestion TRA
combined this purchase with the purchase of 26 locomotives under the
previous Bank loan to TRPA (524 CHA), both being on the basis of full
international competition. In this way TRA was able to standardize
on a single type and achieve substantial cost savings.
18.       The railroad is generally well managed, its personnel are
efficient, and the organization is qualified to carry out the project.
The TRA is financially sound and earns a satisfactory rate of return.
Under the loan the railroad would be required to earn a 6.5 percent
rate of return for fiscal years 1969 and 1970, and not less than
7 percent thereafter. Cash requirements during the four-year period
of the Capital Investment Plan are about $175 million. Internal cash
generation of approximately $105 million leaves $70 million to be
borrowed. The proposed and expected future Bank loans, together with
modest short-term borrowing from local sources, would cover the gap.

Debt will constitute a reasonable portion of TRA's capitalization
during the Plan period and earnings are expected to cover debt
servicing requirements by a satisfactory margin.
19.       The project will provide high priority itens urgently needed
by the railroad and will give economic rates of return varying from
9 to 35 percent on investments.
20.       The proposed loan would be for a term of fifteen and one-half
years, a period which is somewhat shorter than is customary for a
project of this kind and which reflects China's favorable foreign
exchange position and prospects. The Government will relend the
proceeds of the proposed loan on the same financial terms and conditions
to TRA, and cash flow projections indicate that the proposed repayment
schedule will not be burdensome for the railway.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMITS AiND AUTHORITf
21.       The draft Loan Agreement between thle Republic of China and
the Bank, the draft Project Agreement between the Bank, the Province of
Taiwan and the Taiwan Railway Ad.ninistration, the Report of the
Comm,nittee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles
of Agreement and the text of a draft Resolution approving the proposed
loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
22.       The draft loan documents are substantially in the form
usually used for railway projects and follow closely the documents used
for the previous tw.zo loans. In addition, provisions are made in the
draft loan documents:
(i) amending rate covenants in the previous Loan and Project
Agreements (Loan Nos. 409 CHA and 524 CHA) to conform
with the new rate covenants (Sections 7.01(c) and 7.02(b)
of the draft Loan Agreement and Sections 3.01(a) and
3.02(a) of the draft Project Agreement);
(ii) for cross defaults under the previous two Loan Agreements
and the new Loan Agreement (Section 6.02(b), 7.01(a), (b)
and 7.02(a));
(iii) restricting TRA's contribution to the Province during the
period of January 1, 1970 to December 31, 1972 to
$1.25 million in any year (Section 2.10 of the draft
Project Agreement);
(iv) requiring TRA to consult the Bank on implementation of the
electrification of its railway system (Section 2.11 of the
draft Project Agreement);   and
(v) for preference to the local suppliers (paragraoh 5 of
Schedule 4 of the draft Loan Agreement).

PART V - THE ECONOMY
23.       An economic report, "Current Economic Position and Prospects
of the Republic of China" (AS-142a), dated September 11, 1968, in two
volumes was circulated to the Executive Directors on September 17, 1968.
The oconom .c growth of the Republic of China accelerated further in 1968;
GIP in real terms increased by 10.3 percent as compared with 9.9 percent
in 1967 and 9.4 percent in 1966. As a result of this and a notable decline
in population growth, per capita CUP in real terms increased by almost 8
percent to US$273 equivalent. Prospects for further rapid growth are favor-
able. Wholesale prices on the average rose by 2 percent in 1968 and consum-
er prices by more than 6 percent.   Being alerted by this evidence of some
inflationary pressure from a considerable credit expansion, the Central
Bank tightened credit.
24.      alnufacturing and construction continued to grow faster than
other sectors; manufacturing production increased by 20 percent in 1968,
with more output from new and technically advanced industries. Power supply
has improved as a result of a substantial increase in hydropower made possi-
ble by abundant rainfalls during the year.   However, a drought could adversely
affect the supply of hydroelectricity. Accelerated economic growth and the
trade boom have led to rapidly increasing demand for transportation services.
In 1968, overland passenger and freight traffic each rose by more than 10
percent, total import and export shipments by almost 30 percent, and the
volume of cargo loaded and unloaded at the harbors by 17 percent.
25.       Merchandise exports accelerated from a 20 percent increase in
1967 to a 26 percent increase in 1968 while the growth in merchandise
imports slowed down from 22 percent in 1967 to 13 percent in 1968. The
deficit on goods and services amounting to $130 million in 1968 is rela-
tively small compared trith the total export earnings from goods and
services of over $1 billion. Possible reduction of receipts from Vietnam
in case of a peace settiement is estimated at only 2-3 percent of total
exports of goods and services.
26.       Being fully aware of the bottlenecks existing in infrastructure
services the Chinese Government in its Fifth Four-Year Development Plan
(1969-72) emphasized investment in transportation, power, the expansion
of urban facilities, and the development of technical and scientific edu-
cation to train more technical personnel and skilled labor which are in
short supply. Intensification of industrialization, particularly in
increasing investment in more capital-intensive and technologically so-
phisticated industries, along with export promotion, is also emphasized.
To finance the necessary investments in economic and social infrastructure,
Gover-nment savings should increase through tax reform measures. A Tax
Reforma Commission has been established under the Executive Yuan and new
tax legislation is being drafted. The Tax Reform is to be designed to
increase total Government revenue from 18.5 percent of GNP in 1968 to
21.6 percent in 1972.  Governrment savings will rise from a negligible
amount in 1968 to 2.6 percent of GIP in 1972. Total domestic savings
as percentage of GNP is expected to be stepped up from 21 percent in
1968 to 25 percent in 1972.



27.       Gross official foreign exchange reserves amounting to $330
million at the end of 1968 were equivalent to more than five months'
imports. Annual debt service in 1968 was less than 6 percent of exports
of goods and services. It is estimated that further foreign capital re-
quirements after taking account of relatively less favorable terms on
which it can probably be obtained will raise the debt service ratio to
10 percent by the mid 1970's. Given the past record of progress and
the favorable prospects for the future, the Republic of China is credit-
worthy for the proposed Bank loan.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEIENT
28.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOMINDATION
29.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
