Introduction     ,.
21.     'A  tudy carried out from 1960-64 by the United Zkation Development
Program (1l6P) recommended the ea4y irrigation development of Middle Awash
-River Basin, and identified Heleka-tadi and 'Amibara areas of the valley fdr
the purpose.  The irrigation deVelopment in the area by -1976 (before the
start of,AIP) had already reached some 20,000 ha in upper and middle Awaih
Valley s.d 32,000 ha in the'iower valley.* - The Amibara project as .1ini
tially \apptoved by IDA in 1973 (to provide gravity 'Irrigation to about
10,000 ha of land) was subsequently revised due tot substantial Increase
in the total project cost and changing the project's basic concept of
deveft in  80 percent of the area by concessionaires who were given leases
\ to constrlct facilities and recoup their investments. Shis changed concept
followed Governrmnt land reform in 1975. The revised F')ject was developed
out of the reappraisal (Jan.-Apr. 1976) Jut the Project as mplemented, in
many-respects, remained similar to the original project in that it provided
for the develpment 'of io,000 ha under gravity irrigation on state-managed
farms.
2.       The revised AIP was approved by the Board on Kay 10W '^77.  DCA
(6t. 707-ST) and Project Agreement were signed on November 7, 1977 and the
Credit became effentive on April 1, 1978.  the construction of AXP was
resumed in August 1978 and was substantially completed in 1984 with modest
cost overruns.. It achilyed its production objectives by attaining constant
high<eotton yields averag ^  33 quintals/ha.

Results
10.      the Project has been successful and has exceeded the prQduction
target envisaged in the SM.  The average yield ptr hectare is 3.3 tons of
'Seed cotton on the-incremental area on state fatis (7,244 ha) giving ar
annual production of about 24,000 t=ns, exceeding appraisal estimates of
,20,000 tons. The Project continues to make an important contribution to
the natiotnal economy through ipport substitution in supplying the domestic'
cotton demand, thereby conserving- foreign exchange.  At appraisal it was   -
assumed that cotton would largely be exported: however. the production was
consumed domesticallr1 to baeet the increased nationai demand.  Ove4ll .ERR
is 15 percent against an-'appraisal estimate of 13 percent.  The physical
components were substantially completed generally meeting the -anticipated
time frame.   The Project at cpmpletiow registered a cost overrun of 16 -

ETHOPIA
REVISED AMIBARA IRRIG&?ION PROJECT
(CREDIT 707-ET)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The basic ;vi,'ndence of the Ethiopian economy on agriculture will
continue in ,he to* 6 and while the development of agriculture raises
difficult issues, tra lack of other resources strongly indicate that the
Country's economic progress will have to rest almost entirely on the expar.-
sion of crop production. Agriculture is thus 'paramount and its satisfac-
tory growth is crucial. not only for improving and stabil'izing food supply
but also for increased export and industrial growth.
1.02     The Ethiopian population In 1984 was about 42 million, and with an
annual growth rate of about t percent (without counting the influx of refu-
gees), the total populatin 4ould reach 65 million by the turn of the cen-
tury.  With a per -capita GNP of US$110, Ethiopia is one of the poorest
countries in the world. GDP growth has averaged alout 2.5 percent annually
during the last decad', whereas in the same period agriculture grew by a
little over 1.1percent (value added at constant prices), which is signifi-
cantly less than the annual population increase.
1.03     About 85 percent of the total labor force is employed in agricul-
ture, the dominant sector, contributing about 45 percent of the GDP and
around 85 percent of the exports. During the last few years, agricultural
growth has declined sharply and as shown by Annex A, all key Indicators and
indices show a deteriorating trend culminating in the sharp decline (nega-
tive) for drought years )i83/84- 1984185., Preliminary indicators poiit to
some recovery in 1985186, \both in economic and agricultural growth and with
_good rains this trend could have prevailed_provided,other constraints  to
Increased agricultural production wtre reasonably resolved.   However, a
failure of\rains again in many part# of the country in JulylAugust,- 1987,
had devastating impact - particularliin the northern rAgions.
1.04     In outlining  its development priorities,  Government  indicated\
giving its primary emphasis to agriculture and to narrow the gap between
the urban and rural living standards, as well to sustain the growing popu-
lation requiring agricultural exports (and crop production for import sub-
stitution) as part of a more comprehensive agricultural poliivy towards
exports and food security.
105 V  Crops account for sbout 80 percent\of the gross value of agricul-
tural production with the crop production concentrating in the 'highlands
and meeting pr4mrily subs4stence needs.  The cropping systems are adapted
to local agro-2cological conditions but remain highly susceptible to the
variations in rainfall and its distribution. X The increasing need and
significance of agricultural production -focussed greatek attention on the
need for planning the country's large watetrresources in a way that wou4d
allow its Xgricultural production to 'e 'less dependent on the vagaries of
rainfall.   As part of, this -overall program, ,mphasis was given to the

expansion of irrigated croppi   areas in the Av&sh River valley vhich
offered the'",best opportunities for extensive water resources development.
1.06     The Awash Basin covers about 115,000 sq. kms\and is drained by the
Awash River and its tributaries. It is an area in Ethiopia where extensive
water resources development vas well underway and coAsequently it offered
the best opportunities for the expansion, of large scale irrigated agricul-
ture enterprises. the irrigation development in the area by 1976 (before
the start of AIP) had already reached some 20,000 ha ia upper ind middle,
Awash Valley and 32,000 ha in the lower valley.
1.07     The construction of AIP wvs started in i977178 to develop and
bring a total area of 10,300 ha-under gravity irrigation in the Melka-Sadi
and Amibara plains in the middle "wash Valley (some 275 km north-east by
road frnm Addis Ababa), including 3,056 ha already under pumped irrigation
and traisformed into a g4vity-fed system with additional 7,249 ha of new
development.  The new land was developed for irrigated cotton production on
state-managed farms. The Project was substantially completed with modest
cost overruns and achieved its objectives with constant high cotton yields
averaging 3,3 qlha'\which remained above the #ppraisal eatimates over the\
last four years.   -

2.01     Development by 'modern large-scale irrigation systems has 'been a
relatively recent phenomeron inthiopia.  In the early sixties, the lands
of the Awasht Basin had been identified and confirmed as havin\ a high
potential for irrigated agricultural development.  It is an area in Ethio-
pia where extensive'water resources,'development was well underway even
-beforet-he start of Amibara Irrigation Projevt                   --IP4 and  c8nsEe1-tly, -it---

specially cash crops i4ke cotton and sugar cane for export and imRort sub-
stitution.                                ,                
2.02    \A,study carried out from 1961-1964 by' the United Nations Develop-
ment Program (UNDP) recommended the early irrigation development of the
Melka-Sadi agd Amibara areas of the Awash River Valley. These ai,eas are
located' in the Middle Awash River Basin in'\ th,  central eastern part of
Ethiepia at an altitude of 740 m above sea level. Preparation work was
entrustld in 1962 'to the then Awash Valley Authority (AVA). which Vlater
'became known,as the Awash Valley Development Agency (AVDA),,,a Government
public authority cre4ted to administer and,develop the natural resources of
the Awash River Basin (See' par"s 6.01 - 6.02 giving chronologically
subsequent changes in the institutibus).  The World Bank Group first became
associated with \the development of the Awash Valley in"1964 through its
financing of twd hydro power 'plants 'and then in  4968 the Bank helped
finance a road from Awash to Tendaho (303, km) in thp middle and lower
valleys.  This road was justified partly on grounds of Nopening the valley
for future irrigation development.  The loan agreement provided for the
prepara4ion of a spec4fic irrigation' project covering about 20,000 h' in
thei Melka-,Sadi and Aniibara areas in the middle valley   -A' committee,



including representatives of AVDA, UNDP, PAO, PAOI IBRD Cooperativeprogram
and the BAnk, was set up in 1968 to iupervise the kreparation\of a project.
AVDA retained' consultants to con4uct a feasibility study which was
completed in 1969.
2.03     The proposed project was appraised by an IDA appraisal mission in
October 1969 which tpond that further studies, partisularly in soil survey
and land classification, were required before an appraisal could be com-
pleted. After the completion ?f the additional investigations, a 14,600 ha
project, including the Melka-Sadi and Amibara areas, was appraised by an
IDA m4ssion in October 1971.
2.04     Subsequently1 the Government, in consultation wi4h IDA, decided to
lea"e the upstream Melka-Sadi area of abot 4,600 ha to the Melka-Sadi
Agricult*re Estate Company (MAESCO - now defunct) to speed up construction
and utilize private capital and expertise in land development. This change
in the project restricted the development under DA, Project to about 10,000
ha in the Amibara\area and had the effect of changing the point of river
diversion.\ A further mission reviewed the modified, project in M'ecember
1972 and a' credit of US$17 million was approved on July 5, 1973 (Cr. 418-
ET). This credit was not made effective until Augu6t I974 because of
delays in parliameUtary ratification.
2.05     The IDA project as tpprovedX in 1973 was intended to provide gra-
vity irrigation by constructing,\,a diversion structure at, the Melka Warer
from the Awash River to ir;igate about 10,000 ha of land, in the Amibava
\    area'with,a, complete irrigation and drainage network and all'other relat4d V
works and facilities. The total project cost at the time of appraisal was
estimated at\VS$22.8 million and IwA credit of US$17 million was intended
to finance ab64t 75 persent of the,ptoject cost.  The appraised project had
as one\of its basic coneepts the development of 80 percent of the project
#rea by concessionaires who were, given leases to construct facilities and \ \
recoup their investments.  This situation changed in 1975 under the Govern-
ment's land reforms policy.  In the Amibara area: about 1,500 ha had been
developed by pup irrigation in this, manner by these concessionaire groups
prior to the approvfl of the IDA credit.                  '
2.06     In accordance with the Credit Agreement, AVDA employed a "firm pf
consultants to co*plete final' design and supervise construction of the
project.  In earlyX 1974, the conFultants reviewed the cost estimates and
found that there had been a rapid escalation '\n construction costs and
\   estimated that project cost had risen 2-112 to 3 tiu4s the estimites uIeed
in the appraisal.report. In view of the substantial increase in cost, AVDA
after coirsultation with IDA asked the consultants to work out an alterna-
tive plan for a modified and lowers cost project.  The- onsultants proposed
a gradual development of the Amlbara area ba6ed on pump irrigation.  This
proposal deviated from the original plan, thus requiring a revision of
development stratlegy. 'It was therefore considered advisable to examine the
various alternati' s of project implementation and to identify the best of
the axteraatives.   An IDA mission visited Ethiopia in February 1975 to
review\the status of the project and dekermine the best means 9f develop-
ment under the changed conditions.  The principal advantages bof pun ng
development were the comparative lower initial cdst'and the opportunity to
phase investment and dev*lopment to adjust to thk capabilities of the bor-
rower to imnlement the project.   The lbwer initial cost of 'the pumping.
7                                       



scheme, however, would  e o*fset by the higher aupual operating costs - and
the' difficulttes in pump maintenance thus impairing the reliability of
lrrigatioib supplies and crop yields.  The mission was of the view that a
gravity pian with, less elaborate designs would be feasible, subject "to
completion of furthqr studies by the consultants.  Discussions with Govern-
ment and the completion of\ further studies by the consultants confirmed
these' views and IDA carried \out a reappraisal of the project in January/-
Febru4ry 1976 in order to fully evaluate the latest proposal (paras 2.09
and 2.13).,
The Proiect
2.07    -The revised Project was developed out of the above reappraisal and
the project as implemented' in many respects remained similar to the o;igi-
nal Project in that it provide# for the irrigated development of osme
10,000 ha. However, the overall technical design of the Project was signi-
ficantly changed at the reappraisal.   The original high cQst* diversion
structure (a gated barrage),  ihlch was to be constructed En the Awash River
at- a location upstream of Melka-Warer,' was replaced by a, low rockfill
diversion weir at a\ site upstream of the Helka-Sadi area at a narrow point
in the river. The relkcation of the diversion structure allowed the inclu-
sion of the Melka-Spdi area in 'the gravity irrigation- scheme. The reloca-
tion of the weir, however, necessitated a substantial change in the layout
and design of the irrigation works.i 
2.08     The economies \in initial inv\estment cost were\ realized through
design modifications by diverting irri4ation flows by iaeans of a rockfill
weir rather than a gated barrage thereby decreasing control over river
flows and levels and, increasing the degre' of gate control required at the'
headworks.   This woaild result in compromising to an extent on siltation
measures and increasin3 canAl operating and maintenance requirements by
proviling lesser control on silt entering the canal  system (para. 3.08).

grazing areas on the Alledeghi Plains, some office and staff housing faci-
lities for AVRA and bush clearing on about 2,000 ha.  The cost of the\
revised, Amibara 'project (Para. 2.13) includes the expenditure of USS 1.8
million'for the above works.
Orgazan tion aQd Management
2.11     The Project was implemented by a\special implementation unit, the
Amibara Irrigation Project Unit \(AIP Unit)"which was established with-in the
initial implementation agency, the Awash Valley Development Agency (AVDA).
With the subsequent disso.ution of AVDA; the AIP Unit was placed under the
t;hen newly created Water\ Resources Development Authority (VRDA) in the
National Water Resordes  Commission  (NWRC).    The AIP Unit  "emained
responsib.e for all aspects of project implementation. an4 maagement.
After the completion and ;ommissioning of the Project in 1084; AIP Was
dissoived, and it; responsibilities for Project operati$n and maintenance
(O&M) were transferred to the Project Control Ceiter I(PCC) within VWRA
which continues to servict the comlqted Project.  The responsibility f6r
agricultural operations on' state fardms rested with the Ministry of State
Farms Dev. (HSFD) through its subsidiary agencies--MAAE (P4ra. 6.05a).
Enviromaental anad ealth
2.12    \It was realized that environmental cganges would be introduced by
the Project and these would have both positive and negative aspects.  The,
Project included steps to monitoi environmental and health hazards and to\
institute measures to mitigate against water borne diseases, the area being
,endemic in schistosomiasis and 'alaria (see Para. 3.12).\
Protect Costs and Financing
2.13     the toaal co0st of the revised Project' (exslusive of duties and
taxes), was estimat9d at Birr '117'6 million (US$50,.8 million ) with a



'-6-
foreign exchange component df Birr 62.8 million (US$30.3 million) repre-
senting 53 percent of total estimated.cost. (Annex B, Table 1).
2.14\    The\\cost estimates included  physical contingencies averaging 15
percent on all items and annual price \contingencies varying between 13
percent to 5 percent per annum for civik works and 9 percent to 7 percent
f r equipment, machinery and supplies.  The construction schedule assumed
cdppleting the program in seven years with construction btginning late
ib77.  On this basis, the SAR e'6timates,assumed civil works inflation at Z2
percent for 1977 to 1979 and 10 percent from 1980\onwards.
2.15     The financing package for the revised Project was'as follows: \

Protect Start 7p
3.01     DCA and Ptoject Agreement (Cr. 707 ET) was signed on November 7,
1977 and after a further delay of two months by the government to complete
formalities, the Credit was made effectivq on April 7, 1978. -
3.02     The construction work \on the Project started in mid-1978 and the
Project was subv'-ntially completed by December 1985,31   although the
d sbursement  f tdnds lagged behind due to contractual and procedural
:tters .as well as on claims needing time for decisions. 7Eighty-eight
percent (88 percent) of the credit was disbursed by September 39, 1986.
ontraet Management and Procurement
3.03     A  review of the  local -contractors capabil ties prior t6  the
Project implem*itation indicated the need to split the work into contracts
of manageable sizes.  The contrects were accordingly divided into three (3)
group,s
Series 1 Contracts     Prxinminavy- oks -
Seriei 2 Contracts  - Main Civil WVrk-
Series 4 Contracts  - Housing and Buildings  ,.
Eleven contracts were amarded in the abbve three categoreis.  The details
of contracts with the c6mmencement/completion dates and actual completion
costs are shown in Annex C.
3.04     The contracts werc all proc'4ted under competitive,tendering. The
series 2 and 4 contracts were advertised outside Ethiopia under ICB.  The
procurements followed IDA/Bank guidelines for IDA financed tontFacts and
the requi'ments of other fun:ing agencies for their respective contracts.
It *is relevant to observe \thae no serious interest was shown by overseas
contractors and thus tender submissions were Xonfined to domes ic companies
\and the major works contracts were won by three companies.           N.

any significant way, by the t$me of PCR preparation.  This is not strictly
a Project component pet se since its aecessity and pace of dtvetopment has
to be continuously evaluated for( phased 'development under Government
financing.   However, to assist in tie development of grat4ng area, ten
diesel pumping units were protured under IDA credit.   PDRE -in late 1987
started with the construction 'of first phase of the Alternative Grazing
Area comprising 1,001) ha which was scheduled'to be com4ssioned by end of
1988.  The progress on the development of grazing area has remained slow
and unsatisfactory (see Para. 3.11 for elaboration).
Rulementation Delay and Causes Thereof
3.06     Project completion-was scheduled in seven years with the construc-
tion beginning late 1977. \ However the c 4struction started mid 1978.
Whereas the major works were substantially constructed by end of  .984, the
Project was completed about one and a'half years late. The main dauses of
delay weres unrest of the indigenous Afar population which resulted in
delayed start of some contradts and interference by Afar during execution;
shorta$es of local materials, particularly cement, reinforcing steel and
sawn timber, -an) consequential delays in their importations, custom Vlea-
rance, and delayed issue of drawings after -amendments. Extension of'time
was also necessitate in-respect of additional works con*idered appropriate
on-technical groundslas a res'alt of reviews carried out' during the stages
of implementation.   The additional, work  includeds the Amibara western
dyke, services to the state farms headquarters, the extension of primary
drain to the -river instead of terminating it upstream of the Billen Swamip
(a decision influenced by the affects\of 1981 floods);  dditional screens'
at the headworks and modification of the intake structuTe to prevent the
interruption of flow due to the ingress of debris and trash during floods;
works  fok alleviating  siltation,  additional --,buildings 'at  the 'Project
Control Center, continuation of gravityi'system of canals serving the Melka
Werer Research Station (300 ha); an increase"in length of 1,500 m for the
Melka kadi Airstrip and construction ef a pilot dr*inage scheme.\ Reviewing
the Cau8se -o - dais? -and - giving doe consideration to \\he constructions of
above additional works, a delay in completion b  one and a half years with
modest cost- qver"un, is xeparded a satisfactory execution and it 4tAnds as -   -

Settlement of Afar Pastoralists
3-iCO(a) The rapid ince<ease in the are's brought under latre farms since
_\165, utiliziaig watrs of the Awash river for irrigation of the
valley lands, started showing serious impact upon the *vailability
of dry season grazing for the indigenous Afar herdsmen.\  The
control of\ flooding following the establishment of Roka Dam in the
upper vallEy has adversely affected vegetation regenerations and
with the wstablishment' of major. irrigated -agricultural schemes -: =
along the Awash Valley (including the Amibara Irrigatioi. Project -         6

AIP)  have  resulted  in  exdising  large areas  from  dry  season
reserves thiS reducing grazing availability to the Afar herdsien
for their lLyestock.> 
(b)  Being aware of the above situation and tealizing t at Alledeghi
Plains could not be used by pastoralists' during the dry, season
-because of the total lack of water sources to supply either human
or livestock water needs,  action was taken in the very early
stages of the Project development (under Cr 418 ET) to drill eight'
boreholes on the Plain to\provide water and act as' the basis for,
rotatioal grazing of stock.  Relief and'Rehabilitation Comimission
(RRC) has since been operating a farm'of 2,000 h4  based on two of
the eight bore holecI-,. Afar herdsmen have not been able to safely
use the remaining boreholes which are seen by Issa tribesmen 8S
1heing within their sphere of operation.
(c)  The effect oft'the two major influences--agricultural development
and pressures from Issa tribesmen have been to seriously disrupt
Afar pastoralism, 8 balance which had been previously achieved.
This problem had at occasions disrutted construction operations on
AIP "ond resulted also in damage to cotton crops in-the Project
area, with the Afar livestock brought over to cotton fields for
grazingt  It is relevant to point out that while the prbblem is
acutely felt and clearly seen in the vic$nity of AIP farms, it is
not confined to this area alone.'
(d) A\medhanism was incorporated in the Project through which AlP
could play its, part in solvink (or one maygbetter say in retros-,
pect, attomptitg, to solve) the problem in the vicinity of AIP
farms for the pastoralists dislocated from the AlP area' and other
Afars in the vicinity.
The Project therefore included assistance to AVDA for the comple-
tion of its on-going settlement program.  'An area, of #00 4!- ha
(later reduced 'to 560 ha) for the settlement of 'some \320 Afar_
families v    4\developed and laid with gravity irrigation system an4 
the additiOnal area\ (4,440 ha) already under pump irrigation waj
converted? to gravity'dystem on the settlement farm.  The intentioh
was to settle the dislocated Afar people by involving thom in
cotton and food crop production and simultane4usly to provide an
area of land for the co6munal gfazing of tteir livestock.
Uhile the SAR placed a great-promise and hope in this approach, it
did not tu7rn out to be successful.  Aftek i6akng a slow start by
-soae Afar families in the early stage of the scheme to cove&iom'\-
400 ha under crops, the Afar herdsmen with semi-nomadic lift qtyte -.

eonsidiered -to cover an areaof 1,200 'hbL._To this a *urther 800 ha were
to be added to make,.a total of 2,00b ha for- the settlement scheme
However,  -when surveyed properly, the exist'ing area turne4#out to be
1,440 ha and to maintain overall -total of .2,000 ha, the'\800.\ha W#s
reduced to 560 ha.' Final figure for existing RCC Settlement Fam wim    h

abandoned the area, sho~ing nio interest in cziop production'on the
settleme,t  scheme  (2,000 ha).  'The, experDient  in so- fal  it
concerns settling t,hem and involving them in crop production
remained *S failure.  The state farms took over so*e 1,000 ha' of
thew\settlement farm for cotton production.
(e)  Seized vith the situation and to meet forage needs for the Afar,
PDRE decided to developed  3,000 ha under  irrigated pastures.
located in an 'area of suitable soils and topography in Angele4e-
area (situated downstream of AIP).  Funds under IDA credit were
used to acquire ten diesel pumping units for the grazing area.
*     The construction on Phase I (;,000 ha) started in 1987 under
Government financing btt its progress, unfortunakely, remained
slowi   Phase I was scheduled for completion ending 1987, then
rev'ised for'completion'by end of 1988. As noted at the time bf
writing of this PCR- even the first 500 ha are not likely to be
available by end of 1988.   The reason for this unsatisf64tory
pro8res could be a combination of lack of priority for such
dev#lopment within the minds of the authorities and limited imple-
mentation capability\by the co=struction enterprise.  The,pabture
operations come undet  the mangement of MOA but O&M of water
delivery system including pumps and canals etc., will be the
responsib4lity of PCC (WRDA).
(f) The problem of resettlement of Afars occur -tt4roughout the middle
valley and is likely to increase as further agricultural develop-
ment takes place-   The problem' will surely eontinue for any
follow-up pfoject such as the proposed Angelele-Bolhamo Project.
A solution to the problem requires a coordinated action consider-
ing the social eleuents, habits and the lifestyle of nomadic pas-
toralists.   It ca4ls for' concerted efforts on the part of the
authorities with greater, seriousness and on a wider spectrum for,
the welfare and settleient'of the Afar h"rdsmen. An indepth study,
in this respect is required in the context of expanding any futpire
irrigatV.on development in the valley.
Erivironmental and Wealth Measures
3.11     T4e Project area\is endemic in-urinary schistosomiasis  (bilhir-
zia) and malaria..  Monitoring under the Project has continued for measures
against water borne diseases.  A-monitoring system has been developed; to
assess changes in water quality and prevalence qf malaria and schisteso-
--miasis on a contin=ed basis in order -to take timvly m'easures on detection
of adverse situations. ThA Health and Environmental Planning Department of
RDA and Environmental-Health Unit in Amibara collaborated their 'activities
in this respect.                 '
3.12     The construction of the Amibara Irrigation' Projert brought about
*ignificant ecol giqsI.changes to the area. With the construction of dikes
and d ains, from MHela idi down to Dahitele, flood fed swamps dried up"
resulting in the destruction of snail habitats thereby bringing about gra-
dual decreose in the incidence of urinary ~bilharztasias. A pstudy conducted
in 1983184 ({ef: Final Repotts. Health and Environmental Impliiations UNDPI-
--  O Feb. 1983) iudicated thst at least within AIP and even up too Dahitele
village, schistosomiasis appeared ti have ceased.    ihereas some of the

above environmental -changes turned out to be beneficial in reducing the
schistosomiasis, other conditions were created by the irrigation scheme for
th5, propagation of related vector bcrne diseases as well as malaria.  Awash
vatley below Koka Dagp is endemic in malaria and the site is included in the
plan of action of the National Malaria  Control Program (MCP) and 'rotected
through the MCP routine activities. The incidence of malaria has increased
with changing emphasis on malaria control rather than malaria eradication.
Tht environmental and health services need strengthening to provide ade-
quate surveillance and control in the post-construction era.  The present
strength 'consisting of a Senior Sanitarian and two 'assistants is inade-
quate.
Project Costs
3.13     Actual Project costs at completion (Annex B, Table 2-3) amount to
us$ 65.8 million (Birr 136.3 million) compared to the SAR Project cost
estimates of US$ 56.8 million (Birr 117.6 million) exclusive of custom
duties and 'taxes. The cost overrun above the &AR estimates comes to 16
percent which;,. is modest and within the acceptable range considering the
nature of the project, adffitional works undertaken and the span (seven
years) of construction actiyities. The cost overrun is attributed largely
tot a)\ additional works carried out (Para. '3.07) which were -considered
necessary on 'technical grounds; b) purchases of additional farm machineryl-
equipment  in the context of-production by state-managed farms; and c) cost
increasew as a r4sult of.delays caused by non-availability\of materials and
events beyond t#e control of contractors.  To meet,the situation, materials
were imported .~which resulted in increwsing t proportion of foreign
excbange component in .the Project.  The operation and maintenance  xO&M)
cost*_\of-the irrigation system were much higher than those estimated at the
appraisal.  The standard of maintenance at the Project has remaited good
pad other than some over,,staffing at PCC, the cost increases in'the O&M
activities resulted from heavy desilting/dredging operations to maintain
tle irrigation network, as -a result of silt loads being washed into the
-dl.ttibution system, far exceeding the appraital-estimate.s,
Disb rsement and Closing
3.14     The original closing dat- was extended by 1- 12 years until,
March A1, 1987., However disbursements were allowed for further nine ponths
beyond the closiing date to permit the supply/importation of essential 0 t
equipment Ponmitted before March 31, 1987. .'The credit' stood disbursed 89
percent by karc '31, 1987 and 97 percent,by Dec.-31,1987.  A total of US$
0.67M- being the undisbursed balance under the IDA Credit was cancelled on
Jan. 19, 1988. (Annex-F)

V. FtNANCMAL AND ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
\ Costs
5.01 \. Actual project investment 'cost at completion amount to US$ 65.8
million (Birr 136.3'\millior~) compared to the SARf estimates of US$ 56.8
mAllion (Birr 117.6 million)t. as further elaborated under para. 3.14.
Benefits,
F.02     Cotton prQduction constituted the main benefit frdm the Project.
Sew lands (7,244 ha) Vere brought under irrigated cotton production and
ekisting area ($,056 ha) which was irrigated using pumps, prior to AXP, was
conrerte4 to gravity irrigatio3*.  By 1985, total cotton area expanded to
10,300 ha.\ In the first year of production (1480) the Project recorded the
highest cotton yield of 43.8 'quintals per ha.  The high initial yield was
partly due to the natural fertility of the virgin lane as well as the
re&ults of management of a smaller area and 'could hardly be taken as repre-
sentative.   In the course of subsequent years, the yields dropped (27.5
qlha in 1983) and in s91bsequent -years, through better management and agro-
nomical practices, yiel4s incre4sed to 35 q1ha and remained at 'this level
throughqut the Project period.   Increment;al cotton production in the
Project irea ranged between 12,000'quintals in 1980 and 212,000 quintalsin
1986 with a peak production of 256,000 quintals in 1984.  Other Project
benefits include production of wheat (still regarded agronomically at eXpe-
rimental stage),\ haricot beans atid. broom sorghum which were introduced as
second.crops after-harvesting cotton br as rotation crops. In'addition to
increased crop production, the Project improved the environment by draining
nd treating swamps and depresstons with improvement in biLharzia inci-
Knces amongst the rural population in and aroutd the Project area.  The
project also created\employment for underemployed labor from the highlands.
The, labor migrated to the Project area to pick cotton seasqnally.  Though
it was not possible to estimate the number of Reople benefitting frkm\'the
project, the annual labor' requirement for field operat\ionFs amount tQ &bout
five million mandays. a
1inanEia1 Performance
u S.03.    The P oject produced seed cotton on state fargs which were cen-
trally managed by the Minist4  of State Farpa through MAAE (Para. 6.05),.
The management of state *farms participated 'jointly in the scheduling of
irrigation, water which was crucial to the production of cotton.   State
Farms financial perfo6vce improved from a loss of Birr i.6 million in
1980 to a profit of"Birr 12.3 million ip 1986.  The improvement'was- rought
about by hib \cotton 'yiel4'I and lower' overhead costs with a larger area
coming under production.   The"t  profits however do not account for the
element of a subsidy,towards water charges that have accruied to state farms
sice no water charges. were collected (Para. 6.07)'.  Annex E, Table 1
*sumnarizes the financial' performance of state 'farms. The Government fIxed
'farmgate prices' or seed cotton at Birr 1.10 per kg for five years bet;ien
1980 and 1985.  In the following year, prices' werer increased to Birr'1.28

per kg, which were much higher than world\ market prices.   According to
WorJld Bank commodity prices, world market p\Vices for cotton dropped from
Birr 1.30 per kg equivalent of seed cotton to Birr 0.69 per kg between 1980
and 1986.   Therefore if farm gate prices for seed cotton were fifed at
export parity prices, state farms would have made 1osses.   The economic
analysis (Para. 5.04) has been worked out on the basis of import parity
prices, the cotton production from AIP having been donsumed domestically.
Economice;nalYsis 
5.04     Only incremental cottoni production and fuel saviigs on pumps were
included -in the economic 'analysis because wheat, haricot beans and broqm
sorghum production was taken as negligible.  Cotton production ascribed tbo
the project was valued using 1986 constant prices based on World Bank com-
modity price projections which were tevised and  iss:ed in January ':19,8.
The uZport parity price was adjusted tor local handling and transport*  All
actual coits were inclided in the analysis after adjusting for local duties
and taxes on imported items. Local costs were adjustedc by a factor of 0.52
to convert them to. border prices.   During, the remaining life of the
Project, conservative estimates of cotton production were used in the ana-
lysis.  It was assum4ed that the cropped area would be 7,200 ha with auh
average yield of 33 quintals of seed cotton per ha. During t14s period,
constant cotton production co,sts,'and oper4tion and maintenakce costs of the
irrigation system were assumed. Based on the above assumptions, the econo-
mic rate of return of the Prqject' was estimated to be 15.3 percent,
(Annex.E, Table 7). Despite the ihigh cotton yields, the Project attained a
relatively modeste rate of return mainly because of the low prices for iot-
top and higp costs of production, operation and maintenailce of the irriga-
tion system. Assump ions underlying tht economic analysis *sre as follows:
(a)  Economic costs were derived from phased actual costs during imple-
mentation after adjusting for duties, taxes and price contingen-
cies and were expressed at constant I'~86 prices. .
(b) Recurrent costs after Project complftion were maintained at\ the
level of 1987. On-farm production costs were based on state farm
estimates prepared on a per hectare actual cost, exc;uding those
of 1982183 which were incomplete in their bieakdowvi (Annex-E,
Table 2).
(c) All local costs were converted to border prices by using a stan-
dard conversion factor of 0.52 derived from the ratio of the offi-
cial exchange rate to shadow rate, Birr 2.07:4.0 to one. dollar;
and             \
(d)  The economic life of the \Project was .Assumed tio be S  years
because the bulk of the investment (irrigation system) 14s a long
life.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL P R         EO AD DEVELOPMENT
6.01 \  GOSE by its Proclamation 118 of 197t, established the Valleys
Agricultural Development Authority (VADA) with the jurisdiction over all
yalleys development and the objective to coordinate, regulate and supervise

\~- 16 -.                       
agricultural development and utilization of land and water resources in the
river valleys.   Although.VADA had jurisd4ction over all river basins, a
specialized  agency,  the  Awash  Valley  bevelopment  Agency \(AVDA)  was
estab"ished simultaneously with the creation of VADA. Du'king the period of
development of the Amibara Irrigation Project, a special unit, the Amibara
Irrigation Project Unit\ (AIP) was established within AVDA, .(the initial
implementation agency t ed in the DCA and Project Agreement) which was
subsequently superseded\by the Water Resources Development Authority (WDA)
and made responsible to the National Water Resources Commission (NWRC)
created in 1981.   '
6.02     it is relevant to note that throughout these changes, the execut-
Ing office for the Project .(AIP unit) reiained consistent in 'staff and
zesponsibllities for all -aspec's of 0te. Project implementatioit.  AlAP?s

6.03     AIP remained responsible for the Project implementation and mana-
gement till its commissioning in 1984. Thereafter it was dissolved and its
limited responsitilities towards operation and maintenance of the completed
Project were transferred to Prtject Control Center (PCC) within WRDA.  PCC
continues to-date to perform effectively, iti\O&M functions for the irriga-
tion and drainage works,: down to secondary canal system and to ensure water
delivery at the Project.  The on-farm respdnsaibilities fo\r all agricultural

opment Corporation (AADC), which is one of the many Corporations under the
Mihistry of State Farms Development (MSFD).
6.04     The above 6rganizational changes, reduced to "some extent the
ef4ctiveness of cont4nuyty-in planning and deci'sion making.  The \regrRup-
ing of operating agencies. coupled with other organizationsa \NifficultUs
and slow pace, experienced at initial stages with the borrower, were linked
in part to the non-availability of qualified technical and managerial per-
sonnel for the various positions as well as. problems created by the Afft
settlers.    Despite  these  limitations,  the  Project  was  successfully
implemented with the completion of all major w4rks wi hout undue delays,
and giving -yiel4s egenerally better than estimated at the appraisal.6/

6.05     Performance of State Farms .nterPrisj
(a) Middle Awash Agricultural Enterprise (MAAE) was established in
early 1980 within AADC, to be a body responsible for running tte
.state farms. This entity (HAAE)'bas remained responsible for crop
production on the incremental aiea'of AIP (7244 ha).  The finan-
ciaX performance of the, state farms.-organization has b¶en less
cost effestive than anticipated. at the appraisal.   The cost of
production for seed cotton at the appraisal was estimated at Birr
1,035/ha including cost of labor for various operations and all
other inputs.-  The ac tual production co8t~on state-managed farms
bas been higher, some Birr 1.800ha' (Annex E, Tabl* 2).  This is
ittributed to excessive, overheads and operating .atjlessert.han
destired efficiency.   This situation, in addition to low cotton
prices,' has contributed ln depressing the ERR es'pite good cotton
yields.      '          
(b)  Shortage of spare parts due to non-availabilIty of fundslfireign
exchange resulted in lack of repairs' to tractors, vehicles and
equipment at the state farm, reaching at occasions serious propor-
tions, with some equipment lying unused.  (The shortage of spare
parts also affected the operations of PCC, though to a lesser
degree.)
(c)  Shortage of labor at the time of cotton picking in 1986 and 1987
seasons resulted in lost production and alto aftected the quality
of cotton.\ IDA expressed caution to PDRE on their suggested
alternative of mechanical picking, which in IDA's view would add
to the spares and repairs problems on the one hand and lowr the
quality of cotton on the\other hand. MAAE cultivated\or haivesti4
a smaller area thhim actu4ly available for production,' due to th*
labor situation.  This reduced overall productivity of the Project
and further depressed the returns.
Performance of Contractois and Consultants
6.06(a)  The three contractors performed differently, constructed the wotks
\io good standards and at reasonable speed Oven that some of the
difficulties which they had to cope with (Para. 3.07) were beyond
their control  In this context, two contractors performed satis-
factorily and one was regarded as having performed poorly.
(b)  The participating contractors had no previous experience in irri-
gat on works of this' magnitude and gai-ined valuable experience.
This contributed to the. expertise and\ equipment resource i \the
Ethiopian construction industry.                    \
(c)  Consultantss  The engagement-of consultants from the early'stages\
of i"s planning (i973)' proved qst -helpful in project-execution.
\The donstMltants; were. responsible for all Project design work,
\supervision durihg construction and contract management, as well
as for provisions of technical assistance and,pstudies for follow-.
up projects (including study and design of futuire btainage Master
Plan for subsurface drainage progra*).- Advice and assistance in
agriculture and f4rm management was \provided by a technical ser-



vices team, comprising tte consultants working with Ethiopitan
staff from       hd ai  state farms operating authority--MAAE.
The consultants' performance has been impressive antd they rendered
sound technical services in design, project management and train-
ing'to Ethiopian professional lsnd sub-professional staff.  Local
training programs including sem$nars, workshops etc. were organiz-   'V
ed by the consultants aimed at achieving common understanding of
construction and O&M of irrigatinystem.\
The troject monitoring reports  (Para.\ 3.161 w"re accurate, in

covehants except the tollowings
(a)' Borrower's failure to construct O&M workshop buil4dng for servic-.
ing heavy eartbmoving equipment, despite unquestionable need for
such a workshop, repeated emphasis by IDA through' supervision.
missions and correspondence, as well as availability of funds.
This was due to organizationalladministrative problems, conflicts
an$ bickerings between VRDA and Ministry of State Farmi, and the
resulting indecision (See para. 7.03(a)). \
sb) Non-conpliance to introduce and 4pllect water charges \despite
explicit provisions in the Project Agreement (clause 3.02) and
repeated emphasis by IDA supervision missions and follow-up-cor-
espondence from HQTS.  The subject of water charges in Ethiopia
is seen as a' larger policy issue not confined to AIP alone and
remains linked to socio/political system and the poXicies being
adopted\by the PDRE and its concept of production through state
farms.
(c)  Delayed construction of irrigattd grazing= area (as noted under
para. 3.06).

of the technical issues and qbjectives as\well as foresight into the anti-'

ed, generally meeting the anticipated time frame.  The Project at comple-
tion regiater*d a cost overrun of 16 percent,:which t considered modest in
view of additional works undertaken during implementation (Para. 3.07)3
8.02     The Project fully met its agricultural ow ectives, producing \seed
cotton average 3.3 tonslha on the newly developed a ea (7,250 \a) on State-
managed fames and exceeding the SAR estimates.  The Pkoject continues qp
provide around 25,000 tons of seed cotton annually and has made important
contribution to the c utry's economy in supplying the domestic demand and
conserving.valuable foreign exchange through import.  stitution.
8.03k    The cost of production under, state farms has been higher than
envi~aged at the apXprOisal and makes state farms less suited as institu-
tions for agric4tural produ tion in the long run.  For the last. three
. years running, sIzeable quantities of- seed cotton (exact figure not, avai-
lable but indication are.in a range of 10-15 percent of total product.ion)

V      8.04     The ERR for the completed Project comes to 15.3 percent (Para.
I5.04), based on import parity prices, despite constant,high cotton yields.
\,The modest ER (though higher than the appraiVal estimate of 13 percent) is
attributeble largely to depressed international cotton prices; but the cost
elements discussed in paras 8.03 and higher\O&M (Para. 3.14) have contri-
buted, their share as Hwel.  Higher-value crops need to be added in the crop
rotation to increase, ceopping intensity and productivity of similar

8.07     The approach adopted in the SAR for the resettlement component
aimed at -settling -the  displaced' Afar #trdsmen to grow crops on the
resettlement scem_  was unsuccessful.  A long-term solution to the problem
is yet to be evolved. The problem of settlement of Afars occurs throughout
the valley and is likely to increase as further agricultural development
takes plac4.  It calls for indepth study before undertaking turther large
scale irrigated agricultural projects in the'va4ley. The planned pr vision
of 3,000 ha altkrnative grazing area (unfortunately Government  Iemns
extremely slow  n\ its development at the time of writing of this PCR and
even the first 500 ha are not likely to be available by end of 1988) is
considered a step In the right direction though not yet tested.   The
performance and impact of the grazing area development in its first phase
sh,old be evaluated before 3,Q00 ha are,fully cfMitted.

Para.6.01     6th line:-    ... the Awash Valley Development Agency and
not the Awash Valley Development Authorityo
It is worth notin4 that "he government has strengthened 32 km.
length of the western dyke,to safe-4ard previous developed lands
in the Middle Awash from its own financial resources.
On-gding Problems
lnmreasing silt load brought about by the ;iver:-
a)  is blocking the intake
b) fis forcing the maintenance crew to desilt twice per year
thre canal systems.
c)  that deposition has filled the upper and the lo er reaches
of the diversion site.
-  The ntn-availbility of spaie parts for those plants which have
beentendering services for more-than 10 years (b ,ughtt-ttnm
'Japan) created difficulty in the removal of silt load\.
- \The river channel volume is filled so fast with debris, that
,over bank flopd flows are endangering the dykes.
-  Budgetary allocation is very strictly administrated under government
regulations and vefy often we are unable to carry out daily activi-
ties on time.  Oh account of this:-
a)  failure is seen in river training works v
b)  strengthening dyke and rwad notworks is hampered; and
\~~~~~
c)  Maintenance of gates and relevant structures vertually
stopped.
Solution to the Probl m
-  Improvement of the headworks and provision of setteling basin.
-  Resume afforestatioA and soil concervation practices in the
upper r\eacheslof the basin.
-  Governmental Officials must be approached by WRDA Authorities to
relax the t  djatry tightness on Project Control Centre actiIties.
