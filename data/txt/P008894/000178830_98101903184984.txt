PROPOSED LOiANT TO
TURiCEYY ELEKTTIK KU,UMU
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
1.      I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US $24 million to Turkiye
Elektrik Kurumu, to be guaranteed by the Republic of Turkey, for a power
transmission project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.      Turkiye Elektrik Kurumu or Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK) has
requested Bank assistance for expanding its power system. The proposed loan
would be the first for the newly established TEK, although the Bank has made
one loan (568-TU) to Turkey for Etibank, TEK's predecessor, which was one of
five previous operations for power in Turkey, the others being to the con-
cessionar-y private company serving the Cukurova area. In addition, in 1965
the Bank made a technical assistance grant of $1.95 million for the reorgani-
zation of the power sector in Turkey.
3.      The project was appraised in October 1970 with a follow-up mission
in March 1971.  Negotiations with representatives of the Government and TEK
took place in Washington during May 5 - 11, 1971.  The Government was repre-
sented by Mr. Ahmet Tufan Gul, Chief Counselor of the Turkish Embassy. TEK
was represented by Mr. Tekinel, Assistant General Manager and Mrs. Baykal,
Director of Planning.
4.      A summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments to
Turkey as at April 30, 1971 is at Annex I. For comments on the execution of
the projects, as well as for the other operations under consideration and IFC's
activities in Turkey, reference is made to the President's Report and Recom-
mendation on an education project, dated May 7, 1971 (P-930). Since that re-
port was prepared, the Bank has been informed that the main contractor for
the Keban Transmission Project (Loan 568-TU) has not resumed work after the
winter construction hiatus since he has not reached agreement with TEX on a
revision in the prices stipulated in the original contract. TEK is current'ly
attempting to resolve this dispute.

PART III - TIH PROJECT
6.     A report entitled "'Turkey - Appraisal of a Transmission Project of the
Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK)"t (PU-69a, dated May 28, 1971) is attached.
7.     Demand for electrical energy in Turkey has been increasing at an annual
rate of about 11 percent over the past ten years, and about the same average
rate of gro%Tth is expected for the next ten years.  Expension of the power
sector has involved, on the one hand, changes in organization culminating in
the creation in October 1970 of a national electricity authority, Turkiye
Elektrik Kurumu (TEK), and on the othe;^ hand, physical development character-
ized by the establishment of a national grid for power transmission and ex-
ploitation of the country's hydroelectric resources. At present industry
accounts for about 70 percent of total powier consumption and is expected to
stay at about that figure despite the emphasis on connection of villages
and other domestic and commercial loads. Per capita consumption of electric
energy is 210 k14h/year.
8.     The installed capacity of generating plant in Turkey at the end of
1970 was 1985 DRN, consisting of 1718 NLW in systems operated by TEK, 154 MN in
Cukurova's system and 113 NV in small, isolated installations.  In addition,
private self-generation, mostly industrial, totals about 300 MW.
9.     Until recently Etibank, a State Economic Enterprise established in
1935, had the overall responsibility for the electric power sector in Turkey,
in addition to its important interests in mining and banking, but as early
as January 1966, the Bank and the Government had reached agreement on the
manner in which the basic structure of the power sector should be reorganized,
including the establishment by legislation of a national electricity author-
ity. To this end the Bank had made in 1965 a technical assistance grant of
$1.95 million to cover the foreign exchange cost of studies associated with
the reorganization of the power sector in Turkey (ef Memorandum Sec M70-252,
dated June 1, 1970 to the Executive Directors).  The work is well under way,
and about $1 million has been spent or committed. The first stage of the



work - a study on accounting and engineering training - has been completed.
The second stage, -implementing the accounting reccmenda;tiofle, is under way
anid arrangements for t.k, third phasc covering or-,gpnizetional i-nd operational
matters, itnluding village electrifcetion, arc In progress. It is eVected
that Tl i:ill enter into a contract uxth. Electricit.^ de France for this last
phase.
10.    The law creating TEK was passed in the Turkish National Assembly on
June 25, 1970 and became effective on October 25, 1970.  The power group of
Etibank forms the nucleus of the new TEK organization which now also oTns and
operates the hydroelectric stations, formerly owned by the State Hydraulic
Works (DSI). TEK is now responsible for the centralized dispatch of power,
for planning and coordination of co#struction programs, and management of
the power systems in accordance with sound commercial, industrie1, and accounta
practices.
11.    TEK owns and operates several systems.  The most important one, known
as the interconnected system, supplies the western and central parts of the
country from which over 90 percent pf Turkey's elpetrical demand originates;
this system comprises 1,640 Ml of generating plant,and about 5,300 km of
154 kv transmission lines.  Other systems are very small, with installed
capacities of under 20 MW each. When the takeover from DSI and Etibank is
ccmplete, TEK will own 583 1W of hydroelectric generating plants and 753 Mg
of modern thermal plant burning coal, lignite and fuel oil. It will also
own and operate most of the 382 MW of generating plant on 'consumers' (mostly
municipalities) networks forming part of the interconnected system. Taese
plants will gradually be replaced by larger and more efficient stations
built and operated by TEK.
12.    During the period 1971-77 TEK envisages investments of about $1.3
billion excluding distribution and village electrification which may require
an additional $250 million. The present project, which substantially corre-
sponds to TEK's transmission construction program for 1971-74, carries the
development of the national grid a stage further by the construction of
various links and additions which unite or strengthen existing installations.
The main items of the project are 380 kv and 154 kv substations, 154 kv trans-
mission lines, 30 kv transformers, and low-voltage capacitators with a total
cost of about $65 million, including a foreign exchange component of $26 mil-
lion. All imported materials required for the project would be financed
from the Bank loan with the exception of steel for transmission towers and
medium voltage transformers for which finarce has been arranged from bilater-
al sources; these would cost about $4 million. $2 million has been in-
cluded in the Bank loan for interest during construction.
13.    TEK's tariffs, which are applied to its 1500 customers, mostly muni-
cipal authorities or private companies responsible for distribution and large
industrial plants, averaged US $0.01 per Kwh (at the current exchange rate)
since March 1, 1967, when its tariffs were raised by about 45 percent.  No
further adjustments in tariffs have been introduced although substantial in-
creases would have been required to compensate for the inflationary rise in
costs prior to the August 1970 devaluation as well as for price rises because
of the devaluation (e.g. a 45 percent increase in fuel oil costs and higher
construction expenditures and depreciation charges) and to reflect the re-
valuation of the assets taken over by TEK at the time of its creation.



-14 -
1I.    For lack of an increase in tariffs in 1970 the return on 7tibarl^'s
power assets taken over by TEK (5.4 percent) fell short of the 8 percent to
be earned as from January 1, 1970, in accordance wmith the provisions of Loan
568-TU. The Government, which confirmed during negotiations its agreement
to the 8 percent return (which is also a requirement of the TEK law), is
currently considering a range of alternative proposals presented by TEK to
achieve this result, all providing for a tariff increase in excess of 50
percent. The introduction of a tariff increase agreed upon by the Bank is
a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan. The debt service has to
be covered at least 1.5 times.
15.    Materials and equipment financed from the proposed loan would be
purchased through international competitive bidding. Local manufacturers,
principally of conductors and small transformers, would be allowed a 15 per-
cent preference in bid comparison or the import duty, whichever is lower.
The Bakc will disburse the full foreign exchange cost of construction ser-
vices (chiefly the erection of steel towers), and either the total CIF cost
of equipment or, should local manufacturers be awarded contracts, the full
ex-factory cost.  The small amount of local expenditure financing which
might be involved, i.e. up to about $1.5 million, would be justified in the
case of Turkey.
PART IV - THE ECONCM-Y
16.    A report entitled "The Development Prospects of Turkey(' (ETA-30a,
dated February 1, 1971) which was recently distributed to the Executive
Directors, described Turkey's economic performance and appraised the
country's prospects. Reference is elso made to Part V of the President's
Report on an education project, dated -.Tay 7, 1971 (P-930) which updated
the findings of the economic report. A basic data sheet is at Annex II.
17.    If Turkey is to maintain a growth rate of about 7 percent, its needs
for external assistance are likely to be considerable. Debt service obli-
gations in 1970 were about 19 percent of foreign exchange earnings, in
spite of the highly concessionary terms of aid in the past. In the future
Turkey may have to accept a gradual hardening of terms. In these circum-
stances, the country's borrowing capacity will have to be kept under con-
tinuing review. Turkey has some margin for borrowing on conventional terms,
but it should seek to obtain as much aid as possible on a concessionary basis.



PART V - L5GAL IIaSTRIMEJTS AND AUTHO:RITY

Kurumu, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Turkey and
the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section
h (iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the text of a re-
solution approving the loan are being distributed separately to the
Executive Directors.   I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECME/NDATIOiT
19.    I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loani.
