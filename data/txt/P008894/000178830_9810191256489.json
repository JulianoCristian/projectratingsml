Physical achievements under the\n            loans were generally satisfactory. While the projects were\n            completed with large time and cost overruns, initial\n            technical problems were encountered and some minor ones\n            persist, both projects were an integral part of TEK's\n            system development and have carried out essential tasks as\n            envisaged. However, the loans also had major institutional\n            and financial objectives; here, the achievements were at\n            best mixed and in certain important ways disappointing. The\n            most disappointing of all was the very limited progress made\n            towards the achievement of the financial objectives as the\n            key objective of placing TEK on a sound financial footing\n            has not been achieved."}, "docdt": "1981-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
