                         The Project has helped the people of Tajikistan, in particular the citizens of Dushanbe and northern mountainous areas, in meeting the winters energy demand. It provided an
                         emergency support that resulted in retained availability of electricity for the populationdespite the number of external shocks in the last few years. The project has also helped to
                         establish a more reliable infrastructure for heat supply in Khudjand, Gissar, Rudaki, and Vahdat benefiting more than 70,000 people.

                         The Project consists of the original project of US$4 million and its Additional Financing of US$11 million. All the activities under the original project as well as the most of activities
