2.      The progress towards achievement of Project Development Objectives (PDO)
continues to be rated `Satisfactory'. The Project has already created immense relief for
the people of Tajikistan, in particular citizens of Dushanbe, in meeting the 2008/09 and
2009/10 winter hardship. It supported better reservoir management resulting in increased
availability of electricity for the population. Completion of the pending rehabilitation
works would contribute to ensuring reliable infrastructure for heat supply in selected
smaller towns. An Additional Financing in amount of US$15 million was approved
earlier in 2010 to ensure timely payments for the electricity supply from Independent
Power Plants (IPPs). This would decrease the risk of power supply interruptions.

3.      Implementation Performance (IP) rating was recently downgraded to 'Moderately
Satisfactory' due to delayed submission of the audit report and insufficient monitoring
and reporting arrangements in Project Management Unit (PMU). However, a specific
action plan to address these deficiencies was recently discussed and agreed with the
Implementing Agency.

The proposed reallocation is necessary to ensure processing of payments under the oil
supply contract in full. The allocated amount under category 4 "Goods under Part 1.A(ii)
of the Project" became insufficient due to exchange rate fluctuations that reduced the
available IDA funds in US Dollars. On August 5, 2010 the Bank has received the letter
from the Ministry of Finance requesting to reallocate the amount of SDR 197,091 from Category
5 to Category 4. However, it is proposed to reallocate the whole current allocation of SDR
213,846 from the Category 5 "Consultant Services and Training under Part 1.B of the Project" to
Category 4 "Goods under Part 1.A (ii) of the Project" in order to cover current commitments
under the oil supply contract. The training and consultancy services needs would be met
from the allocations under the Additional Financing.
