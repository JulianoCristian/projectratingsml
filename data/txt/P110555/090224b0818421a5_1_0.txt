                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project has helped the people of Tajikistan, in particular the citizens of Dushanbe and northern mountainous areas, in meeting the winters energy demand. It provided an
                         emergency support that resulted in retained availability of electricity for the populationdespite the number of external shocks in the last few years. The project has also helped to
                         establish a more reliable infrastructure for heat supply in Khudjand, Gissar, Rudaki, and Vahdat benefiting more than 70,000 people.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         In September 2008, the EERAP was restructured to allow shifting of implementation responsibilities to energy utilities, i.e. OJSC "Barki Tajik" and SUE "TajikGas".
                         In May 2010, a scale-up in the form of additional financing of US$ 15.0 was approved. The additional financing provided for the purchase of electricity to meet part of the demand gap
                         during the winter season. As a result the total financing of the project was increased to US$ 21.5 mln.
                         In December, 2010 the original EERAP was restructured (Level 2 Restructuring) to enable reallocation among the categories to process payments under the oil supply contract.
