                         The development objective of the project is urgently increase the volume and reliability of the national energy supply, especially in the winter season by suppo
                         rting the implementation of the Recipient's Energy Emergency Mitigation Plan (EE                                  MAP).

                          These objectives will be realized through: increasing to the extent possible thermal and heat energy supply from existing assets in the shortest possible timefr
                         ame and initiating institutional and technical measures to increase the amount a                                nd reliability of energy supplied to the population
                         during the next two winter s                                easons. The Bank will also continue to provide technical and policy advice as ne

                         2008/09 and 2009/10 winter hardship. It supported better reservoir managementresulting in increased availability of electricity for the population. Completion of the pending
                         rehabilitation works would contribute to ensure reliable infrastructure for heat supply in selected smaller towns. An Additional Financing in amount of US$15 million was approved
                         earlier in 2010 to ensure timely payments for the electricity supply from Independent Power Plants (IPPs). This would decrease the risk of power supply interruptions.
