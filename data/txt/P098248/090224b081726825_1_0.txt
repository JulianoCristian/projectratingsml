                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The broad development objective of the proposed project is to contribute to strengthening the resilience of local ecosystems and economies to the impacts of glacier
                         retreat in the Tropical Andes, through the implementation of specific pilot adaptation activities that illustrate the costs and benefits of adaptation. The specific objectives
                         of the project, in support of this broad objective, are: a) the effective integration of the implications of glacier retreat into the regional and local planning in glacierized
                         basins; b) the inclusion of glacier retreat impacts in local, sector development projects; and c) generation of data on glacier dynamics.

                         The project has been extended for one year. The current closing date is September 30, 2013.

                         During this period there has been steady progress in the three participating countries:

                         Bolivia. All pieces of equipment have been purchased and delivered. The implementation phase of two irrigation schemes, for Batallas and Palca is expected to begin before end of
                         year. A consultancy to reduce water losses and improve EPSAS's capacity to increase water distribution efficiency is currently being implemented, and has already yielded positive
                         results. Another key consultancy, aimed at identifying water supply options for La Paz and El Alto in the short-medium term to adapt to water shortages caused by climate change,
                         has been contracted, and is being implemented. The glacier inventory is finalized, and, using ALOS satellite images, the inventory of high-mountain lagoons and paramos is currently
                         being conducted. The third pilot project, "Mainstreaming Adaptive River Defence for Huayhuasi & El Palomar Settlements", has been finalized, and a closing workshop took place at
                         the La Paz's Institute of Hydrology and Hydraulics on May 30.
                         If no unexpected situations take place (such as constant, negative weather conditions that would prevent working on irrigation systems), all project investments are expected to be
                         finalized before the end of project closing date.

                         Ecuador. There has been substantial progress in this period. A process for the acquisition of meteorological monitoring equipment is well advanced. A small water supply and
                         sanitation pilot system in Papallacta is expected to begin the construction phase before end of the year. Another key activity, related to paramo conservation and cattle management,
                         is about to begin. The vulnerability assessment study for the Pita basin is ongoing, and its scope has been increased to also include natural protected areas in the Antisana. The
                         design of an activity related to paramo restoration has been finalized.

                         Peru has seen the resignation of its National Technical Expert (the person who coordinated all activities in the country), and this might have created some slight delays. However, a
                         new person has been hired and has started working. Most of the activities in Peru have been finalized (with some minor purchases of seedlings for reforestation activities in Shullcas
                         still pending). The work being performed in Piura, related to paramo, is being conducted from two complementary angles: one for the modeling of paramo functions and climate
                         change impacts, which is already being implemented; the other, on paramo monitoring, is expected to begin before end of the year.

                         A new technical coordinator has been hired. Her main attribution is to implement activities under the regional component. Workshops are being held amongst the various actors of the
                         countries, and terms of reference to prepare documents on lessons learnt are finalized.

                         All eight high-mountain monitoring stations are installed and functioning properly.
