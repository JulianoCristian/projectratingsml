F. Results Framework Analysis
Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators(as approved)
The broad development objective of the proposed project is to contribute to strengthening
the resilience of local ecosystems and economies to the impacts of glacier retreat in the
Tropical Andes, through the implementation of specific pilot adaptation activities that
illustrate the costs and benefits of adaptation. The specific objectives of the project, in
support of this broad objective, are: a) the effective integration of the implications of
glacier retreat into the regional and local planning in glacierized basins; b) the inclusion
of glacier retreat impacts in local, sector development projects; and c) generation of data
on glacier dynamics.

1. Project Context, Global Environment Objectives and Design

1. This Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) describes the results of the
Adaptation to the Impact of Rapid Glacier Retreat in the Tropical Andes Project, GEF Grant funded
through the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF), and approved by the Board on May 27, 2008.
The recipient was the General Secretariat of the Andean Community (SGCAN) on behalf of the
Plurinational State of Bolivia, the Republic of Ecuador and the Republic of Peru. The US$7.49
million Grant became effective on July 8, 2008 and the closing date was September 30, 2012. The
amount was later increased to US$7.94 million and the closing date extended until March 31, 2014.
2. Besides the GEF funds, the Project included activities financed with resources from a PHRD
(Japan Policy and Human Resources Development) Grant in the amount of US$0.86M, which
included the Republic of Colombia as an additional beneficiary; and a GFDRR (Global Facility for
Disaster Reduction and Recovery) Grant of US$0.247M, specifically for activities in Bolivia.

1.1 Context at Appraisal
Country and sector issues
3. At appraisal, climate change (CC) represented a serious global challenge to ecosystem stability
and human well-being, with evidence indicating that it would be more pronounced in high-elevation
mountain ranges. Thus heavily populated high-elevation areas, such as the tropical Andes, were
experiencing, and would likely continue to experience, dramatic changes in climate, compromising
the scarce water resources upon which those populations and critical ecosystems depended. In
particular, global warming had been linked to the accelerated retreat of tropical glaciers and to an
increase in the weather variability and weather extremes affecting the Andean ecosystems.
4. Field observations and records proved that the pace of glacier retreat had accelerated over recent
decades, coinciding with an overall warming of the Andean troposphere. Tropical glaciers in the
Andes (those located between Bolivia and Venezuela) experienced a 6% area loss between 1970
and 1991, and an additional 10% between 1991 and 2000.1
5. In the Andes, runoff from glaciated basins is an important element of the regional water budget,
it regulates flows and is essential to the integrity of mountain ecosystems (many Andean valleys are
seasonally dry, and depend on glacier runoff to maintain extensive mountain biomes). Natural
glacier melt ensures year-round water flows for agriculture, potable water, hydropower, and the
stability of critical ecosystems. Their accelerated retreat would thus have long lasting implications
for economic activities, imposing a threat that could jeopardize the sustainability of water use
patterns and ultimately the viability of related economies and ecosystems, with potential wider
impacts on the entire Andes region.2 Those prospects required the identification and planning of
adaptation measures to strengthen the resilience of local ecosystems and economies.

  Tropical glaciers in the Andes covered an area of over 2,940 km2 in 1970 but declined to 2,758 km2 in 1991 and to 2,493 km2 by
2000. In Peru alone, glaciers covered an area of 2,041 km2 in 1970 but had declined nearly 22 percent to 1,595 km2 by 1997.
2
  Glacier retreat places a burden on water resources in their area of influence. For example, the retreat of Tuni Condoriri glacier
threats water supply for La Paz and El Alto, where 21% of Bolivia’s population lives. This is shared by other Andean cities (e.g.,
Quito, Cuzco, Bogota). Fluctuations in hydrological cycles would impact already stressed ecosystems and reduce the biodiversity
and productivity of highland agricultural lands because of unreliable water supply. The adaptive limitations of less-developed areas
would likely increase the disparity in food production and food security in rural highlands. Because much of the lowland basins
depend on tributary streams coming from the Andes, impacts would also be felt downstream.
                                                                 1
6. Understanding vulnerabilities to the impact of climate change and developing adaptive capacity
was important for Andean countries. Relevant initiatives in this direction were already ongoing,
such as the development of strategies and plans at national level. At regional level, SGCAN had a
mandate to develop the Andean Environmental Agenda, and act as a platform to promote country
integration around common environmental challenges. There were, however, very few experiences
of specific on-the-ground investments that would demonstrate a viable way to do this.
Rationale for Bank involvement
7. The World Bank’s engagement in this regional Project was timely and justified by the
increasing role the institution was taking on CC issues. By the time of appraisal, the WB’s portfolio
on CC in the Latin America and Caribbean region was growing, with an accumulated body of
experience including mitigation and adaptation projects3, and different carbon funds totaling about
US$1.6 billion. The WB was also supporting low-carbon economic growth strategies, a large
agenda on forestry and avoided deforestation, and linking knowledge and information to decision-
making on climate issues. As later explained, the Project supported specific national priorities, and
was well aligned with the Bank’s own objectives to fight poverty and promote sustainability,
especially in areas that had traditionally received little attention, such as high mountains.
Contribution to higher level objectives
8. The Project was directly contributing to relevant issues highlighted in Peru’s Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS FY07-FY11), Ecuador’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS 2003-2007),
and Bolivia’s Interim Strategy Note. The Project contributed to Peru’s CPS on protection and
conservation of strategic ecosystems, while activities in Ecuador and Bolivia contributed to
understanding and reducing water resources’ vulnerability to changing environmental conditions.
9. Moreover, the Project was designed following the guidance provided by the United Nations
Framework Convention on CC (UNFCCC), supporting adaptation activities to address adverse
climate change impacts and complementing traditional government interventions in water resources
management, including the impacts of warmer temperatures and glacial melt into planning
processes. Project activities were country driven, cost effective, and integrated into national
priorities as expressed in the participating countries’ National Communications to the UNFCCC.
10. Lastly, the Project was pioneering the implementation of on-the-ground adaptation activities to
compensate for the loss of glacier services, raising awareness about the consequences of climate
change in the region, and increasing stewardship of global common goods such as glaciers,
paramo4 ecosystems and water resources more broadly.

1.2 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators
11. The Project’s GEO was to contribute to strengthening the resilience of local ecosystems and
economies to the impacts of glacier retreat in the Tropical Andes, through the implementation
of specific pilot adaptation activities that illustrate the costs and benefits of adaptation. The
specific objectives of the Project, in support of this broad objective, were: a) the effective
integration of the implications of glacier retreat into the regional and local planning in glacierized
basins; b) the inclusion of glacier retreat impacts in local, sector development projects; and c)
generation of data on glacier dynamics.

  Paramos are ecosystems placed in the northern Andes of South America and adjacent southern Central America, above the
continuous forest line, yet below the permanent snowline. They play important water regulation functions.

12. Key GEO performance indicators were: (i) Availability of local, regional, and country-level
plans integrating the implications of glacier retreat; (ii) Pilot projects generate useful lessons and
information on costs and benefits of adaptation options that are incorporated into broader public and
private investments in the water, agriculture and power sectors; (iii) A sustainable glacier
observation and monitoring network, operated and maintained by local meteorological and
hydrology agencies produces relevant, reliable, and valid records on a continuous basis on
hydrology and climate for selected glacier basins; each country allocates adequate budgets for
operations after the end of Project; and (iv) Increase in the national and local awareness of the
impacts of rapid tropical glacier retreat as measured through mentions in written media of mass
circulation.

1.3 Revised GEO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification
13. Both the GEO and the specific Project objectives, as described on Section 1.2, were not
modified. However, three of the four key outcome indicators were adjusted after the Project’s Mid
Term Review (MTR). This adjustment was necessary in order to fix inaccuracies, mainly: (i) one
indicator accounted for the approval of climate change plans, whereas the Project could not ensure
their final approval but rather their preparation and submission to be considered for approval; (ii)
another indicator measured the extent to which information generated by the Project was actually
included into wider public and private investments. This indicator was not properly crafted, as these
processes happen on the medium term and a Project cannot directly commit to influencing those. It
was adjusted to indicate that the Project would provide the lessons and information, which would
then be delivered to relevant decision makers seeking to influence wider investments; and (iii) a
third indicator was focused on an output (i.e. the operation and maintenance of a monitoring
network), thus not capturing the essence of the outcome, which was to strengthen the capacity to
monitor glacier retreat.
14. Finally, and as a result of the Project restructuring that followed the MTR (Sections 1.6 and 1.7)
a new, regional component was added, and it became necessary to include a new key outcome
indicator to capture the achievements of this component. All the above changes did not negatively
impact the GEO and allowed for a better delivery of outcomes in a sustained way.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
15. Populations in and around the influence area of glacierized basins. Most relevant, direct
beneficiaries were high-mountain communities highly vulnerable to climate change impacts, in
most cases living in poverty. These communities were to benefit from the development of
management tools and the implementation of pilot measures on agriculture, livestock, irrigation,
water supply and others. Also large settlements, such as La Paz and El Alto in Bolivia, Quito in
Ecuador, or Huancayo in Peru benefitted indirectly, through improved management of the upstream
water resources upon which they depend.
16. Critical Ecosystems, such as paramos, high-Andean wetlands and native grasslands, through
improved management and conservation.
17. Participating countries, which strengthened their technical capacity (monitoring, research,
knowledge); tested different adaptation activities and the use of methodologies to engage local
communities in the adaptation process; generated relevant plans and strategies to influence
investments; and increased the resilience and efficient use of scarce water resources.


                                                  3
18. Andean region, which benefited from a strengthened high-mountain monitoring system, the
effective integration of the implications of glacier retreat into regional planning, a more
comprehensive and informed Andean environmental agenda, and more cohesive group of
practitioners working on water resources management in mountain areas.
19. Water utility companies (EMAAP-Q (currently EPMAPS) in Ecuador, EPSAS in Bolivia,
SEDAM in Huancayo), which were able to make better-informed decisions on water management
(e.g., learn about options to conserve watersheds, water demand management, improved monitoring
systems, options to replace loss of water regulation).
20. Other strategic partners including CARE, IRD (“Institut de Recherche pour le
Développement”), AGRORURAL (formerly PRONAMACHS), FONAG, and local governments
(all of which co-financed the Project), which benefited because the Project complemented their own
activities with additional resources, creating synergies and providing the basis for future work.
21. Meteorological, water resources management and scientific communities, through
strengthened capacity (e.g., increased availability of meteorological and hydrological monitoring,
glacier dynamic modeling) and increased opportunities for knowledge exchange among countries.

1.5 Original Components
22. The Project had 4 components (details in Annex 10). Component 1 focused on the design of
key selected adaptation measures. It was based on an assessment of climate change impacts in the
selected basins, using the results of the Earth Simulator model in Japan as reference. The
component also included dissemination and outreach activities.
23. Specific adaptation investments were included under component 2, and were carried out in
sectors and communities highly vulnerable to glacier retreat (see Annex 2 for a detailed
description). Two pilot activities were contemplated in Ecuador: one would support EPMAPS
(Quito’s water utility company) to strengthen the resilience of the water supply system, while the
second would implement community level activities in Papallacta to promote integrated watershed
management for the Antisana microcatchments. In Bolivia, one pilot supported EPSAS (La Paz and
El Alto water utility) to promote integrated watershed management in the Tuni Condoriri basin
(especially water conservation and supply); a second pilot focused on agriculture and irrigation in
the Bolivian plateau and high valleys; and the third pilot focused on mainstreaming adaptive river
defense systems along the La Paz river. In Peru, the first pilot investment aimed at improving water
use practices in the agricultural and livestock sectors at the Mantaro and Urubamba basins’
headwaters (Junin and Cusco regions, respectively); the second focused on developing and
implementing an agricultural production plan in Shullcas and Santa Teresa (Junin and Cusco
regions, respectively) to compensate for water availability reduction; and the third pilot aimed at
implementing an integrated watershed management plan in Huancayo (Junin region).
24. Component 3 provided for scientific and monitoring activities, and included three key sub-
components: (i) The design and set-up of a glacier and high mountain monitoring stations network;
(ii) The acquisition and use of ALOS satellite images to monitor glacier dynamics; and (iii) A Peru-
specific activity on the estimation of glacier retreat and its economic implications, and the analysis
and monitoring of mountain wetlands (paramos) to determine their role on carbon and water cycles.
25. Component 4 financed Project management through the establishment of a dedicated Project
Implementing Unit (PIU).



                                                  4
1.6 Revised Components
26. As a result of the MTR (September 2010), the implementing agency submitted a restructuring
request to the Bank on June 21, 2011. The restructuring, approved at Country Director level, was
carried out in order to improve the Project description and ensure full delivery of its objectives. It
introduced two main changes to the components. First, with the objective to boost the regional
dimension of the Project (the Tropical Andes is a regional hotspot), a new regional component was
created, focused on joint activities that promoted South-South exchange and cooperation. It also
supported SGCAN on its mandate to facilitate regional integration on relevant environmental topics.
Second, original components were reorganized as follows: Component 1 was reorganized to focus
solely on scientific research and knowledge creation, moving design activities to component 2, and
the outreach activities to component 5; The restructured component 2 reflected the interrelated
nature of design and implementation of adaptation measures. It also clustered some of its sub-
components differently, and, for example, instead of having three pilot activities in Peru, it was
reorganized into two pilot projects, which in substance included the same activities but in a more
integrated, geographically-focused fashion; An illustrative table of the reorganized components is
provided in Annex 11.

1.7 Other significant changes
27. Some additional changes were included as part of the restructuring process (see Annex12),
namely the adjustment in the specific description and scope of some pilot adaptation measures,
which had not been fully defined during the Project design phase and needed a realignment in order
to make them more relevant and likely to succeed. In addition, and to provide space for the changes
to have an effect and the new regional component to achieve its goals, the closing date was deferred
in two occasions from the original September 30, 2012 to the final March 31, 2014. More
specifically:
28. Pilot adaptation measures adjustments: descriptions for Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru were updated,
reflecting the progress made during implementation in the identification, prioritization and design
of activities, and reducing the uncertainties created by non-specific language used in the Project
Appraisal Document (PAD). Pilot activities in Peru were re-organized by geographical location,
thus strengthening an integrated watershed vision. In Ecuador, adjustments were made to
concentrate efforts around the development of vulnerability assessments and knowledge activities
for an existing water supply system for Quito, rather than supporting the construction of a new
supply Project (initially pre-identified in the “Mindo Bajo” area), which had become unviable for
reasons outside Project’s control. The second pilot in Ecuador remained unchanged. Pilots in
Bolivia also remained largely unchanged, and the restructuring was limited to providing further
details, given that original descriptions were prepared at a conceptual level only. None of the
modifications changed the objectives of the pilot adaptation measures or the scope of the Project.
29. Other changes: The results framework was modified to better craft the key outcome indicators,
establishing a clear link between objectives and outcomes, and also at intermediate level to
establish a better link between outputs and outcomes. Grant proceeds were reallocated among
components and the financing plan was updated.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

30. This Project was a regional effort, involving three sovereign national governments, one supra-
national organization (SGCAN) and a high number of local partners and actors. This institutional
                                                  5
complexity translated into delays and inefficiencies, especially during the first two years of the
Project, and required intense Bank engagement and supervision. Significant examples of this are
illustrated in subsequent sections.

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
31. The Project design was conceptually sound, and contemplated all required pieces to ensure its
outcome. It included a robust flow of activities, from scientific research to monitoring to
implementation to policy, and provided incentives at national level for actors to get involved. The
design managed to bring different stakeholders to the same table, placing glacier retreat and
adaptation to climate change in mountain areas at the center of the discussion. Lessons from other
Bank projects were identified during preparation, and further reflected to some extent in the design
(e.g., adaptation measures generating benefits for all stakeholders, comprehensive participatory
approach, and governance structure). Some relevant shortcomings, however, were:
32. Although the PAD provided solid justification for a regional Project, the design gave prevalence
to in-country activities (thus the need to include a regional component during Project restructuring).
33. The Bank design team failed to properly assess the complexity of some proposed pilots, (e.g.
the Project’s planned support to larger water supply works which never materialized in Ecuador),
and to identify viable alternatives. Also, the design did not define a simplified operational structure,
with clearly spelled-out mechanisms and functions. The Project included many diverse activities
and stakeholders, thus requiring significant coordination efforts that were not foreseen. The design
failed to consider mechanisms allowing for direct use of funds by key partners, which would have
expedited the use of funds, simplified the procurement plan, and reduced SGCAN’s exposure to
activities for which it lacked direct expertise.
34. Although significant efforts were carried out to empower a regional institution with the
adequate competencies to execute the Project, the design team failed to recognize SGCAN’s
limitations as an effective implementation agency. SGCAN had the mandate and experience to
implement environmental projects, but mainly related to the generation of knowledge products. The
scope of activities under the Project, in many cases, fell outside this area of expertise, especially
when civil works in remote communities were involved, causing delays and forcing the Bank
supervision team to increase their support efforts.

2.2 Implementation
35. Project implementation went through two phases. During the first one, progress was slow,
mainly due to administrative and operational issues. The second phase, after restructuring, saw a
speed-up in disbursements and execution, and the final achievement of objectives.
36. A significant initial difficulty was that, although SGCAN had signed cooperation agreements
with participating countries, these needed to be ratified by the ”Andean Council” (Foreign Affairs
Ministers of the Andean Community of Nations). SGCAN had failed to identify this requirement,
also due to the non-fully defined Andean body of regulations. This hurdle required strong political
engagement and convening power from the Bank and participating countries, which finally resulted
into the Andean Decision 727 (December 2009). Until then, the Project had not been able to
disburse in Bolivia. Moreover, SGCAN did not provide sufficient technical support and guidance,
rarely participated on missions, and did not sign Aide Memoirs. Their operational procedures were
cumbersome and in some cases not even fully defined. Although the Bank team identified these
issues earlier on, the remedies put in place at the time proved to be insufficient. During the MTR, a

                                                   6
collective effort crystalized into a fast-track procedure included into the Operations Manual.
Processes sped up thereafter, with SGCAN improving its performance. Given the initial slow
implementation pace and lack of robust technical leadership by SGCAN, the Bank team
strengthened its supervision efforts, and brought additional country-based staff (in Bolivia and
Ecuador). This decision brought clear benefits, as country-based staff were able to directly engage
at national level, supporting the PIU and Environmental Ministries and providing targeted guidance.
37. Changes in key PIU staff impacted its performance: the procurement specialist left in January
2011, taking 10 months to identify a competent replacement, and in July 2011 the regional
coordinator was appointed as Peru’s Minister of Environment. Despite significant impacts, the
Project did not stop, due to a greater national engagement, increased National Technical Specialists’
(NTS) performance (including a new, proactive NTS in Bolivia) and an even greater Bank
assistance.
38. Another challenge was that several investments were poorly identified/assessed during Project
design (especially those related to larger water supply works with the water utility companies of
Bolivia and Ecuador), and they were either not a priority, or were not ready for financing (e.g., due
to technical difficulties, lack of financial closure, unforeseen land tenure issues). The Project
restructuring addressed the situation and, instead of focusing on specific infrastructure, it selected
more strategic activities which could inform and have a longer-lasting influence on sectoral
investments, delivering long-term gains, and therefore contributing to the longer goal of climate
change adaptation.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
39. M&E Design. The results framework was prepared so that output indicators were linked to
outcome indicators, in order to better assess Project progress and impact. It is challenging to
measure resilience increases in absolute terms, and therefore most indicators were qualitative in
nature, their progress measured through descriptive text. The M&E system could have been
designed to gather more quantitative information, however, it would have turned the framework
bulky and non-operational. Additionally, most measurable indicators (e.g. increased natural flows
after reforestation, or increased agriculture productivity after irrigation schemes are finalized),
would have implied dedicated monitoring stations and equipment, with additional costs and
challenges.
40. M&E Implementation. The implementation was reported through semiannual reports. After
changes in key staff, the reporting method changed, mainly due to lack of enough human resources,
and most of the information was gathered by NTSs in preparation of missions. The detailed aide
memoirs signed after missions reflected this information and described the implementation of the
M&E. The MTR undertaken by the Bank proved to be a key exercise, crucial in determining the
specific needed changes to improve Project performance. The M&E was the basis upon which a
number of reports were prepared (an end-of-project report, country-based systematizations, detailed
component 2 systematization, and others). Moreover, a rather complete and aggregate final Project
review was included at the closing supervision mission’s signed Aide Memoir.
41. M&E utilization. The Project complexity implied that many steps needed to be taken before
activities could actually be implemented and outputs achieved. This was not reflected in the first
M&E, as it focused mainly on outputs. After restructuring, the adjusted framework improved the
description and follow-up of the causal steps to achieve outcomes, and was frequently used by the
different Project stakeholders to report on progress and identify weaknesses, and informed decision
making, as discussed in section 3.
                                                  7
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
42. Safeguards. This Project was categorized as B, with minor environmental impacts arising from
on the ground investments. Safeguard policies triggered were Environmental Assessment (OP/BP
4.01), Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04), Pest Management (OP 4.09), Forests (OP/BP 4.36), and
Indigenous Peoples (OP/BP 4.10). The Project complied with all safeguard policies, and no mayor
impacts or issues of material compliance occurred.
43. At appraisal, an environmental and social management framework was developed. This
framework was generic and focused on the positive impacts promoted by the Project, whilst
providing limited guidance on actual implementation. During the MTR it was identified that some
aspects, mainly related to proper documentation of processes and plans, had to be better prepared
and registered by SGCAN. The framework was updated and turned into an easy tool, dedicated
training was offered to the NTSs, and closer Bank guidance and supervision was also provided.
44. The updated environmental framework provided clarity for the preparation of simplified
environmental impact assessments, mitigation activities and monitoring for small water and
sanitation works. It included a sample pest management plan, sample terms of reference for the
preparation of a forestry plan, and procedures to adequately address and document the requirements
of the Indigenous Peoples safeguard among others.
45. From a social point of view, Project implementation was highly participatory and supportive of
rural farming communities. Pilot activities had no social adverse impacts, and positively helped
enhance the resilience of the involved communities to changes in water runoff and glacier retreat.
46. Financial Management (FM). The Project provided reasonable assurance that Grant proceeds
were used by the SGCAN for the intended purposes, keeping adequate FM arrangements in terms
of budgeting, accounting, internal controls, funds flow, financial reporting and auditing. The
SGCAN submitted periodically the withdrawal application of funds and disbursed 99.31% of the
Project funds. Some coordination among participating countries for requesting, approving and
processing payments implied some challenges for timely Project implementation. During the last
FM supervision, the FM team advised to rate Project’s FM performance as Satisfactory, as SGCAN
kept qualified staff to manage the Project and adequate internal controls during implementation. In
addition, SGCAN was able to provide timely and reliable information required to manage and
monitor implementation. The SGCAN also submitted the final audit reports and auditors issued
unqualified opinion on the Project’s financial statements.
47. Procurement. Procurement performance at Project closing date was rated Satisfactory. Close
supervision and extensive Bank support were needed to improve the overall procurement capacity
of the PIU within SGCAN and of the participating entities in each country (especially Bolivia and
Ecuador). Initial shortcomings in terms of contract management and low participation in bidding
processes – largely related to lack of experience with Bank procedures – were identified and
addressed in each country. By closing of the Project, the PIU had demonstrated adequate capacity
for compliance with Bank procurement standards and procedures.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
48. The participating countries’ Governments have internalized plenty of the results and products.
Many Project-financed activities have already been incorporated under own routine responsibilities,
and will count on continued financing (e.g. EPSAS’s replication of water efficiency in La Paz,
Ecuador’s Ministry of Environment replication of adaptation efforts in Papallacta and FONAG’s
continuous operation of the water resources monitoring system, or Peru’s work on paramo
                                                8
monitoring in Piura). The long term operation and maintenance (O&M) of monitoring equipment
purchased by the Project was ensured by country-specific agreements. Regarding investments, the
Project made significant efforts to ensure appropriate O&M: in Bolivia the Project helped create
and formalize irrigation committees and operation manuals in both municipalities where irrigation
works where built, and consolidate a basin committee that is currently leading the implementation
of an integrated management plan (CARE provided on the ground support, and will continue to
work in the area for several years, providing a sound environment for a smooth transition). In
Ecuador, the Project created a water user’s association, who took over the management of the
investment. Irrigation and water users committees were strengthened in Peru as well.
49. Regarding the continuous funding of climate change adaptation activities more broadly,
participating countries have continued to succeed in securing external financing, and there are a
number of initiatives to expand initiatives spearheaded by the Project (with the Japan International
Cooperation Agency (JICA), CARE, Swiss Development Cooperation and others). The Bank is also
supporting additional efforts, such as the Pilot Program on Climate Resilience in Bolivia, the Sierra
Irrigation Project, the Water Resources Management Modernization Project and the Program for the
modernization of SENAMHI for Climate Change Adaptation Project in Peru. More significantly,
and given the level of Project success, the three participating countries plus Colombia have
requested a new operation, and the Bank, through GEF’s Special Climate Change Fund, has secured
additional finances. The new operation was being prepared at the time of writing this ICR.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
50. At the time of design, the Project was directly contributing to relevant issues highlighted in
Peru’s CPS FY07-FY11, Ecuador’s CAS 2003-2007, and Bolivia’s ISN. At the time of writing this
ICR, the Project’s GEO and outcomes are still relevant and contribute to Peru’s CPS FY12-16 third
main pillar “sustainable growth and productivity” (Results Area 3.3 specifically mentions the
Government and Bank’s collaboration to address CC impacts); to the Ecuador ISN (pillar number
one “Sustainable and Inclusive Growth”); and the Bolivia CPS FY12-15 (Results Area 2,
specifically devoted to CC and Disaster Risk Management and significantly mentions glacier retreat
as an important development threat). Moreover, the Project was designed to capture the priorities of
GEF4-5, and is still fully responsive to the global priorities underlined by the current GEF6.
51. This Project had the vision of tackling an issue that was only incipient during the preparation
phase, and which has become crucial for the region. Currently, participating countries have all just
issued national CC plans, strategies, and national adaptation action plans. These national
instruments address glacier melting as a priority. Therefore, the objectives and achievements of the
Project, as conceived over six years ago, are still relevant and consistent with all beneficiary
countries’ development priorities. As specific examples, the Project objective of adapting to
impacts of glacier retreat is more relevant than ever in Peru, a country where the most populated
city (Lima, over 8 million people), important infrastructure and touristic attractions are located on
an arid coast which receives most if its potable water from mountain runoff. Adaptation is
fundamental for Peru’s government, as reflected by the fact that Lima will host the UNFCCC’s 20th
Conference of the Parties in December 2014 (during which mountain ecosystems and glacier retreat
will have specific, dedicated events). Ecuador created in 2009 the CC Sub-Secretariat, and in 2010,
the Inter-institutional Committee on CC, to coordinate and enhance the implementation of CC
policy. Significantly, the National Climate Change Strategy was launched in 2012, constitutes the
official political instrument that tackles CC issues nationwide, and is the basis under which the
                                                 9
National CC Plan will be developed. Adaptation to CC in Bolivia in general, and glacier melt in
particular, are important challenges that the country is currently tackling. In 2012 the Mother Earth
law was passed, which positioned CC at the forefront of the policy dialogue. The law provides the
context and institutionalization to articulate the national adaptation and mitigation mechanisms.
52. More specifically, the Project tackled issues that are fundamental for adequate country
development. It provided support to address Bolivia’s La Paz and El Alto pressing potable water
demands, Ecuador’s needs to strengthen water supply systems for Quito through protection of
upstream basins, and Peru’s efforts to improve water management for irrigation in priority basins.

3.2 Achievement of Global Environmental Objectives
53. The achievement of the GEO is rated Satisfactory.
54. Project objectives were achieved, all outputs were completed satisfactorily, and they all added
up to achieving the GEO. The resilience of local ecosystems and economies in the selected areas
were strengthened, through the implementation of specific pilot adaptation activities. The Project
managed to illustrate the costs of selected adaptation measures, although the monetary benefits
accrued will have to be estimated as more data becomes available.
55. The first specific outcome was to generate CC and glacier retreat scenarios in order to
contribute to the definition of local/regional governments’ adaptation strategies. All results in this
front can directly be attributed to specific Project outputs. The three participating countries, through
the Project, generated CC scenarios using the Earth Simulator from the Meteorological Research
Institute in Japan; obtained and used ALOS satellite images to better describe historic glacier
retreat; prepared integrated watershed management plans, vulnerability analyses of critical sectors,
and developed information and monitoring systems. These outputs were translated into strategies
and planning instruments that go beyond initial expectations, and have long term significance. It
would not have been possible to mainstream glacier retreat and other CC impacts into those
instruments without Project’s outputs. Some selected examples (full results matrix in Annex 3) are:
(i) Ecuador: Preparation of the local government of Papallacta’s development and zoning plan,
with Project resources and using the information generated under component 1. The Ministry of
Environment is using this experience to promote the inclusion nationwide of CC in local
development and zoning plans; Preparation of the National CC Strategy and the National CC Plan
using Project information; Increased protection of key relevant ecosystems (paramo, Andean
forests, grasslands and wetlands) through reduction of anthropogenic pressures and better
management of natural areas, through the implementation of specific zoning, fire prevention plans,
sustainable cattle and tourism practices. These practices also contributed to diversifying the local
economy, increasing its resilience to climate shocks. (ii) Bolivia: Preparation of integrated
management plans with CC and water resources considerations in selected basins. These plans were
prepared with CARE’s leadership and laid the grounds for the subsequent irrigation investments.
The irrigation infrastructure and agricultural development in the area contributed to strengthen the
local economy’s resilience. The Choquacota plan, the first one of its kind in the country, was
selected as example on how to include CC into the country’s incipient basin plans. Integrated
management in both locations and improved agriculture practices also reduced pressures on an
already strained environment; The glacier inventory prepared by the Project was used as input to
influence three relevant plans: Master Plan for Water and Sewage for La Paz and El Alto,
Multipurpose Irrigation and Water Plan for the municipalities of Batallas, Pucarani and El Alto, and
five-year investment plan of the water utility for La Paz and El Alto, EPSAS; (iii) Peru: The CC
scenarios for 2030 and 2100 for the Mantaro and Urubamba basins were directly used to inform the

                                                  10
regional CC strategies in Junin and Cusco respectively; An entire fragile ecosystem along the
Shullcas microbasin was strengthened, with specific reforestation activities, delimitation of
protection zones, infiltration trenches and other measures.
56. The second outcome was related to the design and implementation of pilot investments. These
have all been completed and have been able to generate lessons that have been incorporated into
national planning, programs and investments. The number of outputs achieved and their
contribution to the wider GEO, has also gone beyond expectations. As selected examples: (i) In
Ecuador, the different adaptation activities in Papallacta (cattle management, paramo management,
community development using demonstration agriculture plots) have yielded such positive results
that they have become the basis upon which the Ministry of Environment is building a larger
adaptation program in the same area. Also, the Project has contributed to the formulation of
strategies and investment activities of the water utility company through the development of the
Adaptive Management Plan for the Pita-Puengasi water supply system; (ii) In Bolivia, the pilot
activity to improve water distribution efficiency and reduce unaccounted for water in El Alto
yielded very positive results, and similar activities are being replicated by EPSAS in other districts
(three more to date). The implementation of pilot adaptation community activities informed micro-
basin integrated management plans. As example, the Batallas (Khullu Cachi) plan identifies 8
investments that include climate change and glacier retreat considerations; (iii) In Peru, the
Municipality of Santa Teresa has developed a project on food safety based on the agrobiodiversity
and agroclimatology studies under the Project. Several local governments in Cusco are developing
adaptation projects with own resources based on Project’s experience. The paramo monitoring and
conservation activities in Piura managed to preserve a critical ecosystem and biodiversity hotspot,
ensuring longer term ecosystem services provided by it.
57. Activities implemented by the Project differ from more traditional livelihood, community
agriculture and water supply projects, given that their design and implementation was based on CC
research (e.g., selection of agricultural varieties based on the result of agro-climatological models,
capacity building that underscore the link between efficiency and increased resilience, and others).
58. A third Project outcome was the strengthening of the national meteorological services’ capacity
to monitor glacier dynamics in Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru and Colombia. The Project acquired and
installed eight high-mountain monitoring stations, currently under operation. In Ecuador, 15
additional hydro-meteorological stations were acquired, and are complementing the country’s
national network. ALOS satellite images were used to further understand glacier retreat and paramo
dynamics. In this way, the Project has contributed extensively to strengthening national scientific
institution’s capacity to generate and analyze meteorological, hydrological and glaciology data.
59. A fourth outcome, included after restructuring, was related to the Project’s contribution to
strengthening the Andean region by supporting the implementation of the Andean Environmental
Agenda. This Agenda specifically mentions glacier retreat as a regional threat, and encourages
knowledge exchange and transfer of experiences. The Project contributed to increased regional
integration at the scientific, decision makers, and beneficiaries’ levels, creating spaces where
knowledge, processes and experiences were exchanged (over 6 regional workshops were
implemented). The Project also contributed to the publication of two important Andean region
documents: The Andean Strategy for Integrated Water Resources Management, and the Andean
Environmental Agenda, both led by SGCAN. Another significant Project output was the activity
called AndesPlus, an effort to promote intensive cooperation of the participating countries to
prepare a regional database and regional guidelines for adaptation projects in the region, together
with top notch European institutions working on glacier retreat.

                                                 11
3.3 Efficiency
60. High mountain economies and ecosystems are commonly rated among the most vulnerable to
climate change, and impacts are expected to affect Andean countries significantly. As highlighted
by the recent IPCC’s 5th Assessment Report, CC impacts from recent climate-related extremes,
reveal significant vulnerability and exposure of some ecosystems and many human systems to
current climate variability. Numerous publications highlight the toll that climate change will impose
in development. The benefits associated with increasing resilience to CC are thus significant.
61. There is an inherent difficulty in applying effectiveness criteria to adaptation activities, since
most of the costs are incurred at the present time, whereas benefits will be accrued in the medium-
to-far future. Some activities, such as the reforestation of a mountain slope, the implementation of
infiltration trenches, or the protection of fragile high-mountain ecosystems, are challenging to
assess from a cost effectiveness perspective. A first indication of Project’s efficiency, however, is
given by the positive results achieved, both in local ecosystems and economies and on strategies
and plans, all obtained through an initiative with rather limited GEF resources (less than US$8M),
to be distributed between three countries. This is especially relevant when compared to the
tremendous losses that climate change could bring around to the region. The specific cost
effectiveness of three key activities is discussed below. A broader perspective is given in Annex 4.
62. The Project invested resources in purchasing and installing hydro-meteorological equipment. It
is well-known, and has been extensively documented in specialized literature, that investments in
monitoring and improved weather forecasting are cost effective, because they yield significant
benefits for long time periods, generating information useful at multi-sectoral level. Moreover,
highly competitive procurement methods were used, thus ensuring best available prices.
63. In Bolivia, one of the most salient activities was the pilot project to improve water distribution
efficiency, and reduce unaccounted for water of the La Paz and El Alto water utility, EPSAS. By
purchasing selected pieces of equipment (approximately US$188,000 for the whole water
distribution network), and by hiring a specialized firm (for US$181,000), the total investment
yielded large reductions in water losses for District 4 in El Alto (from 39.6% overall losses down to
26.5%), with a total reduction of approximately 619 m3/year, equivalent to the water required for
18,697 new connections of similar characteristics within a year. EPSAS has already replicated this
pilot in at least three districts, yielding 1.3 million m3/year savings, and has plans to expand to all.
64. In Peru, pilot projects in Shullcas included the modernization of irrigation systems, with three
schemes that were upgraded with sprinkling irrigation and small water reservoirs. The total
investment was around US$500,000, including supervision and capacity building. These schemes
made 190 Ha of additional cultivation area available, and are benefiting 347 families. The Project
also invested in the lining of an open canal. These canal lining investments are amongst the most
cost-effective measures in agriculture development. The costs of the canal lining amounted to
around US$235,000, including supervision and capacity building. This relatively low investment
allowed for 144 Ha to be incorporated under intensive agriculture practices, benefitting 179 families
and allowing them to have two harvests per year. Investments were complemented with community
development and capacity building on climate change for farmers, provided by CARE, and these
are activities well known for their cost-effectiveness and long term impact.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
65. Rating: Satisfactory


                                                  12
66. Climate change was and continues to be a major threat to the sustainable development of the
Andean region, and countries need to continue enhancing their capacity (scientific knowledge base,
institutional strengthening, development of sound policies, and regional coordination) and reduce
their vulnerabilities to climate change impacts. The Project contributed extensively to those goals,
achieving significant outcomes and successfully fulfilling its intermediary outputs. The Project
contributed substantially at different levels, some of which unprecedented: (i) strengthened the
high-mountain monitoring network, installing some of the highest altitude stations in the region and
in the world; (ii) implemented on-the-ground climate change adaptation activities, which, to the
authors’ knowledge, are amongst the first of its kind in the world; (iii) made significant
contributions to public policy, strategies and planning, at local, regional and national level; and (iv)
increased the relevance and urgency of climate change adaptation widely, and high mountain
adaptation specifically, as reflected by its impact on mass media and on national agendas.
67. All the above was achieved within a complex environment, involving three participating
countries (plus Colombia for selected activities through its Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and
Environmental Studies IDEAM), a regional implementing agency and numerous strategic partners.
This gives an indication about the Project’s efficiency, since significant outcomes at local (activities
done with municipalities), national (activities lead by the Ministries of Environment), regional
(Andean community strengthening and sharing of experiences) and even international (through a
South-South exchange) level were completed with relatively low funding.
68. The participating countries have moreover shared their experiences in several fora, and have
successfully used the Project to leverage additional resources, with plenty of ongoing replication
and scale-up initiatives (see Section 4).

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
69. There were no explicit poverty or gender related objectives at the time of Project design, and
therefore there was no data collection on net assets, income or consumption patterns before and
after interventions. However most investments benefited and are expected to continue benefitting
poor communities who traditionally inhabit in high mountain areas. The Project has managed to
improve the economic, social and environmental resilience to climate change at the community
level, and also managed to protect and strengthen the livelihoods of people and communities who
depend on ecosystem goods and services. A key Project partner was CARE, organization that
provided consistent and solid social development support. CARE has been constantly present in the
Project’s remote intervention areas, with dedicated staff devoted to social and community
development, capacity building and strengthened institutions. More specifically:
    (i) The irrigation activities in remote Bolivian communities benefitted 70 poor families in Palca
and 85 in Batallas. These families now have an all-year, secure water supply for irrigation, and
increased capacities to adapt their agricultural practices (mostly rain-fed, subsistence prior to the
Project) to a changing climate. The collaboration with EPSAS managed to reduce water losses and
directly benefit El Alto, a settlement inhabited by the urban poor that traditionally has water
restrictions during dry seasons in Bolivia.
     (ii) In Papallacta, Ecuador, a small water supply and sanitation system was built in the
community of El Tambo, an impoverished settlement who had no source of piped running water,
benefitting approximately 180 persons (32 households or equivalent). In the neighboring high-
altitude communities, an integrated approach was followed to improve the local economy’s
conditions, with activities to safeguard paramo ecosystems on which many depend, improve cattle
                                                  13
management strategies, ecological tourism, reforestation and others. CARE supported several of
these activities, which directly benefited around 900 inhabitants. The regional government of
Quijos, to which Papallacta belongs, was involved in training, so that the lessons learned from these
experiences also reached a broader population. More significantly, Papallacta was chosen as a
priority because of its strategic importance in Quito’s water supply. Therefore, activities to promote
water conservation and efficient use are also indirectly strengthening the supply for the capital.
   (iii) In Peru, the improved irrigation schemes and community development carried out in
Shullcas benefitted around 580 rural families around the catchment, with intense social
development support by CARE. Activities in Santa Teresa, Cusco, with strong leadership from the
Municipality and CARE, provided direct support and assistance to the wider community, with
several activities specifically targeted towards women.
70. Activities related to community agriculture, especially in Bolivia, had a gender angle, since
women in high Bolivian communities are the only ones in charge of agriculture, whereas men are
commonly working on the mines or in the city. Social development and capacity building led by
CARE was thus primarily targeted towards women.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
71. Within the Andean region, the Project has had a significant achievement in strengthening the
ability to collect robust data, improve monitoring capacity, as well as data interpretation. Moreover,
it served as demonstration on how to translate data into actionable investments. Long-term capacity
is ensured through multiple interactions and agreements among partner institutions, and through the
sheer number of professionals trained through numerous workshops, both regional and overseas.
72. The Project has contributed to empowering communities to collaborate and act together.
Irrigation associations in Peru were strengthened, and newly created in Bolivia, where a basin
committee model was reinforced. A new local water users association was created in Ecuador as a
consequence of the pilot activity on water supply. There has been on-the-ground community-based
adaptation, provided by CARE especially in Peru and Bolivia, with the aim of training trainers,
identifying and empowering leaders to support own and neighbor communities.
73. The Project has been a platform on which a remarkable number of stakeholders have interacted:
scientists with decision makers with water utility companies with NGOs with farmers and
community members. As one scientist put it during the Project closing workshop, never before had
they gone to the field and talked to farmers to hear about their needs.
74. The regional dimension of the Project promoted cross-fertilization. For example, Bolivia
became a regional leader in satellite imagery, and provided support to the other participating
countries in image processing; Peru made remarkable innovations in understanding future CC
impacts on selected crops and hydrology, and transferred its knowledge to the other two countries;
whereas Ecuador is arguably the world’s first country to implement paramo restoration activities.
This knowledge is strengthening the Ministry of Environment, and is being disseminated elsewhere.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts
75. The Project has received significant attention, with a number of mass media publications about
it. This steered the interest of another glaciated region, the Himalayas. As a result, on January 2014,
a delegation of government officials and practitioners from Afghanistan, China, India and Pakistan
visited the Project in Ecuador to gain insights and ideas. Ecuadorian Government and institutions
were proactive hosts, and participants remained positively impressed and mentioned their interest in
replicating efforts in their countries.

                                                  14
76. The ALOS satellite images, initially envisioned for glacier retreat quantification, have found
other uses, and in Bolivia there has been a PhD thesis on land-slides and disasters in the city of La
Paz using the same images. One of Bolivia’s pilot projects, financed by the Global Facility for
Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR), addressed the construction of defensive structures
throughout the banks of the La Paz river to protect crops and settlements from flash floods. The
activity financed the construction of a physical simulation model of the river, the first of its kind in
the country. The success of the model, built at the Institute of Hydraulics and Hydrology (IHH), and
the amount of quality of information it provided, called the attention of the city of La Paz, who built
similar models to inform the construction of other infrastructure.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
77. A final Project Stakeholder-wide workshop was held in Lima. It counted with presence of key
authorities and decision makers from the participating countries, as well as the different institutions
(the meteorological institutes, water utilities, local and municipal level governments, CARE and
others), and direct Project beneficiaries During two days, the workshop unanimously and
unequivocally praised the Project’s achievements, relevance and importance, and underlined some
of its most positive accomplishments, such as institutional coordination and its ability to connect all
stakeholders. Another frequent observation was the right approach to strengthen the monitoring
capacity and knowledge base first, and translate it into investments, which have served as an
incentive to achieve Project goals. Annex 6 provides more detail.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

78. Rating: Moderate
79. The Project’s objective remains highly relevant, with relatively low risk to the development
outcome given the importance of the topic and the level of institutional engagement.
80. Factors contributing to the success in reaching the development outcome are robust and have
been mentioned before (knowledge strengthening, capacity generation, policy influence, actor
involvement, deep social engagement). All these factors, in addition to the availability of increasing
international adaptation-specific resources, provide the conditions for sustaining a positive path
towards even stronger institutions and better informed decision.
81. Sustainability and scale-up of activities is also guaranteed through the leverage of additional
funds and efforts to strengthen policies and foster resilient investments. In Bolivia, scientific
activities will continue through initiatives such as JICA’s “Proyecto Grande“, while EPSAS will
receive the support of the World Bank-financed Pilot Program for Climate Resilience, and the work
undertaken with rural communities in Palca and Batallas will continue with support from the Swiss
Development Agency and other CARE initiatives. In Peru, CARE together with AGRORURAL,
and with the support of the World Bank’s financed Sierra Irrigation Project, will continue activities
with local communities in Shullcas to further strengthen Project investments. The implementation
of two new projects with the support of the Swiss Government and the leadership of the Ministry of
Environment will continue to strengthen the capacity around glacier retreat. Moreover, monitoring
and scientific research will be supported through the World Bank-financed Program for the
Modernization of SENAMHI for Climate Change Adaptation Project.
82. The role of CARE in the three countries must be underscored because of the capacity shown to
raise resources aimed at achieving Project’s objectives and sustaining these achievements. CARE
more than duplicated the amount of resources committed to the Project reaching US$ 3.9 million,
                                                  15
part of which is currently being used to replicate some of the pilot investments, and to provide
continuity to the capacity building activities.
83. Still, there are various factors that present challenges to the adaptation agenda. These include
the usual shortcomings such as the general weak capacity at the local level, limited and competing
availability of local resources, and the characteristic regional political turnover, which could
potentially shift priorities. The pilot projects had the vocation to generate useful information for
decision making and scale-up. Most of the activities have a well-designed M&E, and the challenge
remains to maintain the arrangement over long periods of time (needed to obtain meaningful data).
84. The continuity and further strengthening of regional activities is more uncertain, because the
SGCAN is currently re-examining its priorities, and indications point to the institution focusing on
commerce promotion and Andean exchange, likely leaving environment outside its primary area of
interest. However, support on regional integration will be given by a new GEF regional project on
climate change adaptation and water, currently under preparation by the Bank. Thus the overall risk
to development outcome is considered moderate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
85. Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
86. Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. The topic
was incipient at the time of Project design, and the approach to address the issue at the regional
level, considering country similarities both in challenges and in solutions, was innovative and
daring. Moreover, the Bank seized the opportunity to mobilize a new source of funding (GEF’s
Special Climate Change Fund) to respond to a priority, and was arguably one of the first Projects
worldwide to pursue real investments and activities related to glacier retreat, and to do so with a
regional approach. At the time of design, plenty of the information needed to undertake these
investments was still unknown, and the final achievement of objectives indicates that Project design
contained the minimum basis upon which to build a successful intervention.. A considerable level
of risk was thus taken, acknowledging that potential rewards were worth the effort.
87. However, and especially because the Project was challenging, the preparation and appraisal
could have been more emphatic on the implementation arrangements, careful assessment of
institutional capacities at regional and national level, or assessment of administrative requisites to
make the Project actionable. A more careful appraisal of several proposed pilot interventions should
have been carried out. The choice of SGCAN as implementing agency was risky and proved to play
against the long-term objectives of the Project. Finally, the initial Project design did not specifically
include regional activities.

(b) Quality of Supervision
88. Rating: Satisfactory
89. The Bank’s supervision efforts should be analyzed before and after the MTR. Before,
supervision was carried out in a general, detached way. Coordination and procedural difficulties
were jeopardizing the Project, and hard decisions to better define or discard and identify alternatives
for some of the anticipated pilot activities were delayed. Little progress was achieved, and this was
also partly justified by certain lack of ownership and guidance from the participating countries.

                                                   16
90. A significant change came with a new Bank team, which was brought in to conduct the MTR.
The MTR turned into an important milestone, since the review resulted in the formal restructuring
of the Project. Thereafter, the Bank task team tightened its supervision efforts, organized many
detailed field visits and frequent video and audio conferences, placing the participating countries at
the center of the discussions. Moreover, Bank country-based staff was added to the supervision
team to strengthen oversight and provide even further guidance to the PIU, SGCAN and Ministries
of Environment. The procurement, financial management, disbursement, social and environmental
safeguards, and legal Bank team members all had to engage directly with the client. This high level
of attention and proactivity was maintained by the team throughout the Project life, ultimately
turning into one of the main factors contributing to Project success.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
91. Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
92. Overall Bank Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory, based on the ratings for Bank
Performance for Ensuring Quality at Entry and Quality of Supervision.
93. There were several flaws on Project design, certainly related to its complexity and the inability
to properly weigh national and regional weaknesses, and administrative requirements. However, a
very proactive and engaged supervision team closely accompanied the Project; objectives were met,
and significant contributions to climate change adaptation were achieved

5.2 Borrower
(a) Government Performance
94. Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
95. There is an inherent difficulty to describe the performance of three participating countries
(Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru), throughout the life of the Project, into a single rating. However, as a
whole, there have been periods –especially during the first years- of slow, reactive performance,
with delays and discontinuities (often caused by high turnaround times of key Government staff),
lack of ownership and leadership. These periods have been followed by others of intense and
remarkable performance. The last years of the Project witnessed strong engagement and leadership
from the Ministries of Environment, and are prove that, when motivated and engaged, the
participating countries are regional references on climate change adaptation. During these last years,
they stepped up to the challenges, devoted specific staff to coordinate and manage activities, and
significantly contributed to achieving Project objectives. Participating countries have ultimately
internalized Project’s outputs and results, and are eager to continue learning from them and from
each other.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
96. Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
97. The performance of SGCAN can be divided into two different types of contributions. From a
fiduciary perspective (and especially financial management and procurement), SGCAN managed to
provide, with PIU’s support and own staff and resources, the needed environment to carry out
processes in a positive way. The first years of Project implementation saw a somewhat cumbersome
and slow administrative process, which resulted in significant delays. This was reviewed during the
MTR, and SGCAN agreed to change some of its procedures, which allowed to speed up operations.
Significantly, during a long period of time on which the externally-hired PIU staff changed, they
managed to step up and prevent delays or discontinuities that would have resulted into failure.

                                                 17
98. From a technical perspective, however, SGCAN fell short of providing the technical leadership
that was expected. Its country dialogue on environmental and climate change issues was fairly
limited, and their engagement on Project supervision was reduced. Aside from some early
occasions, SGCAN did not participate in supervision missions, did not provide guidance on the
definition of activities, preparation of Terms of Reference, or engage on problem solving and
dissemination of lessons. These issues have grounded reasons, since SGCAN was created to work
on regional commercial and trading matters, and although it had experience implementing
environmental projects, it had never before implemented works and investments on its member
countries. Moreover, the ongoing re-evaluation of SGCAN’s mission and core competencies seems
to indicate that environment will likely be out of its main business.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
99. Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
100. Overall Borrower Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory, based on ratings for
Government Performance and Implementing Agency Performance.
101. As previously explained, there have been some evident shortcomings, and several delays
could have been avoided with the right level of oversight. However, certainly without sustained and
high level Government commitment and support to the Project, none of the achievements would
have been feasible. This is true especially during the second part of the Project, on which the three
participating countries’ Ministries of Environment stepped up and provided leadership and
coherence. Moreover, they are currently committed and devoting own resources to the preparation
of a new, regional project on climate change adaptation and water, through the GEF SCCF fund.

6. Lessons Learned

102. Careful, early-planned partnerships with key stakeholders increases the viability and
chances of Project success. These arrangements need to be built around topics directly within
partner’s expertise and core business. The up-front close involvement of CARE as a key partner
was crucial to facilitate all social engineering processes with rural communities, and ensuring that
the Project had a strong local community-based adaptation pillar. CARE’s ability to leverage
resources also provided continuity beyond Project closing, sustainability and M&E strengthening.
103. Climate change adaptation requires extensive bottom-up work and community
development. The combination of constant on-the-ground presence for community development,
provided by CARE, together with infrastructure works as an incentive, conform a framework with
more success chances than stand-alone investments or capacity building. An engaged and trained
community, with improved basic infrastructure, becomes the best stewardship for fragile
ecosystems that provide key environmental services. The use of a bottom-up approach facilitated
the combination of the knowledge and experience of communities on coping strategies, with the
rigorousness of science and technology, thus providing a sound base for the design of activities with
a long term vision of increased resilience.
104. The ability of countries to increase their climate change resilience is directly linked to
their capacity to generate and analyze data to assess vulnerability. Any adaptation project
should be grounded on robust knowledge creation and capacity building. The Project initially
focused on applying a specific, “donor driven” CC model to countries (Japan’s Earth Simulator),
instead of focusing in developing general capacities to use and interpret CC models more broadly.
Whereas the former is good for getting hands-on experience and high resolution results from the
best available climate model at the time, it has the risk of remaining as a one-off effort with no
                                                 18
continuity. A related lesson was learned when the Project strived to promote the development of
modeling tools in selected basins: what participating countries needed mostly was not model
developing, but data collection and database buildup. Absence of good data is typically the most
important hurdle on these efforts. Strengthening of monitoring networks is thus key, and O&M
mechanisms must be secured for the long run, with costs that short-lived projects cannot cover.
105. Several lessons to improve quality at entry that could inform regional projects have emerged:
106. Different implementation arrangements should be considered and included in the legal
agreements for flexibility. The Project required the participation of a large number of stakeholders,
some of them playing fundamental executing roles (e.g., CARE, AGRORURAL), and a thorough
analysis of the possible options to engage them should have been carried out. Establishing
subsidiary agreements, instead of, for example, including them as co-executors, might have been
the most agile way to finalize preparation, but proved to be onerous in the long run.
107. Clear operational procedures are essential to ensure an effective implementation of
complex projects. The Project had aggregated operational procedures, with uncertainty in steps,
timing and responsibilities. It was designed from a technical perspective, but aligning the technical
with the fiduciary (especially procurement and disbursement) should have been done better.
108. Regional projects need more supervision budgets. Although economies of scale were
effectively reached (centralized procurement, financial management, disbursements), a regional
project with three countries is costlier to supervise than a national one, and both SGCAN and the
Bank should have had more resources.
109. Two types of M&E arrangements should be designed and budgeted for as part of a pilot
Project. A clear distinction between a CC adaptation and a regular investment is the former’s
ability to generate data that informs the adaptation agenda. Notably, for this Project two different
M&E schemes were needed: one to follow up on Project progress and results, and another to
capture and evaluate long-term adaptation benefits. The Project was designed to implement the
former but did not give enough consideration to the later. The MTR detected this and promoted
some solutions, but it had to be done at no additional costs. As a result, long-term M&E
arrangements were designed by the Project, but their continued implementation will depend on

110. The Project has contributed to the replication and scaling-up of adaptation activities.
These are suited to the specific local conditions, but have the potential to inform adaptation efforts
in other geographical locations. Although it has taken considerable time to implement, the Project
has accumulated a number of experiences and generated specific tools (e.g., models, methodologies,
baselines), that are useful elsewhere. The contribution to the global community of practice on high
mountain hydrology and glaciology is so relevant, and the level of interest and attention raised has
been so significant, that, in retrospect, it would have been useful to allocate budget to translate key
publications into English and improve communication during implementation. Nevertheless,
adaptation is ultimately a local challenge, and the material generated by the Project would have to
be adapted to specific circumstances, acknowledging the importance of local know-how.

Moreover, the Republic of Colombia was a Project beneficiary for selected activities. A draft of this
ICR was shared with all the institutions above, and feedback collected during a 4-week period5. A
summary follows (additional details provided in Annex 7).
112. (i) The SGCAN expressed its full satisfaction with Project achievements and successes,
underlining that, thanks to the Project, specific answers and solutions have been given to challenges
to ecosystems and economies posed by glacier retreat in the Tropical Andes; (ii) Ecuador
emphasized that the Project has been instrumental in implementing adaptation measures that
compensate ecosystem service losses caused by rapid glacier retreat and ecosystem degradation,
and call for continuous efforts by Project beneficiaries, local and national governments to ensure
long term sustainability; (iii) Bolivia praised the Project and ICR, and noticed how, thanks to the
Project, scientific information is currently being applied to decision making in the country; (iv)
Peru stated that the ICR appropriately describes the technical, operational and financial aspects of
the Project. They transmitted satisfaction with Project outcomes, and stress the role played by the
Ministry as a convener of the different levels of government and other stakeholders. They also
shared further Project lessons learned; (v) Colombia commended the document, and stressed out the
remarkable achievements obtained through the Project, requesting the Bank team to reflect them
more clearly. All comments and suggestions by were properly addressed in the ICR.
(b) Cofinanciers
N/A

(c) Other partners and stakeholders
113. The ICR was shared with CARE, institution that has partnered with the Project and financed
several complementary activities with own resources. CARE provided additional details on Project
achievements, especially in Peru, and stressed their contributions in technical and institutional
aspects, taking community-based adaptation as departing point (additional details in Annex 8).

  The SGCAN prepared a number of documents (see Annex 9) in which lessons learned were reflected and systematized, whilst other
documents captured and described the achievements of the Project, per component and per country. These reports were shared with
participating countries and other stakeholders, and became a useful tool to inform decisions. A specific, consolidated report reflecting
the whole Project was not prepared.

    (1) Components were modified following the MTR.
    (2) This sub-component was moved to component 2 of the project, and therefore the co-financing value under the updated column is “0”. The actual co-
        financing was included under component 2.
    (3) This sub-component was moved to component 5 of the project, and therefore the co-financing value under the new column is “0”. The actual co-financing
        was included under component 5.
    (4) As of the MTR, this component also included design, i.e., the activities from SC1-2.
    (5) This activity was part of the original project (financed with CCIG resources) but had been omitted as part of the project description in the original legal
        documents, and was therefore added.
    (6) This sub-component was moved to component 5 of the project, and therefore the co-financing value under the new column is “0”. The actual co-financing
        was included under component 5.

Changes in costs and sources of funding summarized in the table above are explained below:
Component 1: The updated cost of this component considered only the activities related to the development of climate change
scenarios and glacier-fed basin impact maps and models, and associated studies. The total cost of this component was slightly higher
than originally foreseen (US$ 1.23 compared to 1.1 million), and the difference had been covered by specialized governmental
agencies. Given the relocation of the design (Sub-component 1.2) and dissemination (Sub-component 1.3) activities to Components 2
and 5, respectively, the total amount of GEF resources allocated to this Component was slightly less than original (US$ 0.33 million
compared to 0.40 million), and the balance was reallocated to fund regional activities under the new Component 5.
Component 2: The Project cost for Component 2 to be covered by GEF resources was in line with the original financing plan
(US$ 5.81 million compared to the original US$ 5.94 million). The overall expected co-financing contribution for Component 2 was
also close to what was originally planned (US$ 21.41 compared to the original 19.61 million). At the time of restructuring, several of
the co-financing resources foreseen in the initial financial package had materialized or were likely to be exceeded. These included: (i)
the World Bank financed Peru Agricultural Research and Extension APL (US$ 6.26 million), (ii) CARE (US$ 1.8 million), and (iii)
AGRORURAL6 (US$3.1 million). Since its inception the Project had leveraged additional resources that had contributed to achieving
the Project’s global objective. These co-financing resources originate from: (i) in Peru, the World Bank financed Sierra Irrigation
Project (US$ 2.75 million), and the World Bank financed Water Resources Management Modernization Project (US$ 2.24 million),
and (ii) the Bolivia Pilot Program for Climate Resilience Phase 1 (US$ 1.5 million), a grant provided under the Strategic Climate
Investment Funds. Finally, some co-financing resources that were foreseen originally did not fully materialize. This was the case of
EPMAPS (Quito’s water utility)7 which was expected to contribute US$ 7 million for a new water supply system to Quito. Due to
land tenure issues, however, EPMAPS had to abandon the foreseen new water supply system in Mindo Bajo; its revised expected co-
financing, for planning and monitoring activities under pilot 1 in Ecuador, amounted to US$1.6 million. FAO’s originally estimated
contribution to the Project was US$1 million, but did not materialize during the life of the Project.
Component 3: Changes in the cost of Component 3 were minimal. The activities that were included under 3.3b and c were reallocated
to Component 5 because of their regional nature and their cost was covered by an additional GEF Grant that was provided to the
Project (P119725) and approved in early 2011. The only change in availability of co-financing resources with a minor impact on this
Component corresponded to the lack of NOAA’s participation, with a foreseen contribution of US$ 0.24 million, which was intended

to support the satellite collection and storage of data from the eight high-mountain monitoring stations, which was nevertheless
already taking place in-country and financed in great part by government contributions.
Component 4: Costs for this Component were originally overestimated. The MTR estimated that Government counterparts funding
amount to US$0.56 million (compared to US$ 2.75 million) based on disbursements so far, which had allowed for efficient execution
of this Component (e.g., preparation for and participation in Steering Committee meetings, supervision missions, etc.).
Component 5: The reallocation of activities among components generate savings on GEF resources from the first three components,
which were being used to finance half of the cost of Component 5. The other half corresponds to the reallocation of activities from
Component 3 (Sub-component 3.3.b-c).

       Scientific studies have generated useful tools (e.g., climate studies, statistical analysis of the climate, impact maps, strengthening of the monitoring system of the high
    Guayllabamba basin, vulnerability analysis) to foster an adequate management of local development in the intervened zones, and to inform decision makers (e.g., EPMAPS).
    These have allowed for the preparation, and sometimes, implementation of investment adaptation activities. Within the framework of the project the following were elaborated: i)
    General adaptation strategy for pilot project 2 (prepared by the national technical expert of the project); ii) Adaptation management plan for the Pita Puengasi system
    (INTERCOOPERATION); iii) Adaptation management plan for the Antisana Ecological Reserve (INTERCOOPERATION); iv) Adaptation management plan for the Parroquial
    government of Papallacta focus of cattle management (ECOPAR); v) Adaptation management plan for degraded paramo zones (CONDESAN).

Annex 4. Economic and Financial Analysis
Estimating both the benefits and costs associated to increasing the resilience of the Tropical Andes
to the impacts of glacier melting and the resulting effects on water availability is challenging.
Adaptation activities go beyond standard investment activities, as they try to address additional
needs (e.g., reforestation has an impact on water retention, thus helping regulate water flow), and
the adaptive result of these interventions will be accrued over long periods of time that escape the
timeframe of the Project. Further, the Tropical Andes wider area of influence is a complex
composite of relatively highly populated centers, fragile ecosystems and small communities. The
water flowing from a glacierized basin originates from glacier melt, rain and snowmelt runoff,
underground water, and is used both by natural ecosystems (paramo, mountain forests) as well as
by several sectors such as water supply, irrigation, and energy to name a few. All these uses
compete among each other for the resource, and therefore the benefits accrued by one sector will
have an (expected positive) externality on another (e.g., savings in one sector obtained through
water efficiency practices decreases demand, freeing resources for other uses).
Given the ample scope of the Project and the number of activities implemented, this annex focuses
on a few examples to provide arguments (qualitative and quantitative when possible) to support the
cost effectiveness of the implemented measures. An approach used to provide a sense of some
indirect benefits of specific activities is to look at the costs to implement alternative solutions to
tackle the same problem.
Water Supply. One of the key sectors addressed by the Project was water stresses caused by CC and
glacier retreat, and their impacts in availability for supply purposes (Quito - Ecuador, and La Paz
and El Alto - Bolivia). The financial benefits of additional water availability (or savings in losses)
could be quantified based on the price of water in each case; however this measurement
underestimates the actual economic benefits. In the case of Bolivia for example, savings in water
losses as the results of the efficiency improvements implemented by the Project, allowed EPSAS in
the short term to decrease water disruption to areas that were not adequately served (the pilot
activity yielded a reduction of 19.61 lt/sec. (619 m3/year) equivalent to the water required for
18,697 connections of similar characteristics within a year) with the consequently expected benefits
on health for example, plus reduced social tensions due to water shortage. In the medium and long
term, it is expected that savings in water would reduce the pace by which new sources of water and
water systems are required, thus decreasing the social tensions that have developed historically in
La Paz and El Alto, in addition to the financial costs of identifying, designing and constructing new
systems. The fact that EPSAS has already replicated the efficiency improvement activities in three
other districts is an indication that addressing water losses is a cost effective measure compared to
just focusing on finding and developing new sources of water.
In the case of Quito, the deep engagement and leadership of EPMAPS and FONAG in undertaking
pilot activities to reduce degradation and promote recovery of the paramo ecosystem, is a clear
recognition of this ecosystem’s specific importance in the supply of water. The alternative to
improve water retention and infiltration by protecting the paramo ecosystem would be for
EPMAPS to look for new catchments to extract additional water for the capital, all of which, as
stated by the utility company, would require seeking sources that are further and further away from
Quito, investing in costly infrastructure, and engaging in social negotiating processes which are not
easy to carry out. As opposed to those works, a very small investment focused on conservation and
promotion of water resources, could yield, as it is being evaluated by the pilot activities, very



                                                 43
significant water availability gains. In addition, paramo restoration encompasses a variety of other
benefits including carbon sequestration and enhanced biodiversity protection.
At a smaller scale also in Ecuador was the pilot activity to provide access to potable water for the
Valle del Tambo community. The literature provides extensive arguments in favor of improved
access to clean water (e.g., reduce child mortality, health benefits), but the actual benefits from an
adaptation point of view go beyond those describe by the literature. If basic needs and daily
challenges are not addressed, the chances that communities get involved in adaptation activities that
can yield benefits beyond the immediate future and to the global public goods as a whole, are
minimal. In addition, the benefits linked to this pilot should be seen beyond the actual infrastructure,
and take into account the strengthened organizational capacity of the water and sanitation
committee.
Strengthened monitoring capacity and the knowledge base. As stated in different places of this
document, a key element in addressing adaptation is the need to understand and evaluate the
impacts of climate change, and the vulnerability of population, ecosystems, and economic sectors.
The only way to keep improving the quality of vulnerability assessments and therefore the
identification of adaptation requirements is to keep investing in stronger institutions and
strengthened monitoring capacity, measured in terms of available hard and soft equipment to
generate data at a local scale, and the human capacity to analyze the data and provide information
for decision-making. Costs of adaptation have been estimated and are available from specialized
literature, all of them in the billion figure. The more accurate adaptation measures can be designed,
the less use of resources required for trial and error, and every adaptation design starts with the use
of good data. This becomes more important in regions such as the Tropical Andes, because their
unique topography makes downscaling of global models more challenging.
Efficient irrigation. Cost benefit analysis of irrigation activities as those implemented in Shullcas,
Peru, were done based on the actual costs (of the infrastructure, capacity, supervision), and benefits
measured by the expected increased productivity at market prices. These analyses yielded internal
rates of return of approximately 46%. The ability to measure actual benefits on productivity
requires a timeframe beyond Project closure. Still, from an adaptation perspective, it is important to
realize that the benefits related to an efficient use of water for irrigation go beyond the increased
productivity, and the reduced demand (and thus competition) for the water resource should be
accounted for.
Food Safety. The benefits of rural community activities in Bolivia related to resilient agriculture by
promoting the use of more resilient crops (e.g., quinoa) under different conditions, and the
introduction of more varieties of native potato species, are not only significant in terms of increased
productivity. Potatoes and basic cereals represent the staple food of these communities, and
therefore their basic source of nutrition. Thus, increasing crop resilience to CC impacts, and
ensuring a less climate variability-dependent food production throughout the year, has also direct
benefits on health and wellbeing. This is also valid for similar activities in Papallacta, Ecuador.
Moreover, improved food safety prevents to some extent encroachment and other practices that
could damage global public goods and degrade critical ecosystems that provide needed services. An
indirect, efficient way to protect these services, is to ensure food safety and viable livelihoods for
the communities in and around those ecosystems.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results
A final Project stakeholder-wide workshop was held in Lima, Peru, on November 28 and 29, 2014.
It was hosted by the General Secretariat of the Andean Community, and included all main Project
stakeholders. It was attended by decision makers and authorities of the three participating countries
plus Colombia (due to its engagement on the third Project component), from the national, regional
and local levels; scientists from the meteorological and hydrological research centers of the four
countries; representatives from the water utility companies EPSAS and EPMAPS; key staff from
CARE, AGRORURAL and IRD (the French Institut de recherche pour le développement);
representatives from the beneficiary communities, some of them of indigenous origin; the World
Bank team and others.
Some of the main findings during the two day event, which were also reflected on an Aide Memoir,
are summarized below.
- Representatives of the different groups involved agreed on the Project’s success in bring them
together and making them work in a coordinated way. Scientists talking to beneficiaries, to decision
makers and to utility companies proved to be powerful and enriching for all. Moreover, the
engagement of CARE, organization that promoted community engagement in development
activities around the climate change theme, was positively rated, especially for Bolivia and Peru.
- The experiences gained by the Project underline the necessity, moving forward, to continue
bridging the gap between different actors at different government levels, beneficiaries and the
knowledge community, as a regional government representative noted.
- Workshop participants praised the Project’s vocation to disseminate results and to facilitate
outreach to other areas (communities and other local governments) not directly involved in it.
- It was noted that, although the Project’s primary vocation was not to influence public policy, it
managed to do it on a very articulated way, by first strengthening the knowledge base, then bringing
it to action through pilot projects, and finally trickling down the experiences into regulations,
strategies and investment plans.
- The Project’s focus on glaciers and glacierized basins was relevant to raise awareness and increase
the level of attention to a critical issue. Glaciers are however not isolated, and future activities will
have to underline the key linkages and interrelations with other areas in the region.
- Moving forward, and as more data becomes available, workshop participants urged the different
actors involved (especially regional governments and CARE) to communicate and advocate for the
positive results obtained in the Project, using as one parameter their cost effectiveness. CARE
agreed to present results of their analyses in the near future.
- Another clear lesson learned from the Project, stressed by all, was the Project’s vision to work
from local to national, and that an adaptation program cannot be implemented solely at the national
level, but a strong, participatory approach is needed, involving local actors and beneficiaries from
the early stages of design. The Project has provided several good examples on how to do this.
- As a final thought, participants praised the Project, indicated that there are numerous lessons and
experiences to learn from, and requested the Andean Secretariat to stress their efforts to better
disseminate them, reaching out to decision makers and civil society.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The recipient of this regional Project was the General Secretariat of the Andean Community
(SGCAN) on behalf of the Plurinational State of Bolivia, the Republic of Ecuador and the Republic
of Peru. Moreover, the Republic of Colombia was a Project beneficiary for selected activities. An
ICR draft was shared with all the institutions above, and feedback collected during a 4-week period.
The comments received are translated and summarized below.
The SGCAN, through its Projects and Cooperation area, indicated full satisfaction with Project
achievements and success. Through the Project, specific answers and solutions have been given to
challenges to ecosystems and economies posed by glacier retreat in the Tropical Andes. SGCAN
states that the successful implementation of activities has allowed to achieve Project objectives and
complete all activities foreseen in the different Project components. Finally, SGCAN stresses that
their management of the Project was accomplished following all procedures and regulations,
statement that is backed up by the Project Audits.
Ecuador, through the Ministry of Environment, emphasizes that the Project has been instrumental
in implementing adaptation measures that compensate ecosystem service losses caused by rapid
glacier retreat and ecosystem degradation. The Ministry also mentions that, in order to ensure long-
term sustainability of several investments, continuous efforts are still needed by Project
beneficiaries, local governments and Ministries. Ecuador has used ALOS images to monitor and
characterize paramo dynamics and vulnerability assessments. In their opinion, there was no lack of
empowerment from countries (as the ICR notices in Section 5.1b), but they agree with the fact that
Government staff changes and norms are a key reason for delays and uncertainties. They indicate
that each country’s performance is different from the others and this should be taken into account.
Finally, they indicate that the social engineering was oftentimes achieved through concerted efforts
by the NTS, beneficiaries and local governments, whereas in other specific activities it was
achieved with CARE’s support (demonstration plots, reforestation, silvo-pastoril systems, forest
connectivity actions, and fire prevention plan).
Bolivia, through the Ministry of Environment and Water, praised the ICR, and emphasized that the
Project managed to strengthen research institutions and promote real applied research. Said research
generated information that is directly being used to inform decisions.
Peru, through the Ministry of Environment, indicated its agreement with the document, stating that
it appropriately describes the technical, operational and financial aspects of the Project. Other
specific comments were: (i) Their satisfaction with the results obtained, which have allowed the
Ministry to implement on the ground investments, generate technical and scientific information
useful for decision making, and provide a platform to coordinate different national and regional
stakeholders, promoting synergies and concerted efforts. The role played by the Ministry, as a
convener and facilitator of efforts at the three government levels is stressed in this regard; (ii) The
Project success in “thinking globally and acting locally”, being able to implement specific actions at
local level, which created empowerment and ownership; (iii) The Project achievements are
especially relevant as they dealt with high-mountain ecosystems and glaciers, prioritized under
Peru’s National CC Strategy and COP20; (iv) The pilot projects completed and the lessons learned
and extracted throughout this initiative are an important input to build public policy at regional and
local levels, especially for high mountain ecosystems. The Project activities could be replicated in
other vulnerable areas of the country; (v) The Ministry of Environment, through its CC General


                                                  48
Directorate, will continue to promote and facilitate climate change adaptation processes and
initiatives, replicating what the Project achieved, seeking the leadership from regional and local
governments to ensure success. This entails continuous engagement in governance and institutional
work, sensitization, and the establishment of the necessary financing mechanisms. The Peru
priorities would be to mainstream CC in development activities, engage as many stakeholders as
needed, strengthen capacities, promote top to bottom approaches and vice versa, and include more
research institutions into the process; (vi) A number of lessons learned, from the Ministry’s
perspective, were mentioned, such as better integrating scientific and traditional/community
knowledge, establishing monitoring systems for long-term characterization of outcomes, better
engaging stakeholders with an implementing role in projects (universities for knowledge creation,
local governments to replicate around Project intervention areas and capacity building), better
integrating regional dimensions in order to generate supra-national processes, and establishing
better communication strategies in order to have greater impact at different levels.
Colombia, through IDEAM, commended the document, and mentioned that the quality and depth
of activities carried out in Colombia as part of the Project merited more specific acknowledgement.
Through the Project, the country has: strengthened its high-mountain monitoring network with two
high-mountain stations; Installed an additional monitoring network on a critical glacierized basin;
Carried out a flagship study on the evaluation of economic, ecological and social value of
ecosystem services provided by glaciers; Carried out a study on the social vulnerability of selected
high-mountain communities to rapid glacier retreat; and performed other activities such as studies
using ALOS satellite images.

Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

The ICR was reviewed by CARE, institution that has partnered with the Project and financed
several complementary activities with own resources. CARE underlines that, in Peru, and thanks to
Project promotion of climate change adaptation, the regional government of Junin established a
regional conservation area (in Huaytapallana) and is currently considering the establishment of a
payment for environmental services scheme in coordination with the Ministry of Environment.
CARE continues to be engaged in the Santa Teresa – Cusco area, and as a follow-up of Project
initiatives, is currently implementing an early warning system as a disaster risk management tool.
CARE underlines their valuable contributions in both technical and institutional aspects of the
Project, especially in Peru (preparation of technical documents that originated the creation of the
regional conservation area, implementation of the early warning system, validation of on-the-
ground adaptation investments carried out by the Project through scientific research together with
local universities, and others). This strengthens CARE’s community-driven approach to adaptation,
which has a strong social component but also technical depth. CARE notes that the gender
dimension has also been significant in Peru’s activities, with initiatives targeted towards improving
income and food security for women in Santa Teresa, Cusco, and other activities in Shullcas, Junin.

Annex 10: Detailed description of original components

Project components, as described in the Project Appraisal Document, were:
Component 1 (Planning). Detailed design of key selected adaptation measures (GEF-SCCF
contribution US$0.4 million; total cost US$1.1 million):
The objective of this component is to complete the design of at least six strategic adaptation
measures to be implemented under Component 2. The objective will be achieved through the
following activities:
Subcomponent 1.1. Design of glacierized basin impacts map (GEF-SCCF contribution US$0.1
million; total cost US$0.6 million): This subcomponent will apply global climate circulation models
developed and run by the Earth Simulator in Japan and use the data generated through project
preparation funds to quantify impacts on glacier retreat, runoff availability, and water regulation at
basin levels. Under this activity, participating countries will develop an impacts map for the
selected glacierized basins. The basins were selected through a set of agreed criteria and in
consultation with key stakeholders during Project preparation.
Subcomponent 1.2. Detailed design of specific adaptation measures (GEF-SCCF contribution
US$0.2 million; total cost US$0.4 million): This subcomponent will overlay the impacts map
designed under Subcomponent 1.1 on the existing and/or planned regional government programs
and investments to adapt to glacier retreat impacts. This activity will support the detailed design of
specific adaptation measures, already selected through a broad consultation with major stakeholder
groups in each of the participating countries. Design of the pilot adaptation measures will also
include a strong monitoring mechanism to generate data (e.g., on costs) to feed into the overall
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system of the Project developed under Component 3.
Subcomponent 1.3. Public outreach and dissemination of information (GEF-SCCF contribution
US$0.100 million; total cost: US$0.100 million): This subcomponent has the following objectives:
(i) to improve public knowledge of the actual and expected local impacts of climate change on
tropical glaciers and how their recession will directly affect associated catchments’ ecosystems and
socioeconomic activities in the Andean region; (ii) to disseminate existing information on climate
change, high mountain ecosystems, and glacier retreat recession, and their impacts on: 1) water
supply systems for human consumption and agricultural and livestock use, and the 2) energy sector;
and (iii) raise international awareness on the economic and social costs of tropical glacier retreat.
Outcomes of this component: Integration of the issue of glacier retreat in the regional/local
planning of relevant glacierized basins.


Component 2 (Investment). Implementation of pilot adaptation measures (GEFSCCF
contribution US$5.94 million; total cost US$25.55 million):
Most of the Project’s funding will go into investments in specific adaptation measures addressing
the most pressing priorities in each country, on a pilot basis. The component includes the following
activities:
Subcomponent 2.1. Implementation of pilot adaptation measures in selected communities and
sectors highly vulnerable to the effects of glacier retreat. The following pilot adaptation


                                                 55
interventions for each country have been selected on the basis of magnitude of the impacts and cost
and will be designed during the first year of Project implementation.
ECUADOR
Pilot 1: Increasing water supply resilience for Quito (compensation of regulation loss in the
Antisana watershed) (GEF-SCCF contribution US$0.668 million; total cost US$5.868 million).
The objective of this pilot is to implement a climate change adaptation strategy for water supply to
the city of Quito and surrounding parroquias. The pilot will include following subactivities: (i)
support to the development of a new potable water supply project for the Quito metropolitan district
(QMD), (ii) implementation of climate change adaptation measures aimed at conserving and
managing other basins that supply potable water to QMD, specifically focused on water demand
management aiming at reductions in per capita use, for example, the adoption of water efficient
devices for domestic use; and (iii) implementation of a monitoring system to assess water
availability and the evolution of the impacts associated with global warming. The new potable
water supply will be implemented in a manner that would avoid impacts on other users (i.e.,
through the tapping of sources that are not currently in use by other communities, including non
urban communities to ensure there is no negative impact on them).
Pilot 2: Integrated Watershed Management Plan for the Antisana microcatchments to better
cope with the impacts associated with glacier retreat (GEF-SCCF contribution US$1.282
million; total cost US$2.027 million). The objective is to: (i) compensate for the decrease in the
effectiveness of water storage capacity, due to increases in precipitation variability in selected
catchments; (ii) minimize the potential negative effects of climate change on highly vulnerable local
communities in the area, which in most cases live in poverty conditions; and (iii) develop a
participatory páramos management plan in order to protect and maintain healthy associated
ecosystems and hydrological balance, and implement its main strategic adaptation measures. The
main activities include the development and adoption of a community-based Catchment
Management Plan including: (i) development of participatory integrated management plans for
selected microcatchments and Páramo ecosystems; (ii) implementation of a community
strengthening program for each participating community; (iii) focusing attention on sectors where
climate change will most seriously impact the existing ecosystems, and where adaptive practices are
more relevant; and (iv) implementation of alternative productive programs within a production
chain approach suitable for local communities and other relevant actors. On the ground measures
are: revised water demand management plan (with emphasis on net reductions on per capita water
usage), climate resilient agricultural plan (with emphasis on promotion of drought resistant cultivars
for crops raised in the community), fire management plan for Paramo vegetation (with an emphasis
on fire prevention and response system). All mentioned activities will incorporate climate change
considerations, including assessments of glacier runoff and of increased evapotranspiration and
temperature in the high mountain ecosystems of the Andes.
BOLIVIA
Pilot 1: Integrated Watershed Management in the Tuni and Condoriri basins, incorporating
the impact of rapid glacier retreat (GEF-SCCF contribution US$1.2 million; total cost US$2.873
million). This activity seeks to include provisions that compensate for the impacts of glacier retreat
on water availability through: (i) development of a strategic water management plan for the Tuni
and Condoriri basins; (ii) replacement of water regulation loss through the design and set up of
water impounding schemes and other key, high-priority interventions (i.e., optimization of existing


                                                 56
infrastructure to reduce losses in water supply to urban users) required to compensate for the loss of
water regulation capabilities in the glaciers; (iii) operation of a monitoring and evaluation system to
identify lessons learned and guide policy dialogue.
Pilot 2: Integrated Pilot Catchment Management Plan for watersheds affected by rapid
glacier retreat in the Bolivian plateau and high valleys (GEF-SCCF contribution US$0.75
million; total cost US$1.1 million). This pilot will support activities to adapt agriculture and
livestock activities to the loss of water regulation and supply caused by glacier runoff in the
Bolivian plateau and high valleys. Specific activities include: (i) building and operating small civil
structures in selected places where water scarcity induced by glacier retreat is projected to stress
local economic activities; (ii) implementing reforestation and revegetation to decrease erosion rates,
and promote infiltration; (iii) applying water conservation practices (drip irrigation and mulching,
closed water tanks) for agricultural and livestock activities; (iv) implementing a Water Management
Plan with the help of local communities to make efficient use of reduced water resources in their
daily activities.
Pilot 3: Mainstreaming Adaptive River Defense for the Huayhuasi and El Palomar
Settlements (WB US$0.427 million; total cost US$0.477 million). The objective of this pilot is to
develop a social model that entails the implementation of measures for disaster prevention and
reduction of vulnerabilities to climate change impacts. The pilot aims to decrease risk and
vulnerability to extreme events (floods) of the Huayhuasi and El Palomar rural communities in the
La Paz River. This will be done through the implementation of adaptation pilots (improved adaptive
construction), which will count on communal participation for the regulation and control of the La
Paz River by means of adaptive best practices for disaster risk management.
PERU
Pilot 1: Implementation of a Water Management Plan aimed at: (i) improving water use
practices in the agricultural and livestock sectors, and (ii) improving water storage
infrastructure at selected basins’ headwaters to address negative effects caused by temporary
increase in runoff (GEF-SCCF contribution US$0.815 million; total cost US$4.640 million). The
activity seeks to improve water availability and its use for agriculture and livestock through: (i) the
implementation of a Water Management Plan to improve water use practices (systems for irrigation,
improvement in efficiency of water use to compensate the reduction in water regulation induced by
glacier retreat); (ii) the improvement infrastructure for water storage in selected areas to prevent
negative impacts due to overflows caused by temporary increase in runoff from accelerated glacier
melting to address negative effects caused by temporary increase in run-off : (a) a glacier lake
outbursts early warning systems to prevent negative impacts due to overflows caused by unstable
moraine-dammed glacial lakes; (b) a disaster prevention program to protect local communities from
catastrophic events such as glacier outburst floods, including an action plan to help communities
cope with glacier catastrophes caused by rapid glacier retreat; the resources will be applied, as a
pilot, in the upper Mantaro Valley. (iii) the development of a reforestation program at the basin
headwaters in Shullcas (Mantaro Valley, Junín) and Santa Teresa (Vilcanota–Urubamba Valley,
Cusco), which may include the following activities: 1) Preparing plants in nurseries for the
reforestation of 1,900 hectares at the basin headwaters in Shullcas and reforestation of 400 hectares
in Santa Teresa. 2) Developing and implementing a forestry management plan and training sessions
for its execution by local communities. (iv) the implementation reforestation to promote water
retention. It will also facilitate the creation of a protected natural area for the purpose of protecting
and conserving the hydrological system of the Huaytapallana glacier and associated small lakes as


                                                   57
the principal source for the generation of water resources, biodiversity, and the scenic beauty of the
upper zone of the Shullcas River basin. (v) Facilitating the generation of specific projects that are in
line with development and research aimed at the conservation of the area’s natural resources
Pilot 2: Implementation of an Agricultural Production Plan that compensates for reduction of
water availability to the agricultural sector as a result of rapid glacier retreat (GEF-SCCF
contribution US$0.965 million; total cost US$6.965 million). This pilot will implement a plan for
the diversification of agricultural production which will aim to improve competitiveness and food
security, reduce agricultural production losses, and implement agricultural good practices adapted
to the anticipated consequences of glacier retreat in the area. It would include the following actions:
(i) identification and implementation of pilot plots of drought-resistant crops; (ii) facilitate the
purchase of seeds and inputs to promote drought-resistant cultivars in the areas of the Shullcas and
Santa Teresa sub-basins; (iii) promote changes in agricultural exports to adapt to anticipated
conditions and address the basic needs of financing for the purchase of seeds and inputs for
production in the areas of Shullcas and Santa Teresa sub-basins; (iv) develop a program for the
application of adapted agricultural practices; and (v) develop a program for technology transfer to
sustain adapted agricultural practices in the Mantaro Valley.
Pilot 3: Implementation of an Integrated Water Management Plan that incorporates
reductions in glacier runoff contributions in Huancayo (GEF-SCCF contribution US$0.260
million; total cost US$1.155 million). Objectives: To improve the availability of water for human
consumption by rationalizing the use of water and through research on alternative sources of water
supply. The following activities are contemplated: (i) implementing improvements, as required, of
the drinking water supply infrastructure (storage tanks and reservoirs and rain collection systems);
(ii) implementing a strategy to plan the use of drinking water and agricultural water; (iii)
developing a program with local communities on the rationalization and efficient use of water for
human consumption (adoption of water-saving practices and tools).
Outcomes of this component: The key outcome of this component is the incorporation ofglacier
retreat impacts in sector policies in the areas of intervention.


Component 3 (Scientific Support). Monitoring of glacier retreat in the region (GEFSCCF
contribution US$0.450 million; total cost US$2.30 million). The first two subcomponents (3.1 and
3.2) would support, primarily with assistance from a Climate Change Implementation Grant and
from other technical and scientific institutions, the installation and operation of a monitoring
network to measure the gradual process of glacier retreat in the region in order to enable better
long-term planning for further adaptation of policy and interventions. The third subcomponent (3.3)
is financed by GEF-SCCF and is aimed at analyzing and monitoring the behavior of tropical
glaciers and related wetlands in light of climate change. Component 3 will not only be supported by
GEF-SCCF and CCIG grants but it will also receive contributions from the Japanese Space Agency,
NOAA, and IRD.
The monitoring program has three subcomponents:
Subcomponent 3.1. Design and set-up of field stations to monitor tropical glaciers of economic
relevance. This component will finance the design, installation, and operation of eight glacier
monitoring stations, located at or near tropical glaciers of economic relevance.




                                                  58
Subcomponent 3.2. Use of high-precision remote sensing to monitor tropical glaciers and
associated ecosystems through the use of the Japanese Space Agency ALOS satellite (Advanced
Land Observing Satellite or DAICHI). This component will support the use of ALOS data for
remote sensing of tropical glaciers. Specifically, the component will support: a) data access from
ALOS; b) data compilation and storage; and c) data interpretation and use. ALOS data will be
complemented with photogrammetry for specific glaciers.
Subcomponent 3.3 (Peru). Analysis and monitoring of the behavior of tropical glaciers and their
associated mountain wetlands in light of climate change. This subcomponent will be financed by
GEF-SCCF and includes the following activities: a) compilation and analysis of baseline data and
analysis of the expected behavior of tropical glaciers in light of climate change: estimates of future
glacier retreat for several CC (SERES) scenarios for a variety of GCM and RCM (dynamic
downscaling) options. The work would include the analysis of watershed response (hydrology) for
selected basins; b) compilation and analysis of baseline data and analysis of the role played by
páramos (mountain wetlands) in fixing (collecting) atmospheric carbon and in the water cycle,
including the monitoring those changes, and providing a sound basis for planning adaptation
measures; c) monitoring of water cycles in specific glaciated basins of major economic relevance;
d) design and set up of field stations to monitor the hydrology and carbon cycle of mountain
wetlands.
Outcomes of this component: Effective use of the monitoring network’s information as an input to
planning and to decisions taken to support its long-term operation.


Component 4. Project management (GEF-SCCF contribution US$0.70 million; total cost
US$3.77 million). This component will support the overall technical coordination of Project
activities (including the implementation of a technical monitoring system) as well as the Project’s
administrative and financial management. It will include goods, consultancy services, travel, and
operating costs undertaken by Project management. Specifically, this component will finance the
project coordinator, the procurement specialist, other required personnel for project management,
and the project’s external audits.

Annex 11: Approved changes in Components after MTR
Changes at the component level included the following:
Reorganization of activities to create a new Component: a fifth component focused on the
development of regional knowledge and learning activities on adaptation to climate change and
glacier retreat was added to the Project. This was requested in order to: (i) provide a more robust
regional depth to the Project, with targeted joint regional activities that would benefit from the
regional cover and vocation of the activities (the Tropical Andes is a regional hotspot); and (ii) the
Project was generating scientific knowledge, methodological approaches and operational expertise
in each of the participating countries that could be better systematized, utilized and disseminated by
the other participants. The component would promote South-South cooperation, bring worldwide
cutting edge research institutions to the region, and support SGCAN on its mandate to promote
integration among their member countries on topics relevant at the regional level.
Reorganization of components: the components were reorganized (i.e. some components renamed,
some sub-components and activities rearranged) in order to better reflect the logic and interventions
of the Project (see the table below). In the original Project, component 1 included both scientific
research and the design of the pilot adaptation measures, while component 2 involved the
implementation of the pilots. At the time of the MTR it was clear that adaptation measures could
not be accomplished independently, there must be an integration of the processes of identification,
prioritization and implementation of activities. Sub-component 1.2 (detailed design of specific
adaptation measures) was therefore incorporated into component 2 (which was therefore renamed
as Design and Implementation of Pilot Adaptation Measures). Sub-component 1.3 (public outreach
and dissemination of information) and Sub-components 3.3 b and c were included under the new
component 5 to enhance the regional character of dissemination activities.

Annex 12: Additional changes as part of the Restructuring of the Project
a.      Adjustment of pilot adaptation measures: descriptions of pilot adaptation measures in
Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru were updated, reflecting the progress made in the identification,
prioritization and design of the pilots during Project implementation. For some pilots, the target was
adjusted, to take into account the request of the Implementing Agency to limit the number of civil
works under the Project, and that the design of several pilots had taken longer than anticipated in
the original Project design, because they were complex interventions that required contributions
from many institutions, sectors and actors. None of the proposed modifications changed the
objectives of the pilot adaptation measures or the scope of the Project.
Modifications proposed for Peru’s adaptation pilots did not imply any substantive change.
Activities would be carried out as planned, however the pilots would be re-organized to focus on
two regional areas (Shullcas and Santa Teresa) instead of type of activities (e.g., agriculture, and
water management).9 This regrouping of activities around areas and not themes reduced the number
of pilots from the original three to two (one in Shullcas, one in Santa Teresa) which nevertheless
included the same activities foreseen formerly but clustered differently.
In Ecuador, the Project was promoting activities in two different locations with different partners,
divided into two pilot projects. The objective of pilot project 1 remained to increase the climate
resilience of the water supply to Quito, and the restructuring centralized efforts on the development
of knowledge activities to increase the resilience of an existing water supply system for Quito (Pita-
Puengasí), as well as small scale interventions to protect the higher areas of the catchment - where
most of the water for Quito is extracted- from anthropogenic activities. The pilot would also
contribute to the development of a water resources and climate monitoring system and support the
generation of data needed for water resources planning in the Pita basin. The content of pilot 2
remained largely unchanged.
In Bolivia, the objectives of the three pilots remained largely unchanged, and the restructuring
provided further description for each of them (original Project designs and descriptions were
prepared at a general conceptual level). .

b.      Adjustment of the Results Framework: outcome (indicated in section 1.3 above) and output
indicators in the Results Framework were adjusted to (i) include new indicators for the new
Component 5 (regional activities), (ii) revise the targets in function of the Project pace of
implementation, and (iii) put more emphasis on the quality of the processes involved in the
identification, prioritization, design and implementation of pilot adaptation measures; as well as the
ownership by key agencies and institutions. The aim of the changes was to: (i) establish a clear link
between Project’s objectives and outcomes; and (ii) establish a clear link between outputs and
outcomes. The Results Framework (indicating original and restructured indicators) is presented in
Annex 2.

 The original project documents described a wide variety of activities to be undertaken under each pilot. The amendment focused on
developing a set of activities that as a group, aimed at the same objectives of the original pilot descriptions, organized by
geographical location instead, rather than by topics.

e.     Operational Manual: in addition to the updates in components and everything that entailed
from an operational perspective, two main changes were included:
   •   Revision and inclusion of a clear definition of the flow of internal procedures within the
       SGCAN to expedite starting of activities, issuance of contracts, payments, among others.
       The Project had been experiencing long delays in handling operational procedures and clear
       guidelines, with specific time frames applicable to the Project were missing.
   •   An update of the environmental management framework. Further detail is provided in
       section 2.4 of this ICR.
