development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. The\n            key lessons learned are as follows:  Careful, early-planned\n            partnerships with key stakeholders increases the viability\n            and chances of Project success. Climate change adaptation\n            requires extensive bottom-up work and community development.\n            The ability of countries to increase their climate change\n            resilience is directly linked to their capacity to generate\n            and analyze data to assess vulnerability.
