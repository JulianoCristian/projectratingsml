                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The broad development objective of the proposed project is to contribute to strengthening the resilience of local ecosystems and economies to the impacts of glacier
                         retreat in the Tropical Andes, through the implementation of specific pilot adaptation activities that illustrate the costs and benefits of adaptation. The specific objectives
                         of the project, in support of this broad objective, are: a) the effective integration of the implications of glacier retreat into the regional and local planning in glacierized
                         basins; b) the inclusion of glacier retreat impacts in local, sector development projects; and c) generation of data on glacier dynamics.

                         The project continues to make significant progress. Most of the activities are already finalized or about to be concluded. Current ongoing activities are mostly focused on workshops,
                         publications, and dissemination of results. Some achievements by country include:

                         Bolivia has finalized the preparation of their glacier, water bodies and moorlands or paramo inventories. These were based on ALOS satellite images, and are now published. The

                         collaboration with EPSAS (the water utility for La Paz and El Alto) is also concluded: activities to reduce water losses and unaccounted for water were a success and are being
                         replicated by EPSAS in other water districts. Activities to identify alternatives for water supply to El Alto in the short term also concluded. This initiative identified a menu of options,
                         and a suggested prioritization and cost estimate. Institutional strengthening of the utility in climate change and integrated water management concepts, as well as strengthening of
                         their social department, is concluded. The construction of pilot irrigation systems in the communities of Batallas and Palca is ongoing. In both cases work is more than 50% complete,
                         and conclusion is expected for the first quarter of 2014.

                         Ecuador has received, tested, installed and is currently receiving information from the ten hydro-meteorological stations purchased by the project. The communications system for two
                         high altitude monitoring stations has also been upgraded. The activities carried out in paramo ecosystems are virtually completed, one of them related to adaptive management of the
                         ecosystem in Papallacta area, with community work and a number of activities aimed at reducing anthropogenic pressure on the paramo, and the other related to restoration of
                         degraded paramo areas. Eco-tourism activities in the Papallacta region are also concluded. A small water supply and sanitation pilot project in the Tambo community is virtually
                         finalized. The information system carried out with FONAG for the integrated management of water resources in the Gayllabamba, Papallacta and Antisana areas has been
                         concluded. Parts of module four were not completed due to difficulties with data. Workshops are being planned for January-February 2014.

                         Peru has virtually finalized all activities. All reforestation, infiltration trenches, native grassland regeneration, irrigation systems, canal improvements in Shullcas are concluded.
                         Institutional strengthening in Santa Teresa, with various demonstration interventions to adapt to climate change, are concluded. Work carried out in paramo ecosystems in Piura
                         (creation of a dynamic paramo hydrological model, and implementation of a monitoring system) is concluded. Workshops are being planned for January-February 2014.

                         The regional component has also made remarkable progress. A number of documents with a systematization of experiences have been prepared; documents synthesizing lessons
                         learned, achievements and gaps, are also available. This component also implemented numerous workshops to share experiences amongst the national meteorological
                         organizations of the participating countries, workshops with direct project beneficiaries, and others with strategic partners (CARE, water utilities of Ecuador and Bolivia, and others).
                         The AndesPlus initiative also concluded, and a publication of the executive summary has been prepared. Finally, the closing workshop of the project was also implemented (the
                         project is not yet closed, but most activities are). The closing workshop took place in Lima, November 28-29, 2013.
