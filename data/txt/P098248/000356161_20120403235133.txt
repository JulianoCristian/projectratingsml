7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The broad development objective of the proposed project is to contribute to strengthening the resilience of
local ecosystems and economies to the impacts of glacier retreat in the Tropical Andes, through the
implementation of specific pilot adaptation activities that illustrate the costs and benefits of adaptation. The
specific objectives of the project, in support of this broad objective, are: a) the effective integration of the
implications of glacier retreat into the regional and local planning in glacierized basins; b) the inclusion of
glacier retreat impacts in local, sector development projects; and c) generation of data on glacier dynamics.
