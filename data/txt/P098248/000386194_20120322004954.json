"versiontyp": "Buff cover", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The development objective of the\n            Adaptation to the Impact of Rapid Glacier Retreat in the\n            Tropical Andes Project is to contribute to strengthening the\n            resilience of local ecosystems and economies to the impacts\n            of glacier retreat in the Tropical Andes. Good progress has\n            been achieved overall in the generation of scientific\n            knowledge and capacity strengthening on climate change and\n            glacier monitoring. Climate change scenarios have been\n            generated in Peru and Ecuador, and are being elaborated in\n            Bolivia, and models have been developed to assess impacts on\n            the water and agricultural sectors in selected areas of the\n            participating countries. The Mid Term Review (MTR) of the\n            project identified the need to restructure the project. This\n            paper presents the restructuring, which entails: (i)\n            creation of the regional knowledge sharing among the\n            Beneficiaries (Plurinational State of Bolivia, Republic of\n            Ecuador, and Republic of Peru); (ii) reorganization of\n            project components, (iii) adjustment of some pilot\n            adaptation measures, without changing the objective; (iv)\n            adjustment of the results framework; (v) reallocation of\n            proceeds to fit the revised project structure; and (vi)\n            updating the project cost estimates and financing plan. A\n            work plan outlining the activities to be completed by\n            project closure has been agreed upon by the implementing\n            agency and the beneficiaries. The changes do not affect the\n            scope of the project or it's Project Development\n            Objective (PDO). They are intended to better reflect the\n            nature of the project, which is innovative and unique in\n            many aspects. It is not a traditional infrastructure or\n            agriculture or water project, although it involves all those\n            sectors. As such, the importance of the whole process\n            carried out throughout the life of the Project is being stressed."}, "docdt": "2011-08-17T00:00:00Z"}
