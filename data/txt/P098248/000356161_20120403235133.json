The closing\n            date of the project will be extended to September 30, 2013.\n            The current restructuring only seeks a one-year extension to\n            ensure adequate project implementation, with no other\n            changes to the project. As such, the appraisal\n            considerations included in the 2011 restructuring remain\n            valid. Granting a one-year extension will allow for adequate\n            dissemination of success stories and will ultimately help\n            countries attract extra funds towards critical sectors\n            likely impacted by climate change.
