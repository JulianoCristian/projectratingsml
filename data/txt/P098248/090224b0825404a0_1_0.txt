                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The broad development objective of the proposed project is to contribute to strengthening the resilience of local ecosystems and economies to the impacts of glacier
                         retreat in the Tropical Andes, through the implementation of specific pilot adaptation activities that illustrate the costs and benefits of adaptation. The specific objectives
                         of the project, in support of this broad objective, are: a) the effective integration of the implications of glacier retreat into the regional and local planning in glacierized
                         basins; b) the inclusion of glacier retreat impacts in local, sector development projects; and c) generation of data on glacier dynamics.

                         Initial findings indicate that the Project has achieved its objectives and beyond. The World Bank team witnessed a high degree of satisfaction among the different project
                         stakeholders, including high level officials of the three participating countries’ ministries of environment (Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru). The Project has turned into a flagship climate change
                         adaptation initiative in the region.

                         The Project has received a tremendous amount of attention amongst mass media both nationally and internationally, with specific mentions in some of the main blogs, journals and
                         TV news shows. The Project has made a substantial contribution in supporting countries adapt to climate change impacts at different levels, from policy making to scientific
                         knowledge generation, strengthened monitoring systems, on-the-ground pilot interventions, strategic planning with the inclusion of the climate change dimension, capacity building,
                         dissemination, and regional sharing.

                         Capacity to assess the impacts of climate change in general, and the impact of glacier melting in particular has been strengthened in all participating countries, and has contributed to
                         policy formulation and the definition of adaptation strategies/plans of different levels of government (e.g., update/formulation of the climate change strategy of the regional
                         governments of Cusco and Junin in Peru; formulation of the zoning plan of the decentralized government of Papallacta in Ecuador, which also promoted the inclusion of the climate
                         change variable in the plans nationwide; preparation of the integrated management plans for the basins of Choquecota and Khullucachi in Bolivia).

                         Further, it has contributed to the formulation of strategies and investment activities of the water utility companies (Adaptive Management Plan for the Pita-Pungasi water supply
                         system in Ecuador, and paramo conservation and restoration for water supply, with the EPMAPS water utility in Quito; Water and Sanitation Master Plan for the cities of La Paz and
                         El Alto, and short and medium term package for climate change adaptation to the EPSAS water utility in La Paz and El Alto; support to the work of the water company SEDAM in
                         Huancayo in Peru). The Project has also facilitated the implementation of several adaptation activities that have contributed to the increased resilience of highland communities and
                         of high mountain critical ecosystems (such as improved irrigation schemes, with canal linings and sprinkler irrigation in Peru and Bolivia, or a pilot water supply and sanitation project
                         in Ecuador).

                         The Project's contribution towards knowledge creation and sharing has been substantive. It has promoted the regional exchange of scientific information, which has helped
                         strengthen the capacity at the regional level and has also allowed for the identification of the strengths of the scientific community among the different countries. It is notable the work
                         of climate change scenarios done by SENAHMI in Peru, the work on glacier dynamics in Bolivia which includes the creation of a very precise national glacier inventory, high mountain
                         water bodies and moorlands, and the inclusion of climate change modules in the monitoring system of the high Guayllabamba basin in Ecuador.

                         Some detailed results per country are:

                         Bolivia finalized the preparation of their glacier, water bodies and moorlands or paramo inventories. These were based on ALOS satellite images, and are now published. The
                         collaboration with EPSAS (the water utility for La Paz and El Alto) is also concluded: activities to reduce water losses and unaccounted for water were a success and are being
                         replicated by EPSAS in other water districts. Activities to identify alternatives for water supply to El Alto in the short term also concluded. This initiative identified a menu of options,

                         and a suggested prioritization and cost estimate. Institutional strengthening of the utility in climate change and integrated water management concepts, as well as strengthening of
                         their social department, is concluded. The construction of pilot irrigation systems in the communities of Batallas and Palca are both fully concluded and operational.

                         Ecuador has received, tested, installed and is currently receiving information from the ten hydro-meteorological stations purchased by the project. The communications system for two
                         high altitude monitoring stations has also been upgraded. The activities carried out in paramo ecosystems were completed, one of them related to adaptive management of the
                         ecosystem in Papallacta area, with community work and a number of activities aimed at reducing anthropogenic pressure on the paramo, and the other related to restoration of
                         degraded paramo areas. Some of these activities are planned with a long term horizon, since paramo dynamics are slow. Eco-tourism activities in the Papallacta region are
                         concluded. A small water supply and sanitation pilot project in the Tambo community is finalized, the system is working and delivering water to its users. A water user's association
                         was legally formed and is operating. The information system carried out with FONAG for the integrated management of water resources in the Guayllabamba, Papallacta and
                         Antisana areas has been concluded. Parts of module four are being finalized by FONAG to complement the work carried out by the project.

                         The regional component was also fully implemented. A number of documents with a systematization of experiences have been prepared; documents synthesizing lessons learned,
                         achievements and gaps, are also available. This component also implemented numerous workshops to share experiences amongst the national meteorological organizations of the
                         participating countries, workshops with direct project beneficiaries, and others with strategic partners (CARE, water utilities of Ecuador and Bolivia, and others). The AndesPlus
                         initiative also concluded, and a publication of the executive summary has been prepared.

                         The closing workshop of the project took place in Lima, November 28-29, 2013. It was very well attended, by high level decision makers of the beneficiary countries at the national
                         level; sub-national level representatives from Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia; strategic partners such as CARE, SENAMHI Bolivia and Peru, INAMHI Ecuador, IDEAM Colombia. Water
                         enterprises such as EPSAS Bolivia and EPMAPS Ecuador; and direct project beneficiaries, such as farmers from Peru or Bolivia. The workshop was a success; participants stressed
                         the achievements of PRAA and its fundamental role in pushing the adaptation to climate change agenda in the region.
