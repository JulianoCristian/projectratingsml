                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The broad development objective of the proposed project is to contribute to strengthening the resilience of local ecosystems and economies to the impacts of glacier
                         retreat in the Tropical Andes, through the implementation of specific pilot adaptation activities that illustrate the costs and benefits of adaptation. The specific objectives
                         of the project, in support of this broad objective, are: a) the effective integration of the implications of glacier retreat into the regional and local planning in glacierized
                         basins; b) the inclusion of glacier retreat impacts in local, sector development projects; and c) generation of data on glacier dynamics.

                         During this reporting period, the project was restructured in order to update the description of some activities, including the incorporation of a fifth component. The fifth component
                         was created with the scope of strengthening the regional dimension of the project, collect and inter-compare results, share experiences and methodologies, and disseminate lessons.

                         Activities are progressing at different pace in the three beneficiary countries, but still the project has started to play a role in the inclusion of climate change considerations in the

                         definition of policy instruments at local and regional level in all of them.

                         Activities in Bolivia have progressed notably: definition and final design of all activities has been finalized, and are currently in the procurement phase. Substantial resources have
                         been devoted to acquisition of equipment and software to increase efficiency of the potable water distribution system for La Paz and El Alto; key strategic consultancies to devise
                         action plans to reduce water losses, and studies to identify adaptation measures to manage future higher demand and lower water availability, are in the selection phase. Pilot
                         demonstration irrigation systems in Batallas and Palca are fully designed, and selection of contractors will start shortly. The implementation of community-based development
                         activities are well advance under the leadership of CARE, strategic partner of the project. On the knowledge side, Bolivia has just finished the national glacier inventory, a thorough
                         study using advanced satellite imagery and other techniques to characterize and map the glaciers of the country.
                         The agility of the procurement of goods, works and consultancies, and the proficiency of the awarded firms and contractors, will have an important weigh in ensuring the achievement
                         of objectives for the country.

                         In Ecuador progress has been less evident, but has accelerated in the past months. A critical consultancy to perform a climate change vulnerability analysis of the Pita basin is
                         underway. Technical specifications for a pilot water supply and sanitation system in Papallacta are finalized, and several activities targeted towards high-mountain wetlands
                         (paramos) conservation and protection, sustainable small-scale cattle and farming practices, and ecologic tourism activities in Papallacta are in final stages of design or under
                         procurement. Specifications for the purchase of hydro, meteorological and rainfall monitoring stations that will support a monitoring system to assess water availability have been
                         prepared.

                         In Peru, two of the four adaptation activities implemented in the Shullcas-basin pilot area, have been finalized and are performing their first test runs (water-efficient irrigation systems,
                         and improvement of an irrigation canal). The reforestation and conservation of natural grasslands activities are well underway, with some minor delays. Substantial and
                         comprehensive technical support and assistance to users and communities has been given by CARE. In Santa Teresa, the other selected pilot area, activities led by CARE are well
                         advanced, and dissemination and lessons learned are now being collected through the project. The only critical activity pending is a consultancy to study the impacts of climate
                         change on the paramo ecosystem in Piura, for which terms of reference have already been prepared.

                         The implementation of activities within the recently created regional component is progressing slowly. This was affected by the resignation of the regional coordinator of the project in
                         July, position that still has not been filled-in. Among the key tasks of the new coordinator will be to speed up the implementation of the regional activities.

                         All high-mountain monitoring stations have been installed.

                         The project is due to close in September 2012, and most activities are expected to be completed by then. Still, it has been agreed that as assessment of the need to extend the
                         project closing date will be done during the first quarter of 2012.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Following a request from the Implementing Agency (SGCA), the project has been restructured. The designs and technical specifications of most activities are now available, and most
                         activities are expected to be completed by project closure (September 2012). However, because the time required to contract and implement of a specific few activities might be more
                         than currently available, it has been agreed that the possibility to extend the project will be discussed during the first quarter of 2012.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
