The closing\n            date of the project will be extended to September 30, 2013.\n            The current restructuring only seeks a one-year extension to\n            ensure adequate project implementation, with no other\n            changes to the project. As such, the appraisal\n            considerations included in the 2011 restructuring remain\n            valid. Granting a one-year extension will allow for adequate\n            dissemination of success stories and will ultimately help\n            countries attract extra funds towards critical sectors\n            likely impacted by climate change. The extension will\n            further allow consolidation of methodologies, dissemination\n            of lessons and knowledge sharing."}, "docdt": "2012-03-28T00:00:00Z"}
