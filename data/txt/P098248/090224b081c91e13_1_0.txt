                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The broad development objective of the proposed project is to contribute to strengthening the resilience of local ecosystems and economies to the impacts of glacier
                         retreat in the Tropical Andes, through the implementation of specific pilot adaptation activities that illustrate the costs and benefits of adaptation. The specific objectives
                         of the project, in support of this broad objective, are: a) the effective integration of the implications of glacier retreat into the regional and local planning in glacierized
                         basins; b) the inclusion of glacier retreat impacts in local, sector development projects; and c) generation of data on glacier dynamics.

                         During this reporting period, the Project has continued to make significant progress. All activities are expected to be finalized by project closing date (September 30, 2013), and
                         objectives are expected to be achieved.

                         Bolivia. The pilot project aimed at increasing water supply resilience for La Paz and El Alto, in close collaboration with EPSAS, is mostly completed. All equipment has been bought

                         and installed; the consultancy to reduce unaccounted for water is finalized, and EPSAS is replicating it in other districts; the consultancy to identify short and medium-term water
                         supply alternatives is in the final stages of implementation; capacity building is underway; and the technical strengthening of EPSAS's social department is proceeding. The
                         implementation phase of two irrigation schemes, for Batallas and Palca, has suffered some delays due to the difficulties the first contractor encountered in the execution of works.
                         Two new contractors have been selected and works have just begun in both locations. Construction is expected to be finalized right before project closing date. Glacier, high
                         mountain lagoons and paramo inventories of the Cordillera Real are all finalized, and a new study is updating the inventory for other glaciated areas of the country, using a new batch
                         of ALOS satellite images. The climate change scenarios for the country, using the Japanese model, are finalized. The systematization of lessons and experiences is ongoing.

                         Ecuador. Activities to strengthen the monitoring capacity of INAMHI to record climate variability and change are underway, ten meteorological stations have been bought, delivered to
                         INAMHI, and are now in the process of being installed in critical points around selected paramo areas. Two studies on paramo ecosystems, one for improved paramo management
                         and reduced pressures from cattle and provoked fires, and the other related to paramo restoration, are well underway. In conjunction, a water supply and sanitation pilot system in
                         Papallacta, aimed at reducing stress from inappropriate water management, is around 65% completed and expected to conclude in time (there have been some delays due to
                         interferences with the nearby road construction). An emblematic study related to the vulnerability assessment for the Pita basin is finalized, and the analysis of natural protected areas
                         in the Antisana region is ongoing. The web-based information system for integrated water resources management in the Guayllabamba, Papallacta and Antisana catchments from
                         FONAG, delayed several times due to the complexity of activities, is now over 90% finalized. Climate change scenarios using the Japanese model are ready, and climate trends
                         using Climdex information are being prepared. The systematization of lessons and experiences is ongoing.

                         Activities in Peru are mostly finalized. The initiatives in Shullcas (reforestation, regeneration of native pastures, infiltration trenches, irrigation schemes, canal improvements, small
                         reservoirs construction) are completed. An activity being done in partnership with UN-Habitat on increased water supply efficiency in a pilot Huancayo district is close to completion.
                         The activities in Santa Teresa (related to capacity building and strengthening of the municipality to adapt to climate change) are also completed. The activities in Piura, related to
                         modeling of paramo's hydrological behavior, are concluded, and the ones on paramo monitoring are well advanced. Activities performed by SENAMHI, on generation of climate
                         change models, agro-climatology and hydrology, have been completed. The past six months have been devoted mainly to the collection of lessons, analysis of results, and
                         implementation of workshops amongst different actors to consolidate the experiences generated through the project.

                         The regional component has made significant progress. The AndesPlus activities, related to the design of a methodology to produce scientific baselines for adaptation projects, and
                         knowledge exchange and strengthening, have been completed. As a result, several high-level scientific publications have been prepared, and scientists from the Andean region and
                         Europe have collaborated to improve mutual understanding and knowledge. Other regional activities related to the increased cohesion of practitioners, cross-learning and cross-
                         fertilization, are advanced. A number of regional workshops have been carried out. These have included scientific topics for the meteorological institutes, glacier monitoring, issues for
                         adaptation practitioners, and a very interesting exchange between beneficiary communities. A project web page is active and contains information from the three countries and
                         regional component. Other dissemination products are being prepared.

                         All activities related to glacier monitoring (including 8 high-altitude automatic monitoring stations, and use of satellite images) have been completed.
