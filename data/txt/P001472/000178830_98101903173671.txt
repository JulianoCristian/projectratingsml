INTERNATIONAL DEV1LOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECCMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
DEVELOPMENT CREDIT TO THE MALAGASY REPUBLIC
FOR AN IRRIGATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation  on a propcsed
credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$5 million to
the Malagasy Republic to assist in financing an irrigation project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        In October 1968, the Government of the Malagasy Republic
asked for assistance in financing an irrigation project in the south-
western part of Lake Alaotra, a vast depression in the Central Plateau
of Madagascar. Feasibility studies undertaken by the French consulting
firm SOGREAH, under contract to the Rural Engineering Services (Genie
Rural) of the Ministry of Agriculture, were completed by the end of
summer 1 969 under the guidance of the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program.
The project was appraised by a mission that visited Madagascar in
October 1969.
3.        Negotiations were held in Washington led first by Mr. Raymond
Rabeharisoa, Secretary General of the Ministry of Agriculture and sub-
sequently by the Honorable Gilbert Ratsitohara, Secretary of State for
Agriculture responsible for Rural Engineering Services. The Malagasy
delegation included representatives of -the Ministries of Agriculture and
Finance, and of the Embassy of the Malagasy Republic in Washington as
well as a lawyer.
4.        Since 1967, the Bank has made six loans and credits to the
Malagasy Republic for five projects; the 1968 Highway project was
financed by a combined loan and credit. The following is a sunmary
statement of those loans and credits as of June 30, 1970:
Loan or Cred-                                      Amount (US$ million)

* Not yet effective



5.        Physical progress under the above-mentioned loans and credits
is generally satisfactory. In two cases, the 1967 educaticn loan and
the 1968 loan and credit for highways, there have been administrative
delays in the preparation of withdrawal requests which have now been
largely overcome. At the Governmentts request, the Association has
agreed that the part of the undisbursed balance of the Highway Credit
No. 90-MAG not required for the original project should be applied to
certain additional construction works and further road studies. To
enable the undisbursed balance to be so applied, the closing date of
this Credit was postponed with the agreement of the Executive Directors
from December 31, 1970 to December 31, 1972 (IDA/R69-76).
6.        Other possible projects at various stages of preparation
include livestock, irrigation and highways. Preliminary consideration
is also being given to the creation of a development finance company
suitable for Bank Group assistance.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED CREDIT
7.        Borrower:              The Malagasy Republic
Amount:                Various currencies equivalent to
US$5 million
Purpose:               To assist in Linancing the improvement
and extension of existing irrigation
facilities over an area of 12,000 ha
for year-round production in the south-
western part of Lake Alaotra.
Amortization:          In 50 years including a 10-year period
of grace, through semi-annual installments
of 1/2 of 1% from October 15, 1980 through
April 15, 1990 and of 1 1/2% from October
15, 1990 through April 15, 2020.
Estimated Economic
Return:              11%
PART III - THE PROJECT
8.        An appraisal report entitled "Lake Alaotra Irrigation Project -
Mlalagasy Republic". (PA-40a), dated July 10 is attached.
9.        The project is designed to provide improvement and extension
of existing irrigation facilities over an area of 12,000 ha for year-
round production. It includes the following works:



- 3 -
(a)  rehabilitation of the irrigation and drainage networks on
4,000 ha presently irrigated;
(b) construction of the irrigation, drainage and road networks
on some 6,000 ha of newly reclaimed areas;
(c) construction of a drainage network on about 2,000 ha of
marshland to be dry-farmed.
The project also includes on-farm development works, the estab-
lishment of an experimental farm for crop diversification, a rural devel-
opment study to examine the means for facilitating permanent settlement
in the project area, agricultural extension services and procurement of
operation and maintenance equipment.
10.       A number of successful irrigation projects have been developed
during the last decade over 14,000 ha in the Lake Alaotra depressions
to the north end southeast of the project area. The project is the
continuation of this development. The rehabilitation of existing
irrigation and drainage systems and construction of new works would
result in an assured water supply during the critical rice-sowing and
transplanting period (October-January) and would increase the irrigated
area from 4,000 ha to 10,000 ha. The project would lead to a significant
expansion in rice production needed to satisfy projected increases in
demand in the domestic and nearby foreign markets. In ten years time
paddy yields under the project will be about 3.5 tons/ha, while without
the project they would be only about 1.4 tons/ha. Gross production would
increase by about 26,000 tons. Furthermore, the agricultural crop
diversification program, combined with an effective extension service,
would permit the growing of new off-season crops, opening the way for
diversified agricultural production in an exclusively rice-growing
district. At full development foreign-exchange earnings would amount to
approximatively US$1.1 million per year. Based on expected world market
rice prices at full agricultural development in 1985, cash income for
the average four hectare farm in the project area, would rise to about
US$660 per annum compared to US$180 per annum without the project, an
increase of US$480.
11.       Particular attention has been given to the recovery of project
costs. Satisfactory present arrangements for collecting charges from
farmers, which would be extended to the project area, would provide for
the recovery of the full cost of on-farm development works plus the local
cost of extension services under a form of 15-year lease acceptable to
the Association.  At the end of the 15 years farmers would receive title
to their land,and thereafter would pay annual charges which would cover the
full cost of irrigation and drainage operation and maintenance, as uell as a
betterment levy which would permit the recovery,over a period of 25 years,
without interest, of the totial cost of the investmnent in irrigation and
drainage works included in the project.



- 4 -
12.       The estimated cost of the project is US$8.2 million, of which
US$5 million (61%) would be in foreign exchange. An IDA credit of
US$5 million is proposed. Under arrangements already established, the
Banque Nationale Malagasy de Developpement (BNM) will provide the
equivalent of US$0.7 million for on-farm development and the French Aid
and Cooperation Agency (FAC) will provide the equivalent of US$0.7 million
for technical assistance including extension services. For simplicity
of disbursement and to fit in with these arrangements, the IDA credit
would be disbursed against:
(a) the foreign exchange portion of contracts covering civil
works including engineering and contingencies, operation
and maintenance equipment and experiments in crop diver-
sification, all of which would amount to US$4.1 million;
and
(b) one half of the local cost of the contracts for civil
works and engineering (including contingencies), this one
half amounting to US$0.9 million.
The Malagasy Republic is a poor country which, in order to achieve an
adequate rate of growth, needs to import capital in amounts exceeding
the foreign exchange cost of projects likely to be financed by foreign
aid. In these special circumstances, I consider the small amount of
local expenditure financing which is proposed on this project, to be
justified.
13.       Assurances were obtained that tendering for civil works, and
for the construction of the experimental station buildings, as well as
procurement of operatiion and maintenance equipment, would be on the
basis of international competitive bidding and carried out in accordance
with the Bank Groupts Guidelines for Procurement.
14.       The Rural Engineering Services will be responsible for carrying
out the civil works and the Soci6t6 d'Am6nagement du Lac Alaotra (SONHALAC)
for carrying out the on-farm development works, agricultural extension
services, the program of experiments in crop diversification, and
operation and maintenance. Both these organizations and particularly
SOMALAC, aided by expatriate experts, have worked well on similar projects
in the Lake Alaotra area in the past and are technically competent.
During negotiations confirmation was given of the intention of the
Malagasy Government to maintain one expatriate project area manager for
six years and three other expatriate technicians for a period of three
years under the assumption that competent Malagasy personnel will replace



- 5 -
them at the end of these respective periods. To assure adequate overall
coordination of all aspects of the project it has been agreed that the
Government shall promptly establish and maintain, at least until com-
pletion of the project, a project coordinating committee which shall
include high ranking representatives of the Central Development Service
of the MIinistry of Agriculture, of the Rural Engineering Services, and
of SOMAIAC. Effectiveness of the credit would be conditional on the
establishment of the committee.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUNENTS AND AUTHORITY
i5.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Malagasy
Republic and the Association, the recommendation of the Committee provid-
ed for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the
Association, and the text of a draft Resolution approving the proposed
Development Credit, are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. The Draft Legal documents conforni in substance to other
agreements foi similar projects.
PART V - THE ECONO0IY
16.       A report on "The Economy of the lialagasy iiepublic" dated
October 8, 1968 (No AF-&3a) was distributed to the Executive Directors
on October 16, 1968 (R 68-193). An economic mission visited Madagascar in
November/December 1969,and a report is expected to be ready soon. A basic
data sheet is annexed.
17.       In spite of a great variety of climatic and physical conditions
which enables the cultivation of a wide range of agricultural products,
the NIalagasy Republic has recently suffered from poor market conditions
for its principal export crops, notably bananas, vanilla and sisal. Other
national resources are limited, and the island remains poor, with a per
capita income of about $100 equivalent.
18.       Recent economic developments, as outlined in my report to
the Executive Directors on the Tamatave port project (P-840), distributed
on June 4, 1970,are characterized by increased public sector investments
and by a slight acceleration of economic growth since 1965.
19.       The ilalagasy Republic has a relatively small external public
debt, with service payments amounting to somewhat over iive percent of
export earning in 1969. Nevertheless, in view of the country's poverty
and modast export prospects, concessionary aid will be required for a
long tLie to come. Consequently, I consider that the Mlalagasy Republic
deserves further assistance from the Association.

PART VI - COIMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
20.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
21.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.
