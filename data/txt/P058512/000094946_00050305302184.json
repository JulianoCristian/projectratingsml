promote equitable use, and coordination\n            of public resources to build a professional basis for the\n            education system. The components will: 1) establish a\n            Quality Fund to finance school grants, teacher training\n            grants, and scholarships, and grants to support\n            institutional strengthening of those institutions offering\n            pre-service, and in-service teacher training; 2) develop a\n            standards and assessment agency, to define performance\n            standards, and assess those standards, through data\n            processing on learning levels at primary, and secondary\n            schools in the country, and promote compatibility with the\n            rest of Europe; 3) finance the development of an education\n            management information system, to enable improved\n            management, and compatibility of information sector wise,\n            among the county's decentralized education systems. It\n            will further test the viability for a budgeting model,\n            designed to promote increased efficiency in education\n            spending; 3) stimulate coordination, innovation, and\n            strategic planning for higher education, through the\n            provision of technical assistance, and training to academics\n            in the country; and, 4) provide reliable data for creating a\n            Poverty Reduction Strategy, and carry out a Living Standards\n            Measurement Study."}, "docdt": "2000-04-19T00:00:00Z"}
