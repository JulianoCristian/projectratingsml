The experience from the\n            successful implementation of the Quality Fund mechanisms,\n            which made resources available directly to the\n            beneficiaries, was used for the preparation of one of the\n            components in the new Education Restructuring Project. These\n            developed mechanisms made it possible to decentralize\n            procurement of goods, and services among schools in the\n            country's fragmented structure, which resulted to a\n            certain extent, in the empowerment of schools, and,\n            increased engagement in the reform process. Notwithstanding,\n            the Project implementation process however, demonstrates a\n            need for further attention to the dialogue with the 10\n            cantonal ministries of education within Bosnia and\n            Herzegovina Federation. These cantonal ministries need to be\n            fully engaged in the dialogue, and endorse the project\n            objectives, to ensure that they provide full support to\n            their implementation."}, "docdt": "2005-06-03T00:00:00Z"}
