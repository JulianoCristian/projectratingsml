requested.
(b)

withdrawn by the Association from the Credit Account under one or more of said 
Special Account’s Eligible Categories.

outstanding special commitments entered into by the Association pursuant to 
Section 5.02 of the General Conditions, in respect of expenditures to be 
financed out of the proceeds of the Credit allocated to said Categories, shall

satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in said Special Account as 
of the date of such notice will be utilized in making payments for Eligible 
Expenditures.
