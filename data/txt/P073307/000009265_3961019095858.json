help achieve accelerated and\n            sustainable growth in agricultural production and\n            productivity with a view to improving food security and\n            reducing poverty. The project is expected to achieve this\n            objective by: a) supporting policy reform to create an\n            enabling environment for the growth of a competitive\n            fertilizer sector; b) supporting institutional strengthening\n            and human resource development; c) promoting increased,\n            efficient and environmentally safe use of fertilizers by the\n            largest possible number of farmers; d) addressing fertilizer\n            supply-side constraints; and e) promoting initiatives to\n            maintain and improve the long-term fertility of the\n            Ethiopian soils and ensuring environmental conservation. By\n            the end of the project period, it is envisaged that\n            Ethiopia's fertilizer sector would have moved from a\n            state controlled to a largely liberalized system with active\n            participation of private sector importers, distributors,\n            wholesalers and retailers in a progressively competitive\n            price and trade environment. This, in turn, is expected to\n            contribute significantly to enhanced food security at the\n            national and household levels, improved management of the\n            Ethiopian soils and the strengthening of fertilizer related institutions."}, "docdt": "1995-04-24T00:00:00Z"}
