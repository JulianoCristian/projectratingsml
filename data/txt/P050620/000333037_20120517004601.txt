F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The original PDOs, as stated in the DCA, were to: (i) promote equitable access to, and
efficient delivery of, quality services in pre-tertiary education; and (ii) foster innovation,
relevance, quality and efficiency in tertiary education.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The revised PDOs were to: (i) improve equitable access to and completion of basic
education in deprived districts; and (ii) improve quality of teaching and learning,
management efficiency, and relevance of post-basic education.

controlled to a market-driven economy, led to a period of renewed economic prosperity
and lower poverty rates. By the early 1990s, the trade regime had been largely liberalized,
the exchange rate was market-determined, macroeconomic imbalances had been
narrowed, and inflation rates had fallen. Despite these impressive gains, weak
macroeconomic management during the electoral cycle, the economy‘s vulnerability to
external shocks, and the failure to implement structural reforms in key areas (public
sector, business environment, energy, finance, telecommunications, etc.) stymied
Ghana‘s long-term development prospects. Notwithstanding these challenges, at appraisal
Ghana continued to enjoy peace in a sub-region plagued by political and ethnic problems.

2.       Education Sector Context. In 2003, the Ministry of Education (MOE) developed
an Education Strategic Plan (ESP 2003–2015). The strategy was based on four thematic
areas namely: (i) equitable access to education, (ii) quality of education, (iii) educational
management, and (iv) science, technology and technical and vocational education
(TVET). The ESP was developed in consultation with stakeholders and was facilitated by
the education sector group made up of in-country development partners then led by the
World Bank and currently co-led by the Department for International Development
(DfID) and UNICEF. Within this context, the EdSeP was strategically aligned to Ghana‘s
ESP by focusing on the following general policy goals: (i) increase access to and
participation in education and training, (ii) improve the quality of teaching and learning
for enhanced pupil/student achievement, (iii) improve and extend technical/vocational
education and training, (iv) promote good health and environmental sanitation in schools
and institutions of higher learning, (v) strengthen and improve educational planning and
management, (vi) improve the quality and relevance of academic and research programs
in tertiary education, (vii) identify and promote education programs that will assist in the
prevention and management of HIV/AIDs, and (viii) provide girls with equal
opportunities to access the full cycle of education.

3.      At appraisal, a number of specific challenges related to institutional capacity,
basic education, and tertiary education were identified by the Bank‘s project preparation
team. The main institutional capacity constraints faced by Ghanaian education system
were: (i) the inter-organizational division of labor in the system was unclear, leading to
conflicts, delays and neglect; (ii) the intra-organizational division of labor in the MOE
and Ghana Education Service (GES) was unclear, leading to widespread
unaccountability; (iii) the capacity of education institutions to formulate plans and



                                             1
strategies, coordinate donor support, and ensure effective project implementation,
supervision, and monitoring of planned activities was weak; and (iv) key resources
(human, physical, financial, and informational were either inadequate and/or poorly
managed. Key among the challenges confronting the basic education system prior to the
launch of the EdSeP were: (i) weak performance of public primary schools due to poor
management at the school level and teachers‘ insufficient initial and in-service training,
high absenteeism and turnover; (ii) significant disparities in average access and retention
figures, especially with regard to gender, location, income, and more broadly, poverty;
(iii) uneven and inefficient distribution of physical and human resources across regions
and schools; and (iv) disproportionate share of the recurrent discretionary budget (82
percent) spent on the salary bill, coupled with a low budget execution rate for non-
salaried items. In tertiary education, the key constraints identified at appraisal were: (i)
low quality and relevance of tertiary education; (ii) shortage of qualified staff,
particularly at the more senior levels; (iii) insufficient funding to ensure educational
quality given the significant surge in enrollment rates; (iv) weak institutional capacity
(professional, strategic, technical, etc.) within tertiary institutions and oversight bodies;
and (iv) low enrollment ratio for tertiary education (both in absolute terms and in
comparison to regional and global rates).

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

4.      The Ghana Education Sector Project (EdSeP) was approved on March 9, 2004
and became effective on March 25, 2004 (IDA credit 38650-GH). The original PDOs, as
stated in the DCA, were to (i) promote equitable access to, and efficient delivery of,
quality services in pre-tertiary education; and (ii) foster innovation, relevance, quality and
efficiency in tertiary education.

5.    The key indicators—along with their respective baseline values and expected
outcome targets—were the following:

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

6.      The level one restructuring approved on June 19, 2009, led to revisions in the
PDOs and key performance indicators. The new PDOs, as stated in the Amendment to the
DCA, were to: (i) improve equitable access to and completion of basic education 1 in
deprived districts; and (ii) improve quality of teaching and learning, management
efficiency, and relevance of post-basic education.

7.    The new key indicators—along with their respective baseline values and expected
outcome targets—were modified to the following:

1 The   baseline for the gender parity indicator was 2005.

8.      The restatement of the PDO was motivated by the need to make the PDO more
precise and narrowly focused on basic education, rather than pre-tertiary, with improved
access and completion at the basic education level. The revision to the second PDO
sought to more accurately measure the impact of the TALIF by focusing on three specific
dimensions: (i) quality of teaching and learning; (ii) management efficiency; and (iii)
relevance of post-basic education. The reformulated development objectives were more
consistent with the project‘s original scope and targeting, aligned to the government‘s

 Since 2008, basic education includes two years of kindergarten, six years of primary school and three
years of junior high school.



                                                       3
increased focus on the deprived districts, and harmonized with Ghana‘s new National
Education Reform Program (NERP).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

9.       The project beneficiaries identified at appraisal were: (i) MOE staff at the central,
regional, and district levels; (ii) GES staff; (iii) children from disadvantaged groups,
particularly girls in deprived districts; (iv) teachers and school administrators in deprived
districts; (v) students, staff and faculty at tertiary institutions; (vi) staff at the national
tertiary oversight bodies (National Council for Tertiary Education (NCTE), National
Accreditation Board (NAB), National Board for Professional and Technical
Examinations (NABPTEX); and (vii) potential employers in the public and private
sectors of the economy.

1.5 Original Components

The project was comprised of three components:

10.      Component A: Sector Capacity Building (SCB) (US$13.9 million). The main
objectives of the original SCB were to: (i) improve the overall organization of the sector,
as well as the internal organization of the MOE and the GES at the central, regional, and
district levels; (ii) improve the availability, deployment, utilization and management of
key resources (human, instructional, physical, financial, and informational) in the MOE
and the GES; and (iii) promote decentralization based on the division of labor agreed
among the national, regional and district units of the GES. The component was to be
implemented by the Ministry of Education (MOE) Headquarters.

11.      Component B: Pilot Programmatic Scheme (PPS) (US$40.4 million). The
main objective of the PPS was to provide direct budgetary support to the deprived
districts, on a pilot scale, for targeted operational activities on the basis of their strategic
importance. Rather than identifying ex ante the activities to be financed by the
component, districts were encouraged to articulate their own strategic priorities in an
Annual Program of Work (APoW), which would subsequently be implemented and
managed locally. The component was to be implemented by the Ghana Education Service
(GES).

12.     Component C: Teaching and Learning Innovation Fund (TALIF) (US$33.3
million). TALIF was originally envisioned as a demand-driven, competitive fund, aimed
at fostering innovation, relevance, quality and efficiency in tertiary education. The
specific objectives of the fund were to: (i) raise the quality of teaching and learning
performance; (ii) sharpen the relevance, competences and skill content of polytechnic
education; (iii) improve the efficiency by which polytechnics and universities manage
their academic programs, while also strengthening the technical capacity of tertiary
oversight bodies; (iv) open up greater access to post-graduate programs and the
University of Development Studies (UDS), buttressed by the expansion of distance
learning opportunities; and (v) support the development of HIV/AIDS programs within
tertiary institutions. On a competitive basis, the TALIF would support projects within the


                                               4
following funding ―windows‖: (a) polytechnic curricula quality and relevance; (b)
strengthening post-graduate programs; (c) institutional leadership and management
development; (d) support for tertiary distance education; (e) strengthening the UDS; (f)
promote HIV/AIDS prevention and management; and (g) technical strengthening of
tertiary oversight bodies. The component was to be implemented by the National Council
for Tertiary Education (NCTE).

1.6 Revised Components

13.     During the June 19, 2009 restructuring, a new Skills Development Fund (SDF)
sub-component was introduced within the SCB component. The main objective of the
SDF was to support the GoG‘s effort to make skills training more relevant and better
aligned with the requirements of the job market. To achieve these goals, the SDF—a
demand-driven and performance-based funding mechanism for TVET institutions—was
to be developed and adopted by the government. The new sub-component would be
jointly implemented by the MOE Headquarters and the Council for Technical and
Vocational Education and Training (COTVET).

14.     After both the mid-term review (January-February 2007) and the level one
restructured (June 2009), a concerted effort was made to properly align the objectives of
the SCB and PPS components. The SCB‘s aim would thereafter be to improve the
capacities of District of Education Offices (DEO) in deprived districts for delivering
basic education. The realignment also linked the SCB, through PPS, to the PDO. This
effectively meant capacity building activities would no longer be promoted across the
entire education sector, but would instead be limited to the deprived districts.

1.7 Other significant changes

15.      The level one restructuring approved by the Board of Directors on June 19, 2009,
(i) restated the PDO; (ii) modified the results framework; (iii) reallocated funds between
disbursement categories to support both the development of the SDF (estimated at
US$0.8 million) and the reconstruction of the schools destroyed by the 2007 floods
(estimated at US$7.5 million); (iv) dropped legal covenant on higher education finance;
and (v) extended the closing date of the project from October 31, 2009 to October 31,
2011. The two-year project extension was granted in order to ensure: (a) full
reconstruction and re-equipment of the 67 schools in Northern Ghana destroyed by the
2007 floods; (b) full completion of the new skills training pilot; and (c) proper monitoring
and assessment of the outcomes linked to the revised PDOs. The development of a
sustainable and equitable strategy for tertiary education financing would no longer be a
legal covenant, but would instead be incorporate into a broader tertiary education strategy
developed by the GoG. This strategy would in turn be developed and monitored as an
intermediate outcome of the project.

16.     On March 22, 2011, the project was restructured for a second time (level two
restructuring) at the request of the GoG. The GoG reviewed their entire IDA portfolio in
order to reallocate resources to agriculture which had become a GoG priority sector.



                                             5
Based on this review, SDRs 4,450,400 (approximately US$7,000,000 equivalent) were
canceled from the PPS component and reallocated within the IDA portfolio. After the
restructuring, the total project financing was SDRs 48,249,600. The restructuring also
increased the withdrawal limit for the PPS from US$2 million to US$5 million to ensure
the efficient implementation of all planned activities under the Annual Programs of Work
(APoW).

17.      On October 10, 2011, the project was restructured for a third and final time (level
two restructuring). The final restructuring reallocated resources to PPS in order to ensure
that all planned activities under the APoWs were completed.

18.     The government also was not able to provide the agreed counterpart funding for
the project. However, this did not have a negative impact on the components or the
planned project activities. By the end of the project, all agreed activities post-
restructuring were implemented and the project had adequate resources available for
these activities.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

19.     Project Preparation. In 2001, the Government of Ghana and the Bank initially
considered a sector wide education operation that was to be supported by an Adaptable
Program Loan (APL) instrument. However, the APL approach was modified due to: (i)
lack of a sector strategy (later developed in 2003), (ii) lack of consensus among donors,
and (iii) lessons learned from other Bank projects that showed that it is risky to launch
full scale sector-wide operations without prior testing. The preparation team decided that
a Specific Investment Loan (SIL) would be more appropriate and would focus on: (i)
comprehensive and systematic sector capacity building, (ii) targeted support for basic
education through the Pilot Program Scheme (PPS) to experiment and test a
programmatic mechanism, and (iii) competitive funding for tertiary education.

20.    The Bank preparation and appraisal teams consisted of technical experts that were
appropriate for the development of the project. The preparation of the project was also
spread over several months which were devoted mostly to building dialogue, consultation
and political commitment to the project concept and design. This was done in an effort to
engender strong and sustained political leadership, championship and ownership which
the team felt were important for the success of the project. On the government side,
several important studies and reports were issued that ultimately supported the project
design. These were the: (i) Ghana‘s Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS);
Report of the President‘s Education Committee, ―Meeting the Challenges of the 21 st
Century; (iii) Education Sector Review; and (iv) Education Strategic Plan (ESP 2003-
2015). The project preparation process seems to have been thoughtful, collaborative, and
technically sound and to the extent possible, based on lessons learned from previous
operations.




                                             6
21.     Original Project Design. The original EdSeP project design fit squarely into the
GPRS, ESP and the Bank Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) all of which supported
equitable access, improved quality at the basic education level, and improved quality,
relevance and efficiency in tertiary education. The project design took into consideration
recommendations provided by a Quality Enhancement Review (QER) and attempted to:
(i) deal with weak capacity to deliver education services with the inclusion of a sector
capacity building component that reviewed governing and management of the entire
system and then provided capacity training throughout the system; (ii) promote and
support the government‘s move toward decentralization of the education system with the
inclusion of the PPS which provided resources to deprived districts in support of their
annual work plans; and (iii) support accountability, innovation and improve relevance at
the tertiary level with the introduction of a competitive funding mechanism. To support
the implementation of all these activities the decision was made to divide implementation
responsibilities between the various sub-sector departments: (i) the MOE would take
responsibility for SCB; (ii) GES for PPS; and (iii) NCTE for TALIF. Finally, the results
framework for the project was derived from the ESP.

22.     The project design proved to be too ambitious for a five-year SIL. In addition, the
project results framework had: (i) PDO indicators that measured nationwide progress
rather than project impact; (ii) no PDO indicators associated with SCB; (iii) indictors that
had no relevance to project inputs or support; and (iv) an excessive number (20) of
intermediate indictors that often did not include baseline data or project targets. This
ultimately made project monitoring difficult. Moreover, TALIF and PPS components
were designed without an integrated M&E activity and for TALIF there was no
dissemination plan included in the design. Given the above, the ICR team judges the
original design to have been flawed.

23.     Quality at Entry. In 2003, there was a Quality Enhancement Review (QER)
conducted for the project. At that time, the QER was impressed with the thoughtfulness
and depth of analysis that had gone into the project preparation and design. The QER
made recommendations for improving the design and many of these were incorporated
into the capacity building and decentralization activities in the project design. Moreover,
they provided detailed recommendations on inclusion of the competitive funding
mechanism. These recommendations were embraced by the preparation team and many
included in the final design. The team also used the preparation period to conduct
extensive consultation to ensure political commitment for the project design which, in the
early stages, led to government ownership of the project. Bank management felt that the
project was ambitious but that the project was fully harmonized with the government‘s
education reform agenda as stated in the ESP and the public sector reform. Project risks
had also been identified and mitigation measures were in place to deal with the risks.

24.    Although the QER team judged the design to have been appropriate, the ICR team
views the QER assessment as being overly optimistic particularly related to: (i) project
design; (ii) government ownership; (iii) government commitment to decentralization; and
(iv) MOE‘s commitment to capacity upgrading and improvement throughout the system.
A 2008 Quality Assessment of the Lending Portfolio (QALP) also found the design to



                                             7
have been overly ambitious and pointed to implementation problems related to limited
capacity.

25.     Restructuring Design. The 2009 restructuring attempted to address the design
problems through a level one restructuring that: (i) restated the PDO; (ii) eliminate those
aspects of sector capacity building that aimed to improve governing and management
capacity for the entire system and just focused on providing capacity training for district
education administers; (iii) changed all PDO indictors so that project impact could be
measured; (iv) reduced the overall scope of the project so that the project would be more
focused on the 53 2 deprived districts; (v) supported rebuilding of schools in Northern
Ghana where schools had been destroyed by the 2007 floods; and (vi) introduced a pilot
skills development fund activity. As stated previously, these modifications coincided with
government‘s own refocused priorities to divert resources to the flood stricken areas and
focus making skills training more relevant and aligned with the labor market. The TALIF
component was not impacted by the restructuring since approximately 86 percent of the
TALIF component had been disbursed and all funding cycles completed. The ICR team
views the restructuring as appropriate particularly in light of the QALP review and
limited SCB and PPS project implementation progress prior to the restructuring.

2.2 Implementation

26.     Implementation was successful to a greater or lesser extent depending on
particular periods of the project: phase one of was the period March 2004 to June 2009
and phase two, the post restructuring period, was July 2009 to October 2011. On the
government side, exogenous factors complicated implementation in that MOE changed
ministers four times which included all the associated policy and staff changes. Three of
the changes occurring before the 2007 mid-term review (MTR). Endogenous factors such
as frequent turnover in implementation staff (TALIF and PPS had three project managers
while SCB had two project managers) also contributed to implementation issues. This
was in contrast to the Bank which had two TTLs over the seven year life of the project
with one critical team member remaining on the team throughout preparation and
implementation. This was beneficial because it provided needed continuity from the Bank
side for the implementation of the project.

27.    During the initial phase of the credit (3/2004-6/2009), the project disbursed 62
percent of the total net credit. 3 However, this period shows a mixed story for
implementation. Despite limited capacity, overall project implementation began
reasonably well with: (i) project effectiveness occurring three months after board
approval; (ii) a successful project launch workshop that included representatives from
MOE, GES, NCTE, universities and polytechnics and directors for all 40 project-
supported deprived project districts; (iii) project accountants were hired; and (iv) three


2
  At the time of the restructuring there were 53 deprived districts that were supported by the PPS
component. In February 2008 the government sub-divided the national districts which increased the
number of deprived districts to 61.
3
  Net Credit = SDR 52.7 million - SDR 4,450,400 = SDR 48,249,600.


                                                    8
special accounts were opened, as agreed, for each implementation unit with the initial
deposits. During this first phase, the SCB began: (i) completion of five important studies
that were to underpin overall sector reform, (ii) development of a model plan for a district
education office (DEO); and (iii) EMIS activities were implementing well with the
establishment of a system and roll-out to all 170 districts in Ghana. The PPS component:
(i) completed the operations manual used to guide PPS implementation at the district
level; (ii) districts produced annual programs of work (APoWs) for 2005, 2006 and 2007
and funds were disbursement to support these APoWs. By December 2007 NCTE had: (i)
developed TALIF proposal review mechanisms, and (ii) reviewed 922 proposals and
selected and supported 412 sub-projects which were all the sub-projects that were to be
supported in the project.

28.      Although there were successes, challenges associated with the government
ownership and design began to appear. Six months into implementation, it was learned
that the decentralization Local Government Act did not include education. This meant
that the SCB would not be able to move forward with decentralization (transferring
power from appointed GES officials to elected district assemblies) but rather to a
deconcentration and devolution process which transferred authority from GES
headquarters to GES Regional Education Offices (REOs) and DEOs. Moreover,
government political leadership and championship of decentralization all but disappeared
with four changes in MOE leadership. These ministerial changes posed serious
implementation challenges for SCB and PPS. Once the SCB studies were completed
virtually all new activities stalled. Although APoWs were being implemented at the
district level, most districts lacked the institutional capacity needed to ensure the effective
implementation, supervision, monitoring and evaluation of the planned activities under
the APoW. Non-compliance in delivering financial management statements and
procurement plans by some deprived districts caused the GES to completely stop
disbursing funds in 2008 and 2009 even for high-performing and compliant districts
which virtually stopped implementation of the PPS component.4

29.     During the 2007 mid-term review (MTR), the Bank and government
acknowledged that the project indicators were neither linked to project interventions nor
measureable. At that time, the MOE presented the Bank with a new results framework
that was judged to be more directly linked to the project and would measure outcomes of
the interventions. The Bank accepted the results framework and began to measure these
indicators. It was only after the MTR mission and subsequent, consultation with OPCS,
the supervision team realized a restructuring was necessary if the result framework was to
be modified. By 2008, it was evident that the project needed more restructuring than just
the results framework. However, it took one and a half years to complete the process
which is unusually long and the ICR team believes that this impacted negatively on
implementation since many of the design problems were taking too long to resolve.

    Between December 2007 and December 2009 only SDRs 1.45 million were disbursed.


                                                  9
30.     Between December 2007 and June 2009 the Bank continued to be rated
moderately satisfactory (MS). It was not until December 2009 that project
implementation was downgraded to unsatisfactory status. The ICR team judges that the
MS ratings do not reflect the actual implementation progress at that time. Moreover, the
ICR team found it difficult to fully analyze the results framework during this period
because after December 2007 the original indicators were not monitored. Instead the
informally agreed set of indicators were monitored and reported on in the ISRs until the
project was formally restructured when a new set of indicators was established.

31.     Despite the implementation challenges addressed above, the last 16 months of
implementation saw impressive gains. After the June 2009 restructuring, the project
disbursed 100 percent of the net credit and project activities were completed. The new
results framework was more closely aligned with project activities and improved the
projects ability to measure progress toward achievement of the PDO. The SCB
completed: (i) construction and rehabilitation of 11 DEOs; (ii) capacity building and
training in financial management, data analysis, and fraud prevention for DEO staff; (iii)
support for the Trends in Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS); and (iv) the
establishment of the SDF. The PPS component: (i) completed the 67 schools destroyed
by the floods; (ii) introduced a new acting Director General and Financial Controller in
GES which led to full disbursement of PPS funds; and (iii) improved regional and district
level data for APoWs. The TALIF component completed implementation of sub-projects
and the SDF – demand driven and performance based funding mechanism for TVET was
developed and adopted by the GoG. However, the NCTE did not develop a monitoring
and evaluation (M&E) system to track the impact of the grants at the institutional level
despite repeated requests by the Bank to focus appropriate attention on the M&E scheme
for TALIF. It was not until September 2011 that a formal assessment of the component
was initiated.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

32.     Design. As stated previously, the original results framework for the project was
problematic because : (i) most of the basic education indicators were meant to measure
national increases while the project investments were in deprived districts; and (ii)
tertiary education indicators could not be attributed or linked to project investment. Given
the complexity of the original results framework, monitoring was difficult both for the
Bank and the various implementation agencies. After the 2009 restructuring, the PDO
indicators were more focused and closely aligned with project components and the
intermediate indicators were reduced from 20 to 11 making them more measurable and
more explicitly linked to the project investments. (See datasheet for full list of indictors.)

33.     The original project design also included an Education Management Information
System (EMIS) activity that sought to: (i) sustain EMIS achievements under the Basic
Education Sector Improvement Project (BESIP) project; (ii) gradually expand the EMIS
coverage from the original 26 districts to all 110 districts (currently 170 districts); and
(iii) upgrade the current EMIS application to a comprehensive, integrated and use-
friendly system that provides reliable, relevant and timely data for all education sub-
sectors. The design for the EMIS activities proved to be appropriate for the project,


                                             10
particularly at the district level, where the implementation was relatively successful.
However, the systematic monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework for monitoring
TALIF was not developed at the time of project design and presented challenges for
evaluating impact of this component. The design of the PPS activity would have
benefitted from the inclusion of a systematic accounting mechanism of the APoWs,
readily available in electronic form for each year.

34.     Implementation and Utilization of Monitoring and Evaluation.
Implementation of EMIS activities was successful. By project closing, all 170 district
education offices are using the EMIS system to collect and compile and data which is
used by the MOE to generate the education statistic yearbook as well as the Education
Sector Performance Report (ESPR). This is judged by the ICR team as being a project
success given that prior to EdSeP, education data collection in Ghana was far less
systematic and less reliable. In the future, Ghana will need to enhance their EMIS system
to reflect the increasing role of private sector provision, distance learning, more detailed
information on disadvantaged groups, and tertiary education. It would be useful if the
MOE would also make the education statistics readily available online in a more user
friendly format to all education stakeholders.

35.      Implementation of the monitoring and evaluation of TALIF was problematic
throughout the life of the project. An assessment and dissemination mechanism was
never integrated into the TALIF design which unfortunately limited the possibility of
distilling lessons and disseminating best practices throughout implementation. It was not
until the end of the project that a formal assessment of the TALIF took place 5 .
Interestingly, the results of the TALIF assessment show that this component was
successful in introducing a transparent and competitive funding mechanism for tertiary
education in Ghana (see Annex 2 for details).

36.     In the last ISR, the Bank‘s reporting on the actual achievement of some indicators
conflicted with EMIS data for the 2010/11 data same period. The ICR team was able to
triangulate different data sources and calculate final project achievement using the GoG‘s
EMIS reports6 , a raw data set provided by the GoG, and the Bank‘s 2011 Education in
Ghana report7 in order to determine the actual project achievement for several indicators.

  The TALIF assessment was conducted by a local team of experts led by Professor John Anarfi and an
international evaluation consulting firm led by Cesar Yammal. The TOR was reviewed and approved by
the Bank. The methodological approaches for the assessment included: desk research, field surveys
(quantitative and qualitative) and participatory observation.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

37.     Safeguards. The project was classified as a Category B based on the Bank‘s
Operational Policy due to the potential environmental and social impacts of its
construction program. An Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF)
was prepared and approved by the time of project appraisal in 2003. The ESMF proposed
specific institutional arrangements to enable sustainable execution of all measures
identified in the ESMF. A Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) was also completed
and disclosed in 2003. During the 2009 restructuring, which included the rehabilitation of
the 67 schools damaged by the 2007 floods, the ESMF was revised and re-disclosed in
the Infoshop.

38.      Fiduciary Compliance. As mentioned previously, there were three separate
implementing agencies, GES, NCTE and the MOE. Each had its own finance and
accounting unit with their own special account. The arrangements were adequate to meet
the needs for financial management under OP/BP 10.02. At the time of project closing,
there are no outstanding FMRs and EdSeP was compliant with the submission of the
quarterly interim financial reports (IFRs). However, submission of both IFRs and FMRs
from SCB and PPS were usually delayed during the implementation period; this was
mainly due to the fact that the GES HQ had to receive the inputs from the district
education offices and consolidate these for reporting purposes. The last interim financial
reports for the period ending December 2011 were received as follows: (i) TALIF
February 1, 2012; (ii) PPS February 15, 2012; and (iii) SCB February 24, 2012.
Throughout the implementation period all implementing agencies complied fully with the
submission of the annual audited accounts and with the exception of the PPS which had a
qualified opinion in December 2008, all other reports were satisfactory. There were
challenges related to the implementation arrangements for FM which included: (i)
frequent changes in the accounting personnel, particularly within GES and FMPU; (ii)
delays in submission of the interim financial reports (IFR) and annual audit reports; and
(iii) delays in the provision of counterpart funds. Overall financial management for PPS
and SCB components are judged to be moderately satisfactory and the TALIF was
satisfactory.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

39.      The Bank is currently working with the government of Ghana to prepare a new
Global Partnership for Education Fund (GPEF) operation. The new project is expect to be
delivered in FY12 and will focus on improving the quality of planning, monitoring and
effectiveness of basic education services in deprived districts. The project will: (i)
provide district grants that will support APoWs, (ii) earmark funding for teacher training;
(iii) support more strategic and regular capacity building for districts, school management
committees, circuit supervisors and head teachers; and (iv) provide routine funding for
M&E. The new operation will take into consideration the lessons learned from the
implementation of the EdSeP. Given the scope and nature of the planned activities under
the GPEF, the lessons learned from the EdSeP‘s PPS component will be of particular
relevance. Moreover, the GPEF operation will build on the experience of the EdSeP and
ensure sustainability of the EdSeP achievements.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

40.     Relevance of Objectives. Both the original and revised project objectives, which
were derived from the 2003 ESP, continue to be relevant to the country needs as reflected
in the current Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy II (GPRS II), the FY08-12 Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) progress report and the new ESP (2010-20). Ghana‘s GPRS II
continues to give high priority to the education sector as one of the engines for promoting
growth and reducing poverty. After acknowledging the progress made in the education
sector since 2003 with the implementation of the ESP, the GPRS II reconfirms the
continued relevance of the program. In this regard, priority will continue to be given to
increased access and participation in education and training; focusing on bridging the
gender gap; and improving the quality and efficiency in delivery of education services.
The CAS progress report for the period FY08-12 supports the focus on targeted programs
for the poor, improving basic health and education services through the decentralized
system, and focusing on post-basic and innovative tertiary support in areas including
technical and vocational education.

41.     Relevance of Design. The original project design was overly ambitious, making it
difficult to assess progress toward the achievement of the PDOs. Therefore, the relevance
is judged to modest. However, the relevance of the restructured design is judged to be
substantial. This judgment is based on the fact that the: (i) PDO and PDO indicators
were linked more closely to the project interventions, and (ii) SCB component eliminated
the ambitious goal of improving governing and management capacity for the entire
system; and focused attention on building capacity at the district level. These
modifications were primarily responsible for reducing the complexity of the project and
made it more feasible to implement.

42.    Relevance of Implementation. The relevance of phase one project
implementation is judged to be modest. This is mainly based on the implementation
challenges prior to restructuring. However, there were successes during the initial
implementation phase. These were: (i) high disbursements for the TALIF component, (ii)
successful implementation of 2005, 2006 and 2007 APoWs, (iii) successful completion of
important studies within SCB that informed system changes; (iv) development of a model
plan for a district education office, and (v) successful scaling-up of EMIS nationwide.
The relevance of the restructured phase is judged to be substantial. This rating is based
on the: (i) institutionalization of the APoW mechanism which is the foundation for the
new GPE operations; (ii) successful completion of the piloted TALIF competitive
funding scheme; (iii) institutionalization of the SDF demand driven and performance
based funding mechanism which is the foundation of the Ghana Skills and Technology

Development Project (GSTDP), 8 and (iv) the successful scaling up of the capitation
grants to all 170 districts.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

43.      Prior to restructuring data related to the original PDO indicators were being
collected for those indicators where data was available. The June 2007 ISR was the last
reported information available on the original indicators. In June 2007, five PDO
indicators were showing progress but these were the nationwide indicators that had no
direct link to project investments. Another indicator, the CRT indicator, could no longer
be measured because the exam was eliminated and finally, the two tertiary indictors were
not being measured because they could not be directly attributed to the project. Between
2007 and the 2009 another set of indicators were being monitored however, they were not
formally approved by the Bank. Based on this, the achievement of the PDO prior to
restructuring is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

44.     After the restructuring of the project, six new outcome indicators were selected to
measure achievement of the PDO which were more closely aligned with the project
objectives. This section evaluates the outcomes against the results framework developed
during the 2009 restructuring and other indicators of system performance.

45.      Basic Education PDO Indicators. The goal of improving equitable access to and
completion of basic education in deprived districts were measured as follows: Increased
Primary Gross Enrollment Rate (GER) in Deprived Districts. The primary gross
enrollment in deprived districts increased from 76 percent in 2003/04 to 92.9 percent in
2010/11 missing the target of 101.6 percent. Improved gender parity index (GPI) at
primary level in deprived districts. The gender parity improved from 0.92 in 2005 to
0.95 in 2010/11 falling just short of the project target of 0.96. Increased primary
completion rate (PCR) in deprived districts. The primary completion rate for deprived
districts increased from 52.7 percent in 2004 to 86.9 percent in 2010/11, thereby missing
the target of 89 percent.

46.     While the basic education PDO indicators fell short of the targets, the trends show
marked improvements during the life of the project. When comparing the achievement of
the project districts to the national average it is evident that deprived districts experienced
substantial increases in GER, gender parity and completion rates when compared to the
national averages. (See Table 3.)

47.     Three of the basic education intermediate indicators were not achieved. Gross
admission rate (GAR) to primary 1 in deprived districts increased from 81.8 percent
to 100.5 percent missing the target of 105 percent but shows an 18.7 percent
improvement. Gross enrollment rate (GER) in JHS 1 in deprived districts increased
from 72.4 percent to 77.3 percent missing the project target of 86.0 percent. The gender
parity index (GPI) at JHS level in deprived districts increased from the baseline of
0.86 to 0.93 in 2011, again missing the project target of 0.95 but showing a 0.07 increase
in the GPI. The trends are all positive for the project period as evidenced by Table 4.

48.     The other two intermediate indicators related to basic education were achieved: (i)
sixty-seven new schools were reconstructed and furnished in the northern regions, and
(ii) the project successfully introduced, financed and piloted the capitation grants
program. The latter was scaled up and mainstreamed in all 170 districts nationwide
thereby meeting the project‘s intermediate outcome indicators. This capitation grant
program was important because it provided non-salary resources at the school level to
address the needs of the schools. EMIS data also reveals that districts which received




                                                             15
capitation grants in 2004 saw a proportionally higher increase in gross enrollment rates
and gender parity when compared to districts which did not benefit from the scheme.9

49.     Post-Basic Education PDO Indicators. The first post-basic education PDO
indicator was: supported programs under TALIF show improvements in teaching,
management efficiency or learning outcomes. In an effort to raise the quality of
teaching and learning within the tertiary sector, TALIF sub-projects built and improved
learning facilities, revised and developed curricula, promoted staff development, and
introduced competency-based training (CBT) and problem-based learning (PBL) and is
judged to be satisfactory. This can be seen by: (i) incorporating information technology
and communication (ITC) in the curriculum, (ii) revising and updating curricula,
particularly in the polytechnic institutes; (iii) providing distance education through
creations of IT facilities; (iv) successfully creating a series of internship programs that
linked institutions with industry: (v) developing lecture series that exposed students to
potential employers; and (vi) building the capacity of academic staff with scholarships for
masters and PhD programs as well as targeted skills upgrading programs for academic
staff. Moreover, the relevance and skills content of polytechnic institutions was
sharpened through the establishment of modern laboratories and workshops.

50.     The second PDO indicator was: seventy-five percent of new polytechnic and
post graduate programs assessed as satisfactory. The TALIF funding windows for
polytechnic programs and university post-graduate programs were to support academic
programs that: (i) improved the programs at polytechnics that were consistent with the
Master Plan10 and (ii) supported a selected number of post-graduate programs chosen for
their importance to the country‘s future economic and social development. These
windows consisted of 61 percent of the overall TALIF sub-project funds. The final
assessments of the TALIF found that 82 percent of the 412 projects were completed and
successfully implemented. The sub-projects supported development and reform curricula,
integrated ICT in teaching and learning activities, and created industrial attachment
programs. Curricula reform focused on improving the opportunities for students to
acquire a range of skills, including: (i) technical expertise and applied solving abilities;
(ii) general skills (communication, computer literacy, teamwork, etc.); and (iii)
citizenship skills and values. TALIF-funded initiatives also provided students with the
chance to interact with business firms and professional associations through a series of
internship programs and guest lecture series. Over 1,000 students interned with local
enterprises and research centers, while nearly 100 staff members acquired industrial
experience through exchange programs.

51.    The intermediate indicators were also met. TALIF successfully introduced a
transparent and competitive funding mechanism for tertiary education in Ghana. The end

   The master plan included a set of proposals designed to improve the quality and relevance of technical
education with a strong emphasis on polytechnics. The plan included such things as: introduction of
competency based training; revision of curricula introduction of exchange programs and internships etc.


                                                    16
of project TALIF assessment showed achievements related to the sub-projects which
were: (i) increased access to laboratory and learning equipment; (ii) staff capacity
building; (iii) exposure to innovative ways of teaching and learning; and (iv) improved
access to modern ICT facilities. Finally, the higher education policy has been drafted and
is currently under legislative review. The draft policy does include principles of equity,
efficiency, relevance quality and accountability. Moreover, the MoE is currently
considering using 20 percent of the Ghana Education Trust Fund (GET) to support a
national competitive funding scheme modeled on the TALIF which would be
approximately US$5.8 million annually. This would be a considerable investment by
MoE for tertiary education and ensure the sustainability of the TALIF.

52.     Skills Development Fund (SDF) mechanism is functional. The achievement of
this PDO is satisfactory. The main objective of the SDF was to support the GoG‘s effort
to make skills training more relevant and better aligned with the requirements of the job
market. To achieve these goals the SDF—a demand-driven and performance based
funding mechanism for TVET institutions—was to be developed and adopted by the GoG.
This objective was achieved and is evidenced by the following: (i) a SDF steering
committee was established to oversee the implementation; (ii) an operations manual was
developed to guide the funding process; (iii) there was advertising for expressions of
interest for funding; and (iv) 484 concept notes were submitted of which 183 were invited
to submit full proposals. The GoG has also fully adopted the SDF mechanism and this is
evidenced by the fact that the government and the Bank agreed to develop the Ghana
Skills and Technology Development Project (GSTDP)11 which is completely based on
the success of this activity.

3.3 Efficiency

53.      The project successfully reconstructed 52 primary schools in Ghana‘s three
northern regions. Each school was equipped with 6 classrooms as well as basic toilet
facilities. Apart from the production of bidding documents, all pre-contract activities
were undertaken by the beneficiary District Administrations. Awarded contracts were
required to fall within established budget ceilings. These price ceilings were calculated
based on the average cost of building materials in the various project localities. An
analysis of the fifty-two awarded contracts shows that the cost of a 6-classroom primary
school built under the EdSeP ranged from US$95,586 to US$106,513, with an average
cost of US$99,909. This is comparable to the US$96,000 cost of a primary school in
Ghana estimated by the Department for International Development (DFID) during the
same period. (See Annex 3 for details.)

54.     The project also reconstructed 12 two-classroom kindergarten (KG) blocks and 3
three-classroom JHS blocks for an average cost of GH¢ 83,552 and GH¢ 84,745
respectively. This compares favorably to the average costs reported by the United States
Agency for International Development for kindergarten block and junior high school

The FPMU costs were GH¢ 152,000 and GH¢ 130,500 respectively.12

55.     The government has reported financing the construction of 458 boreholes by
utilizing PPS funds. This activity was overseen by MOE and GES in cooperation with the
Community Water and Sanitation Agency (CWSA)—the government entity in charge of
overseeing the technical quality and standards for boreholes. Table 5 shows that the unit
construction cost in the EdSeP project for a borehole was comparable to the unit costs in
NGO and community-based projects.

 drinking water to a number of schools in the Bongo District. The current cost of a borehole under this project is
 estimated at £4000, corresponding to US$6,320 assuming the current exchange rate (1£=US$1.58).

56.     The largest share of the 2010-2011 PPS funds was targeted to Ghana‘s three
poorest regions. The strategic targeting is not efficient per se, however, the project
effectively channeled funds to the regions with the highest average poverty indicies in
Ghana. Analysis of the consolidated APoWs for 2010 and 2011 reveals that the 60
percent of the total PPS budget support was absorbed by the three poorest northern
regions. Moreover, as Table 7 illustrates, the per student allocation average for the three
northern regions was equal to GH¢ 15.60 for the 2010 and 2011 period, whereas the per
student allocation average for all other regions was GH¢ 9.93 during the same period.
Thus, both in absolute terms and on a per student basis, PPS provided greater levels of
financial support to the more economically disadvantaged regions.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

57.     An overall outcome rating of the project is moderately unsatisfactory and is
reflected by the two contrasting periods of project implementation. The first phase shows
that the project design was problematic, implementation was slow and erratic, and
efficacy and efficiency were difficult to measure. Although the basic education PDO
indicators fell short of the targets during the second phase, when compared to the national
average, the indicators for the deprived districts show considerable progress. Moreover,
all the post-basic education PDO indicators were achieved. There are also other aspects
of the project that had considerable impact which are factored into the project rating. This
is evidenced by the: (i) successful piloting and institutionalization of the PPS budget
support mechanism; (ii) successful launch of a transparent and competitive funding
scheme for tertiary education; (iii) successful development and institutionalization of the
SDF; (iv) successful piloting and institutionalization of capitation grants; and (v)
development of the Single Spine Salary Structure (SSSS) which is a job grading and job
evaluation system. Annex 2 provides additional achievements related to the projects
outcomes.

    Overall rating = (3)(.6204) +4(.3796) =3.38 (rounded down to 3 or MU)

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

58.    The PPS targeted the most deprived districts, and hard-to-reach populations. The
average poverty rate for the deprived districts targeted by the PPS within in the Northern,
Upper East and Upper West, is substantially higher that the other regions in Ghana. Data
available in 2010 and 2011 show that the largest share of PPS resources were channeled
to Ghana‘s three poorest regions—Northern, Upper East and Upper West.13




13
   Average poverty rate for deprived districts targeted by PPS in 2010 were: Upper West-0.83; Upper East-
0.73, Northern-0.58, Volta- 0.43, Brong Ahafo-0.41, Eastern-0.28, Western-0.26, Ashantai-0.26, and
Central-0.20.


                                                     19
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

59.     At the national level, a positive outcome of this original design was that the
government did use the results of the SCB studies to develop and implement a job
grading and job evaluation system called the SSSS. Moreover, the GoG has fully adopted
the SDF mechanism and this is evidenced by the fact that the government and the Bank
agreed to develop the Ghana Skills and Technology Development Project (GSTDP) 14
which is completely based on the success of this activity. The TALIF successfully
introduced a transparent and competitive funding mechanism for tertiary education in
Ghana and is currently being considered as an integral part of a reformed higher
education financing system, for which the Bank has been asked to provide technical
assistance.

60.      At the district level, the project was also instrumental in establishing the PPS
mechanism and the associated APoWs as a means of determining the annual needs and
priorities for district resource allocation. Moreover, the PPS mechanism has been
institutionalized and will be used by the government in the new GPEF project. The
capitation grants program that was started under the PPS in 2004 as a way to address low
enrollment in the deprived district has also been institutionalized and scaled up to all 170
districts. By project closing, all 170 district education offices are using the EMIS system
to collect and compile and data that is used by the MOE to generate the education statistic
yearbook as well as the Education Sector Performance Report (ESPR) thereby meeting, if
not surpassing, the intent of the intermediate target.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

61.     Anecdotal evidence suggests that a positive unintended outcome of the project‘s
focus on the deprived districts was that the 61 deprived districts are now better equipped
to articulate their priorities in APoWs than the more economically advanced districts.
This bodes favorably given the government‘s continuing efforts at decentralizing the
education system.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial

62.    The risks identified during project preparation were mostly appropriate: five were
rated substantial and two were modest. There were two risks that, in retrospect, could
have been rated differently. The modest rating for the capacity building component was

Board of Directors on March 29, 2011.


                                               20
underestimated. The initial resistance to comprehensive institutional restructuring of the
sector proved to be more than anticipated and should have been rated substantial. The
resistance was one of the main factors that contributed to narrowing the project scope at
the time of project restructuring. By contrast, the TALIF component was fully accepted,
well publicized, and highly demanded by tertiary institutions and could have been rated
modest. The PPS did experience delays providing disbursement documentation which
contributed to delays in overall PPS implementation. Therefore, the substantial rating was
appropriate. The fiscal situation of the government was impacted by the 2009 economic
crisis. However, resources were re-directed to the deprived districts which allowed the
districts to continue their support of the social sectors. Therefore, the modest risk was
appropriate. Sufficient allocation of resources have translated into increased access and
improved gender parity. However, quality of services is still a concern so the substantial
rating remains appropriate. The institutionalization of the PPS at the district level will
provide the foundation for the follow on GPEF operation thereby reducing the risk for
this operation and sustaining the EdSeP gains. As mentioned previously, the MOE is
currently considering using 20 percent of the GET fund to support a national competitive
funding scheme modeled on the TALIF which will increase the likely sustainability of
the TALIF.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

63.      Bank Performance. The Bank preparation team included the appropriate
technical experts to appraise the project and sound preparatory studies and analyses of the
education sector were undertaken to formulate the project objectives and define the
interventions. The preparation was spread over several months which contributed to
political commitment to the project concept and design. The project was appropriately
aligned with the ESP, GPRS and CAS but it was overly ambitious and would have
benefited from a results framework that was more closely aligned with the PDO and
interventions. These design flaws led to substantial implementation delays and
monitoring problems which resulted in the restructuring of the project. During the 2009
restructuring the Bank did respond to the QALP review and the overly ambitious nature
of the project by reducing the scope of interventions and addressing the complex results
framework. However, a robust M&E scheme for project components was not introduced
at the time of restructuring and remained a problem during the project implementation.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

64.    The Bank recognized the need to restructure the project and to narrow the scope
of the interventions while also explicitly linking the results framework with project
investments. The Bank also conducted 18 supervision missions during project
implementation and did an adequate job of reporting on the bottlenecks related to



                                            21
implementation and erratic disbursements, particularly in the case of PPS. There were
two TTLs during the implementation period and one team member that participated
throughout preparation and implementation. The supervision team composition was also
comprehensive and stable and always included education, procurement and financial
management, and M&E specialists. This continuity helped maintain consistency in advice
to the Government over the implementation period. Reallocation of project funds and
extension of the closing date were aimed at addressing issues encountered during
implementation as well as those that would enhance the development impact of the
project. In particular increased allocations were made to transfer funds available from
SCB to PPS ensure full completion of the APoWs.

65.     However, the Bank could have done a better job of systematically documenting
progress of each component in the supervision reports. It was difficult for the ICR team
to easily follow component progress based on reading the aide-memories. The
supervision team also accepted and monitored a results framework that had not been
formally agreed and then during restructuring modified the framework one more time.
Again, this made it difficult to follow progress of the project. Moreover, it was not clear
the extent to which Bank and government implementation teams visited the Northern
regions and, the ICR team feels, that the implementation of PPS would have benefited
from more direct supervision. The Bank missions did include M&E specialists to work
with the NCTE on developing a TALIF M&E scheme however, this never materialized
despite the Bank‘s efforts. In the end, the results of TALIF are judged to have been
positive, although an assessment was not conducted until the end of the project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

66.   Based on the Bank‘s quality at entry, the supervision discussion, and project
outcomes above, overall Bank performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

67.     At the time of preparation, the government actively participated in the
development of the project and was committed to decentralization as well as the sector-
wide approach as outlined in the 2003 in the ESP. However, implementation of the
government decentralization agenda as well as the project were complicated by the fact
that by 2007 the MOE had changed ministers four times which include all the associated
policy and staff changes. The changes brought into question the government‘s
commitment to the decentralization and the staff changes, down to the implementation
staff level, contributed to the substantial implementation delays. These factors
contributed, in large part, to the overall need to restructure the project, particularly as
they related to SCB. The government also was not able to provide the agreed counterpart
funding for the project. However, this did not have a negative impact on the components
or the planned project activities. By the end of the project, all agreed activities post-



                                            22
restructuring were implemented and the project had adequate resources available for
these activities.

Government implementation
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

68.      There were three project implementation units: MoE for SCB; GES for PPS and
NCTE for TALIF. Each unit was committed to achieving the project development
objectives and, by the end of the project, was able to implement the project activities.
PPS and TALIF were successfully completed, district education officers were constructed,
67 primary schools were completed in the flood regions, the SDF mechanism was
designed and institutionalized, capitation grants were piloted and scaled up and capacity
of district level education administrators was increased. Each implementation unit
participated in joint supervision missions and provided implementation status reports.
However, within each unit there were: (i) capacity constraints; (ii) challenges with M&E
at all levels and (iii) challenges with ongoing component supervision. The units complied
with the requirements to submit both IFRs and FMRs but they were often delayed and
audit reports were received and unqualified.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

69.    In light of the government performance and its impact on implementation as
discussed above, the overall performance of the Borrower is rated moderately
unsatisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

70.      Lesson 1. Overly ambitious sector-wide reforms take time to prepare, own
and implement and cannot be undertaken in a SIL particularly when there is
limited institutional capacity. The sector wide reforms under SCB proved to be
politically difficult and were slow to develop, limiting the scope of the proposed reform
of the entire education administrative structure. Six months into implementation, it was
learned that the government decentralization agenda did not include education. As a
result, there was a deconcentration and devolution process to districts. This meant that the
original project sector wide reforms that were to improve the availability, deployment,
utilization of key resources in the MOE and GES at the national, regional, and district
levels could not be achieved. A project design with fewer and more focused components
would have been better for the education sector especially since the decentralization
policy was not fully formulated and government ownership could not be guaranteed.

71.    Lesson 2. The project results framework should be explicitly linked to
project development objectives and interventions. The EdSeP‘s original results
framework lacked the appropriate linkage between the PDO and project indicators which
hindered the Bank and government‘s ability to effectively measure progress toward



                                            23
achievement of the PDO. This coupled with the late project restructuring negatively
impacted the overall outcome rating of the EdSeP.

72.     Lesson 3. Pilot programs must establish sound monitoring and evaluation
systems to measure impact, identify problems and take corrective measures. The
PPS and TALIF pilot programs did not have fully integrated monitoring and evaluation
systems. The lack of an appropriate monitoring system limited the project‘s ability to
regularly assess the programs and outcomes. In the case of TALIF, it was not until the
end of the project that a systematic evaluation was conducted. The results of the TALIF
evaluation showed considerable program impact but because of the late analysis, good
practice and experiences could not be widely disseminated. In the case of PPS, lack of a
systematic consolidation of district APoWs limited the government and Bank‘s ability to
assess impact.

73.    Lesson 4. Funds administered against agreed district plans encourages
pooling of funds and can be the basis for improving the effective targeting of
resources to meet the specific needs of districts. The project successfully piloted this
type of mechanism through the APoWs under PPS. This promoted greater ownership,
decision making power, and financial accountability. The decentralized process and
implementation of the APoWs is more effective when funds are released in a timely
fashion, there is capacity at the district level to implement and monitor the programs, and
support is provided on a continual basis by MoE and GES.

74.     Lesson 5. Professionalism of staff throughout the sector should be a priority.
Through the EdSeP, MOE was able to conduct a job evaluation system and implement a
fair wage commission. Going forward a series of well structured capacity building
programs should be institutionalized for GES headquarter and district management staff
particularly budget officers and accounts. The program should also include circuit
supervisions, school heads and school management committees. This will be critical for
ensure the professionalism of sector staff.

75.     Lesson 6. The efficient and timely implementation of project activities is
contingent upon building and sustaining project implementation capacity. Improving
capacity requires technical assistance (TA) and training on a continuous and integrated
basis. While the EdSeP provided some TA and training, the training tended to one-off
rather that sustained support over an extended period of time. This ultimately limited the
impact of the training and did not necessarily have a lasting influence on improved
capacity as staff turnover at the district level is relatively high. Moreover, lack of capacity
did delay the implementation of the project.

76.     Lesson 7. A demand-driven competitive funding mechanism is an effective
instrument for allocating public funding aimed at fostering innovation, relevance
and quality in tertiary education as long as the selection criteria are clear,
transparent, and well publicized. By inviting institutions to compete for limited
funding, the TALIF gradually introduced a funding mechanism that was linked to
strategic priorities defined by beneficiary institutions. The design and continuous support



                                              24
from the NCTE led to the successful implementation of the program. However, the
design should have included a mechanism for dissemination so that the results and best
practices could be shared and replicated.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

78.      Component A: Sector Capacity Building (SCB). The main objectives of the
original SCB were to: (i) improve the overall organization of the sector, as well as the
internal organization of the MOE and the GES at the central, regional, and district levels;
(ii) improve the availability, deployment, utilization and management of key resources
(human, instructional, physical, financial, and information) in the MOE and the GES; and
(iii) promote decentralization based on the division of labor agreed among the national,
regional and district units of the GES as well as the Regional Service Councils and
District Assemblies. The component was to be implemented by the Ministry of Education
(MOE) headquarters. By the 2007 mid-term review the Bank and the government began
to realize that this component was overly ambitious and that the decentralization process
was more challenging than originally anticipated. Moreover, in 2007 there was severe
flooding in the project areas of the northern regions. The 2009 restructuring attempted to
address the design flaws in SCB by eliminating those aspects of the component that
aimed to improve governing and management capacity for the entire system. Thereafter
the objective of the SCB was to improve the capacities of District of Education Offices
(DEO) in deprived districts for delivering basic education through the Pilot Programmatic
Scheme. This was to be achieved through: (i) construction and rehabilitation of 11 DEOs;
(ii) capacity building for DEO staff; (iii) support for the expansion of EMIS; (iv) support
for the Trends in Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS); and (v) the establishment of
the Skills Development Fund (SDF).

79.     Sector Capacity Building Studies. The original project design of the SCB was to
be implemented in three phases: Phase I-development of an optimal division of labor
among all sector agencies; Phase II-capacity assessment of sector agencies; and Phase III-
implementation of new agencies alignment. Although this component was restructured,
the studies that were to be conducted were completed with the support of the Project
Preparation Fund (PPF). They included: (i) review of the internal division of labor in the
MOE and GES at the central, regional and district level; (ii) analysis of staffing needs and
training at the MOE, GES headquarters, regional and district education offices; (iii)
assessment of information needs and the development of computerized human resources
management system at the MOE, GES headquarters, and regional and district education
offices; (iv) assessment of the physical facility and equipment needs for a fully
decentralized education system and development of a computerized physical resources
system at the MOE and GES; and (v) review of accounting and reporting operations in
the MOE and its agencies. A positive outcome of this original design was that the
government did use the results of these studies to develop and implement a job grading
and job evaluation system called the Single Spine Salary Structure (SSSS).

80.    District Education Offices. The overall objective of this activity was to improve
the capacity of DEO staff to delivery education services at the district level. This was to
be achieved by providing support to the DEOs for the development of a ‗standard‘ DEO




                                            27
in 11 project districts15 and capacity building for the 61 deprived district education staff.
By project closing all 11 DEOs had been constructed, furnished, equipped and handed-
over to the districts according to the standards established by the MOE. The project also
provided training to improve the capacity of education staff as follows: (i) 366 DEO
staff 16 were trained in fraud prevention, (ii) 487 DEO staff were trained in financial
analysis and management, (iii) 40 staff were trained in procurement management, and
(iv) 5 PIU staff were trained on the SUN accounting software. While all these project
activities were successfully implemented, the training was typically one-off training. The
ICR team feels that there is a continuing need for ongoing and repeat training at the
district level particularly as they move toward a focus on quality improvement.

81.     Education Management Information System. The objective of this operation
was to: (i) build on the success of the IDA-supported Basic Education Sector
Improvement Project (BESIP) that established EMIS in 10 regions and 26 districts and
(ii) to upgrade the EMIS application to provide reliable, relevant and timely data. The
intermediate indicator used to measure this was the percentage of targeted districts for
which the EMIS is used to generate annual reports. To achieve this target, in 2004 the
government invited the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) to adapt its newly
developed EMIS software package to the needs of the Ghana education sector as well as
to provide the associated training and development of a new data collection questionnaire.
The EMIS software package was adopted and is currently being used by the MOE. In
addition, the project supported the purchase of 282 computers and printers as well as
related accessories as well as additional EMIS training. By project closing, all 170 district
education offices are using the EMIS system to collect and compile and data that is used
by the MOE to generate the education statistic yearbook as well as the Education Sector
Performance Report (ESPR) thereby meeting, if not surpassing, the intent of the
intermediate target. This is judged by the ICR team as being a project success given that
prior to EdSeP, education data collection in Ghana was far less systematic and less
reliable. In the future, Ghana will need to enhance their EMIS system to reflect the
increasing role of private sector provision, distance learning, detailed information on
disadvantaged groups, and tertiary education. It would be useful if the MOE would also
make the education statistics readily available online in a more user friendly format to all
education stakeholders.

82.    Trends in Mathematics and Science Study. One of the original PDOs was to
focus on quality in basic education. In support of this PDO the project provided resources
for TIMSS. Although the project restructuring narrowed the focus of the PDO to access,
the project continued to support TIMSS. The ICR team considers this support be one of
the more successful aspects of the project. This is because Ghana and Botswana are the
only countries in Sub-Saharan Africa to have participated in both the 2003 and 2007
TIMSS. Moreover, as a result their participation, Ghana now has sector level
disaggregated data and a benchmark for measuring learning outcomes. In June 2011,


15
   The 11 project districts were Abura Asebu Kwamankese, Kumasi, Bawku East, Bia, Birim North,
Dangme West, Hohoe, Karaga, Lawra, Sefwi Wiawso, and Sene.
16
   On average six DOE staff in all 61 deprived districts were trained in fraud prevention.


                                                 28
prior to project closing, Ghana was preparing to participate in the third TIMSS cycle. For
the third cycle the project supported: (i) school sampling, (ii) dispatching test materials;
(iii) data collection and test administration; (iv) preparation of scoring booklets; (v) data
entry and cleaning; (vi) training of trainers in all 61 deprived districts, (vii) participation
in international quality control seminars and (viii) school coordinator and test
administrators workshops.

83.     Skills Development Fund. The main objective of the SDF was to support the
GoG‘s effort to make skills training more relevant and better aligned with the
requirements of the job market. To achieve these goals the SDF—a demand-driven and
performance based funding mechanism for TVET institutions—was to be developed and
adopted by the GoG. The PDO indicator used to measure achievement toward this
objective was to develop the SDF mechanism and have it fully functional. This objective
was achieved and is evidenced by the following: (i) a SDF steering committee was
established to oversee the implementation; (ii) an operations manual was developed to
guide the funding process; (iii) there was advertising for expressions of interest for
funding; and (iv) 484 concept notes were submitted of which 183 were invited to submit
full proposals. The GoG has also fully adopted the SDF mechanism and this is evidenced
by the fact that the government and the Bank agreed to develop the Ghana Skills and
Technology Development Project (GSTDP)17 which is completely based on the success
of this activity.

84.     The project also provided the needed infrastructure and technical assistance
support to the newly established Council for Technical and Vocational Education and
Training (COTVET) responsible for the delivery of technical and vocational education.
This support included: (i) procurement of office furniture; (ii) procurement of
management information systems, financial management, and grants management
database software with related services; (iii) regional training workshops for selected
trade associations; (iv) workshops to revise the TVET policy; (v) regional training
workshops for public and private TVET institutions; and (vi) regional training workshop
to review and validate the Ghana industrial policy.

85.     Component B: Pilot Programmatic Scheme (PPS). The main objective of the
PPS was to provide direct budgetary support to the deprived districts, on a pilot scale, for
targeted operational activities on the basis of their strategic importance. Rather than
identifying ex ante the activities to be financed by the component, districts were
encouraged to articulate their own strategic priorities in an Annual Program of Work
(APoW), which would subsequently be implemented and managed locally. After the
2009 restructuring, the PDO indicators used to measure achievement of this objective
were: (i) increased primary gross enrollment rate in deprived districts from 76 percent to
101.6 percent, (ii) improved gender parity index at primary level in deprived districts



17
  The Ghana Skills and Technology Development Project (P118112) was approved by the World Bank
Board of Directors on March 29, 2011.



                                               29
from 0.92 to 0.96, and (iii) increased primary completion rate in deprived districts 53
percent to 89 percent. The intermediate indicators used to measure achievement of the
objective were: (i) improved gross admission rate to primary 1 in deprived districts from
81.8 percent to 105 percent; (ii) increased gross enrollment rate in JHS 1 in deprived
districts from 72.4 percent to 86.0 percent; (iii) improved gender parity index at JHS level
in deprived districts from 0.86 to 0.95; (iv) reconstruction of 67 schools in the northern
regions; and (v) piloting capitation grants in deprived districts and adopting them for
national scale up.

86.     The primary gross enrollment in deprived districts increased from 76 percent in
2003 to 92.9 percent in 2010/11 falling short of the target of 101.6 percent. The gender
parity improved from 0.92 in 2005 to 0.95 in 2010 falling short of the project target of
0.96. The primary completion rate for deprived districts increased from 52.7 percent in
2004 to 86.9 percent in 2010/11, just missing the target of 89 percent.

87.     While all the basic education PDO indicators fell short of the targets, the trends
show marked improvements during the life of the project. The ICR team judges these
achievements as being substantial in light of the fact that the project targeted the most
deprived districts in Ghana. When comparing the achievement of the project districts to
the national average it is evident that deprived districts experienced substantial increases
in GER, gender parity and completion rates when compared to the national averages.

88.     Three of the basic education intermediate indicators were not achieved. The GAR
to primary 1 in deprived districts increased from 81.8 percent to 100.5 percent missing
the target of 105 percent but shows an 18.7 percent improvement. GER in JHS 1 in
deprived districts increased from 72.4 percent to 77.3 percent missing the project target
of 86.0 percent. The GPI at JHS level in deprived districts increased from the baseline of
0.86 to 0.93 in 2011, again missing the project target of 0.95 but showing a 0.07 increase
in the GPI.

89.      The project also reconstructed and furnished all 67 project supported schools in
the northern regions which was an intermediate indicator target. In addition, the APoWs
supported the construction of 458 boreholes and a number of water tanks and gender
friendly toilets. The APoWs provided resource for annual enrollment drives and cover the
costs of material (i.e. shoes, school bags and exercise books) for needy students with a
particular focus on girls. The APoWs also included training for 18318 district education
staff in procurement at the Ghana Institute of Public Administration (GIMPA).

90.     A sample analysis of 27 deprived district 2011 APoWs, across all 9 regions
targeted by the PPS, showed that: (i) 52 percent of all investments were used for school
rehabilitation and furniture; (ii) 33 percent of the investments were used to improve
school level sanitation (i.e. boreholes, water tanks and toilet facilities); and (iii) 12
percent on support to needy pupils.

     There were three district education staff per district that received this training.

91.     The project was instrumental in establishing the PPS mechanism and the
associated APoWs as a means of determining the annual needs and priorities for district
resource allocation. As a result, the 61 deprived districts are now able to develop APoWs
that identify annual priorities, allocate appropriate resources and implement the activities.
Moreover, the PPS mechanism has been institutionalized and will be used by the
government in the new GPEF project. The ICR team judges this to have been successful.

92.     The capitation grants program was started under the PPS in 2004 as a way to
address low enrollment in the deprived district. The capitation grants, in the amount of
4.50 GH¢ per pupil each year, are used to support the implementation of the School
Performance Improvement Plans (SPIP) for enrollment drives, provision of teaching and
learning materials, school management, community and school relationships, support to
needy pupils, school and cluster-based in-service training, and minor repairs. 20 This
program was important because it provided non-salary resources at the school level to
address the needs of the schools. EMIS data also shows that districts which received
capitation grants in 2004 saw a proportionally higher increase in gross enrollment rates
and gender parity when compared to districts which did not benefit from the scheme. The
project successfully piloted the capitation grants program which has been


19
   A total of 27 districts, distributed across all 9 regions targeted by PPS, were sampled. The sampled
districts were: Ahafo Ano South, Sekyere Afram Plains, Nkoranza North, Sene, Assin North, KEEA, Birim
North, Chereponi, East Gonja, East Mamprusi, Gushegu, Karaga, Kpandai, Savelugu-Nanton, Sawla-Tuna-
Kalba, West Mamprusi, Yendi, Bawku West, Bolgatanga, Garu-Tempane, Lambussie-Karni, Krachi East,
Nkwanta North, Aowin-Suaman, Sefwi-Akontombra, Sefwi-Wiawso, and Wasa Amenfi West.
20
   The capitation grant was originally set at 3.30 GH¢ per pupil per year, subsequently being increased to
4.50 GH¢ in 2009.

institutionalized and scaled up to all 170 districts nationwide thereby meeting the target
for this project intermediate indicator.

93.     Component C: Teaching and Learning Innovation Fund (TALIF). TALIF
was originally envisioned as a demand-driven, competitive fund, aimed at fostering
innovation, relevance, quality and efficiency in tertiary education. 21 The specific
objectives of the fund were to: (i) raise the quality of teaching and learning performance;
(ii) sharpen the relevance, competences and skill content of polytechnic education; (iii)
improve the efficiency by which polytechnics and universities manage their academic
programs, while also strengthening the technical capacity of tertiary oversight bodies; (iv)
open up greater access to post-graduate programs and the University of Development
Studies (UDS)—buttressed by the expansion of distance learning opportunities; and (v)
support the development HIV/AIDS programs within tertiary institutions.

94.     The PDO indicators used to measure the project impact of this component were:
(i) supported programs under the TALIF show improvements in teaching, management
efficiency or learning outcomes and (ii) 75 percent of new polytechnic and post graduate
programs assessed as satisfactory. The intermediate indicators were: (i) TALIF financing
and project assessment mechanisms are functional and (ii) the higher education policy is
aligned to principles of equity, efficiency, relevance, quality and accountability.

95.     TALIF provided the necessary inputs to support improvements in teaching,
learning, and relevance of tertiary education. This can be seen through TALIF
successfully contributing to teaching and learning by: (i) incorporating information
technology and communication (ITC) in the curriculum, (ii) revising and updating
curricula, particularly in the polytechnic institutes; (iii) providing distance education
through creations of IT facilities; (iv) successfully creating a series of internship
programs that linked institutions with industry: (v) developing lecture series that exposed
students to potential employers; and (vi) building the capacity of academic staff with
scholarships for masters and PhD. programs as well as targeted skills upgrading programs
for academic staff. Moreover, the relevance and skills content of polytechnic institutions
was sharpened through the establishment of modern laboratories and workshops. The
intermediate indicators were also met. TALIF successfully introduced a transparent and
competitive funding mechanism for tertiary education in Ghana. However, as indicated in
the M&E section of the ICR, an assessment and dissemination mechanism was never
integrated into the TALIF design which unfortunately limited the possibility of distilling
lessons and disseminating best practices throughout implementation. It was not until the



21
   There were seven studies that were commissioned either prior to project launch, or shortly after the
implementation process began that guided the conceptualization and design of TALIF. These studies
informed and guided the choice of interventions and activities under TALIF and helped link the proposed
activities more strategically to the needs of the sector. The studies were: (i) The Labor Market for Tertiary
Graduates in Ghana; (ii) Expenditure and Revenue Analysis of Tertiary Institutions; (iii) A Vision of
Postgraduate Education in Ghana; (iv) A Strategic Plan for Information and Communication Technology
Development; (v) Priorities and Strategies for Capacity Building in Tertiary Distance Education; (vi)
HIV/AIDS in Tertiary Institutions; and (vii) Socio-economic background of tertiary students.

end of the project that a formal assessment of the TALIF took place 22 . The formal
institutionalization of TALIF (or a similar competitive funding scheme) will largely
depend on properly disseminating the achievements of this project. The MoE is currently
considering using 20 percent of the GET fund to support a national competitive funding
scheme modeled on the TALIF which would be approximately US$5.4 million annually.
This would be a considerable investment by MoE for tertiary education and ensure the
sustainability of the TALIF. Finally, the higher education policy has been drafted and is
currently under legislative review. The draft policy does include principles of equity,
efficiency, relevance quality and accountability.

96.     Funding for TALIF sub-projects were spread across seven windows: (i)
polytechnic curricula quality and relevance; (ii) strengthening post-graduate programs;
(iii) institutional leadership and management development; (iv) support for tertiary
distance education; (v) strengthening the UDS; (vi) HIV/AIDS prevention and
management; and (vii) technical strengthening of tertiary oversight bodies. The funding
amounts for each window were established during project preparation and, by project
closing, the actual disbursements for each window were the same as originally designed
(See Figure 2 for actually percentages).

   The TALIF assessment was conducted by a local team of experts led by Professor John Anarfi and an
international evaluation consulting firm led by Cesar Yammal. The methodological approaches for the
assessment included: desk research, field surveys (quantitative and qualitative) and participatory
observation.

97.    The TALIF funds were in high demand and that the selection process was
competitive. A total of 922 proposals were received by the NCTE during the five TALIF
funding cycles, of which 412 (45 percent) were approved. TALIF resources supported
sub-projects in 27 public and private tertiary institutions and organizations across all ten
regions of Ghana. As Figure 3 illustrates the average approval rate for small proposals23
(70 percent) was significantly higher than that of regular proposals (31 percent).

98.     In an effort to raise the quality of teaching and learning within the tertiary sector,
TALIF sub-projects built and improved learning facilities, revised and developed
curricula, promoted staff development, and introduced competency-based training (CBT)
and problem-based learning (PBL). The project successfully established and upgraded 8
computer facilities, 39 laboratories, and 22 libraries. In addition to improving the
physical and ICT capacity at tertiary institutions, TALIF funds also supported the
introduction of 75 new courses and 10 new programs, as well as the upgrading of 109
courses and 9 programs. A total of 146 academic staff received technical training; 23
underwent specialized training abroad; and 20 obtained master degrees. Eighty-four
training workshops, spread across twenty-nine TALIF sub-projects, also provided
technical capacity building for academic staff.

99.     In order to sharpen the relevance, competences and skill content of polytechnic
education, TALIF funds were used to develop and reform curricula, integrate ICT in
teaching and learning activities, and create industrial attachment programs. Curricula
reform focused on improving the opportunities for students to acquire a range of skills,
including: (i) technical expertise and applied solving abilities; (ii) general skills
(communication, computer literacy, teamwork, etc.); and (iii) citizenship skills and values.
TALIF-funded initiatives also provided students with the chance to interact with business
firms and professional associations through a series of internship programs and guest
lecture series. Over 1,000 students interned with local enterprises and research centers,

  The small proposal window included grants up to US$20,000 per project, while the regular proposal
window included grants between US$20,001 and a maximum of US$200,000.



                                                                                   35
while nearly 100 staff members acquired industrial experience through exchange
programs.

100. Although there was an 82 percent completion rate of TALIF sub-projects, there
were constraints that led to the non-completion of some sub-projects. These included: (i)
long and complicated procurement processes, (ii) initial difficulties in obtaining approval
from the planning committee, (iii) delayed disbursement of funds upon completion of
milestones, (iv) delivery of faulty equipment, and (v) overreliance on one person, rather
than a team, to implement a sub-project. Field surveys administered to TALIF
coordinators and institutional heads at beneficiary institutions suggest that the funded
sub-projects were generally innovative, replicable, and that funds were judiciously used
during the implementation process. However, since baselines were not initially
established nor were TALIF activities systematically monitored, it is difficult to
determine whether universities, polytechnics, and supervisory bodies managed their
human and financial resources more efficiently and cost-effectively during the life of the
project.

101. TALIF supported the GoG‘s aim of improving the provision of tertiary education
by creating new and improved polytechnic and post-graduate programs in situ and by
expanding distance learning opportunities. As was previously documented, a large
number of programs and courses were launched or revised as a result of TALIF. A
concerted effort was made to broaden access within the most remote and underserved
regions of Ghana. This was done through the establishment of nine distances learning
programs as well as earmarking 12 percent of TALIF resources for direct support of the
UDS.24 By project closing, 12 percent of the total funds had been absorbed by the UDS.
During project implementation tertiary institutions experienced marked increases in
enrollments. Between 2004/05 and 2010/11, total enrollments in polytechnics and public
universities increased by 73 and 57 percent respectively. Between 2006/07 and 2009/10,
enrollment in distance education programs increased by 81 percent. While this increase in
enrollment cannot be directly attributable to TALIF, it is safe to assume that TALIF‘s
investments in new and improved programs and distance education capacities were both
relevant and timely given the surge in tertiary enrollment rates.

102. TALIF sought to support the development of HIV/AIDS programs within tertiary
institutions through peer counseling, campus awareness campaigns, and educational
programs incorporated into preexisting academic curricula. A total of 16 prevention
programs were established and 6 institutions currently possess a workplace policy on
HIV/AIDS as a result of the TALIF. AIDS awareness campaigns supported by the fund
have reached over 2,000 students across polytechnic institutes and public universities.



24
   The University of Development Studies (UDS) was originally established in 1992 as a center of
excellence in northern Ghana. UDS was strategically targeted within the EdSeP TALIF component
specifically because it had campuses in the three poorest regions in Ghana (Northern, Upper East and
Upper West).



                                                   36
103. Field surveys administered to all major stakeholders of TALIF (implementers,
coordinators, students, and academic staff) in 2011 reveal that the program‘s overarching
benefits were: (i) increased access to laboratory and learning equipment; (ii) staff
capacity building; (iii) exposure to innovative ways of teaching and learning; and (iv)
improved access to modern ICT facilities. In the process, TALIF successfully introduced
a transparent and competitive funding mechanism for tertiary education in Ghana. The
formal institutionalization of TALIF (or a similar competitive funding scheme) will
largely depend on properly disseminating the achievements of this project.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

104. The economic analysis of the project in the PAD did not calculate a Net Present
Value (NPV) or Internal Rate of Return (IRR), but argued that investments in education
are generally justified because they increase the productivity of labor and are associated
with beneficial social outcomes. It also argues that investments in capacity building are
important for increasing the efficient use of resources and for ensuring the effective
implementation of programs. The PAD also contends that direct budgetary support to the
deprived districts may promote great autonomy and financial accountability at the district
level while ensuring the sustainability of programs. The economic and financial analysis
for the PAD was comparable with that of similar projects at the time.

105. Based on available data the ICR provides: (i) succinct unit cost analyses for the
project‘s main investments; (ii) a detailed discussion regarding the use and targeting of
PPS resources; and (iii) an analysis of the project‘s operating costs.

106. The project successfully constructed 52 primary schools in Ghana‘s three northern
regions. Each school was equipped with 6 classrooms as well as basic toilet facilities.
Apart from the production of bidding documents, all pre-contract activities were
undertaken by the beneficiary District Administrations. Awarded contracts were required
to fall within established budget ceilings. These price ceilings were calculated based on
the average cost of building materials in the various project localities. An analysis of the
fifty-two awarded contracts shows that the cost of a 6-classroom primary school built
under the EdSeP ranged from US$95,586 to US$106,513, with an average cost of
US$99,909. As Table 9 illustrates this is comparable to the US$96,000 estimated cost of
a primary school provided by the Department for International Development (DFID)
during the same period.

Source: EdSeP primary school construction contracts and ―Delivering Cost Effective and Sustainable
School Infrastructure‖ (DFID).

  The average cost of a 6-classroom primary school under the project was 104,904 GH¢. Assuming the
average exchange rate for 2008 (1 GH¢ = US$1.05) —the year in which construction contracts were
awarded—the average cost in US dollars equals $99,909.
2
   According to DFID the average cost of a single classroom in Ghana was US$16,000. Thus, the average
cost of a standard 6-classroom primary school is equal to US$96,000.

107. The project also constructed 12 two-classroom kindergarten (KG) blocks and 3
three-classroom JHS blocks for an average cost of GH¢ 83,552 and GH¢ 84,745
respectively. This compares favorably to the average costs reported by the United States
Agency for International Development (USAID) for kindergarten and junior high school
blocks supervised by the Funds and Procurement Management Unit of Ghana (FPMU).
The FPMU costs were GH¢ 152,000 and GH¢ 130,500 respectively.

108. The government has reported financing the construction of 458 boreholes 25 by
utilizing PPS funds. This activity was overseen by MOE and GES in cooperation with the
Community Water and Sanitation Agency (CWSA)—the government entity in charge of
overseeing the technical quality and standards for boreholes. Table 11 shows that the unit
construction cost in the EdSeP project for a borehole was comparable to the unit costs in
NGO and community-based projects.

  By working in partnership with School Management Committees in Ghana, the project seeks to provide
clean drinking water to a number of schools in the Bongo District. The current cost of a borehole under this
project is estimated at £4000, corresponding to US$6,320 assuming the current exchange rate
(1£=US$1.58).

109. Targeting. In accordance with the decentralization strategy laid out by Ghana‘s
Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS), the Pilot Programmatic Scheme‘s (PPS)
main objective was to provide direct budgetary support to the deprived districts for
targeted operational activities on the basis of their strategic importance. Rather than
identifying ex ante the activities to be financed by the component, districts were
encouraged to articulate their own strategic priorities in an Annual Program of Work
(APoW), which would subsequently be implemented and managed locally. In the process,
PPS envisioned fostering greater financial autonomy, accountability and decision-making
power at the district level.

110. As the Bank‘s 2011 report ―Education in Ghana: Improving Equity, Efficiency
and Accountability of Education Service Delivery‖ cogently argues, poorer regions and
districts in Ghana have historically benefitted less from public resource allocations than
wealthier regions and districts. The study shows that both in absolute terms and on a per
student basis, Ghana‘s three poorest regions (Northern, Upper East and Upper West)
receive lower levels of public funds for basic education than the other regions in the
country. Within this context, the PPS sought to address the inequitable distribution of

public resources by strategically channeling project funds to the poorest regions and
districts in Ghana. As Table 12 illustrates the average poverty rate for the deprived
districts targeted by the PPS within in the Northern, Upper East and Upper West, is
substantially higher that the other regions in Ghana.

111. PPS Analysis. An analysis of the consolidated APoWs for 2010 and 2011 reveals
that the largest share of PPS resources were channeled to Ghana‘s three poorest
regions—Northern, Upper East and Upper West. As Figure 4 illustrates, nearly 60
percent of the total PPS budget was absorbed by these three northern regions. While the
sheer volume of PPS support to these economically disadvantaged areas in 2010 and
2011 (GH¢ 13.6) suggests that funds may have been targeted at the regions with the
greatest financial needs, it is also important to examine how PPS funds were distributed
across the various regions on a per student basis.

112. As Table 13 shows the per student PPS allocation in deprived districts situated
within the three northern regions also tended to be higher on average when compared to
the other regions in Ghana. In fact, the per student allocation average for the three
northern regions was equal to GH¢ 15.60 for the 2010/11 period, whereas the per student
allocation average for all other regions was GH¢ 9.93 during the same period. Thus, both
in absolute terms and on a per student basis, PPS provided greater levels of financial
support to the more economically disadvantaged regions.

113. EdSeP Operating Cost Analysis. The original project IDA allocation for
operating costs for all three implementing agencies was SDR 750,000 or 1.43 percent of
the total project costs. In March 2011, the government and the Bank agreed to cancel
SDR 4,450,400 for a total project cost of SDR 48,249,600 and revised the operating costs
to approximately SDR 1.4 million or 3 percent of total project costs. By the project
closing the actual operating costs expenditures were 2.22 percent26 of total project costs.
Although the March 2011 estimated represented an increase over the original estimation,
the actual operating costs, at project closing, were below the revised estimates and only a
fraction more than the original.

Implementation

114. Delay in completing project preparatory activities. During implementation, a
few project preparatory activities that could have taken place before credit effectiveness
rather occurred during the implementation phase. These include selection of districts to
participate in the PPS programme, appointment of DEOs, and final results framework and
monitoring systems caused initial delays that were rectified afterwards.

115. Project Restructuring and Mid Term review. The project was restructured
thrice. The first restructuring was aimed to better accommodate the Government‘s
strategic priorities and to better align the development objectives and the key
performance indicators with the project activities. The restructured project was altogether
a better fit with what the key beneficiaries, school districts and higher education
institutions aimed to achieve. The project was restructured for the second time at the
request of the Government of Ghana (GoG) for a portfolio-wide restructuring to cancel
and reallocate funds within the IDA portfolio. This enabled the cancellation of US$7
million from the PPS component. The third restructuring was to re-allocate funds from
SCB to PPS.

116. At mid-term, the Government decided that the Sector Capacity Building (SCB)
component, which was implemented by the FPMU should be aligned with the PPS and
the project objectives focused on basic education, targeting improvements of district
capacities in the 40 districts, which increased to 53 and finally 61 deprived districts.
However, this alignment created a confusion regarding which agency among MOE and
GES managed the implementation of the component.

117. Following the restructuring after mid-term, a second objective in post basic
education was added to improve the capacities of selected Technical Training Institutes
under the new Skills Development Fund which was implemented by the Council for
Technical Vocational Education and Training (COTVET).

118. Government White Paper on Education. During implementation, the
Government issued a White Paper on Education that described an ambitious vision to
expand the system and improve performance of the education sector. The key objectives
of the White Paper were provision of free education, improving quality, attention to
equity, expanding high quality educational opportunities in secondary and post-secondary
education, and increasing linkages between education and the labor market. Some
recommendations of the White paper were incorporated into the project. These include
the two-year pre-school kindergarten program and the capitation grant for the poor.

119. Pilot Programmatic Scheme (PPS) - District Targeting. The PPS‘s plan to
channel funds to the 40 districts delayed for 18 months due to a number of factors
including confirmation and training of district directors, readiness of districts to receive




                                            46
funding and preparation of programme and procurement plans. Once the directors were
in place and training carried out, implementation picked up.

120. Performance of deprived DAs under PPS. All the eventual 61 deprived districts
that benefited from the Pilot Programmatic Scheme developed programs of work (POW)
under the PPS. Under the POW, funds were provided to the districts on demand and after
reporting on already completed activities under the approved POWs. Due to limited
capacity at the district level, districts were grouped into ready districts, partially ready
districts, and non-ready districts. Ready districts had full autonomy with direct transfer
of funds to the districts. Partially ready districts had the regional director of education as
co-signatory to the district account while non-ready districts had the funds transferred
into the Regional Education Office accounts. In order to reduce the regional imbalance
in teacher supply and improve on educational quality, incentive packages including
bicycles were given to teachers in deprived schools. Also, the quota system of postings
was enforced with greater consideration given to deprived districts. The Regional
Director for Education vetted the requests for funds before they are released.

121. The GES used several indicators for identifying deprived districts such as access
to the school - hard to post areas, number of times public transport ply‘s the route,
availability of water and electricity, distance from the district capital, BECE examination
results of the school over time. Teachers who qualify under this scheme are provided
with items like solar lanterns, water tanks, and bicycles.

122. Decentralizing Education. The education sector was not covered by the newly
approved Local Government Act (Act 462) since the Act was at variance with the
Education Act. While the Education Act states that GES education offices would be
transformed into education departments under the District Assemblies (DAs), the Local
Government Act does not list the education sector as one of the decentralized
departments. The education sector has its own service system. To ensure smooth project
implementation, an understanding was reached which allowed the education project team
to promote education decentralization at the local level. The understanding was that the
sector engaged in a deconcentration and devolution process (transferring authority from
GES Headquarters to GES REOs and DEOs) rather than in a decentralization process
(transferring power from appointed GES officials to elected DAs). It was agreed that the
Capacity Building component will be developed within the context of deconcentration
instead of decentralization, since it was acknowledged that deconcentration is an
intermediary step towards decentralization.

123. Project Oversight and implementation team. The project did not create
implementation unit. Instead, each component was to be entrusted to the relevant
agencies. The general responsibility of the project was with the Minister, and, by
delegation to the Chief Director. The project anticipated that a Steering and Oversight
Committee (SOC) would be established to advise remedial measures in case of deviation.
During implementation, there were staffing changes and attrition of staff in 2009 that
created implementation challenges which was rectified in the later part of the year.




                                             47
124. Public Sector Reform. Concerning the relationship with the public sector reform,
the education sector had already carried out their job evaluation and that fed into the
work of the fair wages commission under the Single Spine Salary System.

125. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization.
Project‘s design of the monitoring and evaluation arrangements took into consideration
the support of the EMIS which is powerful tool for measuring educational statistics in
Ghana. Project monitoring was adequate for most part of the project but there were
challenges to the measuring system as initial baseline values and indicators agreed at
project preparation were not appropriate as a measuring tool until they were revised after
the MTR. Project implementation meetings were regularly carried out between the World
Bank, MOFEP, GES, Director General and PPS Coordinator to review status of project.

126. Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance. The GES Financial Controller was in
charge of the overall FM function of the SCB and PPS components. He was supported by
adequately qualified Regional Accountants, in charge of the District Accountants in their
various regions. Within the districts, a Budget Officer took charge of the work plans and
budget pricing, while the Accountant handled the disbursements and reporting. Closely
supervising them both was the District Director. The arrangement was satisfactory, and
worked well where the Districts have adequately qualified personnel. Unfortunately only
a few districts had qualified personnel. Most required regular support from the Regional
Monitoring team, compiling returns, and in processing the payments. There was timely
release of project funds to support communities affected by the 2007 floods in northern
Ghana by constructing schools that collapsed during the floods. Apart from preparation
of bidding documents, all pre-contract services were undertaken by the beneficiary
district assemblies.

127. During implementation, the Procurement Unit was established in MOE under the
Finance and Administration Division, and the transfer of staff from FPMU to the MOE
was completed before effectiveness. However, staffs transferred were returned to FPMU
in 2009 to enable the project unit exercise an overarching role and provide support
services to other agencies of the ministry.

128. Post-completion Operation/Next Phase. The implementation of the project has
put into focus investments and other input needs of district education offices. With the
closing of the project, flow of budget support to district education offices will be scaled
down. It is not clear how the shortfall shall be bridged.

129. Achievement of Project Development Objectives. The project‘s ultimate
objective of testing a mechanism that will enable the Ministry of Education and
Development partners to full-scale sector-wide approach leading to a more
comprehensive budgetary support was a huge challenge. Whiles districts with human
and material capacity had mixed results; newly created districts faced major challenges.

Comp 1 - improving equitable access to and completion of basic education in deprived
districts


                                            48
130. The key objectives for this sub-component was to increase access to, and
participation in education and training, with greater emphasis on gender and geographical
equity; improve the quality of basic education; and enhance the delivery of education
services. Significant improvements have been made particularly in the areas of basic
school enrolment and progress towards the attainment of these broad objectives was
recorded in the 2011 editions of the APRs and the EMIS reports. Indicators on Primary
Gross Enrolment Ratio, Gender Parity Index and Primary Completion rates were used to
assess progress towards the attainment of these policy objectives. As highlighted below,
there is evidence of achievement of some indicators, although they cannot all be
conclusively attributed to the EdSeP.

   i)      Primary Gross Enrolment Rate in deprived districts increases

131. Generally, there have been remarkable increases in Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER)
across primary and KG schools between 2004 and 2011 at both deprived areas and at the
national levels. The GER in the deprived districts has improved significantly at the
Primary level, increasing from 76% in 2003/04 to 92.9% in 2010/011. The average
national Primary GER increased from 86.5% in 2003/04 to 96.4% in 2010/11 and at the
kindergarten (KG) level, GER has increased from 54.6% in 2003/04 to 98.37% in
2010/11. The Upper West and Upper East Regions registered the most significant
increase in the GER for the period 2001 – 2010, for primary level, while Ashanti and
Volta regions recorded the least in improvements in GER over the same period. On the
average, the deprived districts grew faster than the non-deprived districts. Many
observers note that had the project not come into fruition; there would have been serious
problems in education delivery in Ghana.

   ii)     Gender Parity Index at Primary Level in deprived districts improve

132. Gender Parity Index (GPI) is the ratio of boys to girls‘ enrolment, with the
balance of parity being one (1.00). Active implementation of activities to promote girls‘
education has helped to eliminate barriers to enrolment and encouraged participation and
attendance. The trend indicates that, the GPI at the primary level has increased from 0.92
in 2005/06 to 0.95 for deprived districts in 2011 and 0.96 as national average.

133. The GPI decreased marginally at the kindergarten. At the regional level, it inched
up compared to the aggregated figures. The GPI for primary school level in the Central
Region was 1.0 which signified that there was no difference in school enrolment between
boys and girls whereas GPI for secondary school was 0.92. The GPI for primary school
in the Upper West Region was 1.02 indicating that more boys attend school than girls. In
addition, there were no differences for the GPI for primary school in Accra and Kumasi
metropolitan which was 1.00 and 0.99 respectively. Average girls‘ enrolment for the
original forty (40) districts at the primary level rose from 46.62% in 2003 to 47.52% in
2004, a rise of 0.9%. Within the same period, average girls‘ enrolment for JHS rose by
1.7%. During the visit to the schools, it was noted that the formation of girl clubs in
schools encouraged the attendance and retention of girls in school.



                                           49
   iii)    Primary Completion Rate in deprived districts increases

134. Primary Completion rate also termed Survival rate measures the proportion of
pupils who stay and complete school after enrolment at the Primary level. Completion
rate at the primary level in deprived districts was at a low level of 52.7% in 2003/04 but
rose consistently to 86.9% in 2010/11 falling short of the end of Project target of 89.0%.
Nationally, while completion rates increased from 81.7%in 2003/04 to 89.7% in 2009/10
among male pupils at the primary school level, it increased from 74% to 84.3%among
female pupils over the same period.

135. Admission into primary is increasing both nationally and deprived district levels.
The gross admission rate for primary 1 increased from 81.8% in 2003/04 to 100.5% in
2010/11 for the deprived districts and from 88.2% to 99.6% nationally during the same
period.

136. Capitation Grant. The Capitation grant was rolled nationwide and sustained
since 2005/2006 academic year after the pilot in deprived districts in 2004/2005. As part
of the GPRS and the EdSeP, the GoG introduced the grants in all public primary and JSS
schools to replace the remaining fees and levies, and to give schools a bit more control
over resources. There is anecdotal evidence that capitation grants increased school
enrollments. The expansion of enrollment and improvement of quality were also boosted
by the delivery of new textbooks. The results have been very impressive, but also
challenging in terms of sustaining growth, managing the system, addressing quality,
monitoring results. These results are part of the GoG approved education sector plan,
clearly measured and most thoroughly monitored.

Key challenges include the following:

137. Inadequate Infrastructure.        Insufficient number of school buildings to
accommodate the growing population of pupils, especially after the introduction of the
capitation grant and the school feeding programme have affected education delivery in
the country.

138. Improved teacher motivation needed. Poor conditions of service coupled with
low motivation factors, availability of teaching and learning materials, etc. have
contributed to undermine the quality of education.

139. Accountability to parents and students. The mechanism to monitor and evaluate
teachers which was almost non-existent are now being improved to ensure that teachers
are always in the classroom and teaching according to what is expected of them. School
performance appraisal meetings are being developed, school report cards being promoted.
The newly established National Teaching Council is being strengthened to regulate
teachers as a professional association. The National Inspectorate Board has also been
established to provide external quality assurance. These were all recommendations of the
President‘s Committee on Education.




                                           50
140. Decentralizing education. The ultimate vision of decentralizing education
management to District Assemblies though laudable was a herculean task considering the
fact that redeploying staff, and merging GES with MOE had perceived and unintended
implications such as infrastructure availability, employee reactions, employee job
satisfaction, etc. The Government constituted a 9-Menber Decentralization
Implementation committee to manage the Education decentralization process and their
report was submitted to the Chief Director in November 2007.

141. The PPS programme was successful. Activities in the work program were focused
on enrolment drives, support to needy children, provision of furniture, rehabilitation of
various school infrastructure, regular school inspections, implementation of incentive
packages for teachers in deprived areas, training of circuit supervisors, provision of water
storage and toilet facilities, provision of storage facilities under improving quality of
education delivery; first-aid kits, and training of heads of schools. In some situations,
teachers in the deprived areas were given bicycles to support their transportation to and
from school. PPS funds were used to purchase school band in one particular school at
New Abirem in the Birim North district which improved school attendance as the sound
of the band attracted the children to attend school. All PPS districts were given computers,
accessories, scanners, etc.

142. Building Education Management Information Systems (EMIS) for Decentralized
Administration. The improvement of the EMIS was a critical part of the SCB component
of the project and was one of the more successful elements of the whole project. The
EMIS cleaned up the Ghana master school list by the end of December 2005.
Presentation of the summary data has been made more comprehensive by the inclusion of
senior secondary, tertiary and technical education. The EMIS data was used to verify
general progress of education performance. At the start of project, EMIS, which is
established in the MOE was not well established but by 2011, it was resourced and
generating annual reports for all 170 districts. The use of EMIS has led to greater
realization of the value of statistical data for policy, planning and management purposes.

143. Sector Capacity Building. The sector capacity building program was designed in
close collaboration with NIRP to ensure MOE‘s program was in line with entire
Government‘s public sector reform program. The NIRP culminated in the creation of the
Ministry of Public Sector Reform (MPSR). However, MPSR idea was discontinued and
there was no institution driving national institutional development and capacity building
in Ghana. The Office of the President currently oversees the reform program but it is
important a constitutionally mandated body enacted by an act of parliament is established
to direct and regulate public sector reform activities in Ghana. One remarkable success of
the project was that the reports on phase II of the project were used by the MOE to carry
out their job evaluation that fed into the work of the fair wages commission under the
Single Spine Salary System.

144. The project contributed to consolidate educational policies at the national,
regional and district levels in policy planning and formulation of educational programs.
An MOU was signed to ensure MOE, GES and GES Council to implementation agreed



                                            51
recommendations in Phases 1 and 2 consulting assignments into phase 3 of the SCB but
this could not materialize during project implementation. The project supported the
development of new administrative mechanisms that led to better working relationships
between MOE and GES but the work on the division of labor was not completed.
GIMPA has however completed reviewing, updating harmonizing manuals and trained
trainers in the use of GES Financial and operational manual.

145. Skills Development Fund (SDF) and TIMMS. This component added during the
MTR to pilot and prepare the implementation of the new project to improve capacity of
selected teacher training institutes to be implemented by the Council for Technical
Vocational Education and Training (COTVET). Then the Training Mathematics and
Science (TIMMS) was also added after the extension of the project and designed for
teachers in 61 deprived Districts to improve training of mathematics and science. They
were disbursed from the Sector Capacity Building Component.

146. Construction of Model Education Offices. The SCB component improved the
capacities of DEO offices in the 61 (used to be 40, then 53) deprived districts in
delivering basic education. The project provided computers, office furniture, etc. for all
the districts. Eleven (11) pilot DEOs were developed to reflect minimum acceptable
standards in terms of staffing, buildings and equipment under the GES develop blueprint
for a ‗model DEO‘, a ‗model REO‘, and a ‗model school‘. One REO in Kumasi, though
not part of deprived districts was also constructed. The GES Training School at Saltpond
was also rehabilitated.

147. Construction and rehabilitation of schools. On schools affected by northern
Ghana floods, there was significant progress in the reconstruction works and that most of
the construction was completed on time. A total of US$7.6 million was allocated to
schools after the 2007 floods and all 67 schools constructed were completed and taken
over by the districts. The schools comprised 52-No. 6 unit classroom block, 3 No. 3 unit
classroom blocks, 12 No. 2 unit classroom blocks. The projects delayed difficulties in
accessing the sites and inadequate construction capacity.

148. Construction of borehole. About 458 boreholes were constructed out of the
planned 667 boreholes, seven in each of the 61 deprived districts and one in each of the
67 new schools being constructed following the destruction from the 2007 floods. The
CWSA worked in an advisory capacity and the boreholes were implemented under the
supervision of district water and sanitation teams.

149. Procurement. To improve management efficiency at the Regional and District
education offices, a number of equipment was procured including the following., 13
Station Wagon and 48 Double-cabin pick-ups, 315 Computers and accessories to the
DEOs and REOs, 12 laptops, 66 Air-Conditioners for the model offices, 160 Desktop
computers, 8 Notebook computers, 143 UPS, 2 LCDs, 1 Scanner 117 Laser Jet printers, 3
Heavy duty printers, 1 No. server and software. Training was carried out in procurement,
auditing etc. for various category of staff. More than 1,200 SMC members and 40 Circuit
supervisors were also trained in eight training centers throughout the country. District



                                           52
capacity building focused on financial management and financial reporting, education
planning and management, and M&E. The project supported printing of 24,000 copies of
revised School Management Committee manual for SMC members.

150. Some of the activities financed under PPS included Support for needy children –
especially Girls in providing School Uniforms, Sandals, Bags etc., Rehabilitation of
School Buildings, Provision of Furniture, Sanitation facilities ie. Gender Friendly and
Toilet and Urinals, organising enrolment drives.

151.   Justification of Overall Outcome Rating. Given the information provided in this
ICR, the overall outcome is moderately Satisfactory.

152. Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry. The Government ICR team
rates the Bank performance at preparation as moderately Satisfactory. The Bank must be
commended for taking proactive steps to address the challenges that had bedeviled the
education sector, especially for tertiary education at the time most donors had refused to
fund the sector. However, the project was overly ambitious and complex and Bank team
failed to heed to management‘s advice to address the complexity of the operation. The
performance indicators (Results framework) were somehow disconnected from the PDO
and outcome indicators as they could not be measured, and quantifiable indicators to
evaluate their achievement were not done until after the MTR. The stand-alone lending
instrument was inappropriate as a longer term three-phase programmatic support would
have been more appropriate to address the enormous educational challenges that faced
the sector.

153. The Bank‘s team may had good intentions to support the educational sector with a
single big operation but it appears not adequate institutional assessment was carried out
to determine what could be implemented during the life of the project as a number of
activities listed in Annex 2 of the PAD as well as Phase 3 of the Sector capacity building
component did not start.

154. Bank Quality of Supervision. The quality of supervision is Moderately
Satisfactory. The supervision team included the appropriate mix of skills, and specialized
support for procurement and financial management was provided to address issues that
affected implementation. The team took the appropriate decisions in dropping a number
of project activities to focus attention on the few that could be implemented and could
impact on the PDOs. There were other supervision strengths as well, the ability of the
team to address issues not previously described in the project, for example the northern
floods, construction of hundreds of boreholes, aligning the SCB to the PPS, etc.

155. The Bank team was regarded a reliable partner in enhancing donor coordination
through active participation in group meetings and in being the lead agency for the
partners. The Bank‘s team also provided adequate advice during the implementation
phase when the President‘s Education report was released and supported Government to
incorporating some aspects of the report in the project.




                                           53
156. Some of supervision decisions were however reactive in nature and could not
adequately anticipate or advice Government ahead on key implementation challenges on
the project. There were also implementation and decision-making delays that were
avoidable. Finally, cancelling project funds from the PPS at the instigation of bank
country leadership at the time the number of districts have increased by fifty percent was
not prudent enough as the rate of disbursements for the component had picked up and
PPS budgets had increased.

157. Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance. The overall bank
performance is Moderately Satisfactory.

158. Government Performance. Government‘s performance is moderately
satisfactory. The Government displayed strong ownership and commitment to the
development objectives demonstrated by its decision to establish a crack project team to
support the preparatory processes. The Government released the President‘s Report on
Education and part of the report was immediately incorporated in the EdSeP project, eg.
two-year pre-school kindergarten program, etc. The MTR provided an opportunity for
some Government team to better understand the project which necessitated the
restructuring of the project.

159. The MOE provided the requisite project oversight involving all agencies to
resolve policy and implementation issues which were regularly carried out. During the
project life, there changes to the Ministers and Chief Directors that affected project
implementation. Counterpart funds were however not regularly forthcoming. There was
no general agreement among Government officials towards the cancellation of funds
from the PPS component.

160. The GES managed a better than expected performance in leadership and outreach
to the districts and regional education offices. But the delayed appointment of DEOs
affected the commencement of the PPS component.

161. Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance. Implementation Agency
performance is moderately satisfactory. The implementation agencies provided
procurement and financial management support, especially to the MOE. FPMU helped
steer the affairs of the project throughout during attrition of staff in 2009. During the
MTR, staff of the implementing agencies and consultants held a number of workshops
that helped to restructure the project.

162. Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance. Based on the
foregoing, the overall borrower performance is moderately satisfactory.

Lessons Learned
163. The EdSeP was an ambitious and complex project positioned in a transition phase
from central to decentralized delivery of education services, and was expected to
accomplish more than it was possible during the implementation period. Implementation
posed formidable challenges on management, coordination and communication. While



                                           54
mandates were devolved to the districts, the overall objectives remained a challenge and
their attainment required additional efforts to keep all decision makers informed,
involved and empowered. A simpler project design including fewer sub-components and
activities are far better in selection a project in a complex educational sector, especially in
situations where new policy instruments are developed and acceptance of all political
parties in the policy are not guaranteed.

164. Project Design – Project design must be based on well-conceived results chain
where there is connectivity between the PDO and the agreed measurable indicators and
their attribution limited to the scope of the project. Appropriate baseline indicators
should have been measured from the onset of project implementation to gauge
achievements towards the stated objectives and to improve management effectiveness
rather than postponing them for the supervision period.

165. Longer term sector wide approach needed – More medium/long-term sector wide
program is needed for the education sector. The choice of a long term programmatic
instrument would have been more appropriate than the stand-alone investment operation.
The programmatic instrument would have provided an overall framework for the
implementation of the Government‘s program over time while following adjustments
throughout implementation.

166. Project preparatory activities must be completed during design phase - A number
of project preparatory activities that should have taken place before credit effectiveness
rather occurred during the implementation phase which delayed the project start-off.

167. Lessons on PPS – Funds administered against agreed district plans and results
encourages pooling of resources at the district level, promotes comprehensive approach
to development and form the basis for simplified reporting systems. The project piloted
the development of performance based contracts among various responsibility levels, for
example, performance contracts between the Director General of the GES and the District
Directors, performance Contracts between the District Director for education, and the
circuit supervisors on the one hand; and between the circuit supervisors and the head
teachers on the other. It is expected that performance agreements shall be scaled up.

168. Management Challenges of MOE and GES - A critical measure of success of the
project remains the ability of the MOE and GES to manage the largely decentralized
sector, build capacity of the district offices to assume their enhanced roles under the
Government‘s decentralization plan, and target the Government‘s overall financing of
primary education to deprived areas.

169. Managing Bank’s Expectations – As early as the period before the MTR, World
Bank‘s team was expecting significant improvements in the sector which did not happen
according their expectation. It is important that Bank must manage expectations in line
with what can be reasonably achieved. Implementation procedures should remain


                                              55
simplified and flexible enough to address evolving development and institutional
challenges.

170. Creation of more District Assemblies – the project commenced with 40 districts,
which increased to 53 and finally 61 deprived districts. Overall, the creation and addition
of more districts to the project slowed down project implementation as strenuous efforts
were made to establish new structures, and newly recruited staff were trained on fiduciary
and project management issues. That notwithstanding, new districts could not implement
the project and implementation then shifted to the regional directors. In future, and due
to operational challenges, newly created districts must first benefit from institutional and
capacity improvements before it could be added onto subsequent projects.

171. Poor infrastructure remains the challenge in deprived districts - Insufficient
number of school buildings to accommodate the growing population of pupils, especially
after the introduction of the capitation grant and the school feeding programme, the boom
in basic enrolments came with its attendant challenges on education service delivery in
the country. The gaps in schooling infrastructure, teaching and learning materials and
qualified teachers were glaring. Good teachers were unwilling to work in poor and
deprived communities, which means that the worst off have the least opportunity to
receive quality education services. District Assemblies should have been more involved.
District Works Department must be strengthened to oversee construction and
maintenance of education facilities in the districts.

172. An adequate monitoring and evaluation system is important to assess the project‘s
progress and to encourage informed decisions during implementation. The project relied
on the existing education information systems to define monitoring and evaluation
systems.

173. Community involvement is key to education delivery – one key unintended benefit
of the project was the level of community involvement in the project as some
communities came together to support the project from their own resources. Educational
must tap into the expertise of all stakeholders to increase investments and promote
sustainability of the sector.
