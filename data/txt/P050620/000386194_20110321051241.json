The\n            cancellation and reallocation of US$7m (seven million United\n            States dollars) from the credit an amount will be\n            recommitted to the general International Development\n            Association (IDA) pool for Ghana towards supporting quick\n            disbursing projects.  This is necessary to provide expedited\n            disbursements and funding for other strategic Government\n            priorities in education and other sectors. The increase of\n            the withdrawal limit is necessitated by the improvements of\n            implementation especially for Pilot Programmatic Scheme\n            (PPS). The more effective implementation of the Annual\n            Programs of Work (APOW) by the districts have led to an\n            increased demand for funds at short intervals rendering the\n            current withdrawal limit insufficient to meet requests of\n            payments. Also, the construction of classrooms under the\n            Northern Flood Program has also come to a phase when large\n            payments are needed to contractors. The increase of the\n            withdrawal limit will, therefore, improve the project's\n            implementation and its likelihood of achieving the expected outcomes."}, "docdt": "2011-03-17T00:00:00Z"}
