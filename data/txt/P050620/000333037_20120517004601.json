"Ratings for the Education Sector Project\n            for Ghana were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: a\n            demand-driven competitive funding mechanism is an effective\n            instrument for allocating public funding aimed at fostering\n            innovation, relevance and quality in tertiary education as\n            long as the selection criteria are clear, transparent, and\n            well publicized. The efficient and timely implementation of\n            project activities is contingent upon building and\n            sustaining project implementation capacity. Funds\n            administered against agreed district plans encourages\n            pooling of funds and can be the basis for improving the\n            effective targeting of resources to meet the specific needs\n            of districts. Pilot programs must establish sound monitoring\n            and evaluation systems to measure impact, identify problems\n            and take corrective measures. Overly ambitious sector-wide\n            reforms take time to prepare, own and implement and cannot\n            be undertaken in a Specific Investment Loan (SIL)\n            particularly when there is limited institutional capacity."}, "docdt": "2012-04-27T00:00:00Z"}
