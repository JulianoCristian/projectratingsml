                         The objectives of the Project are to: (a) improve equitable access to and completion of basic education in deprived districts; and (b) improve quality of teaching
                         and learning, management efficiency and relevance of post-basic education

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is entering the last eight months of implementation. After lags in implementation and disbursement in 2009, both started to get back on track in 2010. The Government
                         has requested reallocation from slow disbursing projects in June 2010 in order to finance new Government priorities. Accordingly, the Government requested a partial cancellation of

                         US$ 7 million of this project, which is less than 10 percent of the total project amount. This restructuring is now being processed by the Bank. Disbursement is currently at 71.45
                         percent. During missions in December 2010 and January 2011, the team discussed and agreed with Government on disbursement and implementation plans through the end of the

                         project for each component.

                         Given the acceleration in implementation and in disbursement as well as the positive changes in project staff, we recommend to upgrade the implementation rating to Moderately
                         Satisfactory.

                         In the meantime, some indicators, while they show improvements relative to the restructured baseline and significant improvements relative to the original baseline, also show some
                         declines especially in enrollment and completion rates. These trends may be explained by external factors unrelated to the project activities. The Government is advised to analyze
                         these trends and to provide some explanation. In addition, TALIF has not completed all the grant reviews as agreed under the restructuring. Given the improved monitoring and
                         evaluation (M&E) reporting and the improvements relative to the baseline, the Development Objectives (DO) rating is upgraded to Moderately Unsatisfactory. Once the explanations
                         regarding changes in basic education indicators and the evaluation of the expected Teaching and Learning Innovation Fund (TALIF) grants are completed, the DO rating will be
                         considered for further upgrade to Moderately Satisfactory.

                         The Bank will proceed with the partial cancellation of US$7million as requested by the Government. All three components will be monitored on a monthly basis. The Government will
                         review the data indicating declines in basic education indicators and report back to the Bank by March 2011. It has also been agreed that the TALIF will contract an independent
                         monitoring consultant without delay.
