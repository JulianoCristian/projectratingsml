                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is closing on October 31, 2011 and the present ISR is the last one also focusing on the entire project implementation period. The last implementation support mission is
                         being held between October 6-20 and coincides with a mission to start the Implementation Completion Report.

                         The improvements in project implementation and disbursement that started in 2010 have been sustained, and they even accelerated resulting in overcommitment of funds. A third

                         restructuring of the project was then requested in late September for reallocation of funds between project components. This restructuring allocated more resources to the PPS work
                         to provide more funds to the deprived districts. In fact, the project was restructured three times during the last three years. The first restructuring was a level one and it was based on
                         a strategic redefinition of the project, informed by an extensive mid-term review and a new education reform that had started in 2008. This restructuring resulted in re-aligned project
                         development objectives, indicators, and new subcomponents and expenditure categories. The second restructuring was originated by the Government of Ghana to allocate resources

                         from the project towards other Government priorities.

                         Overall, project achievements and project implementation were both strongly affected by key design features, including (1) the programmatic nature that was aligned both with the
                         Government 's evolving education sector strategic agenda and with harmonized donor support; (2) the use of Government systems and institutions instead of a separate project
                         management unit; (3) the decentralized implementation through grants and sub-projects by over 63 deprived districts in the case of PPS and by 27 higher education institutions in the
                         case of TALIF and; consequently (4) some bottlenecks, constraints and capacity issues in these decentralized beneficiary institutions especially in terms of FM, procurement and
                         monitoring. Furthermore, elections in 2008 and frequent Government reshuffling also weakened the implementation, monitoring and oversight capacities thus leading to erratic
                         disbursement.

                         On the more positive side, seven years of implementation through Government institutions led to continuously improvement of ownership, attention and capacity to use the project's
                         key instruments, including: the capitation grants to schools; the Education Management Information System; the Annual Programs of Work at district level and the Pilot Programmatic
                         Scheme to finance deprived districts; the Teaching and Learning Innovation Fund for higher education institutions and the Skills Development Fund for skills development/TVET.
                         There is now a strong likelihood that all of these instruments will be mainstreamed and thus, key project activities will be sustained. This likelihood is combined with strong
                         Government efforts to carry out evaluation and bring the lessons forward to improve support to the decentralized agencies mentioned earlier.

                         In terms of the monitoring indicators, especially in basic education, the use of the capitation grants and the pilot programmatic scheme, together with other donor funds resulted in
                         significant improvements in access to and completion of basic education in the deprived districts. Both the Government and the Development Partners have expressed their
                         commitment that targeting the deprived districts, a system developed by EdSeP, will continue. These districts have taken significant steps to catch up with the non-deprived districts
                         and with national averages in terms of admissions, enrollment rates, completion and gender parity. While with the programmatic approach, attribution to the project activities is limited
                         by the fact that IDA and donor and Government support to the deprived districts were harmonized, the Government of Ghana clearly considers both the capitation grant and the PPS
                         as key factors stimulating the achievements in the key performance indicators. Furthermore, the Skills Development Fund has led to a new project. Also, another instrument, the
                         capitation grant has become mainstreamed via Government financing during the second year of the project. Finally, TALIF is now being considered to be an integral part of a
                         reformed higher education financing system, for which the Bank was asked to provide technical assistance following the EdSeP project closing.

                         The Government has engaged in detailed evaluation of the key project instruments and has also started to develop a sector program to be financed through the Global Partnership
                         for Education based on improvements and adjustments to be made in such policy and financing instruments. These Government executed evaluations are also part of the Sector
                         Capacity Building component. The capitation grant, the APOW and PPS systems are all being considered to be part of this upcoming program, which the Bank was asked to serve as
                         a supervising entity.

                         In conclusion, the implementation was negatively affected by erratic and sometimes very slow disbursements for basic education, fragmented sector capacity building activities and
                         lack of monitoring of higher education activities. Some of these were the consequences of using government agencies and systems in implementation. At the same time, the use of

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         All agencies responsible for implementation of project components have been focusing on (1) final implementation issues; (2) any last minute bottlenecks; (3) identifying areas where
                         completion before closing is not possible, and Government or other external funding needed to complete such activities; and (4) detailed evaluation of the project as well as
                         recommendations for future mainstreaming/continuation.
                         The World Bank has started to proceed with the Implementation Completion Report.
                         The World Bank has started to proceed with project closing procedures, including the partial recuperation of project funds. These need to be closely monitored given that the project
                         overcommitted, and decentralized agencies are all focused on completing all sub-projects and grant activities.
                         The Bank has started its work on the preparation of the new GPE project and needs to work with the Government in using the district-based instruments (capitation grant, APOW and
                         PPS) to continue supporting the deprived districts but with stronger focus on quality.
