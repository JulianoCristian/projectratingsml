The cancellation is based on a portfolio-wide restructuring requested by the 
Ghana Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MOFEP) in June and October, 2010 
with the purpose of redirecting IDA funds from slow disbursing projects with imminent 
closing dates to key economic sectors/areas which will ensure quick disbursements of 
funds.

3. 
In addition of the cancellation, we are proposing to increase the withdrawal limit 
from the current US$2 million to US5 million to facilitate the effective implementation 
and completion of all the activities.  
 
4. 
The Project was restructured in June 2009, including: (i) revisions to the project 
development objectives; (ii) introduction of new activities and improved alignment of 
planned activities with the national sector strategy; (iii) revisions to outcome and output 
indicators and targets; (iv) a reallocation of Credit proceeds; and (v) a two-year extension 
of the project’s closing date from October 31, 2009 to October 31, 2011. As a result of 
the first project restructuring, the project became more realistic, better harmonized with 
Government objectives and also helped implementation. Although later various external 
factors influenced negatively the implementation, overall the project is now becoming 
marginally satisfactory in the Bank and has also improved satisfaction on with the 
Government. However, the initial delays may only be partially overcome and new 
Government strategic priorities require reallocation of resources. 
 
5. 
The proposed restructuring does not affect the Project Development Objectives, 
the results framework, the project components and activities or implementation 
arrangements. The bulk of the funds are taken off from the Annual Programs of Work 
(APOW) under the Pilot Programmatic Scheme and, to a smaller extent from services and 
goods complementing the APOWs. The APOWs are being pursued by the Districts this 
year according to the original project operational design. The APOWs are targeting 
improvements in education performance at district level. The indicators measuring 
improvements at district level were adjusted during the first project restructuring (as 
discussed above) to make the project objective more focused and realistic. The proposed 
cancellation is a reflection of earlier delays that affected negatively some of the outcomes 
but did not warrant any change because of the first restructuring.  
 
6. 
The projects three components are (i) Sector Capacity Building (SCB), (ii) Pilot 
Programmatic Scheme (PPS), and (iii) Teaching and Learning Innovation Fund (TALIF).    
The objective of the SCB component is to (i) improve the capacities of DEO offices in 
the 61 (used to be 53) deprived districts in delivering basic education.  Following the 
restructuring after mid-term, a second objective in post basic education was added to; (ii) 
improve the capacities of selected Technical Training Institutes.  This was under the new 
Skills Development Fund sub component 4-A to be implemented by the Council for 
Technical Vocational Education and Training (COTVET).  The objective of the PPS 
component is to support, on a pilot basis, the programmatic approach that will be applied 
to the whole sector. This programmatic approach aims at: (i) improving Gross Admission 
rate to primary in deprived districts, (ii) improving Gross Enrollment rate at JHS 1 in 
deprived districts, (iii) improving Gender parity index at JHS level, (iv) increasing the 
number of schools in the Northern Regions; and (v) Ensuring that capitation pilot grant is 
piloted in deprived districts.  The objective of the TALIF component is to raise the 
quality of teaching and learning performance; sharpen the relevance, competences and 
skill content of tertiary education, improve the efficiency by which institutions operate 
their academic programs, and open up greater access to tertiary level academic programs.

7. 
Achievement on development objectives for the three components has varied over 
time between unsatisfactory to moderately satisfactory.  The SCB component has 
contributed to the improvement in the capacities of eleven (11) district education offices 
through the refurbishment of these offices.  It has also built some capacity on 
international assessments and in data collection and management at district level, namely 
in the Trends in Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and in the Education 
Management Information System (EMIS).   
 
8. 
For the PPS component, the project has contributed to the overall improvement in 
the outcome indicators.  From the available data primary and junior secondary Gross 
Enrollment Rates (GERs) have improved significantly between 2004 and 2011, from 
76% to 95% for primary level and from 72% to 87% for junior high level.  Gender parity 
at primary and junior high levels improved from 0.92 to 0.96 for primary level and 0.86 
to 0.92 for junior high level over the same period.  Primary completion also improved 
appreciably over the period from 53% in 2004 to 87% in 2011.  Although data for 
deprived districts is available for 2011, it was more difficult to obtain baseline and 
midterm data.  The education team would have to work with the EdSeP implementation 
team to ensure that this data is available to support likely improvements in access in the 
61 deprived districts.   
 
9. 
Beneficiaries of the TALIF component indicate that there have been 
improvements in the quality of teaching and learning.  For e.g. the Faculty of Agriculture 
in the University of Ghana refurbished it's laboratory under the TALIF component and as 
a
result, research and teaching has been greatly facilitated and improved.  There is also 
evidence that access to the academic programs offered at the post graduate level has 
improved.  From two (2) masters’ level students in the relevant course per year, the 
faculty now admits six (6) students a year, tripling access to post graduate programs in 
the last three (3) years.  Other faculties and students now take advantage of the facilities 
available at the Faculty of Agriculture for their research as well as teaching and learning.  
However, more work needs to be done to capture the overall improvements in quality, 
access, relevance, competencies, skills and efficiencies experienced in academic 
programs as a result of sub projects funded through the TALIF component.  At least 412 
sub-projects in 26 tertiary institutions have been funded under the TALIF component, 92 
percent of which have been completed. 
 
10. 
To date, the project has disbursed 72.47 percent of project proceeds.  The project 
has been active since March 9, 2004 and has had one extension.  With only eight months 
to project closing on October 31, 2011, there remains an undisbursed amount of 22.61m 
(twenty two million, six hundred and ten thousand United States dollars).  Should the 
cancellation and recommitment of US$7m (seven million United States dollars) be 
approved, the project implementation team has assured the Bank team of full 
disbursement of the remaining US$16.5m (sixteen million, five hundred thousand United 
States dollars).  To this end, the project implementation team has submitted work and 
procurement plans covering the remaining funds under the three components which have 
been approved by the Bank. 
 
11. 
To facilitate smooth and speedy disbursement of the remaining amount and 
implementation of agreed project activities, the education team has instituted monthly 
Page  6
6
implementation support meetings to help resolve any implementation issues that may 
arise.  The new Minister for Education who took office in January 2011 has also made 
the monitoring of disbursements on externally funded education projects a priority for 
speeding up implementation and achieving agreed education sector objectives.  
 
12. 
The proposed cancellation and reallocation of US$7m (seven million United 
States dollars) from the credit an amount will be recommitted to the general IDA pool for 
Ghana towards supporting quick disbursing projects.  This is necessary to provide 
expedited disbursements and funding for other strategic Government priorities in 
education and other sectors. 
13. 
The cancellation is proposed from the PPS Component of the EdSeP because this 
is the component that has delayed the most in implementation and therefore the most 
unlikely to fully utilize allocated funds. The PPS Component disbursed US$14.7 million 
out of US$34 million or 43% of the total funds allocated towards this component. Even 
though recently, the implementation of the component improved, total disbursement of 
the US$19.3 million is not feasible. In the meantime, there are some good outcomes as a 
result of the operation and these outcomes will not be negatively influenced by the 
reallocation because they are the results of sector-wide programmatic changes part of 
which were the capitation grant and earlier PPS allocations plus improved district 
capacities. Moreover, PPS will likely sustain its impact on enrollment and completion in 
the deprived districts as similar development programs financed by the Government and 
by other Development Partners.  
 
14. 
The proposed increase of the withdrawal limit is necessitated by the 
improvements of implementation especially for PPS. The more effective implementation 
of the Annual Programs of Work (APOW) by the districts have led to an increased 
demand for funds at short intervals rendering the current withdrawal limit insufficient to 
meet requests of payments. Also, the construction of classrooms under the Northern 
Flood Program has also come to a phase when large payments are needed to contractors. 
The increase of th
e
withdrawal limit will, therefore, improve the project’s 
implementation and its likelihood of achieving the expected outcomes.
