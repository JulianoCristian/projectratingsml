The\n            changes include: (i) revisions to the project development\n            objectives; (ii) introduction of new activities and improved\n            alignment of planned activities with the national sector\n            strategy; (iii) revisions to outcome and output indicators\n            and targets; (iv) a reallocation of credit proceeds; and (v)\n            a two-year extension of the project's closing date from\n            October 31, 2009 to October 31, 2011. Since appraisal, Ghana\n            has enjoyed fast economic growth, and improvements in\n            accessing basic educational services. As a result, demand\n            for post-basic education has increased and so has the need\n            to improve links between the world of work and the world of\n            education. The new National Education Reform Program (NERP)\n            attempts to tackle these challenges in the context of the\n            decentralization process of public services taking place in\n            the broader framework of public administration. Although\n            this process has not progressed as fast as it had been\n            expected at project appraisal, some new Government\n            priorities have emerged in the process, including the need\n            to strengthen further the capacity at the district levels.\n            This is warranted in view of the importance of their role in\n            achieving more equitable access and also efficiencies in education."}, "docdt": "2009-05-12T00:00:00Z"}
