2.     The objectives of the project are to: (a) improve equitable access to and completion of basic education in
deprived districts; and (b) improve quality of teaching and learning, management efficiency and relevance of
post-basic education.     The project components are: (a) Sector Capacity Building and Management; (b) Pilot
Programmatic Scheme (PPS); and (c) Teaching and Learning Innovation Fund (TALIF) to provide development and
innovation to the tertiary education sector. Both the project development objective and implementation progress
are currently rated moderately satisfactory. The project is in its final month of implementation and is 95
percent disbursed. After lags in implementation and disbursement in 2009, both have gotten back on track in
2010 and all activities under the project are expected to be fully completed by project closing. The Sector
Capacity Building component has supported activities to build the management capacity of deprived districts
including providing training and equipment and supporting capacity in the use of management systems such as
the Education Management Information System (EMIS). Currently, all 67 deprived districts are using the
EMIS to generate annual reports. The Pilot Programmatic Scheme component funds the annual work programs
of 67 deprived districts. Access to basic education has improved over the project implementation period.
Primary Gross Enrollment Rate has increased from 76 percent in 2003 to 95 percent in 2011 and gender parity
index is currently 0.94, up from 0.92 in 2003. In deprived districts, Gross Admission into primary one has
increased over the same period from 82 percent to 106 percent. The Teaching and Learning Innovative Fund
which is a competitive fund supporting proposals from public and private tertiary institutions has supported 412
sub-projects. Over 80 percent of the sub-projects have been completed. An evaluation of all 412 sub-projects is
currently underway to assess their contribution to improved teaching, management efficiency and learning
outcomes at the tertiary education level.

3.    The proposed reallocation is necessary to cover the outstanding remaining payments for Annual
Programs of Work under the Category 3 Annual Programs-GES (Pilot Programmatic Scheme) and for the
Category 2-A Consulting Services MOE (Sector Capacity Building).
