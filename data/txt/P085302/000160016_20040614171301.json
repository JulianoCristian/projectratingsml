Component 1,Customs\n            Reform, enhances efficiency and transparency of customs by\n            improving service-delivery for users and strengthening\n            collection, inspection and compliance. Component 2,\n            Procurement Reform, expands access and enhances\n            transparency, efficiency and competitiveness in procurement.\n            Component 3, Professional Civil Service Management, enhances\n            efficiency and transparency in the management of the civil\n            service by developing the capacity of central government to\n            monitor and manage the number, skills, remuneration and\n            professionalism of its employees. Component 4, Efficiency\n            and Accountability in Selected Public Agencies, improves\n            efficiency and simplifies service provision and management\n            in selected agencies.
