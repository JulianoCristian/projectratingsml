          (rubber and oil palm) in East and West Kalimantan and South\n            Sulawesi provinces with the public sector estates PTP VI,\n            PTP XII and PNP XXVIII as implementing agents; in addition\n            about 9,000 ha would be cleared for smallholder houses,\n            gardens, and food crops. The project would immediately\n            benefit some 19,000 smallholder families and provide\n            full-time employment for another 4,000 families working for\n            the estates. It would also support strengthening of\n            Directorate General of Estates and other agencies associated\n            with tree crops development, marketing programs for\n            smallholders, consultancy services for the estates and\n            in-service training for their staff, and provide funds for\n            start-up activities of future NES projects."}, "docdt": "1983-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
