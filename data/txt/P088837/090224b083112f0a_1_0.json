better services in Turkey.\n            From 2002 to 2006, Turkey undertook wide -ranging financial,\n            economic, and public sector reforms. As a result, growth\n            accelerated and public finances improved, with public debt\n            in 2006 at 48 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), down\n            from 78 percent. Poverty rates declined sharply. Yet,\n            sustained progress was threatened by challenges in reforming\n            public finances, and outdated regulations hindered\n            investments. Unemployment remained high, and the labor\n            market was largely unskilled. The sharp  deterioration in\n            the global economy in 2008 added to these challenges. The\n            first Restoring Equitable Growth and Employment Development\n            Policy Loan (REGE DPL 1) in 2010 streamlined World Bank\n            support to Turkey at a critical time when unemployment was\n            16 percent and GDP had contracted by 4.7 percent. The second\n            Restoring Equitable Growth and Employment Development Policy\n            Loan (REGE DPL 2) supports ongoing reforms of public\n            finances, commercial law, and civil procedures. Turkey has\n            reached almost universal health insurance coverage, enrolled\n            more children in pre-school, and dramatically increased\n            vocational training. These ongoing reforms are expected to\n            reduce poverty and inequality in Turkey over the long run."}, "docdt": "2012-02-08T06:43:04Z"}
