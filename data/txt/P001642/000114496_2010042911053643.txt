      Re:   Credit Number 2069-MAI - Amendment
            (Infrastructure Project)
Dear Sir:
      We refer to the Development Credit Agreement for the above -
referenced Credit dated December 14, 1989, between the Republic of
Malawi (the Borrower) and the International Development Association
(the Association).
      We also refer to the letter of Mr. D.Y.C. Wirima, for
Secretary to the Treasury, dated May 4, 1990, proposing an amendment
to the Development Credit Agreement to include part of the DRIMP
works in Nkhotakota and Zomba districts under the above-referenced
Project.
      Having reviewed and accepted your proposal, we propose that
Part B.5. of Schedule 2 to the Development Credit Agreement be
deleted and replaced by the following:
      "5.  Extension of DRIMP to Mwanza, Blantyre, Chiradzulu,
      Nkhotakota and Zomba; improvement of about 500 km of extra
      roads in other districts; execution of spot improvements on
      previously developed DRIMP roads; and maintenance support."
      Please confirm your agreement to the proposed amendment by
signing, dating and returning the enclosed copy of the letter to us,
at which time the proposed amendment shall constitute a binding
agreement between the Borrower and the Association.
Very truly yours,
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
