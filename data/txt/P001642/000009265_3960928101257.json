(b) restore or improve the\n            physical condition of selected roads, thus facilitating the\n            movement of traffic and lowering transport costs; (c) expand\n            the system of district roads thus providing improved access\n            for many rural people; (d) expand urban and rural water\n            supplies; and (e) rehabilitate priority public buildings.\n            The project will cover MOW's activities for management\n            improvement and training as well as maintenance,\n            rehabilitation and construction works in the roads, water\n            supply and public buildings subsectors over a four year\n            period from fiscal year 1989/90 to 1992/93."}, "docdt": "1989-10-16T00:00:00Z"}
