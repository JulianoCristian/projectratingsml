deepening\n            reforms in the telecommunications, and electricity sectors,\n            by strengthening regulatory institutions, and improving\n            environmental management of the sectors' activities,\n            fostering competition, and increasing private participation,\n            promoting efficient use of energy, and providing new\n            information and communication technologies (IT) to support\n            services to micro, and small businesses. The components\n            will: 1) strengthen the legal and regulatory frameworks in\n            telecommunications, and electricity. Public consultations,\n            and dissemination of regulatory decisions will be undertaken\n            to supervise, and strengthen the Telecommunications Agency\n            (SUPTEL), while software programs, and equipment will be\n            financed, and a telecommunications tariff rebalancing plan\n            prepared. Electricity regulations of the National Council of\n            Electricity will be completed, including strengthening its\n            institutional capacity, and monitoring criteria, and that of\n            other sector institutions. Selected energy, and tariff\n            studies will support these activities; 2) extend services to\n            low income groups, and small businesses in peri-urban areas,\n            by developing pilot projects, an electrification strategy\n            (both grid-extension and off-grid), revising IT regulations,\n            and, developing IT access in marginal urban, and rural\n            areas; 3) design, and implement a program to promote the\n            use, and conservation of electricity, to include tariff\n            incentives, standards for efficient electrical appliances,\n            public information, and, market assessment, and training to\n            local energy service companies; and, 4) finance project\n            management, consultation, and communications activities to\n            provide support to implementing agencies, and the private sector."}, "docdt": "2001-10-23T00:00:00Z"}
