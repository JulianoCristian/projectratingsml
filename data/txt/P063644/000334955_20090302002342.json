(PROMEC's) in Ecuador were as follows: overall outcome\n            of the project was rated moderately satisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, and the performance of the\n            Bank and the Borrower were rated as moderately satisfactory.\n            Lessons learned from the project are: 1) the project\n            included a wide range of components that spanned six\n            different implementing agencies. One could argue that this\n            breadth proved unwieldy and made the job of the project unit\n            extremely difficult. It also resulted in delays because of\n            the large number of coordination agreements required. Each\n            change of government necessitated rebuilding relationships\n            and convincing new leadership of the Project's\n            validity. However, on the other hand, the involvement of a\n            large number of implementing agencies that felt that the\n            Project activities were useful meant that the Project had\n            solid and continuous support in the Government; and 2)\n            communication and community participation approach highly\n            beneficial. PROMEC's communication and participation\n            activities were considered by participants to be innovative,\n            important and highly beneficial. The benefits were multiple:\n            (a) helping create awareness of Project activities; (b)\n            building consensus on implementation approaches; (c)\n            building capacity of communities and individuals to\n            participate in design and implementation; and, perhaps most\n            importantly, (d) increasing accountability and transparency\n            of the Project's activities and management to\n            stakeholders. All of these factors contributed to the\n            generally positive perception of the Project."}, "docdt": "2008-12-16T00:00:00Z"}
