F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The Project will support the Government's efforts to deepen reforms in the
telecommunications and electricity sectors, by strengthening regulatory institutions and
improving environmental management of the sectors' activities, fostering competition and
increasing private participation, promoting efficient use of energy, extending coverage in
underserved areas and providing modern information and communication technologies
(ICT)-supported services to micro and small businesses (MSBs), and enhancing
communication and consultation in the sectors. (Note that the PDO in the Loan
Agreement has some differences.)

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The PDO was not revised nor were the key indicators. However, several modifications
were made to the core final outcome indicators in the legal agreement in December,
2006, at the request of the Borrower.       None of these changes affected the Project


                                             iv

Development Objective or outcomes. Changes were made to the indicators for several
reasons. First, the Baseline year was updated from 2000 to 2002 the baseline data and
targets revised accordingly. Second, because of delays in implementation, the targets for
a few of original core indicators were reduced. Third, an alternative indicator of the
intended outcome was proposed by the implementing agency and accepted as technically
valid. The changes made in 2006 are summarized in Section 1.4 below.

Global Environment Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The GEF-funded components would promote private financing and management of
projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, by removing barriers to the use of: (i)
renewable energy technologies (RET) to extend electricity supply in rural areas; and (ii)
energy efficiency measures.

Revised Global Environment Objectives (as approved by original approving authority
The GEO was not revised. However, a modification was made to the key indicator in
December, 2006, at the request of the Borrower. The end year target for carbon dioxide
emission reduction was reduced from 80,000 to 17,000 tons, based on mainly on results
expected from the energy audit component. It should be noted that the Project exceeded
the original target before closing due to the highly successful activities to promote

F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

The Project will support the Government's efforts to deepen reforms in the telecommunications and
electricity sectors, by strengthening regulatory institutions and improving environmental management of
the sectors' activities, fostering competition and increasing private participation, promoting efficient use
of energy, extending coverage in underserved areas and providing modern information and
communication technologies (ICT)-supported services to micro and small businesses (MSBs), and
enhancing communication and consultation in the sectors.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

The PDO was not revised nor were the key indicators. However, several modifications were
made to the core final outcome indicators in the legal agreement in December, 2006, at the

request of the Borrower. None of these changes affected the Project Development Objective or
outcomes. Changes were made to the indicators for several reasons. First, the Baseline year was
updated from 2000 to 2002 the baseline data and targets revised accordingly. Second, because of
delays in implementation, the targets for a few of original core indicators were reduced. Third,
an alternative indicator of the intended outcome was proposed by the implementing agency and
accepted as technically valid. The changes made in 2006 are summarized in Section 1.4.

Global Environment Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

The GEF-funded components would promote private financing and management of projects to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions, by removing barriers to the use of: (i) renewable energy
technologies (RET) to extend electricity supply in rural areas; and (ii) energy efficiency
measures.

Revised Global Environment Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

The GEO was not revised. However, a modification was made to the key indicator in December,
2006, at the request of the Borrower. The end year target for carbon dioxide emission reduction
was reduced from 80,000 to 17,000 tons, based on mainly on results expected from the energy
audit component. It should be noted that the Project exceeded the original target before closing
due to the highly successful activities to promote compact fluorescent (CFL) bulbs.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal


a. Country Political and Economic Background. Political change characterized Ecuador
during preparation and implementation of the PROMEC Project. During this period (2000-2008),
there were five Presidents.1 The Ecuadorian economy was weak throughout the 1990s, with
falling GDP per capita and increasing public debt. This was exacerbated by external shocks and
natural disasters in the late 1990s, finally resulting in Ecuador's default on payment of external
debt in September 1999. That year, real GDP fell by over 7 percent while unemployment
increased to over 16 percent and annual inflation to 60 percent. The economic crisis had a
profound impact on the poor. The national poverty rate increased from 40 to 45 percent between
1990 and 2001, and the number of poor increased from 3.5 million to 5.2 million.

Under President Noboa, Congress approved laws implementing dollarization and Ecuador
secured a restructuring of its foreign debt. After dollarization, the performance of the Ecuadorian
economy strengthened. Real GDP growth averaged 4.7 percent per year in 2000-2006, compared
to 1.7 percent annually in the 1990s. Annual economic growth increased to a high of 8 percent
in 2004, then fell to 2.6 percent in 2007 and 2.5 percent in 2008.

In January 2007, President Correa took office after winning the November 2006 election. Under
President Correa, a Constituent Assembly prepared a new Constitution that was approved in a
referendum in late September 2008. High oil prices and improvements in tax collection have
permitted significant increases in Government spending, including major commitments to
investments in electricity and telecommunications infrastructure.2

b. Background of the Telecommunications and Electricity Sectors. Coverage and quality of
telecommunications services in Ecuador lagged far behind regional averages, with 9.1 main
telephone lines per 100 inhabitants in 1999 (vs. 13.2 main telephone lines per 100 inhabitants
for LAC) and 82 faults per 100 main telephone lines per year (vs. 20 faults per line in Bolivia
and five in Mexico). National coverage of electricity was relatively high (80 percent of total
population). However, in both sectors, rural coverage was low (rural areas had only 1.6 main
telephone lines per 100 inhabitants and 45 percent of the rural population had no access to
electricity in 1999), which accentuated the urban-rural poverty gap.

Ecuador initiated electricity and telecommunications reforms in the early 1990s, with the
adoption of new sector legislation and regulations, the creation of regulatory and electricity
wholesale market institutions, and the break-up of the national monopolies. The Bank provided
support under the Public Enterprise Reform Technical Assistance Loan (PERTAL), which
assisted the Government to prepare laws and create institutions with the aim of reforming both
sectors.    However, the initial effort to sell the regional telecommunications companies,

ANDINATEL and PACIFICTEL, failed. Privatization of these companies and electricity
distribution companies has never taken place.

The PROMEC PAD was prepared after the closing of the PERTAL Project. The political
environment during preparation and implementation was changing--support for reform,
especially for privatization, was shrinking. For this reason, while the PAD maintains the
objective and language of supporting the Government's reform program, the Project components
and results framework were focused on pragmatic and achievable objectives--strengthening
certain regulatory agencies and supporting efforts to increase the provision of rural services and
energy efficiency.

According to the PAD, a number of issues in each sector needed to be addressed in order to
improve efficiency and extend service coverage. In telecommunications, issues included: an
incomplete legal and regulatory framework; insufficient institutional capacity and cumbersome
regulatory setup; poor performance and financial weaknesses of the operators; and shortfalls of
the previous privatization effort. In electricity, key issues were: gaps in the regulatory
framework; weak institutional capacity; inadequate tariffs; sub-optimal investment in the sector;
lack of access to electricity in rural areas; low level of implementation and monitoring of
environmental guidelines; and inefficient use of energy.

Many of the structural and institutional issues identified during PROMEC preparation persisted
throughout implementation. Constant political change undermined the ability of governments to
resolve fundamental issues in both sectors.

c. Rationale for Bank Assistance. The 2000-02 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) focused
Bank assistance on three objectives: (i) increasing social services and safety nets for the poor; (ii)
restoring macro-financial stability and economic growth (through, inter alia, expanding the role
of the private sector); and (iii) promoting sustainable development and productivity by the poor
(including improved environmental management and rural development). The PROMEC project
contributed to objectives (ii) and (iii).

To contribute to the restoration of macro-financial stability and economic growth, the Project
supported strengthening regulatory institutions, promoting energy efficiency and helped expand
the provision of telecommunications, electricity, internet and business services in rural areas. To
promote sustainable development and productivity of the poor, the Project supported the use of
renewable energy for rural electrification and energy efficiency programs. The Project also
supported the Government's action plan to improve the environmental management of activities
in the electricity sector.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The Project Development Objective was to support the Government's efforts to deepen reforms in the
telecommunications and electricity sectors, by strengthening regulatory institutions and improving
environmental management of the sectors' activities, fostering competition and increasing private
participation, promoting efficient use of energy, extending coverage in underserved areas and providing




                                                    2

modern information and communication technologies (ICT)-supported services to micro and small
businesses, and enhancing communication and consultation in the sectors.3




Key indicators were defined in Section A of the PAD as follows (see also core numerical
indicators defined in Annex 1 of the PAD and legal agreement):4

 a. Regulatory and institutional development in the telecommunications and electricity
sectors5
·   Improved effectiveness of SUPTEL and the CONELEC to regulate the sectors, and
    undertake timely public consultations and dissemination of regulatory decisions.
·   Completed environmental regulations and procedures in the electricity sector and
    strengthened capacity of CONELEC and other institutions including sector operators, to
    promote a better environmental management of sector activities.
·   Establishment of a liberalized wholesale electricity market as shown by a greater number of
    private operators in the interconnected system, a larger volume of transactions and a more
    efficient administration of the wholesale market by CENACE.
·   Increased number of private operators providing rural telecommunications decentralized
    rural electrification, energy efficiency services and ICT-based services to micro and small
    businesses.

b. Extension of rural electricity and telecommunications services
·   Adoption of a sustainable strategy to extend electricity services, including efficient
    subsidization, financing and delivery mechanisms, and community participation.
·   Successful completion of replicable pilot projects for rural telecommunications and
    electricity.

c. Expanded internet access and business services to micro and small businesses (MSB)
·   Successful completion of a replicable pilot project for ICT-supported services to MSBs in
    urban and peri-urban areas, showing improvement in market outreach, competitiveness and
    growth.

d. Increased end-use energy efficiency
·   Design and launching of a program to enhance efficiency in the use of energy.


3There are minor differences with the text of the PDO in the Legal Agreement, which i) includes renewable energy
in the "promoting energy efficiency" clause; and ii) does not include the final clause on "enhancing communication
and consultation in the sectors". This ICR uses the PDO of the PAD as it is more consistent with the results
framework in Annex 1.

4 In Annex 1 of the PAD, an additional core indicator was included for energy efficiency: GWh BBLF. This
indicator was not in the legal agreement, nor tracked in the ISRs. Hence, it is omitted from this ICR's analysis.

5 The telecommunications regulatory institutions are: (a) CONATEL, in charge of policy setting, awarding
concessions, and major decisions; (b) SENATEL, the executive arm of CONATEL, that includes FODETEL, the
universal service fund; and (c) SUPTEL, in charge of regulating and controlling operators.              In electricity,
CONELEC is the single regulatory agency that manages FERUM, the Rural Electrification Fund.



                                                           3

·   Successful implementation of demonstration projects with good replicability prospects.

e. Implementation of effective public consultations and information mechanisms
·   Systematic consultation and dissemination of regulatory and privatization decisions.
·   Growing public consensus in support of the Government's sector reform and privatization
    program.

1.3 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)


The GEF-funded components would promote private financing and management of projects to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions, by removing barriers to the use of: (i) renewable energy
technologies to extend electricity supply in rural areas; and (ii) energy efficiency measures. Key
indicators were:
·   Actual tons of CO2 reduced through the energy efficiency and renewable energy-based rural
    electrification programs.
·   Estimated tons of CO2 expected to be reduced through the implementation of subsequent
    energy efficiency projects and through use of renewable energy instead of fossil fuel-based
    rural electrification.
·   Definition and adoption of a strategy, regulations and policies for the sustained development,
    with private participation, of (i) decentralized rural electrification, and (ii) enhanced energy
    efficiency.

1.4 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification


The PDO was not revised nor were the key indicators. However, modifications were made to the
core numerical indicators in the legal agreement in December 2006, for several reasons. First,
the Baseline year was updated from 2000 to 2002 and some targets revised accordingly. Second,
several of the original targets were reduced. Third, in one case, an alternative indicator of the
intended outcome was adopted. The changes are summarized below.
 ·  SUPTEL: number of subscribers per employee, the baseline was updated to 2002, and the
    targets revised upward accordingly.
 ·  CONELEC: timeliness of response, the level of targets was increased to be consistent with
    CONELEC's Strategic Plan.
 ·  CENACE: efficiency of transaction processing: indicator changed from average number of
    hours to the percentage of timely responses to requests for information of reconciliation and
    billing of accounts, on a monthly basis.
 ·  Extension of Rural Services: the final target for number of households served with
    electricity was reduced from 2220 to 2000; and the final number of users of the business
    services pilot was reduced from 30,000 to 8,000, based on estimates of the business plan
    developed in implementation.
 ·  Increasing End-use Efficiency: the final target for savings was reduced from 38 to 15
    percent.

1.5 Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification




                                                  4

The GEO was not revised. However, a modification was made to the key GEF indicator in
December 2006. The target for carbon emissions reduction at the end of the Project was reduced
from 80,000 to 17,000 tons, based mainly on expected results of the energy audits. It should be
noted that the Project exceeded the original target before closing, due to the successful CFL
promotion activity.

1.6 Main Beneficiaries, original and revised

As intended, consumers and investors benefited from strengthened regulatory capacity in the
electricity and telecommunication sectors. Citizens at large also benefited from the improved
environmental management of resources. Residents of rural areas obtained increased access to
modern telecommunications and electricity services, improving quality of life and offering
additional opportunities for economic activity. Solar home systems were installed in the
indigenous kishwa communities of Centro Sarayacu and Shiwacocha Sarayacu and Ponce Loma
and Capirona in the Arajuno region, as well as in rural areas of Esmeraldas and Napo Sur. Micro
and small businesses benefited from increased access to ICT services in Cuenca, Loja and
Galapagos. At end September 2008, 1,315 clients had benefited from training offered in IT tools,
use of the internet and preparation of business plans. Clients were artisans, owners of micro
businesses, rural producers or students. The energy efficiency program performed energy audits
in public buildings, hotels, hospitals and industries, helping identify opportunities for savings.
However, because of the cancellation of the telecommunications pilot contract, rural households
did not benefit from telecenter services.



1.7 Original Components (as approved)


Component A. Strengthening of Legal, Regulatory and Institutional Frameworks in the
Power and Communications Sectors (IBRD US$ 10.3 million, corresponding to 43 percent of
the loan).

This component aimed to improve supervisory, regulatory and technical capacity of the
electricity and telecommunication regulatory agencies. A key assumption was that reinforcing
these entities was an essential condition for sustainable improvement of infrastructure services
and access in the urban and rural areas. It comprised the following sub-components.
    A1. Strengthening of SUPTEL's supervisory and enforcement capacity
    A2. Strengthening of CONELEC's regulatory capacity
    A3. Improvement of CONELEC's environmental management of the Borrower's power
    sector
    A4. Improvement of CENACE's electricity wholesale market administration

Component B. Extension of Power, Communications and Business Services to Rural and
Peri-urban Areas Sectors (IBRD US$ 7.4 million, corresponding to 32 percent of the loan and
GEF US$1.6, corresponding to 57 percent of the GEF grant.).

This component aimed to increase access to telecommunications, electricity and ICT-based
business services to low income groups in rural and peri-urban areas. The implementation of


                                                5

demonstration projects was seen as a way to test different models and ensure replicability of the
models proposed. The component comprised the following sub-components.
    B1. Rural Telecommunications Pilot Subprojects
    B2. Development and implementation of the Ministry of Energy and Mines' (MEM) rural
    electrification program
    B3. Carrying out of Rural Electrification Pilot Subprojects
    B4. Development and implementation of Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Fisheries'
    (MICIP) program to bring information and communications development services to micro
    and small businesses in rural and peri-urban areas

Component C. Enhancement of Electricity End-use Efficiency (IBRD US$ 0.5 million,
corresponding to 2 percent of the loan and GEF US$1.2, corresponding to 43 percent of the GEF
grant.).

This component aimed to establish the technical and financial mechanisms needed to promote
the efficient use of electricity at the individual and industry levels, remove barriers to efficiency
enhancement and create related incentives. It comprised the following sub-components.
    C1. Identifying barriers to efficiency enhancement, through surveys on electricity demand
    and efficiency enhancement options;
    C2. Determining of strategies and policies to remove such barriers
    C3. Carrying out Electricity Efficiency Enhancement Pilot Subprojects

Component D. Project Communications, Coordination and Management (IBRD US$ 4.9
million, corresponding to 21 percent of the loan).

This component aimed to support (i) coordination and monitoring of the project through the
financing of the SENPLADES/CONAM Project Coordination Unit.; and (ii) provide assistance
to CONAM in carrying out a communication process with stakeholders (including civil society).
Key assumptions was that sustainability of project results would only be achieved through
ownership by the community and sector stakeholders.              It comprised the following sub-
components.
    D1. Management and monitoring of the Project by CONAM
    D2. Coordination of implementation of the Project by the Implementing Agencies
    D3. Carrying out of communications and consultation campaigns with stakeholders and civil
    society organizations

1.8 Revised Components

Components were not revised during execution.

1.9 Other Significant Changes

a. Implementation Arrangements. The implementing agency, CONAM, was merged with the
National Secretariat of Planning (SENPLADES) in early 2007. SENPLADES maintained the
Project Coordinating Unit and staff and respected all aspects of the legal agreement. This
facilitated a smooth transition, and implementation of the Project was not affected. The current
Government made other changes in 2007: the Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy


                                                   6

(MER) was created and took over the energy efficiency and rural electrification activities from
the former Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM); and the Ministry of Industry and
Competitiveness (MIC) was created and took over the ICT services for micro and small
businesses (Micronet) from the former Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Fisheries (MICIP).

b. Partial Cancellation of IBRD Funds and Extensions of Closing Date. In September, 2006,
at the request of the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF), the Bank approved the
cancellation of US$2 million of the Bank loan (from contingencies) and an extension of 6
months, to December 31, 2006. An additional 12 month extension to December 31, 2007 was
approved in September 2006. A third extension until June 30, 2008 was approved in December
2007. The extensions totaled two years, making the project life six years rather than the four
envisaged at preparation.

c. Cancellation of the Contract for Rural Telecommunications Pilot (Telecenters). This pilot
involved a 10-year build-own-operate-and-transfer (BOOT) contract with a private company for
1,120 rural telecenters offering telephone, internet and computer services. The contract was
signed in September 2006 with a termination date of August 2007. It was cancelled by
CONATEL in June 2008, after the Project had paid US$1 million of the US$4.15 million
committed and the telecommunications operator reported installation of half of the telecenters.
CONATEL's resolution authorizing the cancellation indicated that the operator failed to meet the
technical specifications and comply with the deadlines for installation of the telecenters. The
operator appealed the decision but CONATEL denied the appeal. The project team is not aware
of any current attempts by the parties to resolve the disputes arising under the contract.

d. Actual versus Planned Use of Funds. Annex 1 compares the original cost estimates by
component with actual costs, as of November 2008, although it should be noted that the original
cost estimates include a contingency of 12.7 percent. After correcting for this difference, the total
cost estimates are similar for most components. However, the Component of Extension of Rural
Services had lower than expected expenditures because US$3.15 million of the US$4.15 million
of the IBRD loan that was committed to the telecenter pilot was not disbursed due to the
cancellation of the contract. Also, the energy efficiency activities were completed at less than
expected cost because of the use of less costly local consultants, and a focus on promotion of use
of efficient compact fluorescent bulbs.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The PROMEC Project was prepared following completion of the Public Enterprise Reform
Technical Assistance (PERTAL) Project, which closed in December 1999, with a satisfactory
rating. However, as noted in Section 1.1, political support for reform was waning at the time of
PROMEC preparation, resulting in a pragmatic design focused on regulatory strengthening,
extension of rural services, and energy efficiency.

a. Consistency with CAS. As noted in Section 1.1, the Project was well aligned with the CAS
at preparation.



                                                 7

b. Soundness of the Background Analysis. The Project built on studies completed under a
Project Preparation Facility (PPF) that supported technical studies to prepare the institutional
strengthening and pilot project activities (see Annex 2 for details).

c. Complex Design. The project design supported carefully targeted interventions, as opposed to
sweeping sector reforms and privatization, but was complex as it included many subcomponents
and indicators of outcomes. Implementation required a coordinating agency (CONAM, later
SENPLADES), and six implementing agencies. Coordination was challenging. A contributing
factor to delays was changing leadership in the different agencies resulting from changes in
government. The three rural service pilots (telecenters, electricity and ICT business services
(Micronet)) contributed most to implementation difficulties and delays. While cutting
subcomponents and eliminating implementing agencies could have simplified the Project and
made it easier to manage, narrowing the scope could have reduced opportunities for
Bank/Government partnerships in the sector and affected political support for the Project. It is
notable that Government support for PROMEC remained strong throughout changing
governments,     in  contrast   to   other   Bank   Projects,   mainly due      to  support    from
SENPLADES/CONAM and the implementing agencies.

d. Development Objective and Some Indicators Should Have Been Reformulated. There
were two types of disconnects between the development objective/indicators and the activities to
be supported by the Project. First, the introductory phrase "The Project would support the
Government's efforts to deepen reform..." and the mention of sector reform in some indicators
should have been reformulated given the nature of the sub-objectives and activities that were
aimed not at reform but improving specific aspects of sector performance. Second, several
objectives mentioned increased access to telecommunications and electricity service, while
activities to be supported were pilot projects whose main rationale should have been more
modestly defined to reflect an objective of increasing knowledge about what works and what
does not.

e. Other problems. The background studies for the economic and financial analysis are not in
the Project files, making it difficult to compare the efficiency of actual results with the planned
results. Also, there are minor inconsistencies between the PAD and the Loan Agreement in
terms of the PDO, project description, and indicators, the most significant of which is the
inclusion of "communication and participation in the sectors" as part of the development
objective in the PAD, while it is not included in the loan agreement.

2.2 Implementation

There were no major project changes or restructurings that affected objectives or outcomes.
Issues encountered were: (a) delays in start-up; (b) cancellation of the contract for the
telecommunications pilot (telecenters); (c) difficulties in developing a sustainable model for
provision of ICT services to micro and small business (Micronet); (d) difficulties in
implementation of the rural electrification pilots; and (e) change in implementation strategy of
energy efficiency activities.




                                                 8

a. Delays in Startup. The Project became effective 11 months after Board approval, in
September 2002. Due to slow initial execution, the implementation performance rating was
downgraded to "unsatisfactory" in May 2004. After the mid-term review, progress of each
implementing agency was evaluated against the agreed procurement schedule and coordination
between CONAM, the implementing agencies and the Bank was intensified. By April 2005,
there was an improvement in implementation and loan disbursements, and the project status was
upgraded to "moderately satisfactory". However, the late start-up compressed time available to
complete the rural service pilot activities.        Delays and problems in implementation were
particularly acute in the rural telecommunications pilot (telecenters), where the implementation
agreement between CONAM and CONATEL was not signed until September and it then took
two years to reach agreement on the bidding documents for the build-own-operate and transfer
(BOOT) contract. As noted above, the Project ultimately was extended for 24 months, mainly to
permit completion of the rural service pilots.

b. Cancellation of Contract for Rural Telecommunications Pilot (see Section 1.9).

c. Problems in Developing a Sustainable Model for ICT Services Pilot for Micro and Small
Businesses (Micronet). Micronet was delayed first by the need to complete design studies and
then by the need to mobilize private financing. SEDYMYPE, a company with public and private
sector participation, was established to operate the Micronet only in late 2006. By June 30 2008,
three Micronet centers were operating in Cuenca, Loja and Galapagos, with a small but rapidly
growing numbers of users. However, SEDYMYPE remains fragile as several private sector
investors defaulted on their initial commitment. The company has not raised enough private
capital to ensure its viability during the initial years required to establish the business.

d. Difficulties in Implementation of the Rural Electrification Pilots. These pilots were
particularly challenging as they required the introduction of new institutional arrangements for
operation and maintenance of solar home systems in isolated rural communities, under the
supervision of the distribution companies. The first institutional arrangement tried in Arajuno,
an electricity junta formed specifically for the Project, failed and is now being reorganized. The
second project, in Esmeraldas, made use of an existing community organization to manage the
systems and has been more successful in establishing a sustainable model of service, with regular
collection of payments and delivery of service. This model was replicated in the third pilot in
Napo, with variations. A low level of commitment by the distribution companies remains a
problem.     The Government is considering organization of a corporation to manage rural
electrification with renewable energy to address the problem.

e. Change in Implementation Strategy of Energy Efficiency. An initial delay of about two
years was caused by the failure of the initial implementation strategy that aimed to undertake all
energy efficiency activities through a single international consultancy, which was cancelled after
failing to deliver. At the suggestion of the Project Unit, the work was then split up among
several smaller, individual consultancies which were contracted locally. The change in strategy
not only achieved the desired results, but had the additional benefit of strengthening local
capacity for further implementation of energy efficiency activities, thus enhancing sustainability.




                                                    9

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Some shortcomings were evident in the M&E design. First, there were many different indicators,
as shown in section 1.2 (11 main qualitative indicators, 3 GEF qualitative indicators). Second,
while the core numerical indicators included in Annex 1 of the PAD and in the legal agreement
are only seven, they do not correspond well or provide good guidance to the achievement of the
qualitative key indicators. For example, the indicators on energy efficiency and rural
electrification measure direct outputs of the pilots but do not reflect well the intended outcomes
as expressed by the qualitative indicators. On the other hand, the core indicators for regulatory
strengthening are very broad; for example it is difficult to link the number of subscribers per
SUPTEL employee directly to Project assistance. For these reasons, the discussion on
achievement of outcomes focuses more on qualitative key indicators than the core numerical
indicators included in the legal agreements.

Monitoring was the responsibility of each of the implementing agencies, under the guidance of
the Project Coordinating Unit. As stipulated in the loan and grant agreements, the Project
regularly supplied to the Bank a quarterly progress report, including an updated procurement
plan, financial management report, and an update of results indicators. Monitoring indicators
were used to inform decision-making and resource allocation in some activities. For example,
data from the first rural electrification pilot project was used to enable better design of the
community organization in the second and third pilots. In other activities, use of monitoring data
was more limited for two reasons. First, some of the indicators measure the impact of single
stage technical assistance activities. Second, late implementation of pilot rural service and energy
efficiency sub-components resulted in late availability of indicators that limited their usefulness.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance


The Project complied with World Bank safeguard policies as identified in the PAD: (i)
Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01, BP 4.01, GP 4.01); and Indigenous Peoples (OP 4.02). It
also fully complied with fiduciary requirements. Safeguards and fiduciary aspects were rated as
satisfactory in aide memoires and ISRs. No significant issues were encountered.

a. Environmental Safeguards. Environmental screening was required for all pilot sub-projects
prior to approval. If negative impacts were anticipated, then an environmental assessment was
required. In the case of the rural electrification, partial assessments were developed in order to
ensure good environmental practices for aspects such as the disposal of batteries of the solar
home systems. Regarding the ICT business service centers (Micronet), and energy efficiency
sub-projects, it was concluded that no assessments were needed since they were developed in
existing facilities. The Project also financed some hydroelectric studies, which included adequate
environmental assessments. Screenings and assessments were reviewed and approved by the
Bank environmental specialist in Quito. Moreover, the Project supported CONELEC's
certification to evaluate and license the environmental impact of electricity projects. This will
help ensure that future projects in the sector meet adequate environmental standards.

b. Social Safeguards. As with environment noted above, a social screening was required and
carried out for all pilot projects. The analyses conducted more than met the Bank's social
safeguards requirements. The Project Unit systematically incorporated communication,


                                                  10

participation and consultation in project implementation, especially in rural pilot activities, and
documented the process. The Bank's social specialist in Quito noted that this had no precedent in
Ecuador and was best practice. For example, the implementation of the rural electrification pilots
included consultation with rural communities and indigenous populations prior to the Project
activities, and their involvement in the operation and management of solar home systems.

c. Financial Management and Audits. Financial management was satisfactory, aided by
centralization of project administration in the hands of experienced staff, combined with stability
of staff and use of the SIGEF information system. Even though the Project involved six
implementing agencies, requiring coordination activities and resulting in minor shortcomings in
financial management, the Project provided timely and reliable financial information. Audits did
not identify reportable conditions and unqualified opinions were submitted. Furthermore,
financial monitoring reports were delivered in timely fashion and recommendations were
implemented on an ongoing basis.

d. Procurement. The Project Unit was responsible for the procurement plan and undertaking the
contracting processes, responsibilities that were handled in a satisfactory manner. The
implementing agencies were responsible for defining contract contents and terms of reference,
evaluating offers, and administering the signed contracts. The performance of the implementing
agencies was mixed, with CENACE, CONELEC, and CONATEL demonstrating greater
competence in this area. The participation of so many implementing agencies created some
inefficiency, for example, overlaps between contracting committees in the Project Unit and the
implementing agencies.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase


The Project financed mainly technical assistance activities and pilot programs. The technical
assistance for strengthening regulatory agencies and environmental management does not require
explicit post-completion measures since the training/ equipment/capacity-building has been
absorbed by the implementing agencies, and many of the tools and studies developed are in
active use. In the case of CENACE, for example, the advanced technology systems are now an
integral part of operations. In some cases, activities are being expanded, modified and replicated.
For example, SUPTEL is expanding the radio spectrum monitoring system nationally and
CENACE is adapting its information system model to be installed on the computer systems of
market participants.

The current Government plans to address the longstanding fundamental problems by making
structural changes to the sectors that would strengthen public sector management and
investment. For example, in telecommunications, a new Telecommunications Law would create
a new Ministry of Telecommunications and Information Society, consolidate the regulatory
institutions into one agency under the Ministry, and consolidate public sector telecommunication
companies into one institution. The Government also proposes major public investment
programs in both sectors to improve coverage and assure quality of service.

In terms of sustainability of the Project's activities to strengthen regulatory agencies, these plans
could have both positive and negative impact. On the positive side, strengthening of the
regulation, control and monitoring system could result in more effective use of the regulatory


                                                  11

capabilities. On the other hand, changes in regulatory functions, institutional structures or
personnel could result in a risk that some of the capacity would be lost. This risk would be low
for SUPTEL, whose role is mainly one of technical supervision and control, and CENACE,
whose advanced technology systems are now an integral part of its commercial operations, but
would be moderate in the case of CONELEC, the single regulator for the electricity sector.

The second component of extension of rural services involved various activities, each of which
faces separate issues with respect to sustainability:

       Rural Telecommunications Pilot (Telecenters): The contract to implement this
       component was cancelled before completion. See Section 1.9.
       Rural Electrification Plan and Pilots: As noted in Section 3.2, PROMEC financed
       provision of renewable electricity service to 1346 households, but perhaps more
       importantly assisted in the provision of an additional 395 households with financing from
       FERUM and others, and prepared a pipeline of projects to cover 996 additional
       households. The most important longterm impact of the pilots was to serve as instruments
       to assist in adapting the rules of the rural electrification fund, FERUM, to finance projects
       using renewable energy, to assist distribution companies and others to develop the
       capacity to prepare projects, and to contribute experience to the Rural Electrification
       Plan, 2008-2012. In this Plan, funding was increased from US$45 to US$130 in 2008
       and US$120 million annually thereafter, including an allocation to renewable energy of
       US$9.6 million (see Annex 3).
       However, PROMEC's pilot projects using solar home systems are works in progress that
       require follow-up by SENPLADES and the MER, including formal transfer of ownership
       of the systems from SENPLADES to the distribution companies, and institutional support
       to the community organizations that are operating the systems. The experience of the
       pilots demonstrated: (a) the importance of utilizing a strong existing community
       organization rather than a special purpose group created to manage the activity; and (b)
       the difficulty in ensuring that the distribution companies take responsibility for the
       operation of the systems. This experience has led the Government to think of alternative
       systems to support implementation of renewable rural electrification subprojects, possibly
       through a special purpose corporation.

       ICT Services Pilot (Micronet): A public/private company, SEDYMYPE, was established
       in 2006 to operate the Micronet centers that provide ICT services to micro and small
       businesses. While the Ministry of Industry and Competitiveness (MIC, formerly MICIP)
       is in charge of the Government's participation, leadership and financing is expected to
       come from private sector partners. By June 2008, three centers were operating under a
       small management team. SEDYMYPE had arranged with local chambers of commerce,
       trade associations, and microfinance organizations to provide online training to their
       members. In 2008, SEDEMYPE received US$50,000 from the Corporation of Promotion
       of Exports and Investments (CORPEI), as well as an additional US$25,000 from
       Microsoft, in recognition of recent progress. In addition, free Internet services are being
       sought from SENATEL/FODATEL for two years. However, while these recent signs are
       positive, there is no certainty of adequate financing to carry SEDYMYPE through its next
       few years. Its sustainability is precarious and depends on private sector initiative.

The third component of energy efficiency was carried out successfully and has laid a solid
foundation for scaling-up in the future. The prospects for sustainability and replication are good,
as the Government has made strong commitments to scale up activities in the National
Development Plan 2007-2010, that are already beginning to be implemented (see Section 3.2 and
Annex 3 for details).

3. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Given the focused nature of the Project's package of institutional strengthening, rural service
extension and energy efficiency, almost all of the project components and objectives remain
relevant. The Project's aim of strengthening regulatory agencies is highly relevant given the
Government's plans to restructure and improve management of both sectors. There was a
particularly strong match between the content and timing of the energy efficiency and renewable
energy activities of the Project, and the strong priority given to these areas by the Correa
Government, as expressed in the National Development Plan, 2007-2010 and the Rural
Electrification Plan. Even the telecommunications pilot (telecenters), which was cancelled, and
the ICT pilot for business services, which ran into difficulties in implementation, were still
relevant given the Government's commitment to expand rural service provision.

According to the most recent (2003-2007) Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), the Bank Group's
objective in Ecuador is to help the Government achieve its goals by providing assistance to: (a)
consolidate the macroeconomic framework and lay the foundations for diversified and
sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction; (b) increase opportunities and broaden
access to economic resources, and make the needed structural reforms socially sustainable by
mitigating the impacts on the poor and vulnerable; and (c) strengthen governance by helping the
Ecuadorian officials build an accountable and efficient government, the services of which are
accessible to all Ecuadorians. The PROMEC Project is relevant mainly to objective (c) to
strengthen governance and increase access to services. Hence, it remains relevant to current
Bank strategy.

The positive perception of the Project from successive Governments provides evidence of its
ongoing relevance. The World Bank's portfolio in Ecuador has been scaled back significantly in
recent years. However, the last four governments, including the current administration, have
supported the Project.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives and Global Environment Objectives


Project Development Objectives

The Project was successful in achieving major objectives related to capacity building of
regulatory agencies, improving environmental management of the sectors activities, promoting
efficient use of energy and enhancing communication and consultation in the sectors. Highlights
of achievement included the introduction of advanced technology systems to CENACE's
operations center for the integrated national electricity system, making it one of the most modern


                                                 13

in Latin America, the successful promotion of CFL bulbs that reduced electricity demand
significantly, and communication and participation activities that were rated by the Bank's social
specialist as best practice in relation to rural pilot activities. The Project was less successful in
completion of pilot projects in provision of rural telecommunications and electricity services,
and in related fostering competition and private participation in rural service delivery.

Table 1 below summarizes the detailed analysis in Annex 3 of the Project Development
Objective by clause from the Project Appraisal Document (PAD). Following each clause are
selected qualitative Outcome/Impact Indicators from the results framework in Annex 1 of the
PAD and their ratings, as well as quantitative "Core Indicators of Project Outcome/ Impacts".

                     1.2: Improved effectiveness of      Regulatory effectiveness was improved by: (a) provision of tools and methodologies, such as those to calculate       MS
                     CONELEC to regulate the             tariffs based on actual costs; (b) identification of reforms, especially for the wholesale market and international
                     power sector and undertake          transactions; (c) establishment of a geographic information system to facilitate planning; and (d) provision of
                     timely public consultations and     equipment to assist in supervision of service quality. While some tools were not fully used, such as tariff
                     dissemination of regulatory         methodologies, they would provide valuable inputs for current Government plans. The Project did not

                     market, with an increased           dispatch in real time, improving control and reliability. The second improves efficiency of commercial
                     number of private operators and     transactions. The usefulness of both systems would not be affected by changes in sector structure. The third is
                     improved administration by          an information system, customized to market rules that must be changed if the sector is reorganized. CENACE
                     CENACE                              has contracted with the supplier to adapt the system. However, there is a moderate risk that the usefulness of
                                                         the third system could decrease under an organization with fewer and mainly public actors. CENACE's
                                                         administration was strengthened, losses were reduced and more accuracy achieved in transactions.                The
                                                         indicator of establishment of a liberalized market was not achieved because of changes in sector policy. Also, a
                                                         liberalized electricity market could not have been achieved by the activities financed by the subcomponent and
                                                         is therefore not a good indicator of the objective of the regulatory strengthening. Given the inclusion of this
                                                         aspect in the indicator, the rating was reduced from satisfactory to moderately satisfactory.

Global Environmental Objective

The Global Environmental Objective is to promote private financing and management of projects
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, by removing barriers to the use of: (i) renewable energy
technologies (RET) to extend electricity supply in rural areas; and (ii) energy efficiency
measures.

GEF indicator 1: Actual tons of CO2 reduced through (i) the implementation of pilot projects
based on renewable energy technologies in rural areas; and (ii) the implementation of a program
to enhance end-use energy efficiency.

While the end of the Project target was reduced from 80,000 to 17,200 tons in 2006, the actual
achievement of the Project exceeded the original target, at 93,100 tons, mainly through the CFL
promotion project. The CFL bulbs are expected to have an average life of 5 years, therefore the
total CO2 reduction from the Project executed CFL activities alone is expected to be 407,000
tons.

Building on the successful PROMEC experience, a follow-up program is under implementation,
in agreement with the priorities in the National Development Plan, 2007-2010. Under the
program, MER will donate 6 million CFLs to low income households. The result of the program
will be a reduction of peak demand by 225 MW and an energy saving of about 289,000 MWh
per year. CO2 will be reduced annually by an additional 230,000 tons over a period of 5 years.

Outcomes of PROMEC's activities in strategy development and policies are described in detail
in Annex 3, and summarized in sections (d) and (e) of Table 1 above. PROMEC's activities
contributed significant experience to the preparation of the Government's National Development
Plan 2007-2010, which as noted above includes the promotion of energy efficiency activities,
especially CFLs. Additionally, PROMEC's experience contributed to the preparation of the
Rural Electrification Plan that is almost tripling funds available for rural electrification, and
allocating a share to renewable energy.

3.3 Efficiency

The Project was conducted efficiently overall. It generated significant positive economic returns,
with moderate shortcomings in terms of delays that resulted in an extension of two years and an
unsatisfactory rating of several outcomes related to provision of rural services. The total cost of
the Project was US$28.7 million as compared to the original estimate of $38.2 million (excluding
contingencies). The Project completed almost all planned activities, with the exception of the
rural telecommunications pilot (telecenters), where $1 million of the planned $4.15 million of the
loan was spent and the contract was cancelled just before closing without achieving the intended
outputs or outcomes.

The estimates of quantifiable economic and financial benefits are summarized in Table 2 (see
Annex 4 for details). The benefits from reduction in electricity losses and savings due to better
accuracy in CENACE's management of the wholesale market re estimated at an economic NPV
of US$3.5 million and a financial NPV of $US0.5 million. While not entirely attributable to the
Project, the NPV of the consumer surplus from reduction in telephone tariffs is estimated at
US$78 million. The rural electrification pilots financed by PROMEC were estimated to have an
economic NPV of US$0.1million and financial NPV of $0.08 million. Finally, the CFL
promotion was estimated to have an economic NPV of US$40.6 million and a financial NPV of
US$22.3 million (only CFLs additional to base case, see Annex 4). The energy efficiency
impact was achieved at less than planned costs because the project used less costly local
consultants and focused on CFLs, where the cost was limited to highly cost-effective promotion.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome and Global Environment Outcome Rating

Rating--Overall Outcome: Moderately Satisfactory

Given the scope of the project design--i.e. strengthening of regulatory institutions, extension of
rural service of telecommunications and electricity services and energy efficiency--the Project
objectives and activities remain highly relevant to current Government and Bank priorities. As
noted in the section on objectives, nearly all of the programmed activities and consultancies were
undertaken and most of the objectives and results framework indicators were met.



                                                      18

Ratings for individual sub-objectives of the development objective are summarized from Table
1 below, resulting in an rating of moderately satisfactory for the overall outcome (see also
comment in section 2.1 on reformulation of the development objective):




a) strengthening regulatory institutions                                     Moderately
Satisfactory
(b) improving environmental management of the electricity sector Highly Satisfactory
(c) fostering competition and increasing private sector participation:       Moderately
Unsatisfactory
(d) promoting energy efficiency measures                              Highly Satisfactory
(e) extending coverage of power and communications                           Moderately
Unsatisfactory
(f) providing modern ICT services to micro and small businesses       Moderately Unsatisfactory
(g) enhancing communication and participation in the sectors                 Satisfactory
Summary Rating                                                        Moderately Satisfactory

Four of the sub-objectives were rates as satisfactory while three were related as unsatisfactory. It
is notable that the sub-objectives rates as satisfactory include outcomes that are broad and
significant in scope and scale.         The strengthening of regulatory institutions in both
telecommunications and electricity sectors and strengthened environmental management of the
electricity sector result in benefits to all consumers in both sectors. The energy efficiency
activities had a significant impact both directly and through replication--promotion of CFL bulbs
alone reduced national electricity consumption in Ecuador by just over 1 percent, and its
replication is expected to triple this effect by 2010. In contrast, the outcomes that were rated as
unsatisfactory are those of extension of services in telecommunications, rural electrification
using renewable energy; provision of ICT services to businesses; and strengthening of private
sector participation and competition related to rural service provision in both sectors. The
Project's activities that were meant to lead to these outcomes were pilots, small scale, high risk,
and mainly useful in terms of learning that could be used to develop larger scale activities.
Considering the overall outcomes, a rating of moderately satisfactory is assigned.

Rating--Global Environment Outcome: Satisfactory

Given that the Global Environmental Outcome depends on the relevance, outcomes and
efficiency of activities on renewable energy for rural electrification and energy efficiency
described above, a Satisfactory rating has been assigned based on the relevance, significant
outcomes in terms of sustainability and follow-up in the National Development Plan 2007-2010,
and the high efficiency (benefit/cost) ratio of these activities.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts


(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

As noted in section 1.6 above, many of the activities on expanding service coverage of
electricity, telecenters and ICT services were targeted toward low-income rural or marginal
urban areas. The fact that now, more that 79 percent of the population has a phone, means that
low-income, rural and marginal population has dramatically increased their access to phones, as
compared to 27 percent in 2004. These results were mainly due to the private companies'
investment to expand coverage in these areas, but also due to the increased affordability of the
service as a result of the reduction of prices in 2004 that was assisted by the Tariff Study
financed by the Project. For households that benefited or will benefit in future from solar home
systems, the positive impacts are significant. The length of the day is extended by improved
lighting, thus enabling social and productive processes to take place over a longer span of hours.
Availability of electricity provides a healthy living environment with respect to lighting (e.g.
better indoor air quality and better quality of light) and enables access to valuable information,
through different means of communication (e.g. television, computers). There is also evidence
that access to electricity enables the reallocation of household time (especially for women) away
from energy provision and may increase female employment rates and encourage greater
awareness of gender equality.     7



(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

The entire first component of the project is dedicated to institutional strengthening.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome and Global Environment Outcome

Rating--Overall: Moderate

The regulatory, supervision and control capacities of the regulatory agencies strengthened by the
Project would become even more important given the Government's plan to strengthen the
operations of the sectors through major structural changes, as noted in Section 1.1. Given the
changes planned, there is a limited risk that the institutional strengthening and capacity building
outcomes would be partially lost through changes in institutional structures or personnel. For
SUPTEL and CENACE, the risk is assessed as low while for CONELEC it is assessed as
moderate. The coverage extension activities also present some risks. The rural
telecommunications pilot was cancelled and the sustainability of the ICT services pilot for micro
and small businesses (Micronet) is fragile, depending on further private sector capital to a
nascent business. The late implementation of the rural electrification pilots requires follow-up by
SENPLADEs, MER and CONELEC to ensure support to the community organizations
maintaining the systems. However, the Government plans to expand renewable rural
electrification under the Rural Electrification Plan, and is considering creating a renewable
corporation to support the existing pilots and future projects. With respect to energy efficiency,

risks are considered low as the Government has made energy efficiency a priority and there are
plans to dramatically expand the CFL replacement program, expand the standards and
certification program and utilize fully the curriculum on energy efficiency prepared for the
schools.

Rating--GEF: Negligible to Low
Given the current Government's strong commitment to renewable energy for rural electrification
and energy efficiency, and risks are considered to be moderate to low. The Government's
commitment can be seen in: (a) the creation of the Secretariat for Renewable Energy and Energy
Efficiency; (b) ongoing CFL campaign and inclusion of renewable energy and energy efficiency
as priorities in the National Development Plan; and (c) changes already made to increase the
funding available for rural electrification and enable renewable energy projects to benefit from
this financing.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance


(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

The Project team intentionally designed components that would be politically-supportable given
a changing political environment and increased political support for public participation in both
sectors. The Project was complex but given the political considerations at the time, and the
continued Government support of successive Governments over time in a difficult environment,
it seems to have made sense to include all of the components. The main issue was the inclusion
of three challenging pilot activities in rural services that taxed implementation capacity. The
PDO and some indicators should have been reformulated, as noted in section 2.1. There were no
fiduciary issues.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Bank actively supervised the Project, frequently reengaging with new government
authorities following changes at the presidential and ministerial levels. Support was attained
from new authorities and efforts were made to accelerate project execution as much as possible.
Fiduciary and safeguard aspects operated smoothly, and according to interviews with the
implementing agencies, the technical advice of the Bank team was generally considered
valuable. There were some minor shortcomings with respect to procurement requirements and
delays in issuing no objections, given that almost all procurement processes were subject to prior
approval.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance




                                                21

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Taking into account the rating of moderately satisfactory at preparation and supervision, an
overall rating of moderately satisfactory is assigned.

5.2 Borrower Performance


(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Ownership and commitment to achieving the development objectives was strong from the
Government as a whole. However, frequent changes in government administrations and
ministers contributed to delays and a difficult institutional environment. The performance of the
MEF was satisfactory. The Project enjoyed an adequate level of support and budget allocations
were adequate and timely. The moderate shortcomings from the overall political environment
combined with MEF's satisfactory performance resulted in assigning a moderately satisfactory
rating for the Government's performance.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The implementing agencies can be split into three separate entities: the central coordinating
agency     (SENPLADES/CONAM),              the  Project   Coordinating      Unit   (PCU)     within
SENPLADES/CONAM, and the other implementing agencies. The performance of
SENPLADES/CONAM was satisfactory. Both were consistent in their support, demonstrated in
maintaining a highly qualified team in the coordinating unit, providing leadership and support to
the implementing agencies, intervening with higher authorities when necessary, and ensuring a
smooth transition from CONAM to SENPLADES. The performance of the Project Coordinating
Unit was also satisfactory. There was a high degree of continuity and competence within the
technical and administrative staff although there were changes in the project coordinator. At
critical times (e.g. during transitions in government), the project unit played an especially active
role. Beneficiary/stakeholder consultations and involvement was exemplary and fiduciary and
safeguards issues were skillfully handled. Coordinating with the six different implementing
agencies was challenging at times but generally managed well. The Project Unit organized
several off-site workshops with implementing agencies to discuss implementation progress and
issues.

The performance of the six different implementing agencies--SUPTEL, CONATEL/SENATEL,
CONELEC, CENACE, MER/MEM, and MIC/MICIP--was variable but moderately satisfactory
overall. CENACE was a standout in terms of competence and commitment. In fact, CENACE
opted to finance complementary institutional strengthening activities out of its own budget. he
performance of CONELEC and SUPTEL was satisfactory in terms of moving activities forward.
Weak institutional capacity and frequent changes of personnel in MEM/MER and MICIP/MIC
negatively affected execution of their components. In the case of CONATEL/SENATEL the

long dispute with the telecommunications operator indicates the challenge of managing a
complex BOOT contract.

The combination of satisfactory performance from SENPLADES/CONAM, satisfactory
performance from the project unit, and a range of performance from the implementing agencies
(which averaged out to moderately satisfactory), generated an overall implementing agency
rating of moderately satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The difficult institutional environment (created by several government changes) and mixed
implementation agency performance together with the strong performance of the SENPLADES/
CONAM and the Project Unit, resulting in an overall Borrower performance rating of
moderately satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

a. Project Complexity is not only Negative. The Project included a wide range of components
that spanned six different implementing agencies. One could argue that this breadth proved
unwieldy and made the job of the project unit extremely difficult. It also resulted in delays
because of the large number of coordination agreements required. Each change of government
necessitated rebuilding relationships and convincing new leadership of the Project's validity.
However, on the other hand, the involvement of a large number of implementing agencies that
felt that the Project activities were useful meant that the Project had solid and continuous support
in the Government. The most significant problems during implementation were not due to the
complexity of the Project, but rather to implementation difficulties in the rural
telecommunications and business services pilots.

b. Care is Needed in Including Several Pilot Activities. The PROMEC Project included three
rural pilot activities with different implementing agencies (MEM/MER, MICIP/MIC and
CONATEL/SENATEL) and delivery modes (distribution companies plus community
organizations, mixed public-private company to be formed by the Project, BOOT contract).
None of the implementation mechanisms (eg. locations, business plans, contracting documents)
were fully prepared at effectiveness, which delayed pilot implementation and increased risks of
failure. All three of the rural service pilot activities got off the ground late in the life of the
Project, making it difficult to assure sustainability or draw lessons. The difficulty of including
four small but significant pilot activities may have been underestimated at the design stage. It
was the rural pilot activities that contributed most to Project delays and the need for extension,
and the rural telecenter and ICT pilots were ultimately not successful. Lessons learned that need
to be taken into account include:

        (a) by definition, a pilot has a possibility of success or failure. The risk is taken not
        because one necessarily expects success, but rather in the expectation that the pilot
        project would result in useful learning that can help define further activities to achieve a




                                                 23

        defined objective. The indictor of success would not then be successful completion of
        the pilot, but rather valuable experience gained as a result of its implementation.
        (b) care needs to be taken in including a number of pilots in a project, since pilot projects
        by their nature are small, innovative, high risk and time consuming. Each one needs
        considerable effort and time to develop, mature and yield lessons for replication;

        (c) in order to have a chance of delivering results in a four or five years of a Project,
        implementation arrangements for pilot projects need to be defined during preparation;

        (d) caution is needed in attempting to support the formation of a small, special purpose
        company within a Project. Small companies in general are risky by nature, often operate
        at a loss for several years and have a high risk of failure. The estimates in the business
        plan of Micronet were too optimistic. The company is still operating at a loss and may
        continue to do so for some time. The fate of the company now depends on obtaining
        additional working and investment capital from the private sector, a situation that was not
        foreseen in the business plan.

c. Communication and Community Participation Approach Highly Beneficial. PROMEC's
communication and participation activities were considered by participants to be innovative,
important and highly beneficial. The benefits were multiple: (a) helping create awareness of
Project activities; (b) building consensus on implementation approaches; (c) building capacity of
communities and individuals to participate in design and implementation; and, perhaps most
importantly, (d) increasing accountability and transparency of the Project's activities and
management to stakeholders. All of these factors contributed to the generally positive perception
of the Project.

d. Implementation through Individual Local Consultancies rather than Large
International Contracts can be Advantageous. As noted in Section 1.9, the plan to implement
energy efficiency activities through a single large international consultancy with a firm failed
due to poor performance of the international firm. At the suggestion of the Project Unit, the
single international firm was replaced by several individual consultants available locally, that
had international experience. While this required more management by the Project Unit and the
MEM/MER, development of management capability in energy efficiency was in any case
essential in order to ensure longterm sustainability. While obviously not all large international
consultancies fail, there were significant advantages in terms of cost, flexibility and sustainability
in the use of a number of small local consultancies.

                    Annex 3. Detailed Assessment of Project Outcome/Impact

This Annex breaks down the Project Development Objective by clause from the Project
Appraisal Document (PAD). Following each clause are selected qualitative Outcome/Impact
Indicators from the results framework in Annex 1 of the PAD and their ratings, as well as
quantitative "Core Indicators of Project Outcome/ Impacts". The analysis below will demonstrate
that the Project was successful in achieving most of its objectives.

The objective of the Project is support the Borrower's reform programs in the power and
communications sectors by:

(a): Strengthening regulatory institutions.

1.1: Improved effectiveness of SUPTEL to supervise the sector and undertake timely public
consultations and dissemination of regulatory decisions.                                     Rating:
Satisfactory

The Project helped SUPTEL adopt a new organizational structure and procedures to become
more efficient and effective. SUPTEL's computing infrastructure was improved and updated,
training courses (technical, financial/administrative, legal, and ICT) were implemented, relevant
books and technical documents were purchased. Additionally, radio frequency monitoring
equipment was installed in Quito and Cuenca. These units are operating well and have allowed
SUPTEL to better control the radio-frequency spectrum, detecting illegal users, clandestine
radios, and solving interference problems.8 SUPTEL is expanding the radio spectrum monitoring
system nationally, investing US$15 million to purchase monitoring stations and improving the
centralized database for the frequency records. Additionally, the Project assisted SUPTEL to
improve its image, and to conduct public consultations and dissemination programs. It is
reasonable to assume that training staff, providing it with technical assistance, improving its
image and dissemination programs, and updating its antiquated systems with a modern radio
frequency management and monitoring system contributed to the significant gains in SUPTEL's
productivity in terms of the number of employees per subscriber (Core Indicator 1).

1.2: Improved effectiveness of CONELEC to regulate the power sector and undertake timely
public consultations and dissemination of regulatory decisions.                       Rating:
Moderately Satisfactory

PROMEC's technical assistance (including consultancies, equipment, and software purchases)
strengthened CONELEC's planning, regulation, supervision, and control capacity. Consultancies
have given the tariff unit the tools and methodologies to calculate tariffs based on actual costs.
Reforms of laws, norms, and regulations were identified that would improve the operation of the

sector, with respect to third party access to transmission and distribution, anti-trust, guarantees of
existing contracts, operation of the wholesale market and international transactions. Modern
information systems were established, including a geographic information system (GIS) that
facilitate CONELEC's planning processes. Equipment provided assists in supervision of required
transmission and distribution quality levels. A strategic training plan was developed and
implemented. While the political climate in Ecuador prevented some of the consultancy results
from being adopted, for instance some of those related to tariffs and legal reforms, these tools
provide valuable inputs for sector reorganization and tariff rebalancing plans of the Government.
While the Project likely improved CONELEC's regulatory effectiveness and contributed to
improvement of the core indicator of timeliness of completing regulatory tasks, it is not clear that
there was an impact on its ability to undertake public consultations and disseminate regulatory
decisions.

1.4: Establishment of a liberalized wholesale electricity market, with an increased number of
private operators and improved administration by CENACE.                                     Rating:
Moderately Satisfactory

The Project strengthened CENACE's administration of the wholesale market. The Project
financed three inter-related advanced technology systems for CENACE's operations center,
making it one of the most modern in Latin America. This center serves the critical functions of
dispatching electricity and handling commercial transactions in the wholesale electricity market.
The first system financed, the energy management system, manages the dispatch of energy
within the National Interconnected Energy System in real time. It permits supervision and
control of energy dispatch from generators and ensures reliable and secure operation of the
electricity system. It is useful regardless of the institutional or regulatory structure. The second
system is a commercial measurement system that is useful for all types of market participants
(public or private) and for the commercial management of the electricity system. The third
system is an information system for the wholesale market, which is not only being used by
CENACE, but also by major market participants. The information system for the wholesale
market is customized to the current market rules, and would need to be changed if the
Government reorganizes the sector. CENACE has indicated that it has contracted with the
supplier to adapt the system as needed. However, the usefulness of the third system could
decrease under a sector organization with fewer and mainly public actors. It should also be noted
that, as sector policies changed, a fully liberalized wholesale electricity market with an increased
number of private operators was not achieved. Also, the establishment of a liberalized wholesale
market cannot be considered as an indicator of strengthening of CENACE, the operator of the
market. Since the indicator was formulated in this way, the rating has been reduced from
satisfactory to moderately satisfactory.

(b): Improving environmental management of the electricity sector.

1.3: Strengthened capacity of CONELEC and other relevant entities, to conduct environmental
management of power sector activities.                                                   Rating:          Highly
Satisfactory

Environmental management and control capacity has been strengthened within CONELEC as
well as the Ministry of Environment. An environmental unit within CONELEC was accredited
by the Ministry of Environment to evaluate projects and give licenses. The Project also built
capacity within the Ministry of Environment to identify and promote Clean Development
Mechanism (CDM) projects. With the support of the Project, two carbon emissions reductions
CDM contracts were signed for hydroelectric facilities with private investment. Moreover, the
Project's trailblazing activities laid the foundation for several more CDM projects in the power
generation sector.

(c) Fostering competition and increasing private participation.

1.5: Increased number of private operators providing rural telecommunications, decentralized
rural electrification, energy efficiency services and ICT based services to MSBs.
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

While the development objective is very general, the indicator relates directly to rural service
extension and energy efficiency. In the telecommunications pilot, a contract was signed for
establishment of rural telecenters with a telecommunications operator. However, as noted in
Section 1.9, the contract was cancelled without achieving the intended outcome. In the case of
the ICT service pilot, Micronet, a mixed company was established, SEDEMPYE, that is
currently operating centers in Cuena, Loja and Galapagos, but is struggling to achieve financial
viability. Three rural electrification service pilots are in operation with public electricity
distribution companies and private community organizations, but as noted below their
performance in the medium to long-term remains to be established.                           Finally, the energy
efficiency activities of the Project trained 100 representatives of private companies and
educational institutions in energy audits, as well as conducting audits through a number of the
private ESCOs trained. Also, a promotion for CFL bulbs was carried out through private sector
companies. Overall, the outcome is considered to be moderately unsatisfactory at the closing of
the Project, mainly because of the cancellation of the telecenter component and the fragile status
of the Micronet component.

(d) Promoting efficient use of energy.

3.1: Successful implementation of a program to enhance efficiency in the use of energy. Rating:
Highly Satisfactory

PROMEC's energy efficiency activities achieved significant results, including completion of
studies analyzing barriers to energy efficiency, development of a strategy for energy efficiency
and the successful completion of activities that reduced energy use in the short and medium term.
These efforts are particularly relevant to the priorities of the current Government, which has
defined energy efficiency as a priority in the National Development Plan, 2007-2010, building
on the results of the Project. The main results are summarized below:
(a) Sale of more than 1.69 million compact fluorescent (CFL) bulbs that reduced the average
     consumption of residential users' electricity consumption for light by 32 percent (equivalent
     to 8 percent of total consumption of average residential user) and peak demand in the entire
     system by 80 MW, saving 102,300 MWh per year. This led to a follow-up program, already
     underway, in which MER will donate 6 million CFLs to low income households. The result
     of the additional program will be a reduction of peak demand by 225 MW and an energy
     saving of 289,100 MWh per year.
(b) Training of more than 100 representatives of private companies, educational institutions and
     ESCOs on energy audits, as well as completion of energy audits in commercial buildings,
     hotels, hospitals and industries.
(c) Completion of standardization and labeling of energy use of refrigerators, with the
     Ecuadorian Standards Institute (INEN), a procedure that could be replicated for other
     appliances; and
(d) Preparation of educational materials on energy efficiency for school curriculums. Training
     for teachers was provided in four regional seminars and the teaching materials will be
     disseminated for use in schools around the country starting in March 2009.

2.1: Adoption of a sustainable strategy to extend telecommunications and electricity services to
the poor, including the adoption of cost efficient financing and delivery mechanisms.                 Rating:
Moderately Satisfactory

The Project made a significant contribution to this objective through a Tariff Rebalancing Study,
which helped to extend coverage of telecommunications services to the rural, poor and marginal
areas of Ecuador. The Study helped CONATEL to (a) adjust tariffs for fixed line service,
eliminating most of the fixed line tariff subsidies; and (b) order a reduction of the fixed to mobile
interconnection rates.9 SENATEL issued a resolution in 2004 reducing the fixed-mobile
interconnection rate, which caused the private companies to reduce their mobile rates from an
average of US$0.25 per minute in 2004 to US$0.11 per minute in 2008. The number of mobile
lines increased rapidly as a result, from 482,000 in 2000 to 6.246 million in 2007. The

9SENATEL Interconnection Order of July 15, 2004, reduced fixed to mobile interconnection rates from US$0.23
per minute to US$0.1131, and mobile to fixed rates from US$0.045 per minute to US$0.02 per minute average.

percentage of Ecuadorians with phones increased from 27percent in 2004 to 79percent in July
2008.

The Government recently approved a sustainable strategy developed by CONATEL, the National
Connectivity Plan 2008-2010. The Plan calls for US$900 million investment to: (a) increase the
coverage of fixed lines; (b) increase the participation of TELECSA in the mobile market,
focusing on rural and border areas; and (c) expand the number of broadband lines. CONATEL
intends to further revise tariffs, focusing subsidies on the low-income, rural and marginal
population, reducing the tariffs for broadband services, and further aligning tariffs with costs.
The new contracts with cellular phone companies include an obligation to pay 1 percent of
revenues to the Universal Service Fund (FODETEL) to finance extension of services,
representing a sustainable approach to providing service to rural residents and the poor.

With respect to electricity coverage, the Government introduced the Rural Electrification Plan,
building on the successful experience with the Rural Electrification Fund (FERUM), but
increasing financing from US$45 million to US$130 million in 2008 and $120 million per year
for the next four years. Of this amount, US$9.6 million is allocated for renewable energy
projects. The PROMEC Project provided experience that helped in the development of the Rural
Electrification Plan, including help to adapt the regulations of FERUM for renewable energy,
preparation of a strategy for rural electrification, studies of the unmet demand for electrification
and the capacity and willingness to pay of the population without service, implementation of
several pilot projects, preparation of a pipeline of renewable energy projects to be financed,
preparing guidelines for the preparation of projects by distribution companies, and analyzing the
lessons learned from the pilot projects.

2.2: Successful completion of pilot projects for rural telecommunications, testing the cost-

replicability of the models. Rating: Highly Unsatisfactory

As noted in section 1.9, the contract for implementation of this activity was cancelled in June
2008. While 560 telecenters were reported as installed by the telecommunications operator in
August 2007, according to CONATEL the telecenters have not operated and the outcome was
not achieved.

The Project implemented pilots using solar home systems to serve a total of 1741 households,
reaching 87 per cent of the revised target.                      This included 1346 households (in Arajuno,
Esmeraldas, and Napo Sur), where the projects were prepared and financed by PROMEC. Even


                                                              41

more importantly, the Project assisted service provision for 395 households where PROMEC
prepared the rural electrification projects and secured financing from others, including FERUM
and the private sector. An example is the Sarayacu Project, where the Empresa Electrica Ambato
obtained funds from FERUM for provision of electricity with solar home systems for 140
households, after the Project was prepared by PROMEC. Studies were completed for service to
another 646 households that provide a pipeline for future investments.

However, the pilots are still a work in progress. Arrangements to transfer the systems from
SENPLADES to the distribution companies are still underway, and the implementation
arrangements for the first pilot in Arajuno failed and are being reorganized. The second pilot in
Esmeraldas featured a stronger community organization and better administrative organization
that has resulted in more successful operation.                   Issues include a lack of interest by the
distribution companies, an inequity between the monthly payments of the users in the pilots and
the subsidized customers on the network, as well as complaints about the limited capacity of the
PV systems. Maintenance has been an issue, particularly following heavy storms that damaged
some panels. SENPLADES is following up on the issues and working on transition arrangements
with MER and CONELEC. While issues remain, the pilots have provide valuable information
for the expanded Government program under the Rural Electrification Plan, and the Project's
main consultants have been hired by CONELEC or other renewable projects to continue the
work.

At the close of the Project, three centers were operating in Cuenca, Loja and Galapagos. The
centers provide a range of training services offered through an internet portal, including modules
on legal advice, credit, finance, business plans, and marketing plans. While the Project did not
reach its targets in terms of numbers of businesses served, Micronet has reached agreement with
local business associations and chambers to provide training to their members. As noted in
section 2.5, the sustainability of the Micronet centers depends on mobilizing additional financing
from the private sector. Since the number of users was well below the end-of-project target at
end June, and the sustainability of the operation is uncertain, the activity is rated as moderately
unsatisfactory. It should be noted, however, that data to the end of September show an increase
in the number of users to 1315, indicating strong growth potential.

The participation and communication activities of the PROMEC Project were particularly strong
and contributed to its transparency and good governance, contributing to the positive perception
of the Project by stakeholders, implementing agencies and Government authorities. These
activities in relation to the rural services extension components were regarded as best practice by
the Project's social specialist, especially in relation to inclusion of indigenous peoples and the
poor. Activities aimed to assist the beneficiaries of the Project to participate in the definition of
their problems and needs. Actions included: (a) assistance to all pilot projects to incorporate
participatory approaches in preparation and implementation; (b) economic, social and
environmental evaluation of rural electrification pilot projects; (c) one national and six regional
workshops to present and discuss the activities of PROMEC; (d) workshops among
implementing agencies and stakeholders; (e) applying a policy of positive social discrimination,
including indigenous people and afroecuadorians; and (f) developing public information
campaigns for the rural electrification, energy efficiency, telecommunication and business
services pilots.

   Annex 4: Economic and Financial Analysis of the PROMEC Project (Preliminary)

The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) did not provide sufficient detail on the methodology
used to conduct the financial and economic analyses; hence the analysis carried out in this ICR
does not replicate exactly that of the PAD. Given the broad scope of the project, economic and
financial analyses have been carried at the level of project component /sub component, when
relevant. Discount rate is 12 percent for all analyses.

Component 1: Strengthening of Legal, Regulatory and Institutional Frameworks

A1. Strengthening of SUPTEL's supervisory and enforcement capacity
A2. Strengthening of CONELEC's regulatory capacity
A3. Improvement of CONELEC's environmental management of the Borrower's power sector

These three components consisted in the provision of technical assistance for improvement of
technical and institutional capacity of the two entities. Therefore, no financial or economic
analysis was carried out.

A4. Improvement of CENACE's electricity wholesale market administration
The project financed the following systems for CENACE: (i) Energy Management System
(SIMAE), (ii) Commercial Measurement System (SIMEC), and (iii) Information System for the
Wholesale Market (SIMEM).

The Project conducted simple economic and financial analyses, while CENACE carried out a
more comprehensive economic analysis (comprising systems developed at the same time as
PROMEC but not financed by it), which is included in the Project Files.

Economic analysis
The main economic benefits of these systems are estimated to be two fold: (i) a reduction in
electricity cuts and increase in energy provided to clients, (ii) an improvement in measurement of
electricity transactions in the whole sale market.

The main assumptions were as follows:
    -   Yearly reduction in energy loss due to outage is detailed in the table 4.1 below,
    -   Improvement in accuracy of measurement: 0.095 percent (CENACE measurement over
        2006-08),
    -   Costs: actual for the Energy Management System (SIMAE), and estimates for the two
        other systems (SIMEC and SIMEM).

Based on the economic analysis, the component shows good economic returns. Under relatively
conservative assumptions, the ERR for the component is 37 percent, with an economic net
present value of US$3.5 million.

Financial analysis
The financial benefits of these systems are the same as those estimated for the economic
analysis: but the pricing of those benefits differs since the price of non served electricity is
estimated as the average of the final user tariff, the producers 'income and the average cost of
electricity self-production.

The main assumptions were as follows:
    -   Yearly reduction in energy loss due to outage is detailed in the table 4.3 below,
    -   Improvement in accuracy of measurement: 0.095 percent (CENACE measurement over
        2006-08),
    -   Costs: actual for the Energy Management System (SIMAE), and estimates for the two
        other systems (SIMEC and SIMEM).



The financial analysis yields good financial returns. Under relatively conservative assumptions,
the IRR for the component is 16 percent, with a financial net present value of US$538,000.

Component B. Extension of Power, Communications and Business Services to Rural and
Peri-urban Areas Sectors

B1. Rural Telecommunications Pilot Subprojects
The team did not carry out the economic analysis for the Telecenter component, because it was
not successful. The private company that was selected to build and operate the telecenters claims
to have installed 560 centers. However, CONATEL indicated that none of them entered into
operation and CONATEL cancelled the contract in June 2008, after an initial payment of US$1
million.

Nevertheless, as mentioned in Section 3.2(e), the Tariff Rebalancing Study for CONATEL, led
to SENATEL Interconnection Order, which allowed for an increase in installation of the number
of mobile lines by private companies, and a significant reduction in prices for the services.

There are several benefits attributable to SENATEL Interconnection Order: (i) Consumer surplus
from the reduction in prices, (ii) Increased competition in the sector, although the impact is
limited as there were no new companies entering the market in this period, (iii) Voluntary
reduction in prices by the companies in order to attract the lower income population to buy and
use cell phones. In general, we have not seen this behavior in other countries if the operators are
not pressured by competition., (iv) Increased purchasing power of the population: based on IMF
data, total growth for the period 2004 to 2008 (June 30th) is 8.7 percent, which is relatively low
compared with the reported increase in usage.



                                                47

The team conservatively chose to assess only the consumer surplus from the reduction in prices.
The results are very positive: the economic NPV is US$78 million over the period.

B2. Development and implementation of MER/MEM's rural electrification program
The economic and financial analysis was carried out for the rural electrification sub-pilot project
Esmeraldas carried out under the MER rural electrification program, based on the studies
financed by PROMEC (see component B3 below).

B3. Carrying out of Rural Electrification Pilot Subprojects

Economic analysis
The economic benefits have two components : (i) the avoided costs for lighting and TV/radio
(dry cells and rechargeable car-batteries) that households will not incur when the PV systems are
installed, and (ii) the consumer surplus resulting from the increased consumption at lower per
unit prices.

The analysis was carried out for the three sub pilots: Esmeraldas, Arajuno and Napo, in which a
total of 1,346 systems were installed (302 100Wp systems, 1,031 200Wp systems and 13 400Wp
systems).

The following assumptions were made:




                                                 48

- Households energy expenses: US$77.6 / month on average, based on survey data gathered in
Arajuno and Esmeraldas, on average per year10
- Costs of PV systems: actual costs (exempt of VAT) were $1,280 for 100Wp systems and
US$2,280 for 200Wp systems, on average per year11
- O&M costs: on average, US$54.2 per 100Wp system US$77.5 per 200Wp system per year11

Based on the economic analysis, the solar home systems (SHS) component o f the Project shows
good economic returns. Under conservative assumptions, the ERR for the total sub component is
13 percent, with an economic net present value of about US$99,505.

for lighting before the installation of the SHS. Therefore, the NPV is positive at US$78,474 for
the users (see table 4.7 below).

B4. Development and implementation of MIC/MICIP's program to bring information and
communications development services to micro and small businesses in rural and peri-urban
areas.

As of end October 2008, the number of beneficiaries of the Micronet centers totaled 1,315
versus the 8,000 targeted. Micronet clients have followed training in ICT and business
(including preparation of a business plan). Micronet is now introducing a new course to help
MSBs build their financial plans.

After several years of operation, Micronet has not been able to reach break even.
Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that the targets for the component as indicated in the
PAD ("Reaching a financial breakeven by year 2 and positive income of revenues by year
4") were not realistic, especially given that Micronet deals with very small and relatively
informal businesses. Private sector investment in the company was much lower than original
commitments obtained (only US$246,460).

Nevertheless, the concept developed by Micronet has encountered enthusiasm among local
business stakeholders and its impact on MSBs has been widely recognized. As a result the
firm recently received support (in the form of materials) from business associations, a
financial donation (US$38.507) from Microsoft and the Corporation for Promotion of
Exports and Investments (CORPEI) invested US$50,000 in Micronet in 2008. The company
believes that a US$100,000 investment could provide the necessary inflow to finance the
creation of the remaining 5 centers and therefore break-even. Some private companies have
expressed interest in providing the necessary capital, but their participation has yet to be
concretized.

Component C. Enhancement of Electricity End-use Efficiency

The analysis has been performed for the replacement of incandescent bulbs with CFLs
(sub-component C3 " Carrying out Electricity Efficiency Enhancement Pilot Subprojects").



                                                                                         51

As described above, 1,045,000 CFLs were sold to residential customers through the
commercial channels designed by the campaign in the regions participating in the pilot, and a
total of 2,600,000 CFLs were sold throughout the country as a result of the public awareness
created by the Project (with a baseline of 916,667 CFLs, net sales were 1,691,433).

Two main categories of CFLs were sold to customers: 23-Watt (32 percent of total) and 15
Watt (68 percent). CFLs use approximately 75 percent less electricity than the equivalent
incandescent lamps given the same amount of lumen output.

Accumulated GHG emissions reductions resulting from the CFL component are expected to
amount to 407,000 tons of C02e over five years. Corresponding reduction of peak demand is
80MW. This also leads to sizeable savings in postponement of investment generation.

Economic analysis
The replacement of incandescent lamps by CFLs has very high economic benefits. With an
investment of US$4.8 million (before tax), and at an economic cost of energy estimated at
US$11c/kWh, the replacement of incandescent bulbs by CFLs results in an economic NPV of
US$40.6 million and an EIRR of 228 percent over five years (see table 4.8. below).

Financial analysis
The replacement of incandescent lamps by CFLs has good net financial benefits. With an
investment of US$5.3 million (including taxes), and at a financial cost of energy (i.e. average
tariff) estimated at between US$5c/kWh and US$13c/kWh, the replacement of incandescent
bulbs by CFLs results in an economic NPV of US$22.3 million and an FIRR of 147 percent
(see table 4.8. below).




                                                                                         52
