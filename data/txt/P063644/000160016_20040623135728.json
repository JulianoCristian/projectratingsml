This report also analyzes the effectiveness\n            of the environmental legislation for the energy and\n            telecommunications sectors related to the project\n            components, and discusses ways to strengthen policies and\n            the institutional capacity for environmental management.\n            Major impacts due to the internal combustion associated with\n            thermoelectric generation are emissions of nitrous oxide and\n            monoxide. Other potential impacts are significant water\n            pollution, leakage of hydrocarbons, inadequate solid waste\n            disposal, and noise affecting workers as well as neighboring\n            populations. Potential impacts associated with hydroelectric\n            generation include the deterioration in quantity of water\n            resources, that is interrupted water flow, reduced water\n            availability and regularity for use by the general\n            population; a deterioration in water quality because of the\n            excessive production of nutrients leading to anaerobic\n            conditions., loss of the vegetal cover and acceleration of\n            erosion caused by reservoirs and civil works, and increased\n            noise and vibrations caused by machinery and equipment which\n            would not only affect neighboring populations but the also\n            the health of workers. Recommended mitigation measures to\n            offset these impacts include devising policies to reduce\n            emissions--in particular adhering to provisions of the Kyoto\n            Accord, and relying on domestic agencies concerned with\n            insuring environmentally sustainable development, as well as\n            promoting use of renewable energy resources. Negative\n            impacts likely to arise from energy transmission comprise\n            destruction of forest and biodiversity, and interference\n            with protected area management and fragile ecosystems\n            because of transmission lines and installations, as well as\n            reduced access to areas where theses structures are located,\n            increased solid waste generation, electromagnetic radiation\n            from transmission lines affecting humans and animal species,\n            and a reduced right-of-way."}, "docdt": "2001-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
