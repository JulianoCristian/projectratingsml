                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the Balochistan Small Scale Irrigation Project (BSSIP) is to support efforts by the GoBalochistan to improve the management of scarce
                         water resources in the Pishin Lora Basin (PLB) by reducing the overall impact of the present water crisis. Project activities are designed to recognize the importance of
                         direct participation of water users and other stakeholders. Key indicators include (i) increased surface water availability and reduced groundwater depletion, (ii)
                         increased water productivity through a combination of engineering, management, and agricultural measures, and (iii) expanded local capacity and participation of
                         farmers to implement similar schemes and formulate plans for sustainable water resources development and watershed management.

                         Despite overall current security challenges in Pakistan as a whole, and Balochistan in particular, implementation progress under the project is significant. Main works for
                         augmentation of Band-e-Khushdil Khan (BKK), including the Main Dam, Intake Tower, Spillway and the Protection Embankment and have been completed and the dam is storing

                         feeding channels is nearly complete. Rehabilitation of 15 small schemes is progressing well and 14 have been completed. All remaining construction works under the project are
                         expected to complete by end June, 2014. Progress has also been made in the preparation of two future investment projects of Nari and Porali River Basins. The Government of
                         Pakistan has sent a formal request to the World Bank to obtain financing for realization of the above mentioned two projects. The project retains its satisfactory implementation rating.
