                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the Balochistan Small Scale Irrigation Project (BSSIP) is to support efforts by the GoBalochistan to improve the management of scarce
                         water resources in the Pishin Lora Basin (PLB) by reducing the overall impact of the present water crisis. Project activities are designed to recognize the importance of
                         direct participation of water users and other stakeholders. Key indicators include (i) increased surface water availability and reduced groundwater depletion, (ii)
                         increased water productivity through a combination of engineering, management, and agricultural measures, and (iii) expanded local capacity and participation of
                         farmers to implement similar schemes and formulate plans for sustainable water resources development and watershed management.

                         Given the initial delay of about two years in project implementation, the ongoing activities under the project will not complete by project closing date of June 30, 2013, therefore
                         additional one year will be required to complete the ongoing activities under the project. Furthermore, there is considerable demand for rehabilitation of additional irrigation schemes
                         in the project area by the farmers. The government of Balochistan together with the Bank mission of the opinion to extend the project closing date and to request for additional
                         finance of bout 10-15 million to complete the ongoing activities and to address the remaining irrigation system improvement needs in the Pishin Lora Basin.
