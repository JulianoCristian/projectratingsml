                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the Balochistan Small Scale Irrigation Project (BSSIP) is to support efforts by the GoBalochistan to improve the management of scarce
                         water resources in the Pishin Lora Basin (PLB) by reducing the overall impact of the present water crisis. Project activities are designed to recognize the importance of
                         direct participation of water users and other stakeholders. Key indicators include (i) increased surface water availability and reduced groundwater depletion, (ii)
                         increased water productivity through a combination of engineering, management, and agricultural measures, and (iii) expanded local capacity and participation of
                         farmers to implement similar schemes and formulate plans for sustainable water resources development and watershed management.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Despite overall current security challenges in Pakistan as a whole, and Balochistan in particular, there is good and steady progress in project implementation. Therefore, project
                         implementation retains its satisfactory status.

Public Disclosure Copy




                         Given the initial delay of about two years in project implementation, the ongoing activities under the project will not complete by project closing date of June 30, 2013. Therefore at
                         least an additional one year will be required to complete the ongoing activities under the project including completion of two out of the three contracts under Band Khushdil Khan, and
                         feasibility study of the Nari river Basin. Furthermore, there is considerable demand from farmers for rehabilitation of additional irrigation schemes in the project area. Government of
                         Balochistan is to request formally for extension of Loan Closing Date.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.

                         Related Projects
                         There are no related projects.
