Project Development Objectives
Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
The development objective of the Balochistan Small Scale Irrigation Project (BSSIP) is to support efforts by the GoBalochistan to improve the management of scarce
water resources in the Pishin Lora Basin (PLB) by reducing the overall impact of the present water crisis. Project activities are designed to recognize the importance of
direct participation of water users and other stakeholders. Key indicators include (i) increased surface water availability and reduced groundwater depletion, (ii)
increased water productivity through a combination of engineering, management, and agricultural measures, and (iii) expanded local capacity and participation of
farmers to implement similar schemes and formulate plans for sustainable water resources development and watershed management.
Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?
