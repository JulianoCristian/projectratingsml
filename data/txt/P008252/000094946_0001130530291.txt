3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
1 Original Objective:
The project was to assist the Government in creating as rapidly as possible the policy and
irstitutional conditions for the development of an active and responsive labor market.
Specifically, it aimed to establish institutional structures and build in-country experience to: (a)
develop and manage labor market policies thLat support the transition to a market economy; (b)
improve the operation of local labor offices in providing income support and modest
redeployment assistance to the unemployed; and (c) increase the productivity and employability of
the work force through training and small business promotion activities.
3.2 Revised Objective:
Project objectives were not revised.
3.3 Original Components:
Part I: Institutional Development
a. National Labor Policy: designed to strengthen capacity within the MOLSA to develop
national labor policies through: (i) support for strategic planning and management; (ii) improved
collection of labor market information; and (iii) establishment of a Project Coordination Unit
(PCU) monitoring all externally-finded MOLSA activities.
b. Local Institutional Development: designed to improve the operation and management of
ernployment services through: (i) improved efficiency of registration and benefit payment for the
unemployed; and (ii) development of two pilot, full-service local labor offices to focus on
coumseling and job information services, as well as benefit administration.
Part II: Training, Enterprise and Employment Fund
c. The Training, Enterprise and Employment Fund (TEEF): designed to develop a
mechanism  (TEEF) for channeling resources to projects that would encourage flexible,
demand-driven training or promote the creation of small enterprises, targeted toward private
sector job creation for the unemployed. Specific activities that will be eligible for funding include
contract training services, job insertion (on-the-job) training, and small business incubators.
3.3 Revised Components:

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
All project objectives were achieved; however, due to the instability of the political and
civil environment in the country, sustainability of some activities is threatened, particularly
because of MOLSA staff turnover.
The capacity of the MOLSA to develop and manage labor market policies that support the
transition to a market economy was improved. MOLSA and pilot offices implementing labor
market policies benefited from project support through: (i) establishment and strengthening of
additional departments/units (Policy, Information Technology, Public Information); (ii) MOLSA
staff training in functions of a modem labor ministry; (iii) introduction of the concept of active
labor market services and their initial application in two full services labor offices piloted under
the project; (iv) physical rehabilitation of the MOLSA and several branch offices; and (v)
computerization with a Local Area Network (LAN) for the MOLSA and several branch offices.
Operation and management of pilot labor offices was enhanced. Delivery of
unemployment benefits improved at all offices through the introduction of simplified forms for
unemployment benefit payment and more efficient registration of the unemployed.
Five types of active labor programs (e.g., institutional training, on-the-job training, small
business clubs, temporary community employment and small business incubators) which were
piloted through TEEF provided valuable lessons for future development of a national policy of
training of the unemployed in order to facilitate their redeployment. One of the models
(Community Employment) was expanded into a larger scale program implemented by the National
Employment Service (NES), supported by an IDA-financed Rehabilitation Credit.
This ICR assesses project outcomes as satisfactory.
4.2 Outputs by components:
Part I: Institutional Development: Supported (i) the transition to a market economy by
development of appropriate labor policies; and (ii) development of institutions/services at the
national and local levels.
A. National Labor Policy: This component helped the Ministry build its capacity for
planning and management of labor market policies and programs through three sub-components:
(i) development of a strategic plan for the Ministry, together with refinement of its organizational
structure and training for key staff, which assisted development of the National Employment
Service (NES), the new implementing arm of the Ministry; (ii) improved labor market
information; and (iii) establishment of a Project Coordination Unit (PCU).
(i). Strategic Planning and Management: This sub-component provided support to develop a
strategic and organizational plan for the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs.
Specific outputs of this sub-component are:
- 3 -



-.Establishment of a Policy Department in the MOLSA;
-'Development of a strategic plan for the labor sector;
-Computerization of the MOLSA and branch offices and establishment of a Local Area Network
(LAN) for the MOLSA;
-Creation of an Information Technology IJnit in the MOLSA which supports the LAN and
provides appropriate software upgrades;
-Establishment of a Public Information function in the MOLSA.
(ii). Labor Market Information: This sub-component improved monitoring of labor force
activity in the emerging market economy.
Specific outputs of this sub-component are:
-Development of a coding system for job classification by profession;
-Completion of four short-term labor market forecasts;
-E]stablishment of a labor market database.
(iii). Project Coordination Unit (PCU): This sub-component established a PCU to manage
project implementation.
Specific outputs of this sub-component are:
-Establishment of a unit to manage and monitor implementation of the project activities for the
MOLSA.
B. Local Institutional Developmient: This component improved the efficiency of local labor
offices in providing income support and labor re-deployment services to the unemployed. It had
tvo sub-components: (i) improving the efficiency of registration and benefit payment procedures;
and (ii) developing two pilot full-service local labor offices.
(i) Local Registration and Payment of the Unemployed: This sub-component improved the
eificiency of registration and benefit payment procedures in all local offices;
(ii) Local Employment Services: This sub-component developed model techniques and staff
training materials to improve the cost-effectiveness of services at two local pilot labor offices.
Specific outputs of these sub-components are:
-Development of a computerized version of the streamlined unemployment benefit administration
and user manual for unemployment benefits, with piloting in the two pilot labor offices - Tirana
and Korca. This program has been installed in most of the local labor offices;
-I)evelopment and use of a simplified form for employment benefit payment;
-Establishment of two full-service labor offices in Korca and Tirana, equipped with standard office
technology (e.g., computers, faxes), and offering pro-active labor services (job vacancy
information, job matching and referrals, job c'lubs);
-Training carried out for staff of the pilot labor offices in the areas of job counseling, interviewing
techniques and job marketing;
-Development and delivery to 37 labor offices of an occupational classification system;
-4-



-New functions and procedures for office administration in place;
-Computerization of nine regional and 37 district labor offices.
Part II: Training, Enterprise and Employment Fund (TEEF): Ameliorated structural
unemployment, improved productivity and enhanced labor force mobility.
A. TEEF: This component developed a mechanism for channeling resources to projects
that would encourage and facilitate development of flexible, demand-driven training programs and
promoted the creation of small enterprises.
Specific outputs of this component are:
-Establishment of a Tripartite Board and a Management Unit to administer the Training,
Enterprise and Employment Fund. Criteria were established for selection of sub-projects to be
financed under this Fund. The Board was established to approve grants. Five types of active
labor programs were operated under the project: (i) Job-insertion Training; (ii) Institutional
Training; (iii) Business Clubs; (iv) Small Business Incubators; and (v) Community Job Creation;
-Job-insertion (on-the-job training) activities: Training of unemployed persons as factory workers
on the job; 9007 unemployed trained; 198 sub-projects completed; and post-training employment
rate of75%;
-Establishment of business clubs in six cities: Mechanism providing opportunity for people
interested in entrepreneurial activities to meet with key business leaders on a regular basis. This
activity ceased to function during the civil unrest of 1997, and has not resumed;
-Institutional training activities: Training of unemployed in specific skills in a classroom setting;
Training was carried out in four major areas: personal service/cosmetology, construction, food
and beverage, and garment/textiles. The post-training employment rate of participants has
remained relatively high - 40%;
-Small Business Incubators: Rehabilitated and equipped two sites - in Tirana and Shkodra - which
provided training and office space to emerging small businesses. These incubators currently house
100 former unemployed persons. Project support involved rehabilitation of sites, equipping and
training of management staff and selection of small businesses to be located on the premises.
Currently, 20 businesses are active in the Tirana incubator, and 30 are active in Shkodra;
-Community Job Creation: Piloted in early 1998, this activity involved local communities
submitting proposals for funding to undertake public services and infrastructure projects within
the community, e.g., village roads, water drains, minor refurbishment of schools. This pilot
activity is now being implemented on a broader scale by the NES through Government funds.

4.5 Institutional development impact:
Improved legislative and policy framework emerged as a by-product of the project.
I)uring project implementation, several major acts regulating labor markets and industrial relations
were developed and adopted by the Parliament, including revision of the labor code. Another
by-product was the establishment of the National Employment Services (NES) as a labor market
policy implementation agency, semi- autonomous from the MOLSA. The NES was not an
objective or an activity of the project. However, it was developed as a result of the exposure of
MOLSA staff to different organizational models through their training experiences financed
thlrough the project.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control ofgovernment or implementing agency:
1997 Civil Crisis. The project implementation period--January 1994 to June 1999--was
marked by enormous turmoil in Albania. The year 1996 - the second year of project
implementation - saw macroeconomics backsliding, increased political instability, and the
mushrooming of fraudulent pyramid schemes. The collapse of these pyramid schemes in late 1996
and early 1997 triggered massive civil umrest: arms were looted from military barracks,
government buildings were dlestroyed, banks were robbed and burned, and the
Government--which defacto lost control of most of the country--was forced to resign. All travel
to Albania was suspended, which impacted on the on-going supervision of LMDP (almost a year
of' supervision was lost due to this crisis).
During the social unrest, somne of the regional and district labor offices were damaged and
looted. The damage was estimated by the MOLSA at US$400,000.
As security gradually improved, a new Government, which was elected in June 1997,
quickly focused on restoring macroeconomic stability and putting the country back on track to
economic growth. Overall, the 1997 crisis caused a significant, albeit temporary, setback for
project implementation, reflected in a decline in project disbursements.
5.2 Factors generally subject to governmnent control:
Intense politicization of the Government led to frequent changes in the MOLSA
leadership. Six Ministers were chalnged during the project implementation period. These changes
brought additional instability and adversely affected the project because each Minister would bring
his/her own advisors and it would take some time before they would get acquainted with the
project. With each change in the M'OLSA's leadership, many of the staff trained under the
project, both in the MOLSA and in its local branch offices, were removed or pushed out of their
positions for political reasons.
-6 -



For most of the project life, the MOLSA did not provide sufficient attention and support
to the management of the PCU, and even used PCU staff for activities in other parts of the
MOLSA.
The Ministry was also reluctant, at times, to assume responsibility for implementation of project
activities, which contributed to the poor performance of the PCU. In addition, the Government
was slow in resolving land ownership issues which delayed civil works rehabilitation aspects of
the project.
5.3 ractors generally subject to implementing agency control:
Support for PCU management and administration was continuously weak. This hindered
the completion of particular project components and utilization of project funds. This situation
improved in 1998, and consequently, the performance of the PCU improved imnmensely,
contributing to successful accomplishment of the project's objectives.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
Total project cost was estimated at US$6.0 million equivalent at appraisal, with an IDA
Credit of US$5.4 million, a Government contribution in value of US$0.3 million, and another
donor contribution of US$0.3 million (donor unspecified). The US$ equivalent amount of the
Credit was increased by about US$200,000 because of exchange rate changes between SDR and
the US Dollar over the course of the project. It was anticipated that the Government contribution
would be achieved by the end of the project. However, the additional donor contribution was
never realized.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
This was, to a large extent, a pilot project, designed to build awareness, within the
Government of Albania, to the concept of labor market policies and build its institutional capacity.
It was believed that through technical assistance, training of the MOLSA staff, piloting
full-service labor offices, computerization of the MOLSA and its branch offices, and exploration
of innovative active labor policies for the unemployed, the MOLSA would then be able to find
mechanisms and solutions for the design and implementation of labor market policies that would
work best in Albania in the long term.
Several of the project's activities have sustained. The new departments and units within the
MOLSA have been sustained and some of the staff trained during the life of the project, have
continued working. The project succeeded in computerizing the MOLSA and labor offices. The
two pilot labor offices in Tirana and Korca continue to provide services. Some of the active labor
programs, including the Incubators that were established in Tirana and Shkodra are continuing.
However, sustainabilty remains an issue for several of the project's activities. The Policy
and Planning function of the MOLSA has not sustained, as almost all the staff trained in this area
have left the Ministry. Some equipment which was damaged and/or stolen during the civil unrest,
has not been replaced. Business clubs were forced to suspend activities after March 1997, when it
- 7 -



became dangerous for businessmen to have a high profile in the community. These clubs have not
resumed activities. The Government is considering transferring the payment of unemployment
benefit to the Social Insurance Institute that collects contributions from which this benefit is paid.
TEEF, which was originally envisaged to sustain, closed once the funds provided from the project
were exhausted. The training is now provided through the National Employment Service.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
N/A
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7. 1 Lending:
Bank staff assisted the Government in the identification and preparation of the project.
Bank staff appraised the project thoroughly. The project objectives were concrete and consistent
with the countryls needs at that time and the Government's strategy to respond to them. The
objectives were also consistent with IDA's Country Assistance Strategy.
7.2 Supervision:
Bank supervision was professional. The project benefited from 129.6 staff weeks of
supervision of the components and their activities. In addition to the Mission Leader, supervision
mlnissions included Labor and Employment Specialists, Procurement Specialists and local Project
Officers who provided assistance to the Government in implementing the project's components
and monitoring the activities. There were no noticeable deviations from IDA policies and
procedures on financial management, procurement and disbursement.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
Overall, Bank performance is assessed as satisfactory. The Credit was processed in adherence
to a set schedule, in an effort to make an effective contribution to Albania's social and economic
development during the initial period of economic transition.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
Project preparation was Bank-led. This was to be expected given the thinness of domestic
capacity after decades of isolation. Nonetheless, cooperation was satisfactory and there was
willingness to learn.
7.5 Government implementation peiformance:
-8 -



Despite political uncertainties and frequent changes in the MOLSA leadership, the
Government stayed committed to implementing the components and meeting the project's
objectives. However, institutional weaknesses and later on, social and political turmoil, caused
some delays in project implementation and led to its extension by one year.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
Project implementation was weak during the first phase of project start-up because the
MOLSA was unfamiliar with mechanisms of international financing. However, with staff training
and some external technical assistance, performance improved. During 1996, the country
experienced increasing instability and rise of pyramid schemes. Civil unrest of 1997, coupled with
changes in Government and MOLSA leadership, had a negative impact on project
implementation, and progress lagged. During the last year of the project, a new PCU Director
took charge and implementation improved substantially.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Overall, Borrower performance can be assessed as satisfactory. Though the country was
going through a period of political instability and turmoil, most of the project objectives were
achieved.
8. Lessons Learned
This project has significance for other projects that are initiated with limited resources,
implemented in an environment of political and civil instability, weak government and institutions,
collapsing state enterprises, large informal sectors, and little experience with market economies.
1.    Dealing with instability: Institutional development resources and related technical
assistance, need to be designed and implemented in a manner that can continue development in
unstable environments. The transfer of ideas and concepts is labor intensive and technical
assistance, including staff training, will not have the desired impact if management and staff
change often.
2.    Policies and institutions: Complex institutional development models and policies that
may be common in OECD and EU countries should be introduced gradually in accordance with
the country's capacity for absorption.
3.    Financing and sustainability: While the TEEF fund and activities were quite successfiul,
the sustainability of TEEF is in question because the Government did not provide any portion of
the initial financing. All project activities should contain some element of Government financing to
ensure sustainability once the project is completed.
4.    Expectations: The Government and the Bank need to have realistic expectations about
institutional development and project impact. They sometimes agree to pilot activities and then,
as the project progresses, look for more impact than can reasonably be expected. Initial
limitations in project design and resources should be understood at the outset by all concerned
-9-



and there should be more commitment to fol:low-up by both the Bank and Government on
components that are successful.
5     Project Management: Wh.ile sufficient initial staff and technical assistance were assigned
al; the outset, the MOLSA did not give sufficient support to the unit, staff were used for other
tasks, and there was significant turnover of management during the project. To the degree
possible, PCU staff should be professional and assigned in a manner that protects them, as much
as possible, from political influence. The PCU should also have access to the MOLSA
management.
9. Partner Comments
(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
Achievements of Objectives
1.    Support strategic planning and management of public employment services
1. In 1995 is passed the Employment Promotion Law and National Employment Service (NES) is
operating under this law. In January 1998 is approved the statute of NES and in February 11,
1 999 by the Council of Ministers are approved five related Decisions as following:
-Employment Promotion program for unemployed jobseekers
Registering of unemployed jobseekers
-Licensing and operating of private eniployment agencies
-Employment Promotion Program through on-job training
-Employment Promotion Program through supporting of institutional training
II.   Improve collection of labor market iinformation
2. AMU/FAS Consultants supported a computerized application of the job matching system
designed and installed in the Regional Labor Offices. Also they completed the initial staff
training. Also are organized several study tours and training of local office staff of NES.
3. The first short term forecast of labor market in Albania is conducted for the last quarter of
1995 with technical assistance of AMU. It is done periodically during 1996, but during civil
unrest of spring 1997 it was interrupted. The last effort to do a short term forecast for labor
market in Albania is realized in the second half of 1998 and it is finished for the last quarter of that
year. During 1999 is not done any thing like this because of the shortage of staff in statistical
department of NES.
4. The data for rural areas completely lacking because it is assumed that the people in villages
have some land and they are self employed. There is no employment service in rural area.
III.  Improve efficiency of registration and unemployment benefit payment
5. There exist thirty-six local labor offices and almost all of them are computerized. In January
- 10-



-June 1999 the local employment offices have placed in job 6,210 persons. With exception of the
community works program, other types of active labor market programs are limited. For
example, in January-June 1999, 2381 persons were trained by training centers of the NES.
IV.   Develop two pilot, full service local labor offices to focus on counseling and job
information services, as well as benefit administration
6. Employment services are still state services. There is only one request for a private
employment office which is on the approval way. Two pilot full services labor offices are
developed. One of them is in Korca and the other in Tirana. Both of labor offices offer full
services on employment such as counseling and job information services. During 1998-1999
period two labor offices in Tirana and Korca are equipped completely with office equipment and
computers, 12 of them are recently bought.
V.    Build the capacity of public employment services to cope with the rapidly increasing
unemployment, including automation of registration of the unemployed in regional labor
offices
7. Until the end of 1999 would be implemented 105 Community Works Projects. They are on
average 3 months projects and it is foreseen that they would employ 10, 000 unemployed persons.
The state budged for 1999 intended for Community Works Project is 200 million lek. The total
number of approved projects is 691, and the 622 of them are finished. The rest is foreseen to
finish till September 15, 1999.
8. There are 36 local labor offices and almost all of them are computerized. Three of them.
Tirana, Elbasan and Korca labor offices are linked in a Local area network in the framework of
the LMD project. It is expected to raise the quality of employment data and the level of services
in those offices.
9. Total staff in NES now stands at 781, with 155 of this staff in the seven training centers
operated by NES. Seven training centers are placed as following: 2 in Tirana, and one in
Shkodra, Elbasan, Vlora, Korca and Durres.
VI.   Prepare legal framework for market oriented employment benefit (supported by
ILO)
10. In 1999 was approved the first Promotion Employment Law and 1999 and amendment of the
first one is approved. The changes between them consist on the Community works. They did not
have to do with the way of calculation of unemployed benefit. It still continue to be based on the
inflation rate, number of dependents, etc.
TRAINING, ENTERPRISE AND EMPLOYMENT FUND (TEEF)
VII)  Encourage demand-driven training
- 11 -



11. With the Government Decision Nr. 220, dated 10 May 1993 was established "Training,
Enterprise and Employment Fund" in order to encourage demand-driven-training in Albania. In
this context was approved the TEEF stature with determined strict criteria for sub-projects to be
disbursed by TEEF.
12. Institutional training occurred in four major areas: personal service/cosmetology,
construction, food and beverage and garmnent/textiles. There are completed 31 sub-projects, and
1 166 unemployed person are been trained. The percentage of these trainees subsequently
employed is 40%, which is 15% above the original target of 25%. TEEF has served as a
mechanism for channeling public resources to sub-projects that encourage and facilitate adult
training and employment.
13. Demand-driven was organized in different categories of sub-projects to be financed by TEEF
such as: a) Job-Insertion b) Job-Creation and Self-employment (with two sub-categories) a)
Business clubs; b) Business incubators and Training (with one sub-category) - Institutional
Training. From the beginning of the activity till now TEEF have executed 275 sub-projects in all
above mentioned categories.
VIII) Promote the creation of small enterprises targeted towards private sector
job-creation for the unemployed
14. TEEF resources were used to purchase employment and training services from any provider,
public or private, including enterprises, that offer training, meeting the procurement criteria of the
TEEF.
15. As about Job-Insertion TEEF Executive Committee and TEEF Board of Trustees established
strict criteria for private or public employers to participate. In this activity TEEF has executed
198 sub-projects. The number of unemployed people that have participated in these sub-projects
is 9007 persons. The percentage of the people been employed after these sub-projects are
finished is 80% of the participants or 7187 unemployed persons.
:. 6. Job-Creation activity began in December 1996 in order to support development of labor
market in rural and poor areas of Albania. The project was based in sub-projects been proposed
by Comnmunes administration or N'GOs operating in rural areas or poor small cities. In this
activity TEEF executed 53 sub-projects and 3200 persons from the laminly in social assistance
scheme are been employed in these sub-projects. The average duration of sub-projects was tree
rnonths.
17. TEEF resources were used to purchase training services from any provider, public or private
including Training Institutions that were offering training services. Under Institutional Training
component TEEF has executed 24 sub-projects and 2000 unemployed people participated these
sub-projects. After the completition of the projects 40% of the participants were unemployed.
IK)   Develop contract training services, job insertion training
- 12 -



18. In addition to the fund endowment this project has provided technical assistance in three
broad areas: a) final design of the fund framework; b) Developments of the model contracts for
job-insertion, institutional training and job-creation; c) preparation of business plans for
incubators.
19. The standard contracts were part of each sub-project with all detailed elements. There are
developed 275 contracts (3 to 6 months) in total with 275 beneficiaries.
X)    Develop small business incubators: establish small business clubs or associations
20. Two Business incubators are established. One is established in Tirana and the other one in
Shkodra city. Tirana business incubator has 20 units in operation been managed by the
unemployed people. In Tirana business Incubator there are employed about 100 former
unemployed people. Shkodra business incubator is established in the Shkodra city. About 22
business units are ready to begin there. The equipment for Shkodra incubator is procured and it is
going toward the beginning of the activity. About 150 persons are waiting to be employed there.
21. The Board of Trustees decided that the business incubators would be self-financed units.
They will be directed by a three partite board: a) state - represented by NES, b) trade unions, c)
employers.
XI.   Establish a Pilot Training Center; make financial assistance available to training
institutions
22. There are seven training centers managed by NES. It was planned to have one pilot center in
Vlora and it began to be completed as an objective of LMD project. During civil unrest of 1997 it
was completely destroyed. During 1999 it was rehabilitated completely with NES funds and now
it works as a model training center.
23. Number of total persons trained in all seven training centers in a year is 6,000 in seven major
areas: cosmetodology, auto-service, English language, secretary, catering, tailoring, computer.
The average cost per trained person is 10.515 lek.
XII. Adapt the international occupational and industry coding to the Albanian context
24. Under the consultancy of FAS Consultants in the mid 1995 was produced a reference book
containing 4,200 job titles. This has been produced in two parts. Part 1 contains the occupations
in Major Group order and Part 2 contains the occupations in alphabetic order. A smaller manual
containing 450 "most common"v titles was produced in co-operation with local labor offices in
Korca and Tirana.
25. The industry code NACE is translated and a list of the industry codes, identified by a two
digit code (adapted to the Albanian context) has been produced and is printed in the abridged
version of the occupational classification.
