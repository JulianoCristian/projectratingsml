The project conveys significant\n            lessons for countries with limited resources, and under\n            political, and civil instability: 1) unstable environments -\n            particularly because of political, and transition situations\n            - can not provide the desired impact if management, and\n            staff change continuously, therefore, institutional\n            development, resources, and technical assistance requires to\n            be designed, and implemented, to appropriately transfer\n            labor intensive concepts, and succeed. Furthermore, complex\n            institutional policies, need to be introduced gradually, in\n            accordance to the country's absorption capacity; 2)\n            regardless of successful funding activities - such as the\n            Training, Enterprise and Employment Fund's - it is\n            critical that government financing be included, to ensure\n            sustainability following completion; 3) project design, and\n            resources, often reflect adequate expectations about project\n            impact, but both the Bank, and the Government sometimes\n            agree to pilot activities as the project progresses, which\n            diverts realistic expectations.
