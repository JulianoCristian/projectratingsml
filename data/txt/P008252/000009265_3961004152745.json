"During its transition from a command to\n            a market economy, the Albanian government's overriding\n            concern has been coping with an umemployment crisis. The top\n            priorities are to administer minimum income support measures\n            efficiently and equitably, and to begin to support the\n            unemployed; in their job search and training efforts. This\n            project will assist the government to create the policy and\n            institutional conditions for the development of an active\n            and responsive labor market. The components of the project\n            are: institutional development, both national and local,\n            designed to develop labor policies; and the training,\n            enterprises, and employment fund designed to develop a\n            mechanism for channeling resources to projects to encourage\n            flexible, demand driven training or promote the creation of\n            small enterprises in the private sector for job creation.\n            The project will lay the groundwork for the development of\n            active labor markets in Albania; minimize the social cost of\n            the transition; initiate delivery of services to help the\n            unemployed; and provide a framework for providing public\n            resources and external aid to private sector and community\n            based organizations offering services to the unemployed;."}, "docdt": "1993-08-18T00:00:00Z"}
