MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CPEDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF uHINA
FOR AN INFECTIOUS AND ENDEMIC DISEASE CONTROL PROJECT
1.          I submit for your approval the following memorar.-lum and
recommendation on a proposed development credit to the People's Republic of China
for SDR 95.9 million, the equivalent of US$129.6 million, on standard IDA terms
with a maturity of 35 years to help finance a project for control of tuberculosis
and schistosomiasis. An amount of SDR 94.42 million from the credit would be
onlent to the project provinces at no interest, repayable over 20 years,
including a 10-year grace period. The provinces would assume the foreign
exchange risk for foreign costs and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) would assume
the risk for local costs. The provinces would pay a commitment fee of 0.5
percent p.a. and a service charge of 1 percent p.a. to the 1OF. The Ministry of
Public Health (MOPH) would receive SDR 1.48 million under arrangements which are
substantially the same as a budgetary transfer.
2.          Background.  China's significant accomplishments an the health sector
are well recognized internationally. The Bank's health sector report./, while
not disputing that most indicators of China's health status remained highly
favorable by international standards, questioned certain aspects of current
sector policy and practice. It found that constrained public health funding in
the 1980s and a new emphasis on "payment-for-service" threatened to erode the
previous decades' achievements against ^ommunicable diseases and could miscarry
the chance to put prevention first in the coming battle against rapidly rising
numbers of chronic disease cases (cancer, heart disease, etc.). Progress against
two communicable diseases -- tuberculosis and schistosomiasis -- stagnated in the
1980s, in large part because of the changes in the financial system.
Tuberculosis killed 380,000 Chinese in 1989, is the largest single cause of adult
death and most severely affects the poorest communities. Schistosomiasis has
increased in endemicity with 1.5 million people infected in 1989 and about 40
million at risk. Acute infections have risen sharply and remarkable past gains
against the disease are in danger of being eroded. Health services for these
diseases have become less effective in some areas, and have not been accessible
to some segments of the population because of cost. Moreover, the relative
reduction of public financing for health means that most health institutions
today face fixed cost deficits and must earn income sufficient to cover these as
well as provide operational funds.  This has encouraged provision of more
diagnostic and expensive therapeutic services aimed at insured, primarily urban,
residents. Disease prevention activities, and poorer and remote populations,
have been relatively neglected in the patterns of spending which have emerged.
3.          Project Objectives.  The proposed project is designed to reinstate
public financing for control of tuberculosis and schistosomiasis, to improve
efficiency of these services and to remove financial barriers to their diagnosis
and treatment.
9/    The Bank's sector report entitled "China, Long Term Issues and Options
in the Health Transition", Report 7965-CHA, dated June 25, 1990 and
distributed to the Board on July 18, 1990, explores health sector
financing and its implications in detail.



- 2 -
4.          Project Description.  -he project would support the niational
tuberculosis control program through the provincial tuberculosis programs in
twelve provinces!/, the main parts of the national schistosomiasis control
program in the eight endemic provinces?/ and essential operational research and
capacity building for program implementation and for prevention of other
infectious diseases. The tuberculosis component would be implemented in
accordance with an agreed Tuberculosis Policv Package of administrative,
technical and financial measures, including free diagnosis and treatment of
infectious patients. The schistosomiasis component would be carried out in
accordance with an agreed Schistosomiasis Policy Statement to improve efficiency
and emphasize morbidity control through chemotherapy rather than the previous
approach which mainly relied on environmental controls and aimed at snail
eradication. A small, centrally-implemented program of research on alternatives
for improving surveillance and control of other key infectious diseases (6e:ually
transmitted diseases and hepatitis) would also be supported.
5.          Project Implementation.  The MOPH departments responsible for
infectious and endemic diseases would manage their components. Overall
implementation of the project would be coordinated by the Foreign Loan Office of
MOPH which is experienced in managing IDA health projects. The provinces
participating in the project would implement their schistosomiasis or
tuberculosis control components through their provincial health bureaus. Total
project cost is estimated to be $271.0 million. The credit would finance about
48 percent of total cost. A breakdown of project costs and the financing plan
are shown in Schedule A. To ensure that disease control programs can begin early
in 1992, up to USS5 million in expenditures after September 30, 1991 for eligible
items procured in accordance with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines, would be
retroactively financed. Urgently needed, initial drug stocks and microscopes
will be procured under contracts awarded before January 31, 1992, up to an
aggregate of US$5 million equivalent, to the lowest priced quotations obtained
from at least three eligible suppliers under procedures acceptable to IDA.
Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement
schedube are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events
and the status of Bank Group operations in China are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 9894-CHA, dated November 15, 1991
is being distributed separately.
6.          Project Sustainability.  Cost of continuing the tuberculosis programs
after the project would add about 1 percent to the present annual levels of
provincial budgetary spending for health services. These costs will decline over
time. Provinces are expected to favor continuation of the programs because of
the large number of lives which can be saved and the poverty reduccion impact.
Continuing the schistosomiasis control strategy after the project is estimated to
cost a third less than currently budgeted costs and endemic provinces are
expected to want to continue the strategy as the disease will inevitably return
if control is neglected.
t/    The provinces are:  Gansu, Guangdong, Hainan, Hebei, Heilongjiang,
Hubei, Hunan, Liaoning, Ningxia, Shandong, Sichuan and Xinjiang.
!/    The endemic provinces are five in the lake regions (Hubei, Hunan,
Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu), plus parts of Zhejiang, and two provinces in
the mountainous region (Sichuan and Yunnan).

7.          IDA's Previous Work and Lessons Learned.  Two health sector reports
and tt.ree projects under implemertation!/ have provided the government and IDA
with a good health sector development dialogue. Experience on each of the
projects has been good. Lessons learned have included the need to agree on the
details of equipment purchases to ensure suitability, to provide technical
assistance for key activities, to finance operational research to improve
strategy and implementation methods, and to plan carefully for recurrent costs.
As provincial governments have demonstrated increasing independence and take.n on
greater responsibilities the need for specific agreements with them has become
apparent, especially to confirm their commitment to substantial administrative
and financial reforms. The proposed project includes elements to deal with each
of these lessons.
8.          R_ationale for IDA Involvement.  IDA involvement has been catalytic to
China's examination and reorientation of the disease control strategies for
tuberculosis and schistosomiasis. Preparation efforts provided China with access
to the most recent technical advances and assistance from the World Health
Organization. The potential of IDA financing for drugs, equipment, technical
assistance and research was critical to introducing the new financial and
technical policies. IDA funding for key drug supplies closed an otherwise
unaffordable gap for local governments and for patients. The new strategies for
the tuberculosis and schistosomiasis programs should substantially improve health
conditions for a large segment of China's population. The human and economic
consequences of the two diseases give the project a strong anti-poverty focus
which makes it a priority for IDA funding. The diseases do not have a gender
bias and, with the removal of financial barriers to diagnosis and treatment,
women and men should benefit equally from the project.
9.          Agreed Actions.  To overcome the key issues impeding control of
tuberculosis and schistosomiasis the government has agreed to: (a) ensure that
tuberculosis component provinces implement a Tuberculosis Policy Package; (b)
ensure that schistosomiasis component provinces implement their programs in
accordance with the Schistosomiasis Policy Statement; (c) ensure that the
provinces use only niclosamide as an acceptable molluscicide for the
schistosomiasis control program; (d) establish, in cooperation with the Special
Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases, a Joint Research
Management Committee for overseeing operational research on schistosomiasis; (e)
annually provide for IDA's review, the proposed research activities for other key
infectious diseases; and (f) make the proceeds of the credit available to the
MOPH and to the provinces (and to subsidiary levels of government and health
institutions), on terms and conditions acceptable to the Association.
10.         Project Benefits.  For tuberculosis, the project would sharply
increase the cure rate of smear-positive patients in participating provinces from
less than 50 to over 90 percent, and improve the case detection rate from about
t/    The Rural Health and Medical Education Project (Crelit 1472) started in
1984 and will be complete by the end of 1991; the Rural Health and
Preventive Medicine Project (Credit 1713 and Loan 2723) started in 1986
and is largely completed except for component B, Vaccine Production,
which will run until 1995. The Integrated Regional Health Development
Project (Credit 2009) initiated activities in early 1990 and is
progressing satisfactorily.



35 to 70 percent. As a net result of the project, about 1 million lives will be
saved from premature death due to tuberculosis and a similar number of new
infectious cases will be prevented. Patients, their families and communities
will directly benefit from avoidance of illness, death and preservation of
productive capacity. The project will significantly lower the risk of
tuberculosis infection.
11.         For schistosomiasis, the project would: (a) decrease the prevalence
of infection in the population in endemic areas by about 40 percent, reducing the
number of paticnts from about 1.5 mi'.lion in 1989 to approximately 0.9 million in
1996; (b) decrease the prevalence of infection in cattle and water buffalo by
about 40 percent, thereby reducing transmissior of the disease; and (c) decrease
the snail infection rate and the density of infected snails in the high
transmission areas, thus also reducing the transmission of infection. Fewer
acute and advanced cases, most of which occur among working adults (aged 20 to 60
years), will yield direct economic benefits, mainly in poor rural areas. Disease
prevalence will be brought down to a levE'. at which an affordable maintenance
strategy would be appropriate by the end of the project.
12.         Risks.  For tuberculosis, the main risk is that technical and
financial changes introduced by the project are not fully implemented. Project
documents and MOPH policies require commitment by project provinces to implement
the Tuberculosis Policy Package as a condition of participation in the project to
guard against this risk. Careful supervision of the provinces by MOPH with
frequent (quarterly) reporting by provinces of actual results will allow targeted
assistance and supervision to manage any slow compliance with the Tuberculosis
Policy Package.
13.         The major risks for the schistosomiasis component are that further
prevalence reductions in areas of very low prevalence may be difficult to
achieve, and the strategy of morbidity control through chemotherapy may require
time to fully implement as it requires changes in control measures and staff
practices and increased cooperation of the population in endemic areas. To
counter these risks, MOPH and the project documents require provinces to adopt
the revised strategy. The project includes a substantial operational research
effort to improve technical approaches. Project design also increases attention
to monitoring and surveillance. Health education programs are included in the
project for specific risk groups such as farmers, fishermen, people living on
boats, and school children to encourage their greater participation in
chemotherapy. Use of the revised chemotherapy strategy to populations and areas
subjected to floods will provide the best protection against new infection
outbreaks and new areas of endemicity.
14.         Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
