INTERNATIONAL DEVELOFIENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTCRS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA FOR AN AGRICULTURE CREDIT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to $10.5
million to the Republic of Korea for an agriculture credit project.
PART'I - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
2,        Korea has received seven IDA credits amounting to $80.0 million
arnd seven Bank loans amounting to $227.5 million.  The disbursed amount,
$3.1 million IDA credit No. S-4 KO of $3.5 million for highway studies and
engineering w,as refinanced under a subsequent Bank loan of $54.5 million for
highway construction (No. 769-KO); the balance of the IDA credit was can-
celled.  Total Bank Group lending to Korea, taking this refinancing and
cancellation into account, is thus $304 million. The largest share, $134.2
million, has gone to the transport sector - $79.7 million for railways and
$54.5 million for highways. The Korea Development Finance Corporation (KDFC)
has received $55 million in Bank loans for relending to private industry.
The balance of the Bank Group's past lending is accounted for by $100 million
for irrigation and livestock and $14.8, million for education. A statement of
Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments is given as Annex I.
3.        Of the total Bank Group lending of $304.0 million, almost $215
million remained undisbursed as of March 31, 1971. This is explained in
large part by the fact that withdrawals under several of the large loans made
within the past 1½ years are only now beginning and in part by the small
volume of disbursements, as yet, under a 1969 loan of $45 million for the
Pyongtaek-Kumgang Irrigation Project. The original borrower under this pro-
ject, the Union of Land Improvements Association, was dissolved shortly after
the loan was made and replaced by the Agricultural Development Corporation.
It also took longer than expected to employ consultants to supervise the
execution of the project.  The project consequently fell about a year behind
schedule, but is now well under way and may be completed within the original
timetable. The first education project was also slow in getting started
because of delays in organizing the project team but is now progressing
satisfactorily.
4.        IFO has made four investments in Korea and its holdings amount to
$8.1 million in loans and shares. T;e latest of these, made last year, was
an investment of about $0.7 million aq.iivalent in the shares of the Korean
irnvestment and Finance Corporation - a new institution which will assist in
the development of the capital and money markets. Further investment
possibilities are being investigated.

VAR^tZ. ,,;. , ECOQNOMY
5.        A report e6ititid "the Economic situation and ProsDects of
the Republic of Korea" (tAP-Ž5a, dated September 13, .971) was dir-
culated to the Execu'ti'Ve Dfiebtor.s and members of the Consultative
Group oh Septembe? 17t, 97;.. Country data are in ALnnex I.
6.        Korea complted it's second hiVe Year Elan in 1971 with an
impressive record of'e¢ohta'omic glo(rth.  In the latter half of the 1960's,
GNP, in real terms, ifi& bAt6d at-ah Ainual rate of more than U  percent;
per capitA income, iih-ihh t6s6  by about 7½ percent per annum thiroughout
the last decade, reached i i5bl of $258 by the end of 1971.   Industriali-
zation and exports played a lading role in Korea'.s economic progress
together with -apid eXp'afio6h 6t the infrastructure.  Agricultural out-
put rose satisfacto'riiy by inte±tintional comparisons at an average of
3 - 4 percent per afiWim but w"6 far Out-distanced by industry. A pro-
gressively diversified itidatfital sector is now the prominent feature
of an economy which WAs laargely ag idultiiNl at the beginning of the
sixties.  In thf pioces8 uh6eployme6it fell from about 10 percent in the
early sixties to 6 or 5 peib'cnt today.  Unexiploymernt in agriculture has
been sharply reduced, in jtift because of the drift of labor towards
urban indus triai Afes&   .
7.        The rapid gro&6th ih output. was accoipanied by a marked decline
in the population gt'6oth iate fr6m nearly 3 percent a year in 1960 to
less than 2 percent at t&'66i6t As a result of an active family planning
program and a populatioft fzd6ptif  to birth limitation.
8.        Rapid ecothomic. go Wth has c6ntributed to the econdmic welfare
of the populaition as.a wh 61.  Iid6Me differences between rich and the
poor may be larger thAn they were a d'ecade ago but the living conditions
of the poor have beeh gIe&tly improved with the sharp drop in unemploy-
ment, the large increase in labor productivity and an accompanying rise
in wage rates, the growth ,at the 6ff-tarti income of small farmers, and
the rise of farm pric'es o'er the last few years.
9.        The impz'esiMe..econbmic groWth of the last 10 years, however,
has not been achieved without dost. .Continuous inflation, an increasing
balance of payments d6ticit, heavy external indebtedness, and a relative
lag in agriculture are 6o6Me ot th6 maladjustments associated with rapid
development.  The GoveznxtiAnt intends to concentrate its efforts during the
next few years on coriecting these maladjustments as iell as adapting the
economy and the balance dt payments to the effects of the progressive with-
drawal of U.S. troops tfr6  Koiea ahd of Korean troops from Vietnam.
10.       The riin, objectives of the Third Five Year Plan (1972-76) are
to effect structural changes in agridclture and industry and to achieve
a large increase in 6Xports within a relatively stable financial frame-
work and a manageable balance of payments. The Government intends to pur-
sue restrained investenht policies and to hold the rate of growth to an
average of 8.6 percent pbr annum. This year's growth rate is likely to be



down to the plan level or perhaps below it, without significant adverse
effects on employment. Korea faces internal financial problems associated
with slower growth for businesses which have been geared to high growth
rates and expectations; further, inflation persists despite this year's
slower economic pace. The export picturo, however, cocntinues to be bright
as ambitious targets are so far being reached despite international res-
trictions on textile exports. Nevertheless, investent outlays are still
large and imports are so far running ahead of plan levels. *Even after the
impressive gains in savings to the level of 15 percent of GNP in 1971
(compared to about one-half of this rate in the mid-1960's) a wide gap
will remain between savings and investment. This gap will have to be met
by external finance.
11.       The Government is fully aware of the difficulties which it faces.
It.a problem now is to steer a course in the short term Which will enable it
to achieve a reasonable degree of stability without adversely affecting the
chances of reaching the targeted growth rates for the Plan period. A new
economic team has recently come into office and is reviewing the alterna-
tives; some steps have already been taken - these include a further adjust-
ment of the exchange rate following last year's devaluation and the intro-
diction of measures to encourage import substitution. A Bank economic
mi.vsion is scheduled to visit Korea this summer to review and discuss these
policies with the Government.
PART III - BANK STRATEY
12.       In the short term, even if the Government succeeds in its policies
of restraint, Korea will undoubtedly require increased amounts of external
capital. In this context, prudent debt management wil be crucial. The
Government is attempting to meet its foreign exchange requirements with
less reliance on short term borrmwings than in the past. The debt service
ratio is about 21 percent and is not expected to increase much beyond this
during the n'ext few years, provided the Government continues to limit short-
term borrowing. Korea has the capacity to continue to sustain further debt
On conventional terms. However, the difficult balance of payments situa-
tion, and Korea's low per capita income, make it appropriate that some of
the assistance it receives from the Bank Group should be an IDA terms.
13.       In support of the Government's attempt to redress the imbalance
between agriculture and industry, the Bank Group's lending strategy aims
at supporting agricultural developuent. We will also support education and
help to modernise and expand infrastructure. Projects under Bank Group
consideration in these Sectors have small foreign exchange elements. In
spite of a commendable savings effort, there remains a gap between savings
and investmnt, which cannot be entirely covered by financing the foreign
currency component of high priority projects. In these circumstances same
local expenditure financing is appropriate. Many of the projects with a
large foreign exchange component are in private indlustry and financed
from private sources and export credit agencies. The Bank Group itself is
helping industry through its support of the Korea Development Finance



Corporation. Support for another development finance company,, the Korea
Development Bank, is now under consideration, and the Bank Group is also
looking-for ways to support industry directly. Operations being prepared
for the next fiscal year include a fourth loan for railways development,
a further loan to KDFC, and lending for education, tourism, and port
development projects.
PART IV - THE FROJECT
THE AGRICULTURAL SECTCR
14.       Agriculture provides a livelihood for about half of the popula-
tion of 32 million, but contributes only about 28 percent to GNP. The
country is rugged and mountainous, with forests covering over two-thirds
of the land area. Because of the generally poor quality of the.timber
and the inaccessibility of much.of the forest land, forestry contributes
little to value added in agriculture. Daring.and after the.Korean War
mny of the hills were stripped to provide fuel, and the.Government has
undertaken a program of reforestation which has been quite-successful;
this was, however, directed at controlling soil erosion and. not. timber
production. The fishery industry, though.relatively small, earns an
appreciable amount of foreign exchange, and significant efforts have been
made to modernize the coastal and deep-sea fishing fleets-. The average
farm size is less than one hectare; and most farming is not commercially
oriented. Roughly half' of the total cultivated area produces more than.
one crop each year, as a result of inter-planting and double.cropping.
Livestock production has increased substantially during the past five years,
and the Government is upgrading the quality of beef and dairy herds through
cattle imports and fattening programs.
15.       Total gross public and private investment during the Third Plan
is estimated at 4.,525 billion Won ($12 billion)., of which 536, billion Won
($1.4 billion) has been allocated to agriculture, forestry and fishery. This
is almost double their share.during the Second Plan (1967-71). The major
emphasis will be placed on. the distribution of improved-seeds, farm mechaniza-
tion, and the consolidation of fragmented holdings and providing them with
new and improved irrigation, drainage and roads. Most of these activities
are geared to the Government's objective of achieving self-sufficiency in
rice by 1976. Rice production has fluctuated slightly around the plateau
of 4 million tons a year which was reached some 5 years ago.. Ih 1971,. the
poor crop necessitated imports of close to 1 million tons.
16.       The Government, in addition to its major concern to increase
foodgrain production, is also trying to stimulate other activities such
as sericulture, livestock, and the cultivation of fruit orchards. To attain
these objectives, the Government intends to provide adequate storage for
agricultural commodities and to sponsor research into and production of
high-yielding seeds, to support farm mechanization and to encourage more
intensive use of fertilizer and pesticides. Besides these specific areas
the Government has an ambitious program to improve the rural environment
during the five years of the Third Development Plan through more rural
electrification, expansion of the telecomiunications network, improvement
of rural housing, modernization of the water supply systems and the pro-
vision of better medical.care. As mentioned in paragraph l3, above,, the



Bank Group envisages providing substantial support to the Government's
efforts to diversify and modernize agriculture. To prepare for this, it
is planned to send an agriculture sector survey mission to Korea in late
1972.
PROJECT ASPECTS
17.       The provision of medium and long term credit to farmers is an
important element in the Governmentts strategy of expanding and diversi-
fying agricultural production. The proposed project will extend financial
support to farmers to enable them to meet investment plans which they have
been unable to realize because of a shortage of credit and will help to
strengthen the principal agency for agricultural credit in Korea - the
National Agricultural Cooperative Federation (NACF).
18.       The project consists of part of NACF's lending program over the
next three years. NACF will make sub-loans to about12000 farmers who have
holdings of between 1 to 3 heotares.  Investment will be for a mix of farm
enterprises under four categories(a)apple, grape, pear and peach orchards
(b) sericulture (c) mushroom growing (d) poultry and swine breeding.
The project will also provide technical services to NACF and strengthen
its training of staff.
19.       The total cost of the project is estimated at $18.2 million
equivalent; of this about $3.1 million will be in foreign exchange. The
proposed IDA credit wlll finance the foreign exchange expenditures and
$7.4 million of local costs, that is, about 58 percent of total project
costs. The remaining costs will be financed by the Government (23%) and
project farmers (19%). The proceeds of the IDA credit together with the
Government's contribution of A1400 million will be relent by the Govern-
ment to NACF to be placed in a "Special Fund". NACF will pay interest at
the rate of 7% per annum and have the use of the Government funds and the
proceeds of the IDA credit for a period of at least 15 years. The terms
on which the "Special Fund" will be maintained will be discussed by the
Government, NACF and the Association upon completion of the study referred
to in paragraph 22 below. The main features of the project are described
in Annex III.
20.       NACF forms the apex of the cooperative structure in Korea. Its
membership consists of 140 kun (county) cooperatives and 150 specialized
cooperatives of orchard and livestock farmers. Its headquarters are in
Seoul and it has a branch office in each province. NACF was established
in 1961 and now has a staff of about 1500 including a number with techni-
cal knowledge of agriculture, livestock and animal husbandry. It has a
number of banking, trading and promotional functions such as the provision
of credit, purchasing, supply of inputs, marketing, extension services,
processing and mutual insurance.
21.       NACF's paid in capital and reserves totalled 142.6 billion at
the end of 1970 compared with short and long term liabilities of P1h5
billion. This unsatisfactory debt equity ratio has resulted from poor



-6-
profits, and the rapid increas'e in operations over the last few years.
The Governaent and NACF reco,gnize the necessity of -strengthening the
latter's financial situation. 'Two of 'the steps to attain this end are:
(a) the Government's assurance to IDA that i661 million will'be provided
to NACF by the end of 1973 to help write off part of its bad debts;  and
(b) NACF's assurance that kun cooperatives will be required to invest in
NACF's shares to the extent of at least 3% of their borrowing from it by
the end of 1974. This should yield an additional 142.5 billion to NACF.
.22.      In view of NACF's financial situation.and its crucial position
in Korean agriculture,'about $200,000 of the proceeds of the -proposed,IDA
credit will be used by NACF to finance the fcreign exchange costs of a
study by an international firm of management consultants tordetermine how
its organization, operating procedures and policies and accounting could
be improved and NACF's financial position be strengthened. 'The study will
,extend as necessary to the operation of the kun cooperatives. The Govern-
ment has undertaken to discuss with the Association the consultants'
recommendations and to.agree on the measures required to implement them.
23.       The proposed -project will require a substantial increase in the
number of staff trained in.loan appraibal, both for NACF itself and for
participating cooperatives. To meet this need, the Cooperative College
operated by NACF will giv, a series of special training courses each of
6 to'8 weeks in the appraisal of loan applications from farmers, including
the examination of the technical feasibility of projects and their invest-
ment.and.operating costs, the analysis of incremental revenues arising from
,roject investments, -farmers' repaying capacity and in follow-up and super-
vision procedures. To handle these special courses and to improve the
regular two year courses $215,000 from the proceeds of the proposed IDA
c redit will be used by XaCF to help finance. the expansion and improvement
of the Cooperative'CoIleget's training installations with spectal emphasis
on the practical aspects!of agricultural credit.
-24.      The bulk of the proposed credit (i.e. $10 million),'will be used
to make sub-loans for investmnts by farmers, which will coaplement ongoing
Government programs for:irrigation, drainage, storage, landlImprovement
and consolidation and encourage the greater use of high grade.farm inputs,
,seeds -and planting materials,.  Participating farmers will also be helped
to adopt modern technology. Sub-loans will be made on the basis of farm
'development plans prepared by farmers iith the help of kunicooperative loan
officers. Only farmers .who had made some investment and have activities
covered by the project will be eligible to receive financing. The demand
for credit is such that -no difficulties in disbursing the proceeds of the
credit are expected.
25.      .About eighty :percent of sub-loans will -be channeledlby NACF to
the ultimate beneficiaries through kun cooperatives; the.remaining.20%
-or so wil be made -directly by'NACF to farmers. NACF will relend to the
'kun -cooperatives at an:interest rate of 9% per annum. The terms -of -the
-sub-loans will vary according to the purpose of the.loan but vdl1 range
'between 5 to 12,years..



-7-
26.       Interest rates charged to farmers on NACF funds vary according
to their source and the purpose of their loan. The present interest rate
of 9% on medium and long term loans ia unduly low compared to comiercial
rates which are of the order of 20%. As a move to bring interest rates
for agricultural lending closer in line with commercial rates and pending
the completion of the Bank Group's proposed agricultural sector survey,
the interest charged to farmers under tki project would be raised to
12%.
27.       The items to be procured under the project are diverse and the
likely size of individual purchases is8'mall. In these circumstances,
international competitive bidding would be inappropriate. Procurement will
therefore be through normal cooperative and commercial channels which are
weLl developed. The supply of the items required is adequate.
2&.       Farm models show financial rates of return ranging from 18 percent
to 58 percent. Varied sensitivity tests were applied to each model. The
financial rates of return remain satisfactory in all cases. The rate of
return to the economy would be 38 percent, ranging from 18 percent for
sericulture to more than 100 percent for poultry and swine. Sensitivity
tests applied to the costs and benefits still give satisfactory rates of
return.
29.       Accurate data on the net employment resulting from the project
are not available; however, increased labor requirements for farm exploita-
tion will increase working hours for labor that is already employed and also
generate opportunities for employing additional people. The equivalent of
full-time jobs generated by the project would be about 6,000. The incremental
wages to be paid would average i850 million (US$2.3)million a year. This
does not include the incremental employment and earnings generaged by pro-
cessing and marketing.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
30.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Korea and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Associa-
tion and the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation, the Recommendation
of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of
Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed Development
Credit are being distributed separately to the Executive Directors. The
draft Credit and Project Agreements follow the pattern of agreements for
similar projects.
31.       I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
