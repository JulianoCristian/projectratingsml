   Sector Development Project is to increase the\n            competitiveness of the Ukraine enterprise sector. There are\n            four project components. The first component provides\n            advisory services through a local non-profit agency aimed at\n            improving the profitability, productivity, and general\n            operational, financial, and managerial efficiency of private\n            and privatized enteprises; supports and facilitates\n            development of a highly qualified domestic consulting\n            industry; and strengthens the constituency for reform at the\n            oblast level consisting of entrepreneurs, managers, local\n            academia, consultants, and other stakeholders. This\n            component, which focuses on enterprise restructuring, also\n            builds incentives for the government to minimize its\n            involvement in the enterprise selection process; for\n            stakeholders to maximize cost recovery of consultant\n            services; for developing the local consulting market; and\n            for foreign consultants to train and mentor local\n            consultants. Under the second component, the implementing\n            agency will design, subcontract, and supervise in-house\n            training courses for selected candidates who, in turn, will\n            be required upon completion of their secondment programs, to\n            proactively contribute to disseminating their knowledge and\n            experience to the business community. The third component\n            finances monitoring and project administration. The fourth\n            component improves the regulatory environment by providing\n            performance-based incentives for deregulation."}, "docdt": "2002-03-06T00:00:00Z"}
