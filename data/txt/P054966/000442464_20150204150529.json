This line of reforms is actively\n            supported by the World Bank, with its most important\n            projects aimed at building up the private sector in Ukraine.\n            In 1996 and 1998, the enterprise development adjustment\n            loans (EDAL) I and II were implemented in two stages. In\n            2002, the World Bank approved granting a loan to Ukraine for\n            the private sector development project. This project is a\n            systemic (adjustment) type, being oriented not only to the\n            extensive development of private enterprises, but also to\n            increasing the efficiency and profitability of production,\n            and the manufacture of competitive products. The project\n            objective is also to ensure that privatized enterprises\n            themselves, after acquiring know-how and work experience\n            under the conditions of new economic realities, become\n            experts and leaders of enterprise restructuring, supporters,\n            and implementers of market ideas in the regions.\n            Introduction of the latest models of information and\n            communication technologies (ICT) can considerably increase\n            the efficiency and expeditiousness of decisions approval,\n            stimulate the development of the private sector, and\n            strengthen civil society in Ukraine. In order to attain\n            these goals, a credit agreement on financing the project\n            Ukraine: e-development was signed in 2003 between the World\n            Bank and the Ukrainian Government. The activities envisaged\n            by the project have positive prospects for consolidating\n            administrative reform."}, "docdt": "2004-04-19T00:00:00Z"}
