Several key\n            lessons, which have operational and strategic implications\n            for the design of future power sector projects, can be drawn\n            from this project: a) Good project management by the\n            consulting engineer and good coordination throughout project\n            preparation and implementation were key elements in\n            successful implementation of the physical part of the\n            project. b) Rapid action by the Bank to cover 100 percent of\n            local financing was critical in avoiding project delays by\n            nonpayment to contractors due to lack of counterpart\n            funding. c) Environmental studies of the sort included in\n            this project did not receive the high priority from\n            operating staff - it is important to obtain commitment from\n            senior management responsible for operations when\n            contemplating such studies in providing adequate budget and\n            purchasing authority, and incorporation of responsibility\n            for study execution in the job description of operation\n            managers. d) Cost estimates should be more robust; the\n            actual project cost was 38 percent less than the appraisal\n            estimate. e) Close on-the-ground supervision and willingness\n            to be flexible in adopting the project to the local\n            conditions is an essential ingredient for good project implementation."}, "docdt": "1999-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
