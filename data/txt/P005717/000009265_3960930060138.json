The\n            targets of the project are to recruit about 30,000 new\n            family planning acceptors per year in the public sector.\n            Further reductions in mortality and morbidity will be\n            addressed through: (a) reducing regional disparities in\n            access to basic health care and in the availability of\n            resources; and (b) improving the quality of basic health\n            care (BHC) of which family planning/maternal and child\n            health services (FP/MCH) is a critical component. The\n            project will provide: (a) works and equipment to BHC\n            facilities to accommodate the strengthening of FP/MCH\n            services and upgrade the technical quality of the services;\n            (b) mobile clinics and vehicles to deliver family planning\n            and other basic health services with a strong focus on\n            underserved areas; (c) ambulances and equipment for the\n            district hospitals; (d) works and equipment for 5 peri-urban\n            diagnostic centers; (e) educational materials and expert\n            services for a comprehensive pre- and in-service training\n            program for staff who are to deliver the services; (f)\n            expert services to improve strategic planning and monitoring\n            capacities; and (g) spare parts and expert services for the\n            development of a maintenance program for vehicles, equipment\n            and buildings."}, "docdt": "1991-03-04T00:00:00Z"}
