MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION
AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
FOR A POPULATION AND FAMILY HEALTH PROJECT
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Republic of Tunisia for US$26 million equivalent is submitted for approval.
This loan would provide investment finance for a Population and Family Health
Project, and would have a term of seventeen years, including five years of
grace, at the standard variable interest rate.
2.    Backuround.   Thanks to three decades of broad based commitment to
family welfare, social equity and economic growth, Tunisians have secured
impressive improvements in their living standards. Important milestones
include the achievement of universal primary education, the reduction of
infant mortality by two-thirds and the quadrupling of female labor market
participation. At the core of this transformation is the successful
encouragement of smaller family size through improved education, health and
family planning services and better opportunities for women, a process which
has received sustained community support at all levels. The Total Fertility
Rate has declined from 7.1 to 3.5 children per woman, the lowest in the
African continent and the Arab world. This massive demographic shift will
tilt development opportunities in Tunisia's favor for many years to come, as
labor force growth rates become more manageable, savings and consumption
patterns more balanced, and infrastructure needs less daunting than in most
otherwise comparable countries.
3.    The country's planners emphasize the need for further reduction in the
rate of population growth through the equitable and efficient provision of
health and education services. These are essential components of Tunisia's
human resources strategy, underpinning an increasingly open and dynamic
economy. However, the challenges implied in reaching the next stage of the
demographic transition - aiming at replacement-level fertility by about 2010 -
are in many respects more daunting than in the past. The number of couples to
be provided with family planning services will have to double between now and
the year 2000. Furthermore, as contraceptive prevalence in urban areas and
among the educated middle-classes is already quite high, the couples whose
needs must be understood and addressed will increasingly be the poor in hard-
to-serve rural areas. These couples suffer disproportionately from high
infant and maternal mortality and benefit less from the health and social
benefits of family planning practice. The health services most likely to meet
their requirements should simultaneously address their family planning needs
and other priority health concerns. Resources will have to be targeted
resolutely toward this constituency, in spite of protracted fiscal austerity.
4.    Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Following two Bank-supported operations
in population and health launched in the 609 and 70s, the proposed population
project offers a notable opportunity to help Tunisia safeguard past
achievements in family welfare and meet the challenges of moving to the next
stage of the demographic transition. As external grant support for the



-2-
Tunisian population program has sharply declined over the last few years, due
to demand from countries with even more urgent needs, the Bank's continued
technical and financial support is vital, as is its integrated perspective on
reproductive health care provision and community outreach.
5.    The proposed operation complements the recently approved Employment and
Training Fund loan and the FY89 Education and Training Sector loan, aimed at
improving access to basic education and adapting the existing labor force to
changing job patterns. It is closely related to the proposed Hospital
Restructuring Support project, which is presented in parallel with this
project. This restructuring project seeks to rationalize resource use in the
health sector overall, and especially to provide room for improvement in basic
health services by a comprehensive restructuring o' major teaching and
specialized hospitals, which would allow adjustments in the burden-sharing
arrangements between the State, patients and insurers. Together with an
operation addressing higher education reform planned for FY92, this integrated
human resources program illustrates the "Tunisian model" which links social
services directly to productivity, adjustment and growth.
6.    Proiect Obiectives.   The project aims to reduce both fertility and
mortality nationally by targeting the provision of basic health services to
relatively underprivileged groups. For the public sector, this implies
reaching about 30,000 new family planning acceptors per year, and continuing
to serve over half a million women with such services throughout the project
period. Further reductions in mortality levels would be addressed through:
(i) increasing access to integrated family planning and maternal and child
health services; and (ii) improving the quality and flexibility of basic
health care and the first level of referral care. These improvements would
also alleviate the pressure on higher level hospitals and thereby complete a
fundamental medium-term overhaul of the sector's cost-effectiveness.
7.    Proiect Description.  The project would be the first 5-year phase of a
10-year basic health services development program. During this first phase,
emphasis would be placed on training and deploying staff for underserved
areas, in accordance with a "needs index" developed during project
preparation. The focus of basic health services would be on family planning,
reproductive health care and child health. To accommodate these services and
ensure privacy for the clients, physical spaces of clinics would be expanded,
appropriate equipment provided and the availability of a minimum range of
essential drugs &ssured. The project would also strengthen outreach
activities and improve supervision and operations research. First-tier
referral facilities, i.e. district hospitals, maternities and diagnostic
centers, would be strengthened through the provision of laboratories, X-ray
equipment and ambulances. In addition, the project would improve pre- and in-
service training of staff, strengthen management capacity and strategic
planning at the central and regional levels and improve the maintenance system
for vehicles, equipment and buildings. These institutional improvements would
be consolidated in the second 5-year phase, which would also modify and extend
the range of services provided based on early implementation experience and
evaluations.



8.    Organization and Imylementation.  The project would he managed by the
Directorate of Basic Health Care in the Ministry of Health (MOH), in
collaboration with the National Office of Family Planning (ONFP), a
specialized aqency reporting to the same Ministry. The latter would retain
its lead role in research and development, information, education, and staff
development on contract to the Ministry, and focus on developing services in
the private sector and in the most dispersed areas. Routine client services
are increasingly being delivered by MOH staff. At the local level, the
existing MOH Regional Directors would supervise implementation, assisted by
the ONFP delegate. At the central level, a small project imp.ementation unit
(PIU) would monitor regional performance and keep project accounts. A project
steering committee, chaired by the Minister of Health, and including the heads
of the main functional departments and of ONFP, would meet at least twice a
year to review overall progress, including evaluating reports prepared by an
external audit team with the help of local universities.
9.    Cost and Financing.  The total project cost is est'mated at US$63.2
million equivalent including duties and taxes, with a foreign exchange content
of US$36.2 million equivalent. It would be financed as follows: (a) the
proposed IBRD loan of US$26 million equivalent would cover 72% of the foreign
exchange component or 56% of total project costs, net of taxes; (b) the
Government would finance the remaining US$37.2 million equivalent, including
local costs (US$27.0 million equivalent including US$16.4 million in taxes and
duties) and US$10.2 million equivalent in foreign exchange. Discussions with
bilateral and multilateral grant donor agencies covering the bulk of this
foreign exchange requirement, representing drug and contraceptive imports, are
well advanced and expected to be finalized shortly. A breakdown of project
costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A time-
table of key processing events and responsibilities, and the statue of Bank
Group operations in Tunisia &re given in Schedules C and D respectively. The
staff appraisal report No. 9128-TUN, dated February 11, 1991, is being
distributed separately.
10.   Agreements reached durina Neuotiations.  The Government provided
assurances that:
(a)   the annual growth rate of the non salary operating budget for
basic health services would be positive and at least equal to the
annual growth rate of the overall MOH non salary operating budget;
(b)   detailed regional resource allocation and implementation plans
will be developed in accordance with the "needs index", and
submitted to the Bank by December 31 of each year for review and
comments;
(c)   a study/evaluation of basic health services' maintenance system
for vehicles, equipment and buildings will be completed by
December 31, 1992 based on terms of reference to be reviewed with
the Bank before December 31, 1991, and a maintenance system
implemented before December 31, 1993;



-4-
(d)   the necessary foreign exchange will be made available by the
Government for the purchase of contraceptives; and
(e)   the PIU will be established and maintained throughout the project.
11.   As conditions of Loan Effectiveness, the project's resource allocation
and implementation plan for the first year of project operation will be
submitted to the Bank for approval, and the appointment of the Director of the
PIU will be confirmed.
12.   Benefits.  The project would improve and expand the basic health care
system nation-wide and adapt services to the specific health needs of women
and children. Because the poor in general and the rural poor in particular
have little access to other sources of health care, the project would narrow
disparities in health status between regions and social classes. Access to
quality family planning services is of particular benefit to the poor: it
contributes to child survival and health and permits the woman to regain her
strength between pregnancies. Confidence in child survival, in turn,
reinforces a couple's motivation to limit their family size.
13.   In addition, the project would contribute to reducing patients'
incentives to seek care in better equipped and staffed higher level hospitals,
which are currently overburdened by people who could have been served closer
to home, earlier in the disease process and at lower cost. Reducing the
pressure on higher level hospitals would permit them to fulfill their mission
as providers of specialized services and facilitate the containment of health
care costs in the system as a whole.
14.   Risks.  Possible risks include the fungibility of budgetary resources in
the health sector, which could draw resources away from the basic health care
program in general and the needs of low-visibility rural ccmmunities in
particular. In this case, this risk is reduced by the explicit recognition of
the political imperative of reaching the rural poor, tangibly demonstrated in
a sharp increase in funding for such public services in the draft 1991 budget.
A more durable solution to this perennial problem is being sought through
reform of the hospital sector (para 5).
15.   The longstanding difficulty in attracting qualified staff, especially
female nurses, for service in rural areas is the most serious risk to be
overcome. However, as the employment market for health professionals in urban
areas becomes saturated, transfer of the relatively small number of additional
staff needed to rural assignments Is proving easier. The fact that working
conditions in the health centers will improve through project inputs, that
staff will be rotated to and from service in different levels of the system,
including through rural-based mobile clinics, and that comprehensive in-
service training will be introduced, is expected to contribute to attracting
and retaining the necessary staff. In addition, conditions of service for
public health physicians have recently been modified to include a 2-year
mandatory assignment in underserved areas.
16.   Environmental Imoact.  No adverse impact on the environment is expected
from the limited project financed civil works or from the basic health



activities it supports. Since the project would contribute to slower
population growth and help contain population density, it would tend to reduce
pressure on natural resources. The proposed project was determined to be in
screening category C which includes projects which seek to enhance
environmental conditions.
17.   Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
