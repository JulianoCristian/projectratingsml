Some lessons learned included: the\n            importance of fully integrating projects' objectives in\n            the Government strategy, as testified by the project\n            success. The need to develop realistic monitoring and\n            evaluation mechanisms, in line with existing capacity, which\n            was not fully achieved in the project. The importance of\n            harmonizing staff allocations with Government priorities,\n            illustrated in this project by the difficulties encountered\n            in deploying staff in remote rural areas. Ministry of health\n            tradition of self-evaluation also facilitated the systematic\n            incorporation of lessons learned from experience. Indeed,\n            the implementation of the project under review brought to\n            light a number of operational problems and provided\n            opportunities to develop solutions, which were incorporated\n            in the design of the health sector loan."}, "docdt": "1998-06-04T00:00:00Z"}
