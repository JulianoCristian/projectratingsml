Population and Family Health Project\n            objectives are to lower both fertility and mortality, by\n            targeting basic health care services to underprivileged\n            groups with a strong focus on mothers and children. The\n            targets of the project are to recruit about 30,000 new\n            family planning acceptors per year in the public sector.\n            Further reductions in mortality and morbidity will be\n            addressed through: (a) reducing regional disparities in\n            access to basic health care and in the availability of\n            resources; and (b) improving the quality of basic health\n            care (BHC) of which family planning/maternal and child\n            health services (FP/MCH) is a critical component. The\n            project will provide: (a) works and equipment to BHC\n            facilities to accommodate the strengthening of FP/MCH\n            services and upgrade the technical quality of the services;\n            (b) mobile clinics and vehicles to deliver family planning\n            and other basic health services with a strong focus on\n            underserved areas; (c) ambulances and equipment for the\n            district hospitals; (d) works and equipment for 5 peri-urban\n            diagnostic centers; (e) educational materials and expert\n            services for a comprehensive pre- and in-service training\n            program for staff who are to deliver the services; (f)\n            expert services to improve strategic planning and monitoring\n            capacities; and (g) spare parts and expert services for the\n            development of a maintenance program for vehicles, equipment\n            and buildings."}, "docdt": "1991-02-19T00:00:00Z"}
