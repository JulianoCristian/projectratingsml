          modifications in Development Objective and changes in\n            associated outcome targets). This paper also requests an\n            extension of the Grant's closing Date from October 31,\n            2009 to June 30, 2011. The restructuring will emphasize\n            strengthening budget formulation, execution, monitoring and\n            controls through technical assistance activities for the\n            Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) and related\n            independent agencies, the Prime Minister's Office, and\n            the Supreme Audit Institution. It will align interventions\n            to the National Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper\n            (DSNCRP) and the recently approved Country Assistance\n            Strategy (CAS) for FY09-12. The restructuring will make\n            revisions to the following project elements: (a) development\n            objective; (b) number and content of components,\n            sub-components and corresponding intermediate indicators;\n            and (c) component costs, financing plan, and allocation of\n            grant proceeds, while keeping the total project cost and\n            overall Grant amount unchanged."}, "docdt": "2009-10-16T00:00:00Z"}
