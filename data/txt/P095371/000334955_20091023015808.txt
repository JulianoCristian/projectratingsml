  SECOND ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE GRANT
                        (EGTAG 11)
                    GRANT (IDA- H2370)

Introductory Statement

1. This Project Paper (PP) seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to restructure the
Haiti Second Economic Governance Technical Assistance Grant (EGTAG 11). The
proposed changes will be of first order category (significant changes requiring
modifications in Development Objective and changes in associated outcome targets).
This PP also requests an extension of the Grant's closing Date from October 31, 2009 to
June 30,201 1.

2. The proposed restructuring would emphasize strengthening budget formulation,
execution, monitoring and controls through technical assistance activities for .the Ministry
of Economy and Finance (MEF) and related independent agencies, the Prime Minister's
Office, and the Supreme Audit Institution. It would align interventions to the National
Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (DSNCRP) and the recently approved
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY09- 12. The proposed restructuring would
make revisions to the following project elements: (a) development objective; (b) number
and content of components, sub-components and corresponding intermediate indicators;
and (c) component costs, financing plan, and allocation of Grant proceeds, while keeping
the total project cost and overall Grant amount unchanged.

Background and Reasons Underlying a Two Year Extension and Restructuring

3. Background. The Second Economic Governance Technical Assistance Grant
(EGTAG I1 or the Project) of US$2.0 million was approved by the Bank's Board of
Executive Directors on June 20, 2006. It did not become effective until August 16, 2007
due to difficulties in reaching agreement with the Recipient on conditions for its
ratification of IDA grants. Specifically, there was a lack of clarity in the Haitian legal
framework on the need to have all international agreements - not just those that increase
indebtedness-ratified by Parliament. This issue delayed the effectiveness of the whole
pipeline for Haiti until an agreement was reached in 2007. Although the initial closing
date was June, 30, 2009, the Project was granted a four month bridge extension of the
Closing Date to prepare the restructuring package. As a result, the current closing date is
October 3 1,2009.

4. EGTAG I1 was designed as a follow on operation to EGTAG I. Its predecessor,
EGTAG I, was designed and approved in 2005 within the context of the original
priorities set out in the governance section of the Transitional Government's Interim
Cooperation Framework (ICT). While Bank TA support to such priorities was originally
envisaged within the framework of a larger grant, the available IDA envelope was limited
to US$2 million, thereby preventing support in the form of a more comprehensive $4
million operation. As a result, Bank TA support to the ICT took the form of two back-to-
back US$2.0 million grants - EGTAG I and I1 - which were presented to the Board within
one year of each other. EGTAG I required a twelve month extension of its closing date
to September 2009 to allow sufficient time to complete pending activities that were
delayed due to the six month lag between Board signing and effectiveness, as well as to
ensure achievement of the agreed development objectives.

5. Rationale for a Two Year Extension. Along with several other Bank projects,
EGTAG I1 suffered initial delays due to an impasse in the Haitian government over the
correct ratification procedure for IDA grants to Haiti. As a result, although it was
approved by the Bank's Board on June 20, 2006, EGTAG I1 did not become effective
until August 16, 2007, almost 14 months later, following an agreement by the
Government and the National Assembly that exempted such grants fi-om the requirement
for ratification by the Assembly. Furthermore, delays in the implementation of EGTAG
1's activities have slowed the implementation of EGTAG 11, as activities envisaged
within the context of the follow-on operation were closely tied to advances made under
its predecessor.

6. Until recently, no disbursements had been made under ECTAG 11, however, requests
for activities to be financed under the EGTAG I1 are now being received regularly, and
commitments thus far amount to close to $300,000. One of the most important activities
initiated under EGTAG I was the implementation of the Debt Management System,
which will be completed with EGTAG I1 funding. The associated contract with
UNCTAD (for a total of $458,000) is expected to be completed by the end of 2009, and
the final payments for this contract will be made with funds from EGTAG 11. The project
would therefore benefit from a longer timefi-ame (two years) to complete the activities.

7. Rationale for a Restructuring. The rationale for the proposed restructuring is based
on the need to realign the project with the current strategy for governance reform in Haiti
as defined by (i) the priority areas of the new CAS; (ii) the emergence of new strategic
stakeholders; (iii) lessons learned from the implementation of both the EGTAG I and
LICUS projects' which are closing on September 30, 2009; (iv) a review of the factors
that have led to delays in project implementation; and (v) the limited lending envelope for
the project.

(i) A Restructuring in Line with the Priority areas of the new CAS and National
Priorities: The Project was designed in 2005 and approved in 2006, a time which
coincided with the presidential elections which led to the election of Rene Preval and the
inauguration of a new Assembly. Since 2006, progress in strengthening core government
institutions and systems has been significant. Haiti has introduced broad-ranging
economic governance reforms and, building on the 1987 Constitution, a series of new
fi-amework laws have modernized basic systems and procedures. The recently approved
CAS analyzes these achievements in detail and aligns the program of the World Bank,
with the country's 2007 National Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (the
DSNCRP). The CAS's three pillars include promoting growth and local development,
investing in human capital and reducing vulnerability to disasters. Public economic
governance reform remains instrumental as it cuts across all three pillars. Within these

Stress (LICUS) Grant to Support Economic Governance Reform in Haiti- Ref. No. 8 -TF053366.
                                               2
areas, new World Bank interventions are determined by Haitian priorities, primarily
expressed in the DSNCRP. New interventions will address areas in which Bank projects
have already achieved progress, where the WBG has a comparative advantage, or where
Bank resources can fill gaps or leverage investments by other donors or the private
sector.

The proposed restructuring is framed within the context of .the administration's
development priorities and aligned with the strategic areas of the new CAS. Furthermore,
in 2009 a review of the public financial management system was carried out based on the
Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) '~ramework.       The findings of
this review revealed a number of weaknesses in the system. By helping to identify areas
where reform efforts can be targeted, the review was essential in refining the
development objectives and determining appropriate outcome indicators.

(ii) The emergence of new strategic stakeholders: The Project will support new strategic
stakeholders, in particular, the General Finance Inspectorate (Inspection Gknkrale des
Finances, IGF) and the Parliamentarians who were sworn in on May 8, 2006 after a two-
year legislative void. The IGF was created by the Decree of May 25, 2006, and its
General Director was appointed recently. The project will support this newly established
Inspectorate as well as Parliamentarians with the funds available due to the reorientation
of the activities.

(iii) Lessons Learned from the Implementation of EGTAG I and LICUS Projects: The
experience of EGTAG I has shown that institutional reforms take time and require
substantial supervision. Even with a large supervision budget, it is often difficult to
mobilize specialists in all the areas addressed by the project (civil society, anti-corruption
work, budget reform, procurement reform, human resources reform). Therefore, the
Project has been restructured to revolve around two themes: budget formulation and
execution and budget monitoring and controls. This will simplify the supervision process
and create a new dynamic because all beneficiaries will have to work together to achieve
those two common goals.

(iv) A review of the factors that have led to delays in project implementation.
Implementation has been slow due to (i) the weak capacity of the Project Unit at the
outset of the project; and (ii) the lack of a clear vision on the goals that each governance
institution had to achieve. As a consequence, the team received ad hoc requests for
activities that were not necessarily priority initiatives. The PIU received a lot of support
and as part of the preparation of an updated procurement plan, some beneficiaries have
developed a strategic plan for their institutions (Uniti de Lutte contre la Corruption,
ULCC; OfJice de Management des Ressources Humaines, OMRH, and Cour Supkrieure
des Comptes et du Contentieux Administratzx CSCCA).

(v) The Limited Lending Envelope and Comparative Advantage:                 The Project
restructuring also takes into account the reality of the limited lending envelope. Since
EGTAG I1 is a US$2.0 million grant, interventions are restricted to areas where the Bank
has a definite comparative advantage. Given the involvement of other donors in the
governance area, the restructured Project will aim to achieve a narrower objective, while
delving deeper into priority areas where the Bank can build on its long engagement with
the beneficiaries and the analytical base provided by the Public Expenditure and
Financial Accountability Report (PEMFAR).
        Proposed Changes

        8. The proposed changes will require an amendment to the Grant Agreement (GA) to take
        into account the narrower Project Development Objective (PDO) and the newly
        developed outcome targets.

        9. Extension of the Closing Date from October 31, 2009 to June 30, 2011. The Bank
        team has received an official protocol dated September 3, 2009 whereby the Recipient
        formally requests an extension of the Closing Date from October 31, 2009 to June 30,
        2011 to allow sufficient time to complete the implementation of activities and
        achievement of indicators of the restructured Project.

        10. Allocation of Proceeds. The team is proposing to have one single expenditure
        category to finance consulting services, works, goods and operating costs at 100% in
        order to facilitate the implementation of ,the activities detailed in Annexes 1A and 1B.
        Existing disbursement and financial management arrangements will be maintained.

        11. Modification of the Project Development Objectives and Outcome indicators.
        The original objective of the Second Economic Technical Assistance Grant (EGTAG 11)
        is to further assist the Government in strengthening its institutional capacity in the areas
        of public sector resource management and improved responsiveness to citizen needs and
        demands. The revised PDO would be to assist the Government to (i) strengthen budget
        formulation and execution and (ii) strengthen budget monitoring and control. The
        outcome indicators have been updated and refined and are presented in Table 1.

  12. Adjustment of Existing Components. These adjustments will include:

  (a) Reorganization of Project Components: To better align the project with the
      priorities outlined earlier in the document, the existing five components would be
      reorganized into three components: At present the project is composed of five
      components as follows:

               Project Components
               1 . Financial Resources Management
               2. Human Resource Development;
               3. Development of MEF (Office of Economic Studies) and MPCE's
               Capacity for Strategic Monitoring of Sector Policy
               4. Anti-Corruption and Civil Society Engagement
               5. Communication, Donor Coordination, and Project Management.

  Based on a comprehensive dialogue with the Government and executing agencies,
  formalized during a workshop on July 8, 2009, and with other development partners, all
  five Components will be reorganized as follows. An overview of these changes is
  presented in Table 2 and a detailed comparison with the original activities included in the
  PAD is available in Annex 2:
         Component I will be scaled up to include capacity building activities to support
         the ongoing budget reform and debt management department. The activities
         related to the controls were kept and moved to a new component or umbrella
         titled "Strengthen Budget Monitoring and Control" which also includes activities
         for the General Finance Inspectorate, the Anti-corruption Unit, civil society and
         Parliamentarians.
         Component 2 for Human Resource Development and Further Development of
         Training Capacity will be scaled down due to the existence of other sources of
         financing2 and integrated under the umbrella " Improvement of Budget
         Formulation and Execution (Component I of the restructured project);

              Component 3 is maintained but included under the umbrella entitled
              "Improvement of Budget Formulation and Execution";
              Component 4 is reduced as follows: fundiilg for anti-corruption activities are
              scaled up to include a Youth Forum on anti-corruption while the civil society
              activities were reduced, as civil society monitoring is now supported by additional
              funding from a WBIICIDA project under preparation as well as a CIDA financed
              project, to only concentrate on a take stocking study on civil society monitoring
              mechanism and capacity-building activities for parliamentarians3.
              Component 5 activities involving PCU Donor Coordination are dropped since one
              of the envisioned activities - the creation of a donor database by the PCU - is not
              feasible. Instead, donor coordination activities will be undertaken by the Country
              Office and Bank project team, and liberated resources will be transferred to
              support the newly created General Finance Inspectorate and activities supporting
              the budget oversight capacity of Parliamentarians.

               New Project Components
                    1. Strengtliening Budget Formulation and Execution
                    2. Strengthening Budget Monitoring and Control
                    3. Communication and Project Management.

As shown in the table above, the restructured project will be reorganized into three
Components: Component 1-Strengthening Budget Formulation and Execution;
Component 2-Strengthening Budget Monitoring and Control; and Component 3-
Communication and Project Management.

(b) Reorganization of Resource Allocation and Addition of three new sub-
components. Project funding will be provided for some new activities that emerged
during the implementation of the project. While these activities are in line with the
objective stated in the project's initial PAD to further assist the Government in
strengthening its institutional capacity, they were not explicitly identified in the initial
PAD. These activities encompass:

             Support to the newly created General Finance Inspectorate (Inspection Ginirale
             des Finances, IGF) under the new Component 2- Strengthening Budget
             Monitoring and Control. The project will provide assistance to improve the
             efficiency and effectiveness of this newly created institution through technical
             assistance and capacity building activities. The funding for this new sub-
             component will come from the resources initially allocated to two institutions, the
             Human Resources Office Management (OMRH) and the Government Training
             Center (CEFOPAFOP), both of which have other sources of financing available.
             The OMRH has funding from a Canadian International Development Agency
             (CIDA) financed project ("Projet d 'Appui au renforcement de la gestion publique
             en Haiti", PARGEP) and the CEFOPAFOP from a World Bank IDF Grant ("Haiti
             Institutional Strengthening for Donor Project Implementation", P 107447).
             Strengthen the budget oversight capacity of Parliamentarians under the new
             Component 2 - Budget Monitoring and Control. It is envisaged to conduct
             capacity building activities to enhance capacity of key Parliamentary

            supporting the debt management system under Component 1 - Budget
            Formulation and Execution.

    13. In summary, the proposed Project restructuring involves a reduction in the number of
    components from five to three, and a scaling down of the funding of some of the sub-
    components that have alternative sources of financing in order to fund two new critical
    beneficiaries: (a) the General Finance Inspectorate; and (b) the Parliamentarians.

    Analysis

    14. None of the proposed changes has a major effect on the original economic, financial,
    technical, institutional, or social aspects of the project as appraised. The emphasis of the
    restructuring was placed on defining and refining the project development objectives and
    the associated outcome indicators. None of the proposed changes raises the
    environmental category of the project or triggers new safeguards policies. The
    restructuring does not involve any exceptions to Bank policies.
Benefits and Risks

15. The expected benefits of this restructuring are to increase synergies among the
different beneficiaries involved to avoid duplication, to increase the sustainability of the
project and to achieve clearly determined outcomes.

16. The proposed restructuring poses no new risks to the achievement of the PDOs or
outcome indicators. Several risks mentioned in Section 7 (Critical risks, p. 20) of the
PAD - including the PCU's ability to handle several projects, weaknesses in the Haitian
public procurement system, and donor coordination - have been mitigated during the
implementation of the first Economic Governance Technical Assistance Grant. The PCU
staff has been trained, additional have also been hired to assist with the accounting
procedures and a local consultant has been hired to assist with the supervision of the
project. In addition, frequent supervision missions and weekly video conference
meetings are held with the PCU and beneficiaries to assess progress of the project. To
strengthen donor coordination, the team regularly consults with the donors on the
different activities and the Table Sectorielle is still functioning. Most of the necessary
enabling legislation to move forward the reforms are now in place, the adoption of the
new procurement law in June 2009 has also created a solid legal framework for public
procurement; however institutional capacity continues to be a concern and risks will
continue to be mitigated with the same measures and additional measures proposed in the
risk analysis of the PAD.
