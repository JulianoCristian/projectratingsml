In the middle of the last decade, Haiti\n            recognized that it needed to strengthen its economic\n            governance to make the best use of its own resources as well\n            as those provided by external donors. The government viewed\n            it was essential in promoting economic recovery, boosting\n            long-term growth, and setting Haiti on a path toward meeting\n            the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). An economic\n            governance group led by the Government of Haiti helped\n            coordinate donor work and ensure that it met government\n            priorities. The project provided technical assistance\n            related to budget reform, debt management systems, human\n            resource management, and public procurement. A series of\n            external shocks, including the devastating 2010 earthquake,\n            affected project implementation, and limited its\n            achievements.  The Bank had explored new options for\n            providing support to economic governance, which remains an\n            important priority in Haiti. Better public financial\n            management by government of scarce public resources, as well\n            as better service delivery resulting from more effective and\n            transparent public procurement benefitted Haiti."}, "docdt": "2012-04-16T08:19:04Z"}
