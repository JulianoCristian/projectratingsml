Economic\n            Governance Technical Assistance Project for Haiti were as\n            follows: outcomes were unsatisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was high, the Bank performance was\n            moderately unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: counterparts' limited implementation and\n            absorption capacity require focusing Bank activities on a\n            limited number of areas, with few procurement processes, and\n            with a view to achieving realistic targets determined by a\n            sound understanding of country context. In the case of\n            Second Economic Governance Technical Assistance Grant\n            (EGTAG2), it will have been more realistic and effective to\n            identify strategic points of entry, rather than addressing\n            the entire scope of public financial management. Despite the\n            consolidation of the disbursement categories into a single\n            category through the 2009 restructuring, EGTAG2 design did\n            not effectively respond to the Government's changing\n            needs in the post-earthquake context. In this respect,\n            making unallocated emergency reserve funding available could\n            be considered for future operations. Flexibility could also\n            be obtained by combining a broad project development\n            objective (PDO) with specific objectives and project\n            activities. Linking budget support operations with technical\n            assistance projects generates both incentives and support\n            for progress in the government reform agenda. Providing\n            technical assistance to the policy areas covered by budget\n            support operations is useful to ensure an adequate pace of\n            reform implementation. In turn, programmatic budget support\n            operations are an incentive for the Government to achieve\n            PDOs supported by technical assistance projects. During the\n            project design phase, it is critical to discuss thoroughly\n            all potential alternatives. In the case of EGTAG2, the only\n            alternative discussed in the PAD was a larger, multi-year\n            technical assistance grant. It will have been useful to\n            consider other options in order to identify potential\n            pitfalls and to build a consensus on the most appropriate\n            solution. Exploring options for implementation is also\n            critical for project performance. Implementation units with\n            strong capacity are essential to successfully implement\n            projects. It is therefore important to scrutinize potential\n            options in order to identify those implementation\n            arrangements that are most suited to the country context\n            (specific implementation unit, fiduciary agent, etc) and to\n            propose corresponding mitigation measures to enhance\n            counterpart implementation capacity."}, "docdt": "2011-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
