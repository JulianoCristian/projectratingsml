                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The earthquake of January 12, 2010 has caused important human and material damages to the beneficiaries of the project (in particular to the National Public Procurement
                         Commission, the Supreme Audit Institution and the Office of Human Resource management). In this context, some activities envisaged before the earthquake cannot be carried out
                         or do not appear as priorities any more. However, the main beneficiary of the project (the MEF) is still in place and remains committed to the project, and the development objectives
                         of the project are still relevant within the current context.

                         The main project achievements to date remain modest and include: (a) improved documentation of the budget (b) production of various reports on aspects such as economic
                         recovery and budget reform which aim to improve budget formulation. Overall, progress of the implementation plan has been uneven.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Given current achievements and circumstances, a restructuring of the project is envisaged to ensure PDO fulfillment and project implementation. Representatives of the Ministry of
                         Finance and the World Bank are in agreement on the need for a change on PDO's indicators, priorization of activities, and extention of project duration. With regards to project
                         activities, the priorization will be based on the following criteria: (i) consistency with the development objectives of the project, (ii) consistency with the priorities of budget support
                         programs, (iii) compatibility with the schedule of EGTAG II and the absorption capacity of the institutions; (iv) coordination with other donor support.
