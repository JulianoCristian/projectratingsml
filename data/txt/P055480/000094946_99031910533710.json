public services, by strengthening the capacity of:\n            1) the national government to formulate, implement, and\n            monitor decentralization policies and programs; and 2)\n            municipalities in areas such as municipal planning,\n            financial and human resources management, and the management\n            of health and education services. There are two main\n            components. The National Institutional Strengthening\n            Component includes implementing programs developed under its\n            pilot predecessor, the Municipal Development Pilot Project\n            (MDPP) (report no. 12198); performing policy studies in key\n            areas; and developing action plans for implementing them.\n            Programs recommended by the MDPP include implementing a\n            national management information system; a budgeting\n            improvement program; streamlining access to social programs;\n            and dissemination of best practices and lessons of\n            experience. The second component, Municipal Strengthening,\n            consists of three modules: the basic module is composed of\n            municipal institutional development subprojects that focus\n            on internal processes and improvements; the complementary\n            module focuses on improving the municipality's\n            management of key services by providing technical support to\n            municipality's relationship with the community; and the\n            flexible module finances newer and more innovative\n            subprojects to address specific municipal problems."}, "docdt": "1998-11-18T00:00:00Z"}
