Municipal\n            Development and Decentralization Project for Georgia were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was low or negligible, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: in absence of a\n            law on local budget, signing municipal development\n            agreements (MDAs) between MDF and borrowing local self\n            governments (LSGs) proved to be crucial, especially when\n            arrears/default occurred and some legal actions had to be\n            taken. Loan portfolio management should include a receivable\n            aging analysis method, whose monthly monitoring could inform\n            MDF on the status of arrears. Immediate actions by MDF to\n            respond to arrears and defaults are crucial. A soft stance\n            may encourage other borrowers to default themselves. In the\n            meantime ministry of finance should not bail out any\n            defaulter. Very careful consideration should be given during\n            project design to define 'realistic' cost\n            recovery. Full cost recovery is impossible for several\n            municipal infrastructure investments, e.g. local roads\n            rehabilitation, street lighting, wastewater and drainage.\n            Consideration should be given instead, in such cases, to\n            efficiency and savings in operation and maintenance cost.\n            Unexpected changes in the government's structure and\n            policy may be an opportunity to be seized by the task team\n            to improve project implementation and ensure the new\n            government's commitment to ownership of the project. By\n            the same token, unexpected new donors' support emerging\n            during implementation could be an opportunity, but it\n            requires considerable effort by the Bank team and government\n            to ensure coherence o f the overall support being provided."}, "docdt": "2008-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
