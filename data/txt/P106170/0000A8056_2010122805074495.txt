                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         To achieve sustained improved performance in the management capacity of key departments dealing with any or all of the common functions including financial
                         management, human resource management, policy and regulatory design, and administration. This should ultimately result in improved utilization and cost
                         effectiveness of budgetary resources and faster and better development results on the ground.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         To date, 105 MCPs have been appointed across 25 ministries and agencies. Interviews with MCPs and ministers suggest there is greater impact where there is strong ministry
                         leadership, a cluster of MCPs and international TA is aligned to support MCP's. A monitoring mechanism needs to be established in order to assess program impact at the
                         departmental level. HR practices have improved in 2010, individual performance appraisals are taking place effectively and 4 appointments have been terminated on grounds of poor
                         performance in 2010. The demand for MCP's remains high, especially in reform oriented ministries.

                         The MTR assessed the Project development Objective to be ambitious. The number of appointments made through the program are too few to demonstrate significant impact at
                         departmental levels.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The government has agreed to an independent audit of HR policies and practices.

                         The government has requested funding for an additional 60-80 new MCP posts. At least 70 percent of these will be concentrated on senior management positions in priority ministries
                         which are implementing major reform programs. A revised Results Framework including a new PDO will be prepared.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
