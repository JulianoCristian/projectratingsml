                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         To achieve sustained improved performance in the management capacity of key departments dealing with any or all of the common functions including financial
                         management, human resource management, policy and regulatory design, and administration. This should ultimately result in improved utilization and cost
                         effectiveness of budgetary resources and faster and better development results on the ground.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         By December 2011, more than 150 MCP appointments have been made across 28 ministries/agencies. Better results have been achieved in ministries/agencies having clusters of
                         MCPs and strong ministry leadership to support the MCPs. A monitoring mechanism has been developed by the CSC to assess the program impact at departmental level in the
                         ministries/agencies. MCP appointments are conducted according to merit based procedures and in accordance with the civil service laws and regulations. Till date 5 terminations due
                         to poor performance have been effected. Demand for MCPs has increased continuously in reform oriented ministries/agencies. Teamwork among the MCPs in ministries has
                         improved.
