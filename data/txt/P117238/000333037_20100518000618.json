Malawi (GoM) as it implements\n            the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS) by\n            supporting implementation of policy and institutional\n            reforms that will lead to the following medium-term\n            outcomes: (i) increased agricultural productivity, (ii)\n            increased private sector investment, and (iii) sustained\n            improvements in fiscal management. The program document is\n            divided into six sections, including this introduction.\n            Section two discusses the country context which gives an\n            overview of Malawi, recent economic developments including\n            government's macroeconomic program, macroeconomic\n            outlook, and debt sustainability. Section three presents the\n            Government's program (MGDS); section four discusses how\n            the Bank is supporting the government program, while section\n            five describes the third PRSG. Section six describes\n            implementation issues, with a focus on risks and mitigating measures."}, "docdt": "2010-05-07T00:00:00Z"}
