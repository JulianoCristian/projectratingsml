                         Progress continues to be made in the reform program supported by the PRSC series despite implementation challenges in some policy areas. The Government's efforts to rein on the

                         fiscal deficit have witnessed a narrowing of the deficit from 6% of GDP in 2009 to a surplus of 0.1% of GDP in 2010. The Government has also made great efforts to strengthen public
                         sector financial management and has put measures in place to address problems associated with the management of the parastatals. Additionally, external audit backlogs have now
                         been cleared, discrepancies in the payroll have been reduced and payroll control has improved. The recent payroll reform introduced in February 2011, which requires all civil servant
                         salaries and wages and payments to pensioners to be channeled through the banks is also expected to improve payroll management and reduce the number of ghost workers in the
                         system. On debt management, the country's external and domestic debt remain within sustainable levels at 20.9% and 15.3% of GDP, respectively, at end of FY2009/10, and the
                         Ministry of Finance is also becoming more active in the execution of domestic debt strategy functions, which were until recently were carried out by the Reserve Bank of Malawi. In
                         terms of budget planning and execution, budget classification -2001 GFS coding system and Chart of Accounts, 2010/11 budget alignment to MGDS, IFMIS has already been rolled
                         out to 17 District Councils, with additional 17 District Councils next in line. On business climate, progress has been made in the area of improving contracts enforcement and
                         business licensing through the establishment of the commercial court, resulting in a significant reduction in the time it takes to settle commercial disputes from over 300 days in 2006
                         to about 120 days by 2009. Progress has also been made in the protection of investors, reduction in the number of documents needed to export and imports to 11 (still more efforts
                         are needed to improve trade across the border), reduction in the Central Bank rate from 15% to 13% in August 2010 (access to finance).

                         fully implemented due largely to political economy issues.
