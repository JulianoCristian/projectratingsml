epidemiological transition\n            and the increasing importance of non-communicable diseases\n            of adults; and c) key health policy and financing issues. To\n            achieve these objectives the project will comprise the\n            following components: a) malaria component; b) Sexually\n            Transmitted Disease (STD)/AIDS component; c) nutrition\n            component; d) non-communicable diseases; e) program support\n            component, which contains three subcomponents: health\n            policy, management information systems and health education."}, "docdt": "1996-11-21T00:00:00Z"}
