Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 Overall, the project objectives have been satisfactorily achieved, even exceeding well beyond the original targets. To date,
 approximately 295 low income neighborhoods have been upgraded, directly benefiting over 2.5 million people in low-income
 areas and indirectly benefiting 5 million more. The project has transformed the project areas, which cover up to 90% of the city,
 by upgrading basic infrastructure services such as drainage/sewer collection and primary/tertiary roads, rehabilitating lakes and
 canal, improving cultural and social infrastructures, and in so doing supporting livelihoods of the urban poor. All targets have
 been exceeded, including 29,687 households with improved water connections, 550,106 households with sewer connections and
 improved drainage and 91,392 households with improved electricity. The condition of primary and secondary infrastructure has
 also significantly improved with about 243km of roads, 232 km sewers/drains, 28km of cleaned canals with embankments, and
 7.45 ha of lakes cleaned and improved. In addition, 51,109 micro loans have been made in these neighborhoods for housing
 improvement and 43,751 micro loans for income generation, with very high repayment rates and sound financial management.
 Changes in property values resulting from the improved infrastructure are also significant, and reductions in the time for
 acquiring land use certificates has dropped from 60 days at appraisal to less than 30 days now, exceeding the end of project target
 of 45 days. Significant efforts have been made on institutional strengthening and capacity building, developing a cadre of high
 quality professionals in public institutions across all four cities.
 The Implementation Completion Report will be reviewed in Q3 FY 2015 and will be completed by end June 2015.

 Overall Comments
 In the Results Framework of the Project Paper for Additional Financing, two PDO-level indicators were proposed to measure the indicidence of
 selected diseases and the water quality in the TH-LG Canal. However, these two indicators were not feasible to be monitored by the PMUs and
 therefore were transfered to other monitoring reports. The incidence of diseases indicator will be captured in the Impact Assessment Report, and
 the water quality in the TH-LG Canal indicator in the environmental monitoring report after the upgrading and dredging works are completed.
