Date achieved                   03/31/2004         12/31/2012 12/31/2014                12/31/2014
Comments        PAD had no baselines or targets; baseline and target values are from the AF
                Project Paper. Combined achievements for all four cities: water supply >98%,
                sanitation >94%, electricity 100%, public lighting 100%.
Indicator 2:    Reduced incidence of selected diseases

Comments        PAD had no baselines or targets. MTR attempted to measure achievements but
                results inconclusive, and indicator was dropped in the AFPP. Impact evaluation
                shows significant decreases in incidence of common water-borne diseases in all
                cities.
Indicator 3:    Reduced flooding
Value                                     0                NA              NA                  NA

Comments        PAD had no baselines or targets. Property values in the project areas increased
                significantly since 2004 as reported by real estate agencies, although these
                increases cannot be uniquely attributed to project interventions.
Indicator 5:    Reduction in time and cost of acquiring BOLUCs/LUCs
Value                          > 8 months                   NA         15 days           15-40 days

I. Disbursement Profile
1.      Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
Urban Poverty in Vietnam. In 2000, over 30% of the population of Vietnam was living
below the poverty line.1 Although the national poverty rate had steadily declined since the
early 1990s, poverty in urban areas actually increased during the same period. Official
statistics indicated that in 2000 fewer than 10% of the nation’s poor lived in urban areas. The
number was probably significantly higher, given that many urban migrants remained
registered in the rural areas from which they had migrated. Moreover, the urban population
was increasing at rates of over 3% per annum, almost twice the national population growth
rate. The majority of the urban poor worked in the informal sector with unstable jobs, highly
volatile incomes, and limited access to credit. Low-income areas in Vietnam cities were
characterized by high population densities, poorly maintained infrastructure, and inadequate
social services. The quality of housing was generally low, and settlements were often
unplanned with encroachment around lakes, canals and natural waterways. Many houses did
not have access to piped water and virtually no sewerage connections existed. Toilets usually
discharged directly into drains, canals and lakes, causing severe health and environmental
risks. Frequent floods adversely affected economic activity, public health, and the general
quality of life of the urban poor.
Government Policies to Address Urban Poverty. In 1998, the Government of Vietnam
(GoV) issued the Orientation Master Plan for Urban Development to Year 2020 that would
serve as the principle policy document for urban development during most of the 2000s. This
Plan identified three key constraints to urban development in Vietnam: (i) the lack of
adequate infrastructure, (ii) environmental degradation, particularly the lack of adequate
sanitary facilities; and (iii) limited institutional capacity to manage urban growth. The Master
Plan set targets for coverage of piped water and sewerage, transportation, power, housing and
the provision of open space, and recognized the importance of providing security of tenure
through the issuance of land use rights certificates to increase the supply of housing and
improve the existing stock. The Master Plan also advocated for improving access of credit to
the poor, forging partnerships between government and civil society, improving access to
information, and building social capital to help the poor break out of the cycle of poverty.
Enforcing better planning and building regulations and developing a more efficient real estate
market were also considered high priorities.
Vietnam Urban Upgrading Project. In 2003, GoV requested Bank support to help prepare
and finance a project aimed at upgrading low-income areas in selected cities in accordance
with its Orientation Master Plan for Urban Development. The project would cover 137 wards
in four cities: Hai Phong and Nam Dinh in the north and Can Tho and Ho Chi Minh City
(HCMC) in the south. The Ministry of Construction (MOC) and the governments of the four
cities were appointed as the implementing agencies of the project, which became known as
the Vietnam Urban Upgrading Project (VUUP). 2 VUUP did not only address GoV’s
development objectives, but was also fully consistent with the Bank’s Country Assistance

     East Asia: A Review of Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam.

     The PAD and other Bank documents refer to the city governments and the Ministry of Construction as
     “executing agencies”. This was taken to mean “implementing agencies” in the context of this ICR.

sustainable development, and promoting good governance.

1.2 Original Project Development Objective and Key Performance Indicators
Project Development Objective
The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) stated that the project development objective (PDO)
is: “to alleviate poverty in urban areas by improving the living and environmental conditions
of the urban poor using participatory planning methods and influencing planning processes to
become more inclusive and pro-poor”. The PDO in the Development Credit Agreement
(DCA) was slightly different, especially with regards to the definition of project beneficiaries.
It defined the PDO as: “to alleviate poverty in urban areas by improving the environmental
and living conditions of the urban poor in the Project Cities through the use of participatory
planning methods and the promotion of more inclusive and pro-poor urban planning
processes” (emphasis added). The PDO in the DCA will be used for this ICR.
Outcome indicators
#1 Improved service coverage (water supply, sanitation, sewerage, electricity, public ligh-
   ting coverage)
#2 Reduced incidence of selected diseases
#3 Reduced flooding
#4 Change in property values in project sites
#5 Reduction in time and cost of acquiring Building Ownership and Land Use Certificates
   (BOLUCs) / Land Use Certificates (LUCs)
#6 Operational sustainability of participating microcredit lending institutions

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators
The PDO was not revised during project implementation. However, in the Additional
Financing Project Paper (AFPP), two new outcome indicators were added to the monitoring
and evaluation framework to measure the outcomes of the construction of the Tan Hoa–Lo
Gom (THLG) Canal, which would be financed from the Additional Financing:
#7 Reduced flooding in THLG Canal Area (replacing Indicator #3 above)
#8 Improved water quality in THLG Canal
The AFPP also set targets for some—but not all— outcome indicators and intermediate
results indicators as none were set in the PAD. The year in which the targets should be
achieved was shifted from December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2014 in line with the two-
year extension of the Credit closing date (See Section 1.7).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
The intended primary beneficiaries of the project consisted of over 1.9 million people living
in the four project cities, of which about 1.4 million lived in HCMC (Table 1). Approximately
45% of the targeted population lived in low-income areas (LIAs) and the remainder in
adjacent areas. The population of the LIAs (see PAD, Annex 2) would benefit directly from
improved access to a range of infrastructure services (clean water supply, sanitation,
sewerage, solid waste management, electricity, roads and public lighting coverage) which
would generate substantial social and environmental benefits (notably public health benefits


                                               2
through a reduction in water-borne diseases, improved accessibility to other parts of the city,
and reduced crime and violence). The project would also improve access to home
improvement loans and reduce the time and cost of applying for BOLUCs and LUCs. These
measures, combined with planned investments in infrastructure improvement, would increase
economic activities in LIAs and result in higher property values. The population in adjacent
areas would benefit indirectly from spill-over effects from improved infrastructure in LIAs,
notably investments in primary and secondary roads and drains. Secondary beneficiaries
would be: (i) Ministry of Construction (MOC), which would benefit from increased capacity,
(ii) governments of the project cities, which would benefit from training and institutional
strengthening aimed at improving their planning capabilities, (iii) communities in the LIAs,
which would be trained in the planning of small-scale infrastructure projects, and (iv)
microcredit institutions, which would benefit from technical assistance (TA) and advisory
services.

1.5 Original Components
The project consisted of seven components; the first six of these were implemented in each of
the four project cities by the Provincial People’s Committee (PPC) of the respective city.
Component 7 was implemented by MOC at the central level.
Component 1: Tertiary Infrastructure Upgrading and Service Improvements. Project
Cost: US$87 million (60% Bank financing) 3
This component was designed to finance a package of tertiary infrastructure and services in
LIAs to be covered by the project. Each package would consist of improvements to water
supply, drainage, paved access, electricity, sanitation and solid waste management combined
into a single package of works. In some LIAs, the package would also include the construc-
tion or rehabilitation of market infrastructure, public restrooms, and educational or health
facilities. Investments in each LIA would be selected with the active participation of
community members, who would be represented in Community Committees. Design
consultants would meet with the committees (and, where relevant, with municipal utilities) to
prepare Community Upgrading Plans (CUPs). A CUP would contain detailed investment
plans, management structures, financial and implementation arrangements for operations and

    Project cost amounts presented in this section do not include contingencies or taxes (which were not
    available by component).



                                                       3
maintenance (O&M) and an environmental management plan.
Component 2: Complementary Primary and Secondary Infrastructure. Project Cost:
US$226.6 million (55% Bank financing)

This component was designed to finance the improvement of primary and secondary
infrastructure required to complement the tertiary infrastructure improvements financed
under Component 1. Investments in this component would mainly consist of improvements
to existing roads and bridges, drainage networks and sewers, water supply systems and the
construction of pumping stations. The works would be carried out under separate contracts
from tertiary works, and would involve relevant city government departments and public
utilities.

Component 3: Resettlement Housing. Project Cost: US$34.3 million (20% Bank financing)

Although infrastructure financed under Components 1 and 2 were designed with a view to
minimize resettlement, it was anticipated that about 5,400 households would nonetheless
need to relocate. The majority of these consisted of migrant households who had settled along
canals and lakes, creating hazards to their health and the health of others. At the time of
appraisal, the majority of households that would need to be resettled had opted for replace-
ment housing in resettlement sites that had been secured by the project city governments.
This option was allowed under the Bank's policy on Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12).
The project would finance resettlement housing for the poor and site development costs
related to resettlement housing. (Participating cities preferred to build a combination of low-
cost housing and housing aimed at more affluent citizens; the project would exclusively
finance costs directly related to resettlement housing for the urban poor.)

Component 4: Land and Housing Management. Project Cost: US$1.7 million (71% Bank
financing)

This component financed TA and training to strengthen the administration of land use
certificates, which was decentralized to local governments shortly before project preparation
started. Depending on the existing capacity of the relevant departments, assistance would be
provided for the: (i) establishment of a networked land administration and housing
management information system; (ii) completion of cadastral maps to accelerate the issuance
of certificates; (iii) supporting administrative and organizational restructuring; and/or (iv)
simplifying procedures for issuing BOLUCs or LUCs. In accordance with Vietnamese law,
women's names would be included in all certificates issued.
Component 5: Housing Improvement Loan Program. Project Cost: US$15.5 million (97%
Bank financing)

The purpose of this component was to: (i) provide poor households in LIAs with access to
credit to improve their housing, and (ii) strengthen the housing microfinance system to facili-
tate the provision of housing improvement loans to the urban poor in general. The component
would provide capital to five partner organizations, which would lend this capital to eligible
households as micro-credit for housing improvement. The component would also deliver TA,
training and equipment to strengthen the capacities of these organizations. The selected
partner organizations were: (i) Capital Aid Fund for Employment of the Poor (CEP) in


                                              4
HCMC4; (ii) Mekong Housing Bank (MHB) in Can Tho; and (iii) Women’s Union (WU) in
three out of four project cities.
Component 6: Capacity Building. Project Cost: US$10.1 million (35% Bank financing)
This component was designed to provide technical assistance and training for:
    city, district and ward level authorities, to strengthen participatory planning, design and
     implementation;
    municipal utilities and district authorities, to improve O&M of project-financed works,
    communities, to participate effectively in project planning and design, and organize
     information education and communication campaigns to promote better sanitation
     practices; and
    PMUs, to build the required capacity in project management, procurement and contract
     management, financial management, auditing, monitoring of environmental and
     resettlement action plans, and monitoring and evaluation of the project.
This component would also finance equipment to support PMU operations.
Component 7: Development of a National Urban Upgrading Program. Project Cost:
US$1 million (0% Bank financing)
This component was designed to provide TA and training to MOC to help: (i) develop a
National Urban Upgrading Program that would apply the principles of urban upgrading used
for VUUP to cities across Vietnam, and (ii) evaluate the progress and impact of VUUP on a
continuous basis.

1.6 Revised Components
The components remained unchanged during project implementation, but their scope was
expanded and costs and financing increased, especially for Component 2 (see Section 1.7 and
Annex 1).

1.7 Other Significant Changes
Withdrawal of AFD Financing. At appraisal, GoV expected to receive a loan of
approximately US$37.5 million equivalent from the Agence Française de Développement
(AFD, French bilateral aid agency) to help finance infrastructure improvements in the THLG
Canal basin in HCMC. In 2005, it became clear that AFD was unable to provide the
requested financing, and the planned infrastructure improvements to the THLG Canal were
instead financed from the AF.
Additional Financing. In September 2009, the Bank approved an IDA Credit (Cr. 4604) of
US$160 million equivalent for AF with a closing date of December 31, 2014. It would co-

 In Phase 2, the Program was opened to two additional partners: the Ho Chi Minh Fund for Housing
Development (HOF) and the HCMC branch of the Vietnam Bank of Social Policies (VVBSP-HCM).




                                               5
finance: (i) increases in the cost of Components 1, 2 and 3 arising from unforeseen increases
in prices of labor and construction materials (US$31.2 million), and (ii) an expansion in the
scope of works needed for improvements of the THLG canal in HCMC (about US$129
million, including the financing gap of US37.5 million created by the withdrawal of AFD –
which had increased by US$50 million due to inflation, US$16 million for additional waste
water interceptor, and US$24 million for price and physical contingencies). With approval of
the AF, the estimated project cost rose to US$580 million (see Annex 1).


2.    Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Soundness of background analysis and lessons learned from previous projects. The
project’s background analysis was extensive and lessons learned were drawn from other
relevant projects. In terms of background analysis, a comprehensive poverty mapping exer-
cise was carried out in all four cities to identify LIAs according to agreed criteria, based on
which the areas were prioritized for interventions. In terms of lessons learned, the project
benefited from a wealth of upgrading projects financed by the Bank and other donors in East
Asia and internationally, which demonstrated a relationship between enhancing the living
conditions of the poor and poverty alleviation5. Poor infrastructure, lack of access to basic
services, and dilapidated housing conditions create a host of conditions that trap residents in
chronic poverty and prevent them from seeking or maintaining income-generating
opportunities. It was also seen that taking a sectoral approach had inherent weaknesses so a
multi-sectoral approach was chosen to transform the living and environmental conditions in
the selected LIAs. The approach included the introduction of components that went beyond
standard upgrading to include a housing microfinance program to enable households to
improve their homes in tandem with improvements in infrastructure, and a land administra-
tion component to ensure security of tenure for the affected residents. The approach also
included the upgrading of complementary primary and secondary trunk infrastructure to
enhance the impacts of tertiary infrastructure improvements in the LIAs.
International experience also showed that strong community participation and financial
contributions towards project costs could increase the sense of ownership of the investments
by residents and contribute to O&M, and therefore to sustainability. As a result, community
input in the selection of investments and designs was introduced as a core project principle. A
thorough affordability analysis of low-income households was also carried out to ensure that
the level of community contributions, rising costs of services due to the project investments,
and costs associated with resettlement would not negatively affect the residents. Financial
analyses of the municipalities and the utilities responsible for sewerage and drainage were
also conducted.

  This is now widely known as “multidimensional poverty”, which is made up of several factors that
constitute poor people's experience of deprivation – such as poor health, lack of education, inadequate
living standards, lack of income (as one of several factors considered), disempowerment, poor quality of
work, and threat from violence.




                                                     6
Assessment of Project Design. The project was appropriately designed around five
principles: (i) active participation by communities; (ii) use of functional standards
commensurate with affordability and willingness-to-pay; (iii) minimization of resettlement;
(iv) coverage of all residents in the project area, irrespective of their registration status; and
(v) adoption of a multi-sectoral approach. “In-situ” upgrading was chosen instead of
clearance and reconstruction because of lower resettlement costs that would allow a greater
number of beneficiaries, and because it better preserves the social fabric which the poor rely
on, in times of need. The project also allocated sufficient resources for capacity building
through a PHRD-financed grant for training and TA, and by including sufficient funds for
safeguards, supervision and monitoring activities in the cost estimates for civil works. The
two social and environmental safeguards policies triggered were properly assessed and
adequate safeguard measures were put in place. Nevertheless, the core PDO of alleviating
poverty was set, in retrospect, overly ambitious. Project components were capable of
improving living and environmental conditions, although the land and housing management
and the housing improvement components added complexity to an already challenging
project. One notable shortcoming was the project’s old log-frame style results framework,
which lacked KPI demonstrating clear linkages between the project’s outputs and its poverty
alleviation objective (see Section 2.3) or targets to measure achievements.
Adequacy of Government commitment, stakeholder involvement, and participatory
processes. GoV’s commitment to the project was strong and involved stakeholders at central
as well as city levels. Indeed, the first project principle emphasized participatory processes
and involved multiple stakeholders at the local level (including but not limited to
communities, city governments, wastewater utilities and microcredit providers). City
governments were also highly committed to the project, as evidenced, inter alia, by their
willingness to use their own financial resources to hire consultants to prepare studies and
designs that were not covered by project preparation grants.
Assessment of Risks and Risk Mitigation Measures. The PAD identified nine risks, the
most critical of which were; (i) limited capacity of PMUs to manage large numbers of
contracts; and (ii) limited affordability of low-income households for resettlement, with a
conservative overall risk rating of “substantial” after mitigation. Although the proposed
mitigation measures were generally on target, several important risks were not identified at
appraisal, including; (i) timely availability of funding from the Bank and its co-financing
partners (there was no formal agreement with AFD to provide co-financing of US$37.5
million, and the extent of physical and price contingencies—which, taken together, accounted
for only about 7% of the base cost—was unusually low for a country with a history of high
inflation); (ii) impact of possible natural disasters; (iii) ability of city governments to foster
participatory planning; and (iv) timely resolution of an unclear status of affected persons who
did not have a legal title to land.
Quality at Entry. On balance, the background analysis of the project was sound but led to a
complex, challenging project design in four geographical areas. While project components
were capable of leading to poverty reduction, the design lacked a strong monitoring and
evaluation framework to track progress toward poverty alleviation attributable to project
interventions. For these reasons, quality at entry is rated “moderately satisfactory”.

2.2 Implementation




                                                7
Start-up. The project was approved on April 29, 2004 and became effective on October 6,
2004 (about two months later than envisaged). Because the project was complex and
contained elements that were new to the participating cities (notably the participatory
planning approach and the home improvement loan component), it was anticipated that
implementation would initially be slow. In practice, implementation was even slower than
expected, with the overall rating for implementation progress downgraded to “moderately
satisfactory” as of March 2007. The main reasons were:
 Delays in securing community participation. Because the active involvement of commu-
    nities in the planning, monitoring and maintenance of public infrastructure was new to
    Vietnam, the newly established PMUs did not have established relationships with the
    targeted communities, and communities were not familiar with and, at times, were
    mistrustful of working with city government officials. Further, the schedules of the
    working poor were often unpredictable, which made convening participatory working
    sessions difficult; in particular, it was challenging to fulfill the 60% community participa-
    tion and gender balance targets. Additional efforts (and financial resources) were put in
    by the PMUs to build productive working relationships with the communities and ensure
    their meaningful participation, which ended up being key to the successful
    implementation of the tertiary infrastructure component.
 Delays in resettlement and payment of compensation. The project needed more time than
    expected to organize resettlement and compensation payments, mainly because; (i)
    verifying the legal status of eligible households took longer than anticipated; (ii)
    compensation payments had to be adjusted repeatedly due to changes in market prices of
    land (see Section 2.4 for details); and (iii) land acquisition and compensation were
    financed by Counterpart Funds, which were often inadequate since the provinces did not
    have full control over this allocation and also faced competing demands from various
    sectors. Regular supervision by the Bank and dialogue with City leadership team was
    instrumental to address these challenges.
 Delays in procurement. Procurement was significantly delayed during the first years of
    implementation, mainly because of the limited experience of PMU staff with the Bank's
    procurement procedures and a shortage of funds for advance preparation of detailed
    designs and bidding documents. To improve procurement capacity, GoV and the Bank
    provided training and TA, promoted experience-sharing, and delegated decision-making
    authority to the PMUs, which improved procurement substantially in later years (see
    Section 2.4 for details).
 Delays caused by changes in engineering designs. The extent to which detailed enginee-
    ring designs needed to be modified was higher than expected, mainly because of unantici-
    pated changes in: (i) physical conditions of project areas; (ii) underground facilities (such
    as water pipes and telephone cables); and (iii) additional tertiary infrastructure requested
    by participating communities. Some of the designs from Community Upgrading Plans
    also deviated from the overdesigned Master Plans of the respective cities and created
    delays in the appraisal and approval processes at the provincial level. The Bank promptly
    carried out just-in-time policy dialogues with the national Ministry of Construction to
    issue appropriate guidelines to facilitate these processes.
Mid-Term. During August-September 2009 the Bank conducted a mid-term review, which
focused on resolving issues that were delaying implementation. The review resulted in a
series of recommendations, the most important of which were summarized in the Bank’s
management letter to the Government.


                                               8
   ensure that all project cities made the required counterpart funds available to enable land
    acquisition and payment of compensation to be carried out in a timely manner;
   ensure that project cities improve coordination with their utilities to reduce the time
    required for the relocation of underground facilities;
   ensure that all project cities adequately fulfilled their obligations stipulated in Decree
    131/2006/NĐ-CP on management and utilization of development aid;
   amend the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) to change the size of housing
    improvement loans and allow PMU staff to participate in overseas training and study
    tours; and
   take appropriate action to meet the effectiveness conditions of the AF (the agreement for
    the AF was to be signed shortly after completion of the mid-term review).

By mid-2010, GoV and the implementing agencies had implemented all of the above
recommendations except for the amendment of the DCA, which was not deemed a priority by
GoV and the project cities). Although availability of counterpart funds improved, delays in
compensation payments persisted (see Section 2.4 and Annex 9 for details).
Extension. With the approval of the AF in September 2009, the Credit closing date was
moved from December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2014, bringing the entire implementation
period to 10 years and three months. Most of the AF were used to finance the rehabilitation of
the THLG Canal. Implementation of this sub-project faced challenges, including last-minute
design changes due to changes in soil conditions that could not reasonably have been
foreseen. As a result, some of the works were not completed by the Credit closing date. In
response, the Bank extended the final date by which the PMU could submit withdrawal
applications for THLG Canal contracts by two months (until June 30, 2015) and HCMC
government used its own funds to finance works no longer covered by the AF. The
rehabilitated canal was formally inaugurated by the President of Vietnam in April 2015.
Factors affecting the project outside the control of the implementing agencies.
   Unexpectedly high price inflation in 2008. From mid-2007 to the end of 2008, Viet Nam
    experienced an unusually high level of price inflation. As a result, the cost of contracts
    tendered after 2007 was significantly higher than expected, and resulted in a financing
    gap of US$31.2 million (see also Section 1.7). High inflation also created gaps between
    bid prices and cost estimates that were prepared prior to inflation, causing procurement
    delays as a number of packages needed to be rebid.
   Withdrawal of AFD support. This further widened the financing gap by US$37.5 million,
    which was the planned AFD loan amount. The financing gap from this AFD withdrawal
    and cost overruns due to inflation has been covered by the Additional Financing credit
    (see also Section 1.7).
   Increased price competition among contractors during the extension. This unexpected
    development resulted in cost savings of about US$37 million mainly in HCMC. A portion
    of these savings were used by the cities to undertake additional upgrading works based on
    established project principles. These works were completed within the extension period,
    even though the cities had to quickly mobilize an unanticipated amount of counterpart
    funding for resettlement and compensation. However, cost savings were also collected
    from these final contracts, and in the end, together with all other unused contingencies
    amounts, the project had to cancel US$32.5 million.



                                              9
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
Rating: Modest

M&E Design. Against a PDO that was set over ambitious, monitoring and evaluation of
progress toward the project’s PDO and outputs was based on a results framework that
contained key performance indicators (KPIs) for the measurement of the PDO and the
planned outputs (six outcome indicators and 10 intermediate results indicators).6 The project
relied on the old style log-frame which did not contain time-bound targets for KPIs against
which progress could be measured; it also did not contain baseline values to facilitate a
comparison with the “without project” case (even though this was reportedly a lesson
learned). Several KPIs were not clearly defined (such as “reduced flooding” or “reduced
incidence of selected diseases”) and some were not uniquely attributable to the project (e.g.
“change in property values in project sites” or “reduction in time and cost of acquiring
BOLUCs/LUCs”). Moreover, none of the KPIs measured poverty reduction in the LIAs even
though the core PDO was to alleviate poverty.
When the AF was prepared, the project paper redefined some of the KPIs and intermediate
indicators, retroactively set certain baselines, and defined time-bound targets for all seven
components. It also introduced two new indicators related to the THLG Canal, one of which
––a planned reduction of COD levels from 800mg/l to 50 mg/l ––seemed overly ambitious in
the absence of wastewater treatment facilities. However, for eight of the 18 KPIs, no
baseline values were established or time-bound targets set, and no KPI related to measuring
poverty reduction was included (see Datasheet, Section F).
M&E Implementation. PMUs regularly reported achieved values for most intermediate
results indicators and some outcome indicators, but required Bank support to track others
(mostly non-physical KPIs such as “reduced incidence of selected diseases” and “reduced
flooding”). Because PMUs were understaffed during most of the implementation period,
M&E was accorded relatively low priority vis-à-vis contract management. The project
financed two evaluations: (i) an evaluation of the housing improvement loan program in
2012; and (ii) an impact assessment covering the entire project in 2014 (“the Impact
Assessment”). Without a relevant indicator, the project did not monitor or evaluate changes in
poverty incidence in LIAs covered by the project, even though poverty alleviation in these
areas was the primary objective of the project. During the early stage, the Bank proposed to
retroactively establish baseline values for poverty (as well as the incidence of selected
diseases), but this relatively costly assessment was not conducted because GoV could not
afford the required budget (about US$1 million). The evaluation of housing improvement
loans did not assess the impact of this component on poverty.
M&E Utilization. The Bank used data collected by PMUs to monitor physical progress of
works and, once the AF was approved, also monitored achievements against the time-bound
targets listed in the project paper. This enabled the Bank to identify and remedy problems and
incorporate better controls as the project progressed, and fine-tune the targeting of resources
to areas with the greatest need (this was especially relevant for the allocation of cost savings
identified during the extension). City government PMUs primarily used the M&E system to

monitor physical progress and compliance with provisions in the DCA, but not to monitor
progress based on the results framework in the legal agreements. The Impact Assessment and
the evaluation of the home improvement loan program were mainly used for the preparation
of the Government’s project completion report (see Annex 7) and this ICR.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards
Overview. The project could cause significant adverse social and environmental impacts and
was therefore classified as Environmental Category “A”. The project triggered safeguards
related to environmental assessment (OP/BP 4.01), involuntary resettlement (OP/BP 4.12),
and indigenous peoples (OP 4.20). To address these potential impacts, the Borrower
developed an Environmental Management Framework, a Resettlement Policy Framework
(RPF) and an Ethnic Minority Development Strategy (EMDS) for the project as a whole.
These frameworks and strategy formed the basis of the implementation of the safeguards
policies in the participating cities. Construction of the THLG Canal, which was financed
from the proceeds of the AF, also triggered the Bank’s safeguard policy on physical cultural
resources (OP 4.11). Compliance with the four safeguard policies is discussed below. Table 2
provides dates on which relevant safeguard documents were made publicly available.

Environmental Assessment. For each project city, two types of environmental assessments
(EAs) were prepared: (i) Community Environmental Management Plans for Component 1
sub-projects (tertiary infrastructure), which emphasized a participatory approach to
identifying environmental solutions at community level; and (ii) Environmental Impact
Assessments (EIAs) and Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) for sub-projects under
Components 2 and 3 (higher-level infrastructure and resettlement housing, respectively).
These EAs were only prepared for sub-projects that were identified at the time of appraisal
(so-called “Phase I Investments”). EAs for sub-projects identified at a later stage were based
on an Environmental Assessment Safeguards Framework (EASF) that was agreed with GoV
and the project cities before DCA negotiations. The main environmental risk of the THLG
Canal, by far the largest individual sub-project financed by VUUP, was posed by the
handling, transportation and disposal of over 90,000 m3 of dredged material, and a sludge
management plan was subsequently included in the sub-project’s EIA and EMP.
Involuntary Resettlement. Based on the RPF, resettlement action plans (RAPs) were prepared
for each city, initially covering Phase I investments only. At appraisal, it was anticipated that
over 4,800 households would need to be relocated permanently; in addition, over 16,700
house-holds would be adversely affected on a temporary basis (these figures include


                                               11
appraisal estimates for the AF; see Table 3 for details). At the detailed design stage, efforts
were made to minimize adverse social impacts and thereby resettlement requirements
through realignments, scale reductions and other modification. As a result, the number of
households that needed to be relocated was about 40% lower than at appraisal (2,917 instead
of 4,859). Compensation and resettlement costs were nonetheless substantially higher than
envisaged at appraisal (US$188.5 million instead of US$111.3 million), because of higher-
than-expected increases in land and asset prices. The number of partially affected households
was 14% higher than estimated, caused mainly additional investments in the AF. All
adversely affected persons, including informal settlers, were financially compensated for
their estimated losses at replacement cost and supported to maintain the living standards and
income-earning capacity that they enjoyed before the start of sub-project construction.
Surveys undertaken by independent resettlement monitoring consultants confirmed that most
affected households were able to maintain or improve their pre-project living standards.
However, the project encountered significant delays in organizing resettlement and
compensation payments, the main reasons being: (i) verifying the legal status of eligible
households took longer than expected (illegal encroachment was a particular problem); (ii)
many households only wanted to resettle or receive compensation on days considered
auspicious; and (iii) GoV cost norms were often outdated, and compensation payments
needed to be adjusted repeatedly for changes in market prices of land.

Indigenous People. During preparation, it appeared that the project could adversely affect a
Khmer minority group in Can Tho. A survey undertaken in 2003 found that Phase I invest-
ments would affect about 25 Khmer households in and around the city. Based on the survey,
the PPC of Can Tho prepared an EMDS for these households and approved the plan in July
2003. Because the households were scattered—and did not form a cohesive group—there
was no need for a separate ethnic minority development plan. Sub-projects developed after
Phase I were not expected to affect indigenous people in Can Tho or any of the other project
cities.
Physical Cultural Resources. Rehabilitation of THLG Canal adversely affected shrines and
temples located near the canal. To address these impacts, a series of mitigation measures has
developed in consultation with (and with the agreement of) the property owners. These
measures included relocation and compensation for shrines that would be permanently
affected by the canal rehabilitation, and fencing and appropriate work schedules for temples
that would be partially affected during rehabilitation. The agreed measures were incorporated
in the relevant EIA and RAP.
Summary of Compliance with Safeguard Policies. Compliance with all four safeguard
policies was satisfactory throughout project implementation. However, with regards to



                                              12
involuntary resettlement, there were substantial delays in resettlement and payment of
compensation although adversely affected households were adequately compensated.

Fiduciary Compliance
Financial Management. Supervision missions found that the project’s financial management
was generally satisfactory. The implementing agencies employed qualified staff, had
established appropriate accounting and internal control systems, and implemented the
recommendations of the auditor without undue delay. As a result, the financial management
systems were able to provide a high level of assurance that the proceeds of the Credit were
used for their intended purposes. The implementing agencies submitted quarterly and annual
financial reports of acceptable quality in a timely manner. Annual financial reports were
audited by an independent auditor and the reports of all four cities received an unqualified
opinion from their external auditors in all years from 2004 to 2014, except for the reports of
Hai Phong (2010, 2011 and 2012) and Nam Dinh (2009 and 2010). The auditors’ opinions of
these reports were qualified because of incomplete recording of community contributions,
inclusion of expenditure on resettlement housing outside the scope of the project, and
incorrect treatment of withholding tax. Both cities eventually implemented the auditors’
recommendations, and their financial reports subsequently received unqualified opinions.
Governance. The project also established a grievance redress mechanism for the resettlement
program. All project cities used the system until the end of the implementation period. By
project closing, 571 complaints had been received, of which 568 were addressed. The three
outstanding cases are being resolved as relevant investments have been transferred to projects
financed by the Cities’ own funds.
Procurement. Initially, procurement was less than satisfactory as PMU staff had little or no
experience with the Bank’s procurement procedures. This problem was exacerbated by a
shortage of funds for advance preparation of detailed designs and bidding documents, and by
the fact that PMUs and city governments were sometimes unwilling to make decisions
without formal approval from higher-level authorities, even after decision-making authority
was delegated to them. As a result, the procurement and subsequent execution of project-
financed contracts was significantly delayed during the initial years of implementation. To
improve procurement capacity, GoV and the Bank provided training and technical assistance,
experience-sharing, and delegated decision-making authority to PMUs. Thanks to these and
other measures, procurement and contract management improved substantially in later years
in all PMUs. Eventually, the project financed over 430 contracts, all of which complied with
the Bank’s procurement guidelines. (The Bank declared “misprocurement” for a relatively
small civil works contract that a PMU decided not to award.) At closing, procurement was
rated “Satisfactory”.

2.5 Post-Completion Operation/Next Phase
(a)   Transition Arrangements. Responsibility for O&M of primary and secondary
      infrastructure financed by the project was transferred to municipal utilities (water
      supply systems, sewerage networks) or city government departments (roads, bridges,




                                             13
        drains).7 O&M expenditures would be financed from user charges and city government
        subsidies. City government departments and utilities are generally well-staffed and
        adequately funded, with the exception of O&M budgets for sewerage and drains.
        Communities were made responsible to maintain tertiary roads and drains in their LIAs
        (and collect user charges to finance repairs); city governments and utilities would
        operate and maintain public lighting and piped water connections. The impact
        assessment of 2014 indicated that project beneficiaries were generally able and willing
        to pay for O&M expenditures of tertiary infrastructure in their LIAs.
(b) Follow-up Projects. In March 2012, the Bank approved a US$292 million IDA Credit
    for the Mekong Delta Region Urban Upgrading Project (Cr. 5083), the design of which
    was largely based on VUUP. In addition, a results-based National Urban Development
    Program in the Northern Mountains (approved in June 2014) also adopted upgrading
    principles from VUUP for investments in LIAs. Other sectoral operations in transport,
    flood risk management, and water and sanitation are on-going (or are under preparation)
    in project cities, including: Hai Phong Urban Transport Project (approved in March
    2011); proposed Can Tho Urban Development and Resilience Project (planned for
    March 2016); Second HCMC Environmental Sanitation Project (approved in 2014);
    HCMC Green Transport Project (approved in 2015); and proposed HCMC Flood Risk
    Management Project (planned for March 2016).
(c)     Future Impact Evaluation. No evaluation was planned after the project impact
        assessment was completed in early 2015 (see Annex 5 for details).

3.      Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objective, Design and Implementation
Relevance of Objective
Rating: High
The project development objective (PDO) was highly consistent with the Bank Vietnam CAS
2003-2006, a key theme of which was to enhance equitable, socially inclusive and
sustainable development, including addressing the needs of the urban poor. There were
pockets of deep poverty in cities, especially associated with migrants and unregistered
residents. The PDO remains highly relevant to the current CPS 2012-2016, which strongly
emphasize broadening access to economic and social opportunities. These include efforts to
continue to sustainably increase access to water supply and sanitation service, and upgrade
living conditions in poor urban neighborhoods, addressing challenges linked to rapid
urbanization and an emerging group of urban poor and vulnerable households.
The PDO was highly relevant to the 2003 Vietnam Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and
Growth Strategy (CPRGS), which translated the vision laid out in Vietnam's Ten-Year Socio-
Economic Development Strategy for 2001-2010 into concrete public actions. One of the
targets of the CPRGS was the provision of basic infrastructure services to extremely
disadvantaged groups and the urban poor under the strategic objective of an equitable,

socially inclusive, and sustainable pattern of growth. The objective remains strongly aligned
with the strategic development agenda laid out in Vietnam’s five -year Socio-Economic
Development Plan for 2011-2015 and the Socio-Economic Development Strategy for 2011-
2020, which emphasize efforts to create equal opportunities for access to resources for
development, basic services, and social welfare in rural and urban areas, as well as to
continue with policies for sustainable poverty reduction (especially in the poorest districts
and among ethnic minorities), and to improve the quality of social services.
Relevance of Design
Rating: Substantial
As described in Section 2.1, the project’s components and implement ation arrangements
were thoughtfully designed and likely to result in the achievement of the PDO. Six of the
seven components directly aimed at improving environmental and living conditions in low-
income areas, which was highly relevant and corresponded to GoV’s own plans and priorities.
Components 1 and 2 would provide tertiary and complementary primary and secondary infra-
structure aimed at improving environmental and living conditions of the urban poor, and the
provision of tertiary infrastructure was planned through comprehensive poverty mapping and
with the active participation of the intended beneficiaries. Component 3 would provide
resettlement housing to persons who needed to relocate because of infrastructure financed by
the project. Component 4 would help make it easier and less costly for the urban poor to
obtain LUCs and BOLUCs, a prerequisite for obtaining credit, which became more available
under Component 5. However, the results framework was not adequate, primarily because no
targets were set or baseline values measured for most performance indicators and did not
measure the impact of the interventions on poverty alleviation in the project areas. Therefore
relevance of design is rated “substantial.”

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objective (Efficacy)
Rating: Substantial
Poverty Alleviation. At appraisal, poverty incidence in urban areas in Vietnam was
estimated at 15%. According to the Impact Assessment, poverty incidence in LIAs covered
by the project—when measured by housing conditions—was far higher, ranging from 40% to
54%, and urban poverty correlates strongly with informal housing and slums. At closing,
poverty incidence in project areas had dropped significantly in all four participating cities
especially in Hai Phong and HCMC (Table 4).

In addition, with data from a stratified random sample household survey, the Impact
Assessment team found evidence indicating that the project had led to significant poverty
reduction: poverty headcount ratio in project areas in each of the four cities declining
dramatically from 16-27 percentage points above the national poverty ratio in 2004 to 4-6
percentage points below the national ratio in 2013.8 However, in the absence of: (i) a rigorous
evaluation that compares changes in poverty incidence in project areas to changes in a control
group of LIAs to show the direct causal effect of the project interventions on poverty
alleviation; or (ii) a well-defined M&E system with KPIs capable of measuring poverty
reduction, this report will argue for the project’s efficacy using results from other s tudies
where needed.
A wide body of literature9 looks at poverty reduction from a multidimensional perspective –
defining poverty as deprivation from good health, education, living standards, income,
empowerment, etc. The common practice consists of defining a threshold in each dimension
of well-being, and claiming that an agent is deprived in a dimension if he/she experiences a
lower level than the threshold. The primary means to alleviate urban poverty in the
participating cities is to improve well-being in each dimension; this project sought to improve
environmental and living conditions in the LIAs covered by the project. The project aimed to
achieve this objective through investments in: (i) infrastructure provision, coupled with
interventions aimed at; (ii) improving access to land titles and resettlement housing; and
(iii) credits to invest in home improvements and income generation. Achievement in these
areas that contribute to improving well-being (i.e., alleviating selected dimensions of
poverty) of the beneficiaries can be summarized as follows.
Infrastructure to Improve Environmental Living Conditions of the Urban Poor
Component 1 financed multi-sectoral packages to construct and rehabilitate small-scale
infrastructure in 295 LIAs with a combined area of almost 2,100 hectares. The component
installed water and sanitation connections, improved drainage networks, upgraded roads,
bridges and sidewalks, and invested in electricity, public lighting, solid waste management,
health and educational facilities, fire hydrants, community halls and other tertiary
infrastructure. Component 2 financed investments in higher-level infrastructure to enhance
the effectiveness of the tertiary infrastructure improvements.
       Water and Sanitation. A large portion of the project’s outputs were in the water and
        sanitation sector. The linkages between clean water and adequate sanitation and poverty
        reduction are well known and are widely documented in numerous studies (by WHO,

    Based on Vietnam’s official national poverty lines which are issued by the Ministry of Labor, Invalids,
    and Social Affairs (MOLISA). The results here are robust to people who moved in and out of the project
    areas during the project implementation period. The estimated poverty ratios were broadly consistent
    with comparable official data.

    for example). Indeed, indicators #30 and #31 under MDG #7 on Ensuring
    Environmental Sustainability involve access to water and sanitation respectively.
    Untreated water and inadequate sanitation often result in the transmission of
    waterborne and water-related diseases. Such diseases result in declines in economic
    productivity and raise costs for treatment, combining to reduce wages and household
    savings, ultimately impacting household welfare. Public health was a major concern in
    the project areas with surveys showing high incidence of sickness directly related to
    poor living conditions. The project likely contributed to poverty alleviation by reducing
    waterborne disease through installing almost 30,000 piped water connections
    (compared to the original estimate of 18,200) and increasing water pressure in the LIAs.
    These investments contributed to meeting Indicator #1: improved service coverage for
    water, which rose from about 40-50% at appraisal to over 98% at closing. Component 2
    installed 298 km of tertiary drains to remove wastewater and eliminate open drains
    (which are mosquito-breeding areas, given Vietnam’s tropical environment). These
    investments contributed to increasing sanitation coverage to over 94% in the LIAs. The
    contribution to reducing disease is not quantifiable due to the unavailability of costly
    epidemiological studies, but it is likely significant. Beneficiaries perceived a reduction
    in sick days in the Impact Assessment.
   Drainage and Flood Control. Adequate drainage and flood control are also well known
    to reduce water-borne disease, while also increasing property values thanks to reduced
    flood damage and inundation periods. Increased property values, in turn, can contribute
    to poverty alleviation. Under Component 1, some 233 km of primary and secondary
    drains were upgraded, and under component 2, 28 km of canals were dredged to
    increase flow capacity and culverted, embankment works (lining, tree planting, side-
    walks, lighting) were carried out, and 7.4 ha of lakes were improved to increase their
    holding capacity and increase amenity. (See Annex 2 for pictures of Bet-Do Lake,
    Xang Thoi Lake, An Kim Hai Canal and THLG Canal.) The rehabilitation of the THLG
    Canal in HCMC reduced flooded areas from 484 ha in 2009 to zero ha at the end of
    2014, exceeding the target of 14 ha. The works also improved water quality in the
    THLG canal from a COD level of 811 mg/L in 2009 to only 80-130 mg/L in 2015, a
    significant achievement (although short of the target of 50 mg/l, which was deemed
    overly ambitious in absence of a wastewater treatment plant; see Section 2.3). Positive
    results are also recorded in the other three cities. According to the Impact Assessment,
    from 2003 to 2014, the share of beneficiary households adversely affected by flooding
    dropped from 75% to 17% in Can Tho, from 80% to 2% in Hai Phong, from 92% to 4%
    in HCMC, and from 45% to 6% in Nam Dinh; it is very likely that project interventions
    contributed to this reduced flooding. With regard to changing property values, it is very
    difficult to isolate the project’s impact over the project’s 10-year life, but property
    values have risen between 50-400% in the project sites. Project beneficiaries stated that
    the project had an unexpected impact of positive changes in the urban landscape as well
    as the social environment (See Annex 5).
   Roads. Improved road access is widely known to alleviate poverty. Road access
    reduces transport fuel costs and travel times, facilitates access to employment
    opportunities and to health clinics and schools, and promotes integration of LIAs with
    the rest of the city. Better road conditions reduce vehicle operating costs, which lead to
    savings. They can improve safety by facilitating access for emergency vehicles and
    generally increase pedestrian safety. Component 1 upgraded some 340 km of roads by



                                            17
        straightening, widening and paving them, and component 2 upgraded another 235 km
        of roads and built 812 m of bridges to facilitate traffic flow to and from the LIAs (see
        Annex 2 for pictures of the Le Van Sy Bridge and Lane 452 in Binh Tan District, both
        in HCMC). As was seen during project preparation, poor households often use parts of
        their living quarters as shops and cafes. As a result of the road works, these households
        can now receive and make deliveries and attract customers more easily. Solid waste
        vehicles can reach into LIAs to pick up waste, thus reducing odors, possible infestation
        and improving sanitary conditions and the environment in general. Complementary
        investments in sidewalks and public lighting also likely increased safety. Improved
        drainage can facilitate vehicular flow during the rainy season. No indicators were
        designed to capture road access, thus no quantifiable evidence is available about road
        outcomes, either in terms of reduced costs, accidents or crime. However, a study
        conducted by Gonzalez-Navarro and Qintana-Domeque in 2010 found that street
        paving led to a doubling of the number of home improvements, increased the number
        of durable goods owned by households, increased motor vehicle ownership and
        increased home prices.10 These indicators can be tied to improved living conditions and
        poverty alleviation. Beneficiaries also reported in the Impact Assessment that project
        interventions resulted in a higher level of security, which had resulted in increased
        business activity.
It is important to note that throughout implementation, Community Upgrading Plans (CUPs)
proved useful to address overdesign issues of city master plans, which were often based on
design standards that were far more costly than needed by local communities. CUP designs
reflected the real needs of the community, helped minimize resettlement and reduced costs.
MOC and the Bank supported PMUs in obtaining the necessary approvals for city
governments to deviate from approved design standards, thereby further improving the
efficacy of the project.
Land Titling and Housing Provision
Adequate housing is very important for health, personal development and household
productivity and acts as a defense against crime. Lack of formal land tenure is often stated as
a sense of insecurity, a reason why households refrain from investing and a major concern of
the poor. A study by De Soto (2001) found two main channels through which property rights
affect economic development: (i) by promoting private housing investments by owners who
feel secure about their property rights; and (ii) by allowing property owners to use their
property as collateral to secure loans or as proof of asset ownership.11 This credit can then be
invested to increase productivity and income and housing upgrades. In this project,
Component 4 financed TA and training to strengthen the administration of land use
certificates, which was decentralized to local governments shortly before project preparation
started. Per KPI #5, the time needed to obtain a BOLUC or LUC decreased from as much as
eight months to 15-40 days (the appraisal target of 15 days was too ambitious given the
limited interventions of Component 4 and that results are not uniquely attributable to the

project). The percentage of households in upgraded areas with BOLUCs/LUCs was as much
as 74-91%, but no baseline is available for comparison.
In addition, Component 3 financed resettlement housing (apartments or land plots) for the
poor, including those who encroached along canal banks without land tenure. At project
closing, the proposed resettlement sites were completed in all four cities, providing improved
environmental and living conditions for over 2,500 project households and restoring (at least)
their livelihoods. (See Annex 9 for details on resettlement works.) In general, relocated
households were satisfied with the resettlement areas, not only because of the quality of the
infrastructure and amenities (with schools, markets, and green spaces), but also because the
resettlement areas were located in the vicinity of their original communities. These results
from the land titling and resettlement programs, coupled with the housing improvement
program, likely reinforced a sense of security for poor households (which is also a dimension
of well-being), helping them increase their assets and productivity, which ultimately led to
poverty alleviation.
Revolving Fund for Home Improvement and Income Generation. In conjunction with
titling security, Component 5 provided capital that was on-lent as housing improvement
microloans to low-income households in order to provide a more salubrious home
environment and increase security. Eventually income-generating activities were also
financed. In all over 51,000 loans were extended for home improvement compared to the
appraisal estimate of 29,000, and almost 44,000 loans were made for income-generation.
The repayment record for these loans was nearly perfect, and the percentage of the portfolio
at risk remained below 5%, meeting the appraisal target. The poor mainly used these loans
for toilet installation, floor elevation, as well as repairs of roofs, walls, and kitchen. Loans for
income generation were mainly used to open new (or expand existing) businesses and
purchase new equipment. These investments helped improve living and economic conditions,
which contribute to poverty alleviation.
Summary. At closing, the number of persons who directly benefitted from investments in
Components 1-5 was estimated at 2.5 million—substantially higher than the appraisal
estimates of 1.9 million. The number of indirect beneficiaries was estimated at 7.5 million.
Project investments met or exceeded expectations, where there were measurable results and
those investments are known to alleviate poverty. Poverty incidence in terms of income per
capita and housing conditions has improved in all four project cities. Improvements were
recorded in different dimensions of well-being or poverty reduction. In view of this, efficacy
is rated “substantial.”

Rating: Substantial
Efficiency of Project Management. The project was managed by PMUs established by
MOC and the governments of the participating cities. Initially, the project was delayed
because of delays in procurement and resettlement. As a result, the project achieved its
outcomes (and generated its benefits) later than anticipated. With experience and additional
external support, the efficiency of the PMUs increased. PMUs were also highly efficient in
utilizing US$37 million in cost savings that were identified during the extension. The
implementing partners of the housing loan improvement program managed this component
efficiently (see below).



                                                19
Efficiency of Infrastructure Sub-projects. Investments in primary, secondary and tertiary
infrastructure accounted for over 80% of the total project cost. The economic internal rates
return (EIRRs) for investments in Components 1 and 2 were estimated at appraisal (2004),
for the preparation of the AF (2009) and shortly after project closing (2015). EIRRs at project
closing were far higher than those estimated in either 2004 or 2009, ranging between 58-67%
for tertiary infrastructure and 33-60% for primary and secondary infrastructure (see Annex 3
for details). Although net economic benefits may have been overestimated using a current
price base, correcting for this error would not reduce the returns below 12%. In spite of a
reduction in the number of relocated households, the cost of resettlement housing (which
accounted for most of the remaining project cost) was almost double the amount estimated at
appraisal, mainly because of higher than expected land prices. If the economic analyses
would have allocated resettlement costs to the relevant sub-project under Component 1 or 2
(which would be methodologically correct), EIRRs would remain comfortably above 12%.
The project also received about 52,000 m2 of voluntary land donations valued at over US$30
million, which not only reduced project costs (thereby further improving efficiency) but also
suggests a high level of satisfaction with project interventions.
Efficiency of Housing Improvement Loan Program. According to the Impact Assessment
published in January 2015, all loans financed by Component 5, which accounted for about
3% of the total project cost, were fully repaid to the city governments at project closing,
indicating highly efficient fund use (and an unusually high repayment rate; an internationally
acceptable non-performing loan ratio for micro-loans in developing countries is 5%). The
application for loans was made easier by a substantial reduction in the time needed to obtain
a BOLUC or LUC (from up to eight months to 15-40 days). It should be noted, however, that
only four of the seven implementing partners of Component 5 (CEP, HOF and VBSP in
HCMC and MHB in Can Tho) were able to maintain the microloan model as under the
project given their existing status. The three Women’s Unions had to scale back and did not
develop into microcredit institutions due to political economy reasons.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The PDO remained highly relevant throughout implementation. The relevance of design is
rated substantial, especially with regard to improving environmental and living conditions,
but suffered from an inadequate Results Framework. The project’s efficacy is rated
“substantial” because the estimated number of beneficiaries was greatly exceeded and project
interventions likely improved living and environmental conditions which are known to
alleviate poverty. The net economic benefits of physical investments were “substantial” in all
project cities. Given these factors, the overall outcome rating is rated “Moderately
Satisfactory”.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a)   Poverty impacts, gender aspects, and social development. It is highly likely that
      VUUP has alleviated poverty in the areas covered by the project (see Section 3.2 above
      for details). According to the Impact Assessment, project beneficiaries perceive that
      they have become less poor because of project interventions. More specifically, they
      reported that these interventions had resulted in a higher level of security (which had
      resulted in increased business activity), fewer sick days (and therefore less income lost


                                              20
        due to illness), improved housing conditions (financed from loans received through
        Component 5), and an improved access to loans from other financial institutions (see
        also Annex 5). The project also successfully increased the role of women in urban
        upgrading, through their participation in the preparation of CUPs, the administration of
        housing loans by Women’s Unions, and their role in deciding on the utilization of home
        loan proceeds. Women in project areas also benefitted from reduced housework (a direct
        result of reduced flooding) and from a decrease in domestic violence as a result of
        improvements in the living environment.
(b) Institutional change/strengthening. The project provided capacity building support to
    MOC and the governments of the participating cities to help operationalize the
    participatory planning approach in Vietnam. This also helped redefine the role of low-
    income communities vis-à-vis city governments, from passive recipients of government
    support to partners in development. At project closing, many PMU staff were promoted
    to influential positions in the city governments, which not only indicates that the project
    helped to strengthen the PMUs, but also contributed to the long-term sustainability of
    the project. The HCMC PMU received a prestigious award from the President of
    Vietnam for its significant efforts and achievements under this project.
(c)     Other intended outcomes and impacts. Rehabilitation of the THLG Canal changed
        the urban environment of HCMC for the better, and has inspired city governments
        throughout Vietnam (including, but not limited to, Hoi An and Da Nang) to invest in
        similar urban upgrading projects. The housing loan improvement programs helped first-
        time borrowers to establish a credit record, which was instrumental in securing
        additional loans beyond the project. The land management model developed under
        Component 4 has been replicated nationwide.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and Stakeholder Workshops
Beneficiary Surveys. In 2014, MOC commissioned a survey on the impact of VUUP. The
survey was based on interviews with 1,800 beneficiaries and published in January 2015. 12
The key findings of the survey can be summarized as follows (see Annex 5 for details):
       The project contributed to poverty reduction in LIAs in all four cities.
       By involving communities in planning and implementation, the project enjoyed high
        levels of support, participation and appreciation of the intended beneficiaries.
       Project beneficiaries welcomed improved access to home improvement loans,
        especially women, who played an important part in using loan proceeds and also
        benefitted from the reduced workload of cleaning the house.

Stakeholder Workshops. In December 2014, shortly before the Credit closing date, the
PMUs of each of the four project cities organized a stakeholder workshop to collect
comments on the implementation of VUUP. The most important comments were (see Annex
6 for details):

     Development Institute. January 2015.



                                                  21
     Participatory planning with local communities was generally effective, not only because
      the intended beneficiaries were in great need of improving their living environments,
      but also because the PMU and the communities learned to trust each other over time.
     Most beneficiaries perceived that their poverty levels had decreased, partly because they
      have better houses, better public infrastructure, and improved access to credit, but also
      because they no longer felt marginalized.
     Many project beneficiaries attested to a strong sense of ownership of the project and as
      a result have become more vigilant about drug users and criminals.

4.    Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
The “Risk to Development Outcome” is defined as the risk that the (expected) development
outcomes of the project—at the time of this assessment—will not be maintained or realized.
The most important risks are:
     Technical Risk. The project’s investments were concentrated in physical infrastructure
      that is not technically complex. Responsibility for O&M of primary and secondary
      infrastructure was delegated to experienced city government departments and utilities.
      To mitigate the risk of inadequate O&M of tertiary infrastructure, the project required
      CUPs to define and allocate O&M responsibilities. Technical risk is rated “low”.
     Financial Risk. Utilities and government departments of the project cities charge tariffs
      and receive subsidies that together are sufficient to cover O&M costs of primary and
      secondary infrastructure. The value of project-financed infrastructure accounts for less
      than 20% of the value of assets under management by the respective departments and
      utilities, hence the project has not resulted in a major increase in O&M budgets. During
      project preparation, it was found that most intended project beneficiaries would be able
      and willing to pay for O&M of tertiary infrastructure, and this was confirmed by the
      Impact Assessment undertaken in 2014. Housing improvement loan programs managed
      by Women’s Unions were not financially sustainable (see Section 3.3), although
      virtually all loans were repaid on time and investments in this subcomponent accounted
      for less than 3% of the total project cost. On balance, financial risk is therefore rated
      “moderate”.
     Natural Disaster Risk. Project cities are located in low-lying river deltas and are highly
      susceptible to extreme weather events as well as other adverse impacts of climate
      change. The extent that project cities would be willing to pay for the rehabilitation of
      damaged project-financed infrastructure from their own resources is uncertain.
      However affordability is not a constraint; as shown in Annex 3, all project cities have
      the fiscal capacity to provide the necessary funding. This risk is rated “moderate”.

5.    Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a)   Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The Bank fielded a comprehensive preparation team consisting of a very senior sanitation


                                              22
expert and respected experts in urban, social, microfinance, financial analysis, fiduciary and
safeguards specialists, from both headquarters and the Hanoi office. The team identified,
helped prepare and appraised this very complex project in two-and-a-half years, at a cost of
approximately US$750,000. The Bank constituted to the development of a project with
strong strategic relevance to the borrower’s Orientation Master Plan for Urban Development
to Year 2020, and the Bank’s strategy for poverty alleviation and engagement with
communities (refer to the Bank’s 2007-2011 Vietnam CAS and the 2012-2016 Vietnam CPS ).
The Bank’s background analysis was comprehensive and detailed, and resulted in a design
based on five key principles and decision to upgrade existing urban areas instead of clearance
and reconstruction in new areas. Additional strengths of the project design were:
    Relevance to Beneficiaries. The project provided a menu of tertiary infrastructure
     options that were highly appropriate to the beneficiaries, who could then select the
     options most appropriate to their own communities. This in turn resulted in high
     satisfaction levels and relatively low user charges needed to cover O&M of tertiary
     infrastructure.
    Comprehensiveness. Project design correctly anticipated that upgrading of tertiary
     infrastructure would be an incomplete means to alleviate poverty in LIAs. To ensure
     that tertiary infrastructure would be able to deliver intended benefits, it would be
     necessary to also invest in higher-level connective infrastructure. Project design also
     provided project beneficiaries with improved access to credit in order to trigger private
     investments in improved living conditions and income generating activities. The
     drawback of this ambitious approach was an increase in the complexity of the design.
    Decentralized Decision Making. The project intended to build capacity for
     implementing a participatory planning approach for urban upgrading at the local
     government level, to test if the approach would be replicable elsewhere in the country.
     At an early stage, it was therefore decided that the project would be implemented by the
     city governments, and not by the central government.
These strengths were partly offset by the following weaknesses:
    Inability to Measure Project Impacts on Poverty. The PDO––to alleviate poverty––was
     extremely ambitious given that the results framework did not contain KPIs to measure
     the impact of project interventions on poverty (see Section 2.3).
    Incomplete Risk Assessment. Various critical risks were not anticipated, notably the risk
     of delays in resettlement and in compensation payments, delays in developing working
     relationships with local communities, and shortages of funds from the Bank and other
     development partners.
These shortcomings were moderate, and the Bank’s performance in ensuring quality at entry
is therefore rated “moderately satisfactory”.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The Bank mobilized a multi-disciplinary supervision team with substantial expertise in
engineering, project management, financial management, procurement, monitoring, and
safeguards. Intensive supervision enabled the Bank to identify and proactively address key
issues adversely affecting achievement of the project’s intended outcomes at an early stage,
notably problems with procurement, resettlement and community participation. The Bank



                                             23
typically fielded two full supervision missions per year, in addition to many shorter site visits
between such missions, and most team members were based in the country office, which
allowed for close and continuous supervision. The Bank’s supervision efforts were useful in
helping PMUs to overcome challenges, especially those that required high-level engagement
and dialogues with central and city governments, e.g., ensuring timely allocation of
counterpart funds for resettlement activities or facilitating approval of detailed design
documents. The Bank realized that a common problem with upgrading projects was the
government’s insistence on following set standards for physical infrastructure and on
implementing existing city master plans, regardless of reality on the ground, population
density, or residents’ affordability (e.g., the minimum lot size in HCMC was 100m2, which
was unaffordable for most low-income residents). The Bank invested substantial effort in
working with city authorities to allow modifications to city master plans and the application
of affordable standards for LIAs. This enabled the project to minimize resettlement and
achieve more (within each area and to cover more areas), and ensured that the poor were able
to benefit from project investments.
The Bank worked closely with the PMUs on advocating for the consolidation of land and
housing management systems, for which a pilot was carried out under the project and scaled-
up nationally due to advocacy by the Bank with city governments. The Bank was
instrumental in setting up the microfinance models in the cities with capacity building
activities and study tours for relevant stakeholders. The near universal of compliance with
safeguard policies is especially commendable, given the Environmental Category “A” status
of the project.
The Bank also responded flexibly to requests for AF following the withdrawal of AFD
financing, and was effective in helping city governments allocate and utilize substantial cost
savings identified late in implementation. However, the good quality of supervision was
adversely affected by persistent weaknesses in the relationship between the high level PDO
and the weak results framework and M&E generally. The preparation of the AF offered the
Bank an opportunity to either reformulate the PDO to something more concrete, e.g.,
“improve living and environmental conditions” or to strengthen the results framework to
measure poverty alleviation by removing KPIs that were too difficult to measure or attribute
to project interventions, and by defining appropriate time-bound targets for the remaining
KPIs. However, this opportunity was not seized (see Section 2.3). As this shortcoming was
moderate in light of the overall performance of Bank supervision, the quality of supervision
is rated “moderately satisfactory”.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Because of the “moderately satisfactory” rating of the Bank’s performance in ensuring
quality at entry and the “moderately satisfactory” rating of the quality of supervision, the
Bank’s overall performance is also rated “moderately satisfactory.”

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Performance of the Government
Rating: Satisfactory
Throughout project preparation and implementation, the project enjoyed the strong support of
the Government, which together with city governments and communities financed over 30%


                                               24
of the total project cost. GoV supported the Bank’s efforts for continuous innovation of
VUUP to improve the impact of the program on poor communities throughout Vietnam. It
also maintained good relationships with other development partners involved in the project,
made a timely request for the AF, and helped develop a successor project to replicate the
approach developed under VUUP. At the same time, it is felt that the Government could have
prevented delays arising from the implementation of Decree 131/2006/NĐ-CP (see Section
2.2) by adopting a stricter position on city government requests for approval of matters that
were already formally delegated to these governments. These shortcomings were minor,
however, and the performance of the Government is consequently rated “satisfactory”.

(b) Implementing Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
VUUP was largely decentralized, and most of the project was implemented by the govern-
ments of the project cities. All city governments supported a bottom-up, participatory
approach to urban upgrading, and, through their PMUs, generally complied with the Bank’s
policies on safeguards, procurement, financial management and progress reporting. However,
city government PMUs largely focused on monitoring and evaluation of physical inputs, and
not on higher-level outcomes in the results framework. Although the project suffered delays
early in implementation, the causes were reasonable (e.g., PMUs were unfamiliar with Bank
procurement regulations and with participatory planning in general). There were, however,
several challenges that stronger management may have been able to prevent, notably delays
in counterpart funds for land acquisition and compensation payments (problems that have
affected many other Bank-financed projects in Vietnam), and limited coordination between
PMUs and utilities, which necessitated avoidable changes to detailed engineering designs.
These shortcomings, which were observed in all four project cities, resulted in avoidable
delays to project implementation, but are deemed moderate in relation to the generally good
performance of the city governments. For these reasons, the performance of the city
governments is rated “moderately satisfactory”.
The implementing agencies of Component 5 (CEP, HOF, VBSP, MHB and three Women’s
Unions) managed their loan portfolios exceedingly well, as evidenced by a near-perfect
repayment record and a higher-than-expected number of microloans (almost 95,000 against a
target of 29,000), and their performance is consequently rated “highly satisfactory”. The
performance of MOC, which completed the preparation of NUUP ahead of schedule, is rated
“satisfactory”. Because the four city governments were responsible for the implementation of
five of seven components, accounting for about 97% of the total project cost, their
“moderately satisfactory” rating was applied to the rate the performance of implementing
agencies as a whole.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
In light of the “satisfactory” rating for GoV performance and the “moderately satisfactory”
overall rating for implementing agencies, and moderately satisfactory outcome, overall
performance of the Borrower is rated “moderately satisfactory.”

6.   Lessons Learned




                                             25
Implementation of VUUP confirmed the key lessons from similar programs undertaken
elsewhere in the region: (i) using participatory planning methods can deliver small-scale
infrastructure that better meets the needs of communities than infrastructure projects planned
in a traditional “top-down” fashion, and (ii) investments in complimentary higher-level
infrastructure are necessary to secure the benefits of community-based infrastructure. In
addition, several other important lessons were learned.
   Transformational urban upgrading projects create wider benefits that cannot be captured
    by traditional measures. The THLG Canal transformed the inner city of HCMC and
    inspired other cities in the country to undertake similar upgrading projects. This
    highlights the important “demonstration value” on the project that capture by traditional
    cost/benefit analysis.
   The Bank needs to set the PDO at a level consistent with proposed project interventions.
    Although the VUUP interventions were capable of contributing to poverty alleviation,
    attributing higher incomes solely to the project interventions was not possible, especially
    given the fast rates of growth in Vietnam’s larger cities over the extended life of the
    project. Further, a high level PDO must be accompanied by a carefully designed results
    framework, a well-planned and funded M&E system, and adequate institutional capacity
    to demonstrate linkages between project interventions and the PDO.
   Project design for a multi-sector multi-city project should find opportunities to reduce the
    complexity, lessen transactions, and improve efficiency of Bank supervision. The
    complementarity of the different components contributed to a comprehensive approach in
    addressing urban poverty in the project areas. Given the significant scope of work, the
    originally planned 8 years of implementation was highly realistic. However, this was
    unusually long for a Bank project, and it posed substantial risks of socio-economic
    fluctuations such as high inflation, changes in leadership, etc. It also implied high
    transaction costs for Bank supervision. Simplifying the design by keeping only crucial
    components and reducing the scope of work will shorten implementation period with
    more targeted and efficient Bank support.
   Fostering meaningful community participation among the urban poor is very rewarding,
    but is time- and labor-intensive. Under VUUP, the requirements for 60% community
    participation and gender balance in consultations were challenging to fulfill as the local
    residents, who were mainly self-employed on very small scale activities, found it difficult
    to attend community meetings. Only with strong commitment and financial support could
    the PMU organize over 600 community meetings and made efforts to go door-to-door to
    obtain inputs from the local communities. This process was tedious and labor intensive
    but was instrumental in securing the targeted support, especially for the contribution of
    land and money. Projects that include similar community participation in their design
    should budget sufficient time at the start of implementation, unless these processes can be
    advanced prior to project approval.
   Resettlement policies for urban upgrading investments need to include informal settlers
    as well and provide market-level compensation prices, as outdated Government’s cost-
    norms may not be accepted by the affected households and causes delays. The
    Resettlement Policy Framework needs to be approved by the highest authority to provide
    the legal basis for independent land price evaluators to set competitive compensation
    prices. As the entire resettlement process is very politically and financially sensitive, the
    Bank task team needs to work closely with the relevant authorities and stakeholders,


                                               26
      putting pressure where needed, to bring them together to find solutions. Quality
      resettlement areas are also critical to gain the community’s support for the project,
      ensuring that the resettled households can be close to their original community, with
      schools, markets and green spaces available.
     Community Upgrading Plans are a useful tool to avoid overdesigns as Master Plans, often
      use design standards that are beyond the needs of local communities. In Nam Dinh, the
      participatory CUPs identified the local needs of alley roads to be 2.5–3 meters wide,
      which was well below the 6 meter wide standards in the approved Master Plan. Close
      support from the Bank through just-in-time dialogues with local governments and
      national Ministry of Construction was key to help issue appropriate guidelines for greater
      flexibility in tertiary infrastructure design and ensure that they are enforced at the local
      level.
     Urban infrastructure projects are inherently complex and require strong project (and
      especially contract) management skills, so adequate budget should be allocated for
      capacity building and quality consultant support to the PMUs. Resources should be built
      into the cost estimates for civil works to ensure that the PMUs receive the necessary
      support to carry out fiduciary, safeguards, technical supervision, and monitoring activities.
      Complementary capacity building grants can go a long way in providing training to the
      PMUs and relevant stakeholders. Such training should be organized through coordinated
      efforts ideally by one central agency to ensure efficiency.
     Improved access to credit is essential for an urban upgrading project, but does not need to
      be provided by the project itself. To fully benefit from improvements in public infra-
      structure, project beneficiaries need access to credit for complementary investments in
      housing and income generating opportunities. Projects should work with established
      microcredit providers instead of investing in capacity building of institutions that are
      unable to provide microloans beyond project closing.

This annex summarizes the outputs of the project, and is largely based on a review of the
achievements of the outcome and intermediate results indicators mentioned in the PAD (refer
to the datasheet for a complete overview of targeted and achieved values for key performance
indicators).
Component 1: Tertiary Infrastructure Upgrading and Service Improvements. This
component financed the construction and rehabilitation of small-scale in infrastructure in 295
LIAs with a combined area of almost 2,100 hectares (Table A2.1). The component upgraded
about 340 km of roads and 298 km of drains, installed almost 30,000 piped water connections
(increasing coverage from about 40-50% at appraisal to over 90% at project closing), and
invested in bridges, sidewalks, electricity, public lighting, solid waste management, health
and educational facilities, fire hydrants, community halls and other tertiary infrastructure – all
planned, implemented and monitored using a participatory planning process.

Location: HCMC.
Description: Lane 452 in Binh Tan District in HCMC used to be in poor condition and was
flooded frequently. Now, the lane is paved, and has become safe, clean, and dry.

Component 2: Complementary Primary and Secondary Infrastructure. This component
would finance the improvement of higher-level infrastructure to complement the tertiary
infrastructure improvements financed under Component 1. The most important of these
improvements was the rehabilitation of the THLG Canal, the cost of which accounted for


                                                  29
over 25% of the total project cost. At project closing, the component had constructed and
rehabilitated about 243 km of roads, 233 km of drainage, 28 km of canals, 7.4 hectares of
lakes and bridges with a combined length of over 800 meters.
The investments in Components 1 and 2 were expected to result in:
   Reduced flooding. At project completion, flooding was reduced significantly in LIAs
    covered by the project in all four cities. According to the Impact Assessment, from 2003
    to 2014, the share of beneficiary households adversely affected by flooding dropped from
    75% to 17% in Can Tho, from 80% to 2% in Hai Phong, from 92% to 4% in HCMC, and
    from 45% to 6% in Nam Dinh. The rehabilitation of the THLG Canal had reduced
    flooded areas in HCMC from 484 hectares in 2009 to zero hectares in 2014.
   Reduced incidence of selected diseases. At appraisal, the incidence of water-borne
    diseases was high, especially for low-income groups who live adjacent to the canals and
    in the low lying flood-risk areas. Over half of the persons interviewed asa part of the in
    socio-economic survey conducted during project preparation reported that illnesses in
    their households are directly related to living conditions in the project area. Surveys also
    showed that the incidence of water-related diseases was higher in areas adjacent to
    polluted drains, canals and lakes. It is likely that project-financed interventions have
    resulted in a reduction of waterborne-diseases in the project areas (for example, water
    quality of the THLG Canal increased dramatically from a COD of over 800 mg/l in 2009
    to 80-130mg/l in 2015), but it was not possible to quantify these impacts without
    undertaking extensive and costly epidemiological studies.

Component 3: Resettlement Housing. This component project finance resettlement housing
for the poor and any site development costs related to resettlement housing of persons
adversely affected by the project. At project closing, resettlement sites were completed in all
four cities, covering a combined area of 62 hectares. In total, the project financed about 2,640
serviced plots (with water supply, sanitation, electricity and other utilities) and about 2,400
contained low-income housing units (Table A2.2). Of these, 2,547 plots and apartments were

Component 4: Land and Housing Management. This component financed technical
assistance and training to strengthen the administration of land use certificates, which was
decentralized to local governments shortly before project preparation started. As a result of
this investment, the time needed to obtain a BOLUC or LUC decreased from up to 8 months
to 15-40 days. Together with the improvements in public infrastructure, increased ownership
of BOLUCs and LUCs contributed to a substantial increase in property values in the LIAs
covered by the project, ranging from 50% to 400% during the project implementation period.
Component 5: Housing Improvement Loan Program. This component provided loans for
home improvement and, at a later stage, loans for income generating activities to poor
households (defined as households in the bottom 40% by income level) living in LIAs
covered by the project. In all over 51,000 loans were extended for home improvement and
almost 44,000 for income generation, with near-perfect repayment records in all cities except
Can Tho (Table A2.3). At project closing, all four PMUs had collected 100% of the principal
loan amounts and repaid these to the Government as per schedule.

Component 6: Capacity Building. This component financed technical assistance and
training for city, district and ward level authorities, municipal utilities, communities, and
PMUs, including trainings and workshops for over 5,100 participants (Table A2.4). It also

                        Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

A3.1    Economic Analysis
Overview of economic analysis. At appraisal, an analysis was conducted of the quantifiable
economic costs and benefits of investments in Component 1 and Component 2 (which, taken
together, accounted for over 75% of the total project cost). Benefits consisted of increased
productivity and efficiency from reduced flooding and avoided flood damage to economic
activities, lower cost water and electricity services, avoided flood damage to property,
improved road and alley access, and increased property values. To verify the accuracy of the
analysis, and to assess the economic costs and benefits of the THLG Canal that was added to
the project scope at a later stage, a second series of economic cost-benefit analyses was
undertaken for the preparation of the additional financing in 2009, and a third series shortly
after the project closing date. It should be noted that the methodology that was used for
assessing economic costs and benefits at project closing expressed all cost and benefit
streams at current prices, so that the resulting economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) are
not directly comparable to the EIRRs estimated at appraisal, which were expressed in
constant prices (as required by the Bank).
Economic analysis of Component 1 (tertiary infrastructure). At appraisal in 2004, the
economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of Component 1 was estimated at 40% or higher in
all four project cities (Table A3.1). This was substantially higher than the Bank’s assumed
economic opportunity cost capital for Vietnam and other developing country members (12%).
At project closing, economic costs––expressed in constant 2004 Vietnamese Dong––was
comparable to the economic costs estimated at appraisal in three of the four cities. In HCMC,
the cost of Component 1 was somewhat lower because the city preferred to increase the
volume of works in Component 2 at the expense of investments in tertiary infrastructure
upgrading. In 2009, anticipated economic benefits remained substantial, but were lower than
estimated at appraisal, so EIRRs were also somewhat lower (23% to 36%, see also Table
A3.1). At project closing, the EIRRs of Component 1 investments were estimated at 58% or
higher; as mentioned above, these estimates were based on economic costs and benefits at
current prices, and are therefore not directly comparable to EIRRs estimated in 2004 and
2009. However, because the nominal EIRRs are far higher than the minimum required EIRR,
correcting for this error would, in all likelihood, not cause EIRRs to fall below the Bank’s
hurdle rate of 12% at constant prices (this observation also applies to EIRRs estimated for
Component 2).

Economic analysis of Component 2 (primary and secondary infrastructure). This
component financed primary and secondary infrastructure needed for the adequate
functioning of tertiary-level infrastructure, and included the improvement of road networks,
sewers, drainage systems, THLG canal and lakes. The largest individual sub-project financed
under Component 2 was the Tan Hoa - Lo Gom Canal in HCMC. The cost of this canal was
about US$200 million, which was financed from the proceeds of the AF. Economic costs of
the other Component 2 investments were comparable to costs estimated at appraisal. The
conclusions of the economic cost-benefit analysis of Component 2 are the same as for
Component 1: EIRRs estimated in 2009 were somewhat lower than EIRRs presented in the
PAD (Table A3.2), albeit still substantially hi gher than the Bank’s hurdle rate of 12%. EIRRs
at project closing were far higher than those estimated in either 2004 or 2009, but
overestimate net economic benefits because of using a current price base. Correcting for this
error would reduce the returns, but most probably not below the minimum required return of
12%. This means that Component 2 investments were also economically feasible, as
anticipated both at appraisal and during the preparation of the Additional Financing.

A3.2       Financial Analysis

Overview of Ginancial Analysis. During project preparation, three types of financial
analysis were conducted: (i) an analysis of the fiscal impact of counterpart fund contributions
and recurrent costs on local government budgets; (ii) an analysis of the financial impacts of
increases in O&M expenditure on wastewater utilities; and (iii) an analysis of the financial
impacts of the project on household budgets (affordability analysis). Each of these analyses
was also conducted at project completion, using the methodology as at project preparation.

Fiscal Impacts on Local Governments. All project cities were required to finance 7% of the
cost of the civil works of sub-projects undertaken in their jurisdictions from their own
revenue as well as the O&M expenditure of infrastructure assigned to it (mainly roads and
drainage systems).13 In addition, HCMC would also need to repay a sub-loan for drainage
works from its own sources. At appraisal, it was anticipated that counterpart fund


13
     The minimum required counterpart fund contribution was 10% of civil works cost. However, part of this
     commitment was passed on to communities, who were requested to provide contributions amounting to
     3% of the civil works cost.



                                                     36
contributions would account for 0.8% to 1.6% of total expenditure budgets, and for 1.3% to
5.8% of capital expenditure budgets (Table A3.3). These percentages applied to 2005; it was
anticipated that the share in later years would be lower as local government budgets were
expected to increase at higher rates than the required counterpart fund contributions. During
2004-2014, the required shares were substantially lower (counterpart fund contributions
accounted for 0.3% to 1.0% of total expenditures and 1.1% to 3.8% of capital expenditures),
except for Can Tho, where the share of capital expenditure used for counterpart funds was
slightly higher than anticipated at appraisal (3.8% instead of 3.5%). At appraisal, it was
envisaged that incremental O&M expenditure would account for about 1-2% of total capital
expenditure budgets, and for less than 1% of total expenditure budgets. Although, the
project’s incremental O&M expenditures were not estimated at appraisal, it is assumed that
actual incremental O&M expenditures would also be lower––expressed as either a percentage
of total or capital expenditure budgets than estimated at appraisal.14

Financial Impact on Wastewater Utilities. All four project cities own utilities that are
responsible for operations and maintenance of project-financed wastewater infrastructure
investments. At appraisal, it was assumed that the financial impact of the incremental O&M
expenditures would be marginal, partly because these expenditures would account for a
relatively small share of the total O&M expenditures of the four utilities (less than 20% for
Can Tho, Hai Phong and HCMC; no data for Nam Dinh), but also because part of the
incremental expenditures would be covered by incremental revenues from wastewater
surcharges to the water bill. At project completion, these assumptions were deemed valid.

Affordability Analysis. At appraisal and at project completion, an analysis was undertaken
to assess to the extent project beneficiaries would be able to afford:
     Minimum required counterpart fund contributions to the civil works cost of tertiary
      infrastructure;
     Charges for water supply, wastewater and solid waste management services; and



14
     This assumption was based on the notion that counterpart fund contributions and O&M expenditures can
     both be expressed as a fixed share of the capital expenditure budget (counterpart fund contributions 7%,
     O&M expenditure 2-5%). If counterpart fund contributions account for a much lower share of capital (or
     total) expenditure budgets than envisaged, it is highly likely that O&M expenditure would also be lower.

    Debt service charges on home improvement loans.

Affordability of Community Contributions for Tertiary Infrastructure. Communities in
LIAs were required to provide cash or in-kind contributions equivalent to 3% of the civil
works cost of tertiary infrastructure. At appraisal, this was on average VND6,000 to VND
38,000 per month, or about 1.2% to 2.8% of the average monthly income of a poor household.
According to the PAD, this was in line with national guidelines for community contributions
that were prevailing at the time. The analysis was not repeated at project closing. By then,
communities had provided voluntary land donations with a total value of VND650 billion
(about US$32 million equivalent), indicating a high level of affordability and willingness to
contribute to the project.

Affordability of Water Supply, Wastewater and Solid Waste Management Services. At
appraisal, it was envisaged that the cost of water supply, wastewater and solid waste
management services would not exceed 5% of the average expenditure of a poor household.
In 2004, the share in Hai Phong was estimated at 4.9%. At project closing, the share was
slightly lower, 4.3% (Table A3.4). No data were available for other project cities, but PMUs
assumed that the affordability limit of 5% was not breached in any of the LIAs covered by
the project.

Affordability of Debt Service Charges for Home Improvement Loans. The housing
improvement program was designed with loan ceilings, interest rates and repayment periods
appropriate to low-income households. At appraisal, it was estimated that a typical low-
income household would borrow VND6 million (about US$390) at an annual interest rate of
6-8%, and repay the loan in 40 equal monthly installments of about VND170,000 each (about
US$11). The monthly installment would account for 10-25% of the average monthly
household income in a LIA, which was considered affordable for low-income households.
During implementation, various loan conditions were adjusted in response to demands from
project beneficiaries, including an increase of the loan ceiling to VND15 million, a reduction
of the repayment period, and a change to eligibility criteria (loan proceeds could also be used
for income-generating activities in addition to home improvement). At project closing, all
participating microcredit institutions reported repayment rates close to 100%. This indicates
that loans provided by the project were affordable to most low-income households (but not
necessarily to all, because loans of some households were guaranteed by other community
members).

                             Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

In 2014, a survey was commissioned by Hai Phong PMU on the impact of VUUP, using the
Before-After approach to measure changes in the population. The survey consisted of
questionnaires, household interviews, local authority interviews, focus group discussions, and
field work observations with a sample size of 1,800 persons (600 in HCMC and 400 in each
of the other three project cities). The results of the survey were published in January 2015 in
a report called “Impact Evaluation Report––Vietnam Urban Upgrading Project”. 15 The
sections containing the conclusion and lessons learned of the report are copied below.

     4.1 Conclusion
      The project has contributed to poverty reduction in low-income residential areas of
      four cities. The project has brought greater opportunities for house improvement,
      created employment opportunities, improved the environment and surrounding urban
      landscape, improved access to basic public services, and improved people’s health.
      The intervention projects integrated the suggestions of the local community and
      allowed them to play a central role in the project’s im plementation, and so it has
      received high levels of support, participation and appreciation of the local people and
      government.
      The high number of direct and indirect beneficiaries, as well as the effectiveness of
      the project beyond its initial objectives, has contributed significantly to overall
      poverty reduction in the four project cities, particularly in residential areas where the
      project has intervened. The project has had an unexpected impact of positive changes
      in the urban landscape as well as the social environment, creating conditions for city
      residents to enjoy a better life while simultaneously contributing to investment,
      tourism and the general economy of the city.
      The project was successful in mobilizing the participation of citizens during the
      project’s implementation. One key factor of the project’s success is the propaganda
      campaigns implemented by the city, which helped people understand the goals and
      objectives of the project. At the same time, the integration of training incentives for
      people to participate in environmental monitoring has attracted effective participation
      of people at all levels. People can contribute ideas in the design of environmental
      monitoring, encouraging responsibility and mobilizing energy contributions and land
      resources to help the project maximize economic efficiency.
      Ultimately, the economic and social benefits that the project generates are greater
      than the cost of the project, and the project is expected to bring positive economic and
      social development to the city in the future.
      Project Management Units (PMU) in all four cities has effectively used financial
      resources and contributions from the people in this project. Human resources in the
      PMU were working at maximum capacity, as all project management units and

project owners were contributing their skills and management abilities. These
managers and owners play a crucial role in ensuring the success of the project and the
achievement of the objectives set out in the planning stage. This means that
understanding the personnel issues and management capacity of the PMU is very
important when implementing the project. For example, guiding contractors’ payment
procedures is very important to ensure work that is carried out in time. This kind of
oversight requires a large amount of effort. As the number of personnel in the project
is limited, all personnel were working overtime. Due to the complexity and volume of
overload work, this causes high amounts of pressure and stress for the project staff.
The Revolving Fund in Component 5 of the project contributed an important role in
reducing urban poverty and expanding the impact of the project to tens of thousands
of poor families and low-income households in four cities. Component 5 improved
the impact and effectiveness of Component 1, 2 and 3 on targeted beneficiaries of the
project, thanks to access to credit services for renovating and upgrading houses to
improve the quality of life and health of the beneficiaries (poor families). The
Revolving Fund in Component 5 also empowered women by providing access
opportunities to invest capital in house renovation and economic development.
Because of this, women have the right to participate in decisions about large work
projects such as repairing and renovating the house. Repairs and renovations
improving the house and living environment also reduced the workload of women in
cleaning the house, which subsequently reduced their stress levels and pressure from
the family.
As explained above, the microfinance fund in Component 5 contributed to
sustainable urban poverty reduction through access to credit for the poor. In order to
maintain and replicate the successful results of this project, it is suggested that a
sustainable strategic approach from the start should have been established by
selecting a unit management and ensuring that the microfinance organizations are
oriented in a professional way at the end of the project, so that they can continue to
replicate and extend the reach of their work to poor and low-income households in
the city. Results from the project showed that microfinance funds managed by the
Women’s Union were effective during project execution, but faced challenges in
order to sustainably and independently develop. The Women’s Union does not have
funds themselves, and depends on funds from the project. Therefore when these funds
need to be returned back to the City People's Committee, it is almost impossible for
the Women’s Union to receive a loan from another source. The Women’s Union have
the advantage of possessing widespread resources and connections that assist the
Fund in understanding customer information, debt collection and credit management.
However, the administration, information systems, internal controls, risk
management, and accounting activities of the Women’s Union have not received
enough support to ensure long-term sustainability. Therefore, the microfinance
programs should have integrated an exit strategy from the project’s initial design by
combining a semi-formal microfinance institution (MFI) and professional capacity
building orientation with the participation of the Women’s Union.

4.2 Lessons Learned
   Decentralization and clear responsibilities and procedures are necessary to help
   accelerate the project’s progress.
   As a big project in multiple cities that involves the sensitive issue of compensation &
   clearance, the PMU should always be in consultation with the City People's
   Committee as well as the World Bank to have solutions to problems that may present
   themselves, especially in matters relating to institutions and policies. Deployment
   projects involving multiple agencies and departments need clear coordination
   mechanisms to reduce duplication of work, accelerate project progress, and remain
   consistent with the overall planning of the city. The agencies and departments need to
   work together to solve the problem of institutional differences and policies between
   sponsors and owners.
   The participation of the community should be considered as a key factor to mobilize
   project resources especially involving environmental monitoring and clearance, as
   participation of the community greatly accelerates progress and economic efficiency
   of the project. Professional and technical training for a community monitoring
   committee should be done before the project implementation and additional training
   should be provided if necessary for effective monitoring.
   Compensation, site clearance and resettlement of the project are always complicated
   and affect the success of the project. The participation of the community in the
   project is essential to make these processes more efficient. Another important factor
   in the success of the project is the empowerment of PMU members. For example, in
   Ho Chi Minh, the Coordinator is now able represent the owner to coordinate
   activities under the contract and monitor the performance of contractors to ensure the
   progress and quality of each contract. Management and working closely with each
   contract is an important factor to ensure the quality and progress of the project.
   Enhancing the professional capacity of the PMU financial accounting staff about
   financial management of ODA allows them to manage the issues, making payment
   and settlement process quicker and ensures that all the right regulations are followed.
   Planning and implementation of the project Components are necessarily going well
   with the project timeline to maximize the effectiveness and progress of the entire
   project. Changes or approvals from the World Bank need to be quickly passed on to
   the PMU so that they can actively plan on how to deploy the project and to avoid
   being delayed in the process of disbursement.
   The principle of “coherent to the overall planning of the city” needs to be applied
   flexibly and creatively for primary and secondary infrastructure in order to make sure
   the designs are consistent and will not encounter any overlap in the city’s future plans
   that may impact negatively on this project’s work. The designs must consider climate
   change and rising sea levels as well. The lesson for future projects is that the
   infrastructure design must incorporate environmental protection, and should have a
   long-term strategy that takes into account of factors that affect climate change. An
   example of Climate Change Adaptation infrastructure is the installation of a harmonic
   pond for storing water.



                                             44
With regard to Component 5, the prerequisites for successful implementation of the
credit project for housing improvement are that the implementing staff must have the
capacity to assess loans, appraise credit, and manage delinquency and risk. Capacity
building must be the main activity if the organization lacks necessary capacity to
implement effective programs. To facilitate credit for home improvement for low-
income households who do not have stable incomes, the economic development loan
must be deployed before to ensure the households have incomes and sources of
savings from which they can repay the loan when they get the house renovation. The
implementing units are allowed and encouraged to determine the maximum loan in a
flexible manner based on the market price and the ability of the low-income
borrowers to repay. The implementing units need to consider and evaluate current
market and demand, to change the provisions of the Operations Manual to encourage
members with the ability and savings demand to apply for credit products. Finally,
the implementing units need to build a withdrawal strategy right from the design
stage to ensure that at the end of the project, the successful results from the project
and capacity building are maintained and sustainably developed.”

                Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

Introduction. In the period 8-19 December 2014, shortly for the project closing date, the
PMUs of each of the four project cities organized a stakeholder workshop to collect com-
ments on the implementation of VUUP. The attendants of the workshops consisted of repre-
sentatives of the PMUs themselves, project beneficiaries living in LIAs and adjacent areas,
contractors, ward leaders, city government staff tasked with O&M of project-financed facili-
ties, and representatives of institutions providing home loans to project beneficiaries. The
observations of the attendants about project implementation can be summarized as follows.

Observations about Community Participation
   Participatory planning with local communities was new to all four project cities, but
    was generally effective. This was especially the case because the intended beneficiaries
    were in great need of improving their living environments, but also because PMU and
    communities learned to trust each other over time.
   Frequent communication and a high level of transparency are necessary to build trust
    among PMUs, community members and other stakeholders in CDD projects. It also
    helped ensure timely payment of community contractors and high level of repayments
    of home improvement loans (and other loans to project beneficiaries).
   Communities formed their own coordinating committees headed by the ward leader to:
    (i) keep community members informed about project progress, (ii) monitor and super-
    vise community contracts, and (iii) develop new ideas for upgrading of the neighbor-
    hood for consideration by PMUs.
   Community participation was adversely affected in cases where PMUs did not imple-
    ment upgrading plans as fast as promised.
   In general, communities are willing to contribute a higher share for upgrading tertiary
    infrastructure for a new urban improvement project than for VUUP.
   PMUs were perceived as committed to achieving VUUP’s objectives and worked well
    together with communities and other stakeholders in the project.

Observations about Infrastructure Improvements (Components 1 and 2)
   Most community members understood that upgrading of tertiary infrastructure was
    needed, but there was no communal will to support this cause as long as the necessary
    primary and secondary infrastructure was not in good condition. Once the problem of
    poor higher-level infrastructure was addressed, communities became interested to work
    together on solving problems related to tertiary infrastructure.
   Most community members felt that improvements to primary and secondary infra-
    structure were necessary to bring physical changes (i.e. improved access and reduced
    flooding) to their neighborhoods. The upgrading of tertiary infrastructure helped
    communities connect to the improved higher-level infrastructure.
   The project provided communities with small grants to finance infrastructure that would
    help improve social cohesion, such as community halls to be used for weddings and
    other gatherings. This grant program generally worked well.




                                            46
Observations about Resettlement Housing (Component 3)
   Some households were dissatisfied with resettlement housing even though their living
    conditions were worse prior to relocation, mainly because they felt disconnected from
    their friends and the communities they used to form part of.
   PMU considered resettlement housing the most difficult component to implement, as
    many intended beneficiaries (especially the elderly) were reluctant to change their lives.

Observations about Housing Improvement Loan Program (Component 5)
   Intended beneficiaries and PMU placed a high level of trust in the participating
    Women’s Unions, which have a long history and generally good track record. This, in
    turn, helped the successful implementation of the program.
   For many households, applying for a loan was a first-time event, which made them feel
    empowered and responsible, and thereby change their perceptions of themselves. This
    observation especially applied to women, who were made responsible for loan repay-
    ment in the majority cases. Some women decided to join the labor force because their
    experience with loan repayment made them trust themselves to be responsible.
   Initially, many households expressed concerns about their ability to repay loans.
    Support from Women’s Unions and community members helped first -time borrowers
    instill a habit to save money and build confidence to meet their debt service obligations
    according to schedule.
   In some instances, when households could not pay the loan, other community members
    paid for them (thereby, in effect, acting as a guarantor). The household that missed the
    payment would then repay these members in a later stage.
   In general, loan amounts were too small to finance the improvement that households
    wanted to make to their homes.

Observations about Project Impacts
   Most beneficiaries perceive that their poverty levels have decreased, not only because
    they have better houses, roads, and other infrastructure services and were able to access
    home improvement loans, but also because they feel they are no longer marginalized.
   In many LIAs, people used to feel unsafe and did not hang out in the streets. With better
    roads and better lighting, more people socialize on streets, which does not only improve
    the social fabric of the neighborhoods but also increases the income of street vendors.
   Many project beneficiaries attested to a strong sense of ownership of the project and a
    sense of pride to have helped reduce poverty in their own households and made their
    neighborhoods a more desirable place to live. As a result, they have become more
    protective of the neighborhoods, and more vigilant of drug users and criminals.

Social safeguards. In all four participating cities, the project triggered safeguards related to
involuntary resettlement (OP/BP 4.12). To address potential adverse impacts, the Borrower
developed a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) for the project as a whole. Based on the
RPF, resettlement action plans (RAPs) were prepared for each city, initially covering Phase I
investments only. For each city, the RAP was made publicly available in Vietnamese in
December 2003 and in English in March 2004. A separate RAP was prepared for the THLG
Canal sub-project. This RAP was made publicly available in Vietnamese in April 15, 2009
and in English in April 1, 2009.
Resettlement. All adversely affected persons, including informal settlers, were financially
compensated for their estimated losses at replacement cost and supported to maintain the
living standards and income-earning capacity that they enjoyed before the start of sub-project
construction. The project also provided special in-kind support to relocated households and
vulnerable groups, such as providing vehicles to relocated households for moving to
resettlement area, and assisting in arranging permits for housing construction and issuance of
land and house certificates. The project conducted a large number of public consultations
about land acquisition and resettlement, and compensation plans were publicly disclosed in
communal areas. Where involuntary resettlement was unavoidable, affected persons received
an appropriate cash compensation with either a plot of land or a house or apartment in a
resettlement area with basic infrastructure services (in Nam Dinh and Can Tho, only the first
option was offered). In all four cities, resettlement sites were constructed in the early stages
of project implementation, so that affected households could relocate in a timely manner. But
also to avoid delays in construction due to land clearance. During project implementation,
about 2,640 serviced plots and 2,400 apartments were developed for resettled households, on
a total area of about 63 ha (Table A9.1). Basic infrastructure services consisted of roads,
drains, electricity supplies, public lighting schools and other public facilities (Table A9.2). In
addition, all resettled households were supported with income restoration measures, such as
free vocational training and access to revolving funds, with the aim of enabling them to
return to the living standards they enjoyed prior to resettlement.

In each project city, a grievance system was established to address complaints of affected
households regarding all aspects of the land acquisition process, including compensation
payments and resettlement issues. In total, the system collected 571 complaints, of which 568
were resolved at closing. The three outstanding cases in Nam Dinh are being addressed as the

Resettlement impacts. At appraisal, it was anticipated that over 4,800 households would
need to be relocated permanently; in addition, over 16,700 households would be adversely
affected on a temporary basis (these figures include appraisal estimates for the AF; see Table
A9.3 for details). At the detailed design stage, efforts were made to minimize adverse social
impacts—and thereby resettlement requirements—through realignments, scale reductions and
other modifications. As a result, the number of households that needed to be relocated was
about 40% lower than at appraisal (2,917 instead of 4,859). Surveys undertaken by indepen-
dent resettlement monitoring consultants confirmed that most affected households were able
to maintain or improve their pre-project living standards.

in the total project cost as a result of the AF. However, the project encountered significant
delays in organizing resettlement and compensation payments, the main reasons being: (i)
verifying the legal status of eligible households took longer than expected (illegal
encroachment was a particular problem), (ii) many households only wanted to resettle or

outdated, and compensation payments needed to be adjusted repeatedly for changes to market
prices of land. In summary, compliance with safeguard policies on involuntary resettlement
