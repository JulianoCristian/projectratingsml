"Ratings for Urban Upgrading Project for\n            Vietnam were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: project design for a multi-sector\n            multi-city project should find opportunities to reduce the\n            complexity, lessen transactions, and improve efficiency of\n            Bank supervision. The complementarity of the different\n            components contributed to a comprehensive approach in\n            addressing urban poverty in the project areas. Given the\n            significant scope of work, the originally planned 8 years of\n            implementation was highly realistic. However, this was\n            unusually long for a Bank project, and it posed substantial\n            risks of socio-economic fluctuations such as high inflation,\n            changes in leadership, etc. It also implied high transaction\n            costs for Bank supervision. Simplifying the design by\n            keeping only crucial components and reducing the scope of\n            work will shorten implementation period with more targeted\n            and efficient Bank support. Resettlement policies for urban\n            upgrading investments need to include informal settlers as\n            well and provide market-level compensation prices, as\n            outdated Government\u2019s cost-norms may not be accepted by the\n            affected households and causes delays. The Resettlement\n            Policy Framework needs to be approved by the highest\n            authority to provide the legal basis for independent land\n            price evaluators to set competitive compensation prices.\n            Improved access to credit is essential for an urban\n            upgrading project, but does not need to be provided by the\n            project itself. To fully benefit from improvements in public\n            infrastructure, project beneficiaries need access to credit\n            for complementary investments in housing and income\n            generating opportunities. Projects should work with\n            established microcredit providers instead of investing in\n            capacity building of institutions that are unable to provide\n            microloans beyond project closing."}, "docdt": "2015-11-20T01:02:00Z"}
