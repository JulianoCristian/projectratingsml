Economic Rehabilitation\n            Loan Project supports the Jamaican Government's efforts\n            to maintain a sound macroeconomic program and continue its\n            progress toward achievement of sustainable economic growth\n            and further poverty reduction in the face of multiple shocks\n            which have impacted the economy, especially the decline in\n            international travel to and tourism in Jamaica following the\n            events of September 11, 2001. It will bridge part of the\n            fiscal gap generated by the shocks, help to maintain\n            spending in key social programs, and rebuild damaged\n            infrastructure; support private sector-led tourism and\n            related economic activities; and improve overall governance\n            in the country. The loan will help the Government avoid\n            cutbacks in critical expenditures, especially in social\n            programs. Improved public expenditure control,\n            rationalization, and governance and transparency will\n            increase administrative efficiency and improve the delivery\n            of public services. Reforms and actions to improve the\n            framework for private sector development, including a more\n            flexible labor market, will stimulate growth and create\n            employment opportunities for the poor, particularly in\n            tourism and tourism-linked agriculture and manufacturing.\n            The report also discusses three potential risks that the\n            project would face."}, "docdt": "2001-12-07T00:00:00Z"}
