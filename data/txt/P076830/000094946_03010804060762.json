satisfactory project\n            outcome, likely sustainability, and modest institutional\n            development impacts. Lessons learned address three main\n            issues. First, a critical issue during preparation centered\n            on the suitability of the instrument type to support the\n            Government during its period of fiscal pressure: a\n            multi-year investment loan was not adequate due to the need\n            for a fast-disbursing mechanism, similarly was the case of\n            an economic recovery loan, while the selected emergency\n            recovery loan provided greater flexibility to ensure that\n            social spending would not be reduced during the adjustment\n            period. Second, while the loan delineated a number of policy\n            reform actions sector wide - though appropriate - the\n            breadth of the reform program did somehow detract the\n            support to macroeconomic stability, and social efforts. It\n            is thus suggested to consider in the future, a less\n            comprehensive set of actions, particularly those not\n            considered requirements for Board presentation, or\n            effectiveness. Third, although the Government could have\n            obtained additional resources from the International\n            Monetary Fund (IMF), its entry at the time of the loan might\n            have signaled investors with a much worse macroeconomic, and\n            fiscal situation than anticipated; notwithstanding, the\n            IMF's extension of its Staff Monitoring Program,\n            favored more rigorous monitoring of the macroeconomic\n            framework, providing an adequate coordination."}, "docdt": "2002-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
