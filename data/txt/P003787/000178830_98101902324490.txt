REPORT AND RECONIMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF
THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR
A FIFTH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Indonesia for the equivalent of
$10 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a Fifth Technical
Assistance Project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY /1
2.        The latest economic report on Indonesia, "Indonesia:  Growth
Patterns, Social Progress and Development Prospects," of February 20, 1979
(2093-IND) was circulated to the Executive Directors on February 26, 1979.
The report's main findings are that:
(a) aided by a massive improvement in the country's resource position
during the early 1970s and innovative policies, considerable
progress has been made towards raising the level of material
well-being for the bulk of the Indonesian population, including
the lowest income groups;
(b) due to a number of new, mostly exogenous circumstances,
including an expected slow-down in the growth of oil production,
Indonesia is now facing a rapidly tightening overall resource
position which will make it more difficult to maintain high levels
of income and employment growth, while at the same time preserving
monetary stability and external balance;
(c) the recent (November 15, 1978) devaluation of the Rupiah from
Rp 415 to Rp 625 to the US dollar, while strongly supportive of
the structural changes required to reduce economic dependence on
oil and to improve long-term development prospects, should not be
regarded as a substitute for efforts needed to remove physical and
administrative bottlenecks and to develop effective support services;
(d) although the Government (because of the structure of its revenues
and expenditures) is a prime beneficiary of devaluation-induced
income shifts from import users to net-exporters, significant
additional public sector resource mobilization efforts will be
needed to prevent a sharp decline in the share of Government
savings in GNP beyond 1979/80;
/1 Substantially unchanged from President's Report, Third Urban Development
Project (No. P-2440-IND), circulated under cover of R79-1, dated
January 4, 1979, and approved by the Executive Directors on January 16,
1979.



- 2 -
(e) while the next five to ten years may be difficult because of the
structural changes needed to adjust to a post-oil boom era,
Indonesia's long-term development prospects have been significantly
enhanced by the Government's successful population policies which
have already contributed to a substantial (approximately 20%)
reduction of fertility on Java and Bali during the past decade.
These crucially important demographic developments will, in due
course, particularly after the mid-1980s, be reflected in reduced
and declining rates of growth of the labor force. Declining labor
force growth rates and the prospects of declining income elastici-
ties of demand for food justify the hope and expectation that with
sound policies, Indonesia can and will eventually - possibly within
the next two decades - overcome the severe poverty and food security
problems that still plague the country today. The solution of
these fundamental problems through the pursuit of a pervasive
employment oriented development strategy would set the economy
firmly on a long-term growth path towards much higher levels of
social and economic development involving all Indonesians. One of
the key components of such a strategy would be to aim at a high
rate of labor-intensive manufacturing development.
Social Developments Since 1970
3.        Analysis of data from the National Household Surveys for 1970 and
1976 suggests that while overall income disparities have almost certainly
widened, the rapid overall growth of the economy /1 has contributed to a
considerable improvement in consumption of all income groups, including the
very poor. The data further suggest that increases in per capita consumption
were higher in Java than in the Other Islands and higher in urban areas than
in rural areas. Notwithstanding this, many Indonesians remain extremely poor:
in 1976 when average per capita income was about $280,/2 over 50 million
Indonesians (38% of the population) spent less than $90 (1976 prices and
exchange rate).
4.        Analysis of data from National Labor Force Surveys shows a remarkably
high rate of employment growth (over 4% p.a.) between September 1971 and
October 1976. But during this period, the labor force also grew at a very
high rate and the data suggest that there was a slight increase in the rate
of open unemployment. Since the labor force grew much faster than population
in the relevant age groups, a sharp increase in labor force participation
rates, from 50% in September 1971 to 55% in October 1976, was observed. Thus,
a substantial part of the increased per capita consumption levels is believed
to have been related to increased labor force participation and declining
dependency ratios.
/1 GDP grew at 8.0% p.a. As a result of favorable terms of trade develop-
ments during most of the period, GDY grew even faster - about 9.5% p.a.

- 3 -
5.        The share of agricultural employment between 1971 and 1976 declined
from 66% to 62%, implying rapid growth of nonagricultural employment - over 7%
p.a. or 54% of the total increase in employment. Within the nonagricultural
sectors, the increase in employment occurred largely in proliferating small-
scale enterprises in the manufacturing and service sectors where labor produc-
tivity is thought to be extremely low. This is indicated, inter alia, by the
stagnation of real minimum wage levels which are among the lowest in the
world. Employment growth in medium- and large-scale enterprises, which absorbed
the bulk of industrial investment, was very modest. The broad picture of
rapid employment growth since 1970, though encouraging in many respects, thus
reveals that a relatively large part of the incremental employment has been
of poor quality in residual types of activities.
6.        Much progress has been made in recent years with the provision of
education services. Enrollment rates increased at all levels of education.
For example, primary school enrollment (excluding over-age students) is ex-
pected to reach 85% in 1979 for the 7-12 age group, compared to 60% in 1974;
dropout rates - while still high - declined, and universal primary education
appears to be in sight. A promising nonformal education program has been
introduced to increase the basic employable skills of those who never attended
school (presently estimated at 23 million people) and others who left school
without completing primary education (a further 22 million). Indonesia's
adult literacy rate increased to 62% in 1974, which is much higher than in
India (36%), Pakistan (21%), or Bangladesh (23%), but lower than in Thailand
(82%) or Philippines (87%). Within Indonesia, large differences in levels
of educational attainment between urban and rural areas still exist, but
differences between Java and other parts of the country are relatively small.
7.        In the field of health care services, there has been a tremendous
expansion of physical infrastructure including medical training facilities.
Almost 3,000 rural health centers, designed to become the principal vehicles
for the delivery of basic health services, were constructed between 1969 and
1977. But much of the new physical infrastructure has so far remained under-
utilized due to personnel shortage, and a range of other factors, including
popular preference for traditional health care services in several areas.
8.        Inadequate sewerage and sanitation facilities are still major
health hazards, especially in crowded urban areas. Even if the various
targets for rural and urban water supply for the Second Five-Year Development
Plan (Repelita II), which ended in March 1979, are fully met, over 100 million
Indonesians will still remain without easy access to safe water in 1979.
Similarly, housing conditions are generally very unsatisfactory, especially
in crowded urban areas.   Although simple and inexpensive improvements in
water supply, drainage, footpaths and community facilities, executed through
Kampung Improvement Projects, including those supported by the Bank Group,
have contributed to better living conditions in several overcrowded urban
areas, specific socio-economic support programs to improve the living con-
ditions of the urban poor are needed.



- 4-
The Devaluation of November 15, 1978
9.        The recent devaluation of the rupiah from Rp 415 to Rp 625 per US
dollar was designed to encourage labor-intensive import substitution and
nonoil export growth by reversing some of the adverse relative price shifts in
the economy that had occurred earlier this decade. The opportune timing of
this drastic and unique policy action is believed to be a strong factor
enhancing the probability of its success. The strongest immediate effects of
the devaluation, however, will be a dramatic increase in budgetary revenues in
local currency terms. Government expenditures will, of course, also increase
as a result of the devaluation but the net budgetary position in terms of
rupiahs should strongly improve. While the recent devaluation will generally
tend to facilitate export promotion efforts, great emphasis needs to be placed
on the importance of developing effective support services and of reducing
administrative obstacles and other unnecessary cost increasing factors.
10.       A number of supportive measures to prevent an upturn in domestic
inflation eroding the potential benefits of this devaluation have already been
taken. Such measures include the lowering of import tariffs by 50% on a wide
range of intermediate inputs, stringent temporary price controls, and a
temporary increase in budgetary subsidies to initially isolate key consumption
items, such as rice, from the effects of the devaluation. Aside from the
budget's influence on the prices via subsidies, the degree of monetary control
exercised will also be an important factor in minimizing devaluation-induced
inflation. There is likely to be conflict, however, between the needs to
contain devaluation-induced monetary expansion and the need for additional
credit to promote new private investment in line with the structural objectives
of the devaluation. Nonetheless, a sizeable budget surplus in fiscal 1979/80
almost certainly will be needed to assist in neutralizing the effect of a sudden
sharp increase in the rate of monetary expansion following the devaluation.
11.       Prior to the November exchange rate adjustment, balance of payments
projections based on current trends and expectations suggested the probability
that, without special export promotion efforts, a shortage of foreign exchange
would become a binding constraint on development efforts within the next few
years. Although it is too early to make more than a very preliminary and
speculative assessment of the effect of the devaluation on imports and exports,
there is now less ground for the fear that the balance of payments will become
a development constraint. No dramatic changes, however, are foreseen in the
immediate future; the short-term export response, in particular, is likely to
be constrained by supply rigidities. Ultimately, changes in the size and
structure of imports and exports will be strongly influenced by the effect that
the devaluation will have on the overall growth performance of the economy.
Food Supply and Demand Prospects
12.       Despite impressive achievements in rice production, the past
decade has seen a continuing decline in Indonesia's food self-sufficiency.
Between 1968-77, the composite trend growth rates of domestic food calorie



- 5 -
production and availability were approximatelY 3.2% and 3.7%, respectively./l
These growth rates reflect a growing import dependence on rice, sugar, wheat
and recently coconut oil, as well as a reduction or disappearance of maize,
cassava, meat and coconut product exports. After three years of stagnating
or slow growing rice production due to a combination of poor weather and
pest problems, 1978 showed an unprecedented increase in output (over
10%), but import requirements in 1978/79, though much lower than in 1977,
are still about 6% of total domestic consumption.
13.       Comparison of plausible food supply and demand scenarios suggests
the likelihood of increasing import requirements of basic foods and especially
of rice, wheat, sugar, coconut oil and possibly maize. There is an urgent
need for a comprehensive food production and consumption strategy. In the
case of rice, with the substantial completion of irrigation rehabilitation,
the recent shift in emphasis towards extension of irrigated areas and to
swamp drainage projects will probably somewhat reduce rice production growth
rates, at least through 1985. However, the potential from increasing fertil-
izer and insecticide consumption and from improving the local performance of
the most recent IRRI varieties, suggests that an annual rate of growth of
rice production of around 3% is nevertheless feasible through 1985. The
recent devaluation has provided significant additional room for further rice
producer price increases aimed at stimulating supply.
14.       While slower growth in rice productivity is anticipated, a com-
parison of yields for secondary crops in a number of countries suggests that
these crops offer considerable potential for raising Indonesia's domestic
food self-sufficiency. With proper marketing and other support services, the
rate of growth of secondary crop production could probably be raised from
1.7% to 3.5% p.a. A gradual shift in the overall food production and con-
sumption pattern from rice to the secondary crops would assist low income
farmers in unirrigated areas and reduce the cost and risks associated with
excessive rice import dependency.
Overall Growth and Employment Prospects
15.       Miedium-term prospects, as determined by developments already in
motion and by exogenous factors such as the expected temporary stagnation
in oil production, suggest that it will be difficult to achieve an overall GNP
growth rate of more than 6-6.5% during the next 3-5 years. This is consider-
ably less than the average growth performance of the economy during the
past decade. But if the broad pattern of relationships between output growth,
employment growth, and personal consumption growth observed for the period
1970-76 does not drastically change, a GNP growth rate of 6-6.5% could still
be consistent with an overall employment growth target rate of around 3% p.a.
The Government has already announced a GNP growth target of 6.5% p.a. for the
Third Five-Year Development Plan (Repelita III), which started in April 1979.
/1 The rice trend production growth rate was about 3.5% and the composite
trend for the 5 main secondary staples (maize, cassava, peanuts, sweet
potatoes, and soybeans) was 1.7%.



16.       As the economy is entering a difficult period of adjustment to post-
oil boom conditions involving structural changes in the pattern of production
and the sources of savings, more reliance will have to be placed on agricul-
ture and industry and on the mobilization of Indonesia's most abundant and
inexhaustible resource: people. The devaluation may be expected to facilitate
the structural changes that are needed. With improved incentives for an employ-
ment-oriented strategy and adequate Government investment and institutional
support services for agriculture and small industries, it should in due course
be possible to raise the overall growth rate of the economy to at least 7% or 8%,
which would be a major help in accelerating the further elimination of poverty.
External Aid and Creditworthiness
17.       The heavy foreign borrowing in 1974, 1975 and the early part of
1976, together with a hardening of average terms during those years, has
raised the level of debt service payments which reached about $1.5 billion in
1978, or about 18% of projected export earnings. The debt service ratio /1
was 16% in 1976 and 17% in 1977; the ratio is expected to remain below 20% in
1979 and 1980. This is the encouraging result of restraint with regard to
new borrowing in 1976 and 1977 and the recent replacement on more favorable
terms of $575 million remaining payments on cash loans (originally totalling
$1 billion) which had been obtained in 1975 from a number of private banks in
the wake of the Pertamina crisis. Total new loan commitments declined from a
peak of $3.4 billion in 1975 to $2.3 billion in 1978. Most of the decline
was achieved through a reduction in commercial borrowing. This means
that average loan terms have recently begun to soften again, which will be
reflected in future debt service payments.
18.       The Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia (IGGI) continues to be
the principal source of external capital, including Official Development
Assistance (ODA), to the country. Total ODA (bilateral and multilateral)
commitments in 1977/78 (including grants) amounted to about $1.4 billion; the
IGGI (including the World Bank Group and Asian Development Bank) accounted
for over 90% of this amount. The Bank's most recent economic report on
Indonesia recommends that total ODA to Indonesia should reach at least
$1.93 billion in 1979/80, including both loans and grants, of which at least
70% should be on concessional and semi-concessional terms. At the meeting of
the IGGI in May 1978 the indications of probable commitments in 1978/79 made
by bilateral and multilateral IGGI members amounted to $1.6 billion; the
meeting concluded that the Bank recommendations would be approximately
met. As a result of the pattern and terms of external borrowing during
the recent past, net resource transfers from abroad are expected to decline
in 1978/79 to about $500 million, even if the recommended level of new ODA
commitments is reached.
19.       Our overall assessment of Indonesia's external accounts indicates
that the country will be able to finance essential imports of consumer,
intermediate and capital goods and meet its debt service obligations. The
/1 Ratio of debt service payments to commodity export earnings, with oil

debt service ratio is expected to remain below 20%. Although the November 15
Rupiah devaluation will provide a one time revenue windfall, the Government
will need to raise substantial additional non-oil revenues over the coming
years if the relatively high rate of domestic investment already reached is to
be maintained. The Government has been quite cautious in increasing current
expenditures and there does not appear to be much scope for reducing them
further; they should, in fact, rise in step with the growth in GNP and infla-
tion, to permit reasonable growth in Government salaries as well as materials
expenditures, a significant part of which is development related. In view of
the expected increase in the pressure on public sector resources, the devalua-
tion notwithstanding, a limited measure of local cost financing is considered
justified.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDONESIA /1
20.      As of February 28, 1979, Indonesia had received 40 IDA credits
totalling $680.8 million, and 37 Bank loans amounting to $1,903.0 million.
IFC investments have totalled $61.3 million. The share of the Bank Group
in Indonesia's total (disbursed) external debt outstanding at the end of
1977 was about 8%, and the share of debt service about 1.8%. By the end of
1978, these ratios are estimated to have increased to around 12% and 5%,
respectively. Annex II contains a summary of IDA Credits, Bank Loans and
IFC Investments as of February 28, 1979, as well as notes on the execution of
ongoing projects.
21.      To date, the Bank Group has financed projects in virtually all
sectors of the Indonesian economy, although there has been particular stress
on agriculture, which accounts for over one-third of all lending. Most of
the loans for agriculture have been for rehabilitation and expansion of
productive capacity, both for food and tree crop development. Several
national programs to provide credit inputs and advice to farmers and to
promote agricultural research have also been financed by the Bank Group.
More recently, an effort to aid the Government's transmigration program
has been initiated. In the industrial sector, while the major thrust has
been on expanding fertilizer production on the basis of Indonesia's gas
resources and on establishment and improvement of development finance institu-
tions, a credit has also been extended to finance a small enterprise develop-
ment project. The main emphasis in education has been on upgrading the
quality of education, improving primary and secondary education and manpower
training as well as on expanding non-formal education. In the social sector,
the Bank Group has financed projects for urban development (through neighbor-
hood improvement programs), urban water supply, family planning, and nutri-
tion. A major portion of Bank Group financing has been used to rehabilitate
and expand Indonesia's inadequate infrastructure, particularly in the power
and transportation sectors. Credits have also been extended to finance a
telecommunications project and a tourism project. Finally, the Bank Group
/1 Substantially unchanged from President's Report, Third Urban Development
Project (No. P-2440-I11N), circulated under cover of R79-1, dated January 4,
1979, and approved by the Executive Directors on January 16, 1979.



-8-
has assisted the Government's efforts to prepare and formulate its development
programs and projects through four technical assistance credits and a loan
for a natural resource survey and mapping project.
22.      The discussion in Part I of this report underscores the need for a
development program which will provide increasingly productive work oppor-
tunities and incomes for Indonesia's presently underemployed and growing
labor force and increase agriculture production, particularly of food crops.
Efforts to increase employment through programs directed towards improving
the incomes of the poor and their living standards are expected to be one of
the major objectives of Repelita III. While several of these programs are
likely to be suitable for Bank Group financing, it will be some time before
they are ready for implementation. However, as part of this new focus, a
small enterprise development project designed to increase non-agricultural
employment in rural areas and small towns, has already been approved by the
Executive Directors, and an integrated rural development should be ready for
presentation to the Executive Directors this fiscal year. With respect to
agriculture development, projects are being prepared to further improve and
expand research and extension services, rehabilitate and expand irrigation
systems, help replant smallholder rubber and coconut plantations, assist in
watershed management and village development, and develop presently under-
utilized land in areas outside Java for transmigrants and other small-
holders. In addition to the family planning program, which continues to have
high priority, other areas of particular importance for Bank Group assistance
will be the improvement of urban services through construction of urban water
supply systems and further expansion of neighborhood improvement programs,
and the improvement and expansion of higher education particularly of engineers,
accountants and agriculture specialists, as well as primary and nonformal
education. Finally, Bank Group financing continues to be important for the
Government's program of infrastructure rehabilitation and expansion, par-
ticularly in transport and power, which will continue to require very large
investments for many years before these facilities are adequate to support
Indonesia's development. Compared to past lending activities, many of these
projects and programs reflect the shift of emphasis in Government's develop-
ment objectives from rehabilitation and expansion to a better balanced and
more equitable and employment-oriented economic growth strategy.
23.      Bank Group lending to Indonesia started in 1968 and between 1968 and
1974, all Bank Group lending to Indonesia was on IDA terms. Following the
rapid increase in Indonesia's oil income which enabled Indonesia to borrow on
less concessional terms, it was decided that all lending to Indonesia after
June 30, 1974, would be on Bank terms. Since 1974, the Government has
saved and invested almost all of the increase in its oil revenues and greatly
expanded its development expenditures which reached about $6 billion in
1977/78. For reasons discussed in Part I above, and notwithstanding the
November 1978 devaluation, both the budgetary and balance of payments situa-
tions may be difficult in the years ahead. Thus, while Indonesia has always
qualified for assistance on concessional terms on grounds of its low per
capita income and the quality of its economic management, such terms are now
also necessary to enable it to maintain a high level of investment without



-9-
impairing its ability to service its external debt. Accordingly, starting in
FY78, a portion of Bank Group lending to Indonesia has again been provided on
IDA terms.
24.       The n'oposed credit would be the sixth lending operation presented
to the Executive Directors this fiscal year and would bring total lending to
Indonesia this year to $282 million. Projects for rural development, trans-
migration, development finance company (BAPINDO), water supply, road better-
ment and power are expected to be ready for presentation in the next few
months.
PART III - THE NEED FOR A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CREDIT
Previous Technical Assistance Credits
25.       To date, the Association has made four technical assistance
credits to Indonesia: Cr. 135-IND (December 12, 1968; $2.0 million),
Cr. 216-IND (September 15, 1970; $4.0 million); Cr. 275-IND (December 29,
1971; $4.0 million); and Cr. 451-IND (January 2, 1974; $5.0 million). The
first three credits have all been fully disbursed. Collectively the use of
funds from these three credits can be summarized as follows:
Type of Subproject                       Amount
(US$ million)
Project preparation studies                6.1
Long-term and sector studies                1.6
Advisory services and other                2.3
Total                            $10.0
26.       Project Completion Reports for each of these three credits were
attached to a Project Performance Audit Report from the Operations Evaluation
Department (Report No. 2015), which was distributed to the Executive Directors
on April 7, 1978 (SecM78-300). The OED Report commented, inter alia, that
the credits had been an essential component of the Bank Group's lending
program in Indonesia, had contributed substantially to the elaboration of a
pipeline of development projects suitable for multilateral or bilateral
financing, and had accounted for the rapid acceleration of the Bank Group's
volume of lending in Indonesia.
27.       The Report expressed some concern that there was little evidence
available on the effectiveness of the various advisory services funded under
the credits, due largely to the fact that in a number of instances steering
committees had not been established to review the consultants' activities.
This issue was discussed with the Government and the situation was corrected
under the Fourth Credit (Cr. 451-IND), when the Bank's Resident Staff in

Indonesia requested the Government to ensure that steering committees be
established for all subprojects under that credit and that regular reports
be prepared by advisors and heads of advisory teams. These steps are now
being taken.
28.       As of February 28, 1979, about $4.8 million had been committed and
some $3.1 million disbursed under the Fourth Technical Assistance Credit.
Details relating to the use of these funds are contained in Annex IV to this
report.
Other Technical Assistance
29.       In addition to the four technical assistance credits, about $21.4
million has been provided for technical assistance /1 under other Bank
Group-assisted projects approved in FY78. This amount represents some 4.2%
of total Bank Group lending ($505 million) to Indonesia during FY78. A
further $28.9 million has been provided under two Bank Group-assisted projects
approved in the first half of FY79. The projects and general types of
activities for which these funds were provided are summarized below:

30.       The Government receives substantial financial resources for
technical assistance from the UNDP. During Repelita III anticipated UNDP
financing amounts to about $74 million. This assistance is expected to be
focussed as follows:
Anticipated Expenditures as
% of Total UNDP Funding
Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry                      21
Industrial Development                                   15
Human Resources and Manpower Development                25

31.       Training-oriented projects are expected to account for 56% of the
programmed resources, investment-oriented projects for 17%, with research
anid extension projects accounting for the balance. As has been the case in
the past, a few of the activities will result in fully prepared projects for
which the Government can invite external financing for implementation. Many
of the UNDP Projects, however, will be concerned with the intensified field-
level training efforts and research activities which are so essential to
develop workable new project modalities and define effective techniques. As
substantial and important as the UNDP program will be, it will not be able to
cover all of the critical research and advisory services needed, nor undertake
the detailed project preparation efforts necessary to reestablish a full,
firm project pipeline responsive to both the financial capabilities and
development needs of Indonesia.
._      Therefore, a Fifth Technical Assistance Credit is proposed to
finance some of the specific project preparation activities which will arise
out of the broad objectives of Repelita III; to investigate a number of the
chronic research, administrative, training and planning problems which emerge
from a review of the past decade; to assist the Government with analysis of
a range of policy choices to increase food production and improve employment
opportunities in small and rural industries; to intensify research on and
marketing of non-oil exports; to provide advice and assistance on energy
research, training and policy regulations; to develop programs to improve the
Indonesian consulting and contracting industry; to streamline planning and
budgeting procedures; and to finance similar high priority activities.
33.       As before, a continuing dialogue and close collaboration among
the Government, the Bank's Resident Staff in Indonesia (RSI), the UNDP, IGGI
members and other foreign embassies, will ensure that there will be no
duplication of activities in various technical assistance programs. It is
the Government's policy, with which the Bank is in agreement, to use to the
extent possible, funds (generally provided as grants) from the U.N. organiza-
tions and bilateral donors for ongoing or already chosen future projects, and
to reserve IDA financing as a last resort source, flexible in purpose and
adaptable in use to speedily meet those high priority needs for assistance
where financing from other sources is not suitable or possible.



- 12 -
34.       Since IDA technical assistance funds, unlike those provided
through some bilateral programs, are untied, the Government is able to use
these funds for a wide range of activities and to internationally recruit
experts and advisors. In addition, uncomplicated commitment and administra-
tive procedures and the ability of the RSI, working closely with BAPPENAS, to
assess priorities, expeditiously approve the proposals for subprojects and
continuously be available to monitor their progress, are in themselves a
major factor contributing to the success of previous technical assistance
credits.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
35.       The proposed credit of $10.0 million would finance a program of
technical assistance to the Indonesian Government for which disbursements are
expected to be made over the next five years. This will be the crucial
period of preparation and pre-investment activities, including training and
management advisory services for projects and programs to be implemented
during Repelita III. The identification and preparation of sufficient,
well-formulated projects for potential financing from the Bank Group, IGGI
members and from the Government's own budget will again become the focus of
this Fifth Technical Assistance Credit, as they were for the first four such
credits to Indonesia. Preparation of specific projects or components which
have an impact on social problems, in particular permanent employment creation,
fulfillment of basic human needs and poverty alleviation, will have emphasis
in the use of funds.
Uses of Funds
36.       The proposed credit would help rebuild a pipeline of projects
suitable to Indonesia's needs and resources. The pipeline of well-prepared
projects was rapidly drawn down with Indonesia's oil and commodity boom and
increased creditworthiness as described above (para. 19). To help ensure
the availability of adequately prepared projects which meet the needs of each
sector, the proposed credit will supplement and be used to fill the gaps
in project identification/preparation activities financed from other sources.
The continuing project-specific dialogue between BAPPENAS, the project
agencies and the Bank, is expected to remain the primary means by which
projects to be financed are identified.
37.       Particularly important in project preparation activities will be
those which directly and indirectly address the key social and economic
constraints to employment creation and poverty alleviation in Indonesia.
These activities would include the following:
(a) Field-level identification of conditions necessary for increased
growth of small-scale enterprises and rural industries, and research
on appropriate skill, technology and manufacturing methods.
Financing on a limited scale of small experimental pilot projects
in the above areas would be an important investigative use of the
credit.



- 13 -
(b) Investigation, monitoring and evaluation of certain broad policy
areas which affect growth and change in employment opportuni-
ties. For example, studies of licensing systems, transportation
char;es and working capital costs are expected to reveal needed
structural and policy changes for the small enterprise subsector.
(c) Project identification and preparation activities for health, rural
water supply, sanitation, village and community development techniques,
education and agriculture.
38.       In order to assist the Government to finance independent consultants
to serve as advisors on the technical aspects of investment and to evaluate
the merits of a few large infrastructure, mining or industrial projects which
will be ready for consideration in the next several years, the proposed
credit will provide financing for independent legal, financial, economic and
technical advice. As in the past, such investment advisory assistance will
be helpful to ensure that future major capital investments are undertaken
on terms and with scope and technologies appropriate to Indonesia's needs.
39.       Technical assistance to develop the public enterprise sector is
of high priority. To control and improve the contribution to development of
the large number of public enterprises in Indonesia, it will be necessary for
the Government to undertake further and better-focussed analyses of policy
options, management and organization studies, and appropriate regulations. In
some cases, the Government will use the credit to prepare specific investment
projects to revitalize and assist public enterprises.
40.       Financial assistance for the Government's efforts to improve its
agencies, their procedures and staff capabilities is another area which has
been identified where the proposed credit can be useful. Consultant services
are needed to identify management improvements and to provide data and advice
necessary for the drafting of new laws and regulations and the conduct of
training programs. Scope exists for the preparation of specific projects to
assist the training programs of the National Institute of Public Administration
(LAN), the civil service academies of the Department of Home Affairs, and the
departmental training institutes.
41.       The Oil and Gas Institute has been reorganized and has indicated
interest in strengthening its capacity to provide the national training,
research and testing role assigned to it in context of its responsibilities
in the oil sector. Preparatory work to establish domestic, in-service
training programs and seminars as well as selected programs of overseas
studies is under way. Funding for the actual conduct of such programs would
be done in limited circumstances as agreed between the Government and the
Association.
42.       The proposed credit would also assist the Provincial Governments,
especially their development planning boards (BAPPEDAs), to prepare high
priority regional development programs and projects to the stage where they
can be proposed to the Central Government for consideration of budgetary or
external financing assistance. At present, the inability of Provincial



- 14 -
Governments to prepare projects effectively appears to be a serious constraint
to investment particularly in those provinces where natural resource endowments
are poor and experience with designing development projects is weak. The
Government has already completed a series of regional development studies
with external assistance and is now working with several donors to strengthen
regional planning capability. Project preparation activities would not only
provide these provinces with projects suitably prepared for investment but
would also serve as a valuable learning experience for provincial planning
staff. The Government plans to decentralize gradually some investment
planning and project preparation activities. While it may take a decade or
more for the Government to achieve its goal successfully, progress will be
directly dependent on the ability of provincial authorities to perform better
their role as regional planners, project administrators and, eventually.
fiscal managers of the local economy. It would be directly in keeping with
the purpose of the proposed credit that the Provincial Governments also
receive, as necessary, assistance to help strengthen their own planning and
preparation capabilities.
43.       In general, as evidenced over the past decade of development in
Indonesia, the progress achieved has been due, in no small part, to the
increased competence of Indonesian agencies. With further growth and invest-
ment, and increasing support from the Bank Group and other IGGI donors, the
Government will have to ensure that a continually increased level of respon-
sibility is assumed, shared and delegated downward by Indonesia's planners and
managers. As investments move more toward people-oriented and socially
sensitive activities, and as the complex linkages between sectors become more
important in a rapidly modernizing economy, it is important that development
planning and execution be borne by the beneficiaries. This will mean that the
knowledge about sectoral issues, both in the Government and the Bank Group,
will require strengthening: Government institutions and lower level staff will
have to be trained to cope with the day-to-day responsibilities of development
projects, thereby freeing senior officials to concentrate on the broad policy
issues of development. Progress in addressing these issues will ease one of
the prime causes of the absorptive capacity problem. It is clear that it will
take some years to move toward this objective, but the result will be that the
Government and the Bank Group will be able to engage more in sectoral planning
and lending. The proposed Fifth Technical Assistance Project will provide an
important tool for achieving this objective.
Procedures for Use of the Credit
44.       To ensure rapid initial commitment of the proceeds of the proposed
credit toward the objectives of rebuilding a firm project pipeline responsive
to development priorities, the Bank's Resident Staff has met with each of
the major departments of the Government as appropriate, and together with
BAPPENAS, has defined a tentative list of project identification efforts to
be financed by the proposed credit (Annex V). The Bank's Resident Staff
and BAPPENAS will also, with assistance from Bank headquarters as necessary,
identify and assist in the steps to be taken (including the preparation of
draft terms of reference) to allow Government departments to mobilize those
efforts which are agreed and approved to be financed by the proposed credit.



- 15 -
45.       The proposed credit would, in all essential respects, follow the
procedures used in the earlier technical assistance credits and would finance
up to 85% of each subproject costs, including local cost. The Government would
continue to contribute to the financing of the various technical assistance
activities not less than 15% of total cost, in cash or kind, for each sub-
project. Financing of local costs is justified as technical assistance for
project preparation and advisory services has a high priority and in order to
promote the development of domestic consulting services. As under previous
credits, BAPPENAS would be the Government agency mainly responsible for
determining technical assistance priorities and for making requests for
assistance from the proposed credit, but actual contracts for services woulu
be signed and supervised by the Government implementing agency concerned.
The Director of the Bank's Resident Staff would continue to act for the
Association in dealing with all matters related to the selection and execution
of subprojects.
Project Implementation
46.       A new feature of the proposed credit would be the establishment of
a Project Coordination Committee for the Fifth Technical Assistance Credit
(Section 4.02 of the Development Credit Agreement). The Committee would be
chaired by the Deputy-Chairman for Economic Affairs of BAPPENAS, and the
members would represent the relevant bureaus in BAPPENAS, the Ministry of
Finance and Bank Indonesia. The Chairman of the Committee would invite
representatives of other ministries and agen.cies to participate in meetings
of the Committee when the Committee considers matters relevant to such
ministries or agencies. The Committee would be empowered to:
(a) formulate, on behalf of the Government, an overall plan for sub-
projects to be financed from the credit and recommend to the
Association all subprojects proposed to be carried out under the
project;
(b)  assign responsibility to line agencies for all aspects of preparing
terms of reference, short lists of consultants, negotiating and
administering contracts for approved subprojects; and
(c)  review and approve all aspects of employing consultants including
their qualifications, terms and ronditions of employment, and terms
of reference, supervise the execution of their contract by the
relevant line agency and review problems and progress of the approved
subprojects.
The members of the Committee would be delegated enough authority by their
respective departments to act on all appropriate matters on behalf of their
departments. An assurance has been obtained that, for the purpose of carrying
out each subproject, qualified and experienced consultants acceptable to the
Government and the Association shall be employed, to the extent required, on
terms and conditions (including terms of reference) approved by the Government
and the Association (Section 4.03(a) of the Development Credit Agreement).
47.       The Project Coordination Committee would meet from time to time,
but at least once every quarter, to: (a) review implementation, and amend as
necessary, the overall plan for subprojects to be financed from the credit;



- 16 -
(b) review and approve, on behalf of the Government, the qualifications,
experience, terms and conditions (including terms of reference) of consultants
employed under the project; and (c) review and approve the final statement of
account for each subproject prior to withdrawal from the credit account. The
Chairman of the Committee would appoint a Secretary who would be responsible
for preparation of the overall plan for subprojects, an action program for
following up the implementation of the subprojects, and for routine adminis-
trative actions related to establishing and processing of subprojects. The
Committee would keep the Director of the Bank's Resident Staff fully informed,
on a regular quarterly basis, of the latest overall plan and the action program.
48.       In all cases, before approving a Government request for commitment
under the credit, the Bank's Resident Staff would review with the Government
and, where appropriate, with the UNDP or other IGGI sources, alternative
possibilities of financing to ensure that these sources are used when the
need could be met with reasonable effectiveness. All efforts would continue
to be made to incorporate funds in project loans or credits to finance
improvements in the implementation capacity of project agencies and studies
for future lending in related fields, and the proposed technical assistance
credit would only be used when special needs cannot be suitably financed under
project credits and loans.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
49.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Indonesia and the Association and the recommendation of the Committee provided
for under Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the
Association are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
50.       Features of the Development Credit Agreement of special interest
are referred to in Annex III of this report. The establishment of the
Project Coordination Committee would be a condition of effectiveness of the
proposed credit.
51.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
52.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
development credit.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
AGRICULTURE
Irrigation
Credit No. 289 Fourth Irrigation Rehabilitation: US$12.5 Million Credit
of March 9, 1972; Effective Date: May 5, 1972; Closing
Date: June 30, 1979.
The construction program has escalated in cost by 150% over the
appraisal estimate, due to an increase in the magnitude of the works and
unexpected inflation. The project is expected to be completed shortly.
Feasibility studies included in the project have been concluded and ground-
water investigations are nearing completion.
Credit No. 514 Jatiluhur Irrigation Extension: US$30 Million Credit
of October 3, 1974; Effective Date: January 10, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1980.
Initial organizational difficulties and late awarding of the
first construction contract have caused a delay of about 2 years in the
project schedule. The first construction activity started in February 1977
and contracts for over 70% of the project works have been let. Based on bid
prices for the first contract and revised quantity estimates on the basis of
detailed design, total project cost is now estimated to be about 140%
over the appraisal estimate.
Loan No. 1100   Sixth Irrigation:  US$65 Million Loan of April 10, 1975;
Effective Date: June 20, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1982.
Good progress has been made on the rehabilitation works, but
construction of new works is behind schedule because of delays in preparing
contract documents. The two largest contracts have still not been let.
Substantial cost overruns are anticipated due to unavoidable major changes in
the design of the Sampean Baru dam and unit price increases in other compo-
nents. These will be verified as bids are received for the major contracts.
Loan No. 1268   Seventh Irrigation:  US$33 Million Loan of June 4, 1976;
Effective Date: September 21, 1976; Closing Date:
December 31, 1981.
The implementing agencies have engaged the consultants. Construc-
tion is underway in the North Sadang and tertiary development areas, and
studies being funded under the project are expected to be completed shortly.
The mapping program is progressing satisfactorily. Disbursements are ahead
of schedule.

Loan No. 1434   Eighth Irrigation:  US$63.0 Million Loan of June 6, 1977;
Effective Date: July 7, 1977; Closing Date: March 31, 1983.
Disbursements are somewhat ahead of schedule, and the project is
being implemented satisfactorily.
Loan No. 1435   Ninth Irrigation:  US$35.0 Million Loan of June 6, 1977;
1977; Effective Date: July 7, 1977; Closing Date:
December 31, 1981.
While delays have arisen due to inadequate mapping in the Sungai
Dareh-Sitiung area, the project is ahead of schedule and progressing satis-
factorily. Some tender documents have been prepared and contracts are
expected to be let this year. Disbursements are ahead of schedule.
Loan No. 1578   Tenth Irrigation:  US$140 Million Loan of June 6, 1978;
Effective Date: August 16, 1978; Closing Date:
December 31, 1984.
Initial delays in hiring consultants and in preparing tender
documents are slipping the start of project construction behind the appraisal
estimate.
Loan No. 1579   Eleventh Irrigation:  US$31 Million Loan of June 6, 1978;
Effective Date: August 16, 1978; Closing Date:
December 31, 1983.
A smooth start has been made on some components but two components
are behind schedule due to unforeseen technical problems and delays in
drawing up tender documents.
Loan No. 1645   Twelfth Irrigation:  US$77 Million Loan of December 29,
1978. Not yet effective; Closing Date: March 31, 1984.
Consultant contracts are being finalized and a smooth start to
project implementation is being made.
Other Agriculture Production
Credit No. 259 Tea: US$15 Million Credit of June 24, 1971; Effective Date:
September 17, 1971; Closing Date: August 31, 1979
Nearly all the targets set at appraisal have been achieved one year
ahead of project completion, but factory capacity still has to be expanded



- 28 -
ANNEX II
Page 7 of 20 pages
to take account of the increased production which exceeds appraisal estimates
by about 6,000 tons, or 30%. Financial, technical and managerial performance
has been excellent. Inflation and additional construction and equipment
costs are expected to increase project costs by about 17% above appraisal
estimate, but the economic rate of return is good and is expected to be over
20%.
Credit No. 319 Fourth Agricultural Estates: US$11 Million Credit of
June 28, 1972; Effective Date: January 30, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1981.
Progress of the project continues to be good, with planting of
rubber and oil palm ahead of appraisal estimates and in excellent condition.
The project has been expanded to 15,000 ha (originally 11,400 ha). The
remaining area to be planted is about 3,500 ha, of which 2,300 ha have been
cleared and are ready for planting. Technical problems exist in processing
and equipment maintenance, but construction of the oil palm mill will be
accelerated and additional capacity for crumb rubber production will also be
provided. Profitability and cost of development at PNP X are satisfactory,
while the capital structure of PNP X is to be improved during the course of
the Nucleus Estates and Smallholders I Project (Loan 1499-IND). PNP X is
also participating in the Transmigration and Rural Development Project
(Loan 1318-IND).
Credit No. 355 Beef Cattle Development: US$3.6 Million Credit of
January 31, 1973; Effective Date: May 30, 1973;
Closing Date: September 30, 1980.
Several problems seriously delayed project implementation. The
Government's budget allocation was insufficient, and financial management and
coordination were weak. Changes in the scope and design of the project,
from one of breeding and fattening of beef cattle for export to that of
production of improved cattle for domestic sale as draft and breeding
animals, were approved by the Executive Directors in June 1977. The project
was reviewed in November 1977 and May 1978 and is now being implemented
satisfactorily.
Credit No. 358   North Sumatra Smallholder Development:  US$5 Million Credit
of February 14, 1973; Effective Date: August 13, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981
Progress continues to be satisfactory, and the expected program of
planting rubber and oil palm by smallholders was accomplished at the end of
1977. By 1981, when the project is completed, these plantings will have been
brought to maturity. The Government has decided not to expand the project in
its present location because of the extensive support already being given to
North Sumatra Province through this and other Bank-supported projects;



- 29 -
ANNEX II
Page 8 of 20 pages
instead, the Government is seeking the Bank's assistance for smallholder
development projects in other Provinces, including Aceh, Jambi, Riau,
S. Sumatra, W. Kalimantan and S. Kalimantan.
Credit No. 400   Smallholder and Private Estate Tea:  US$7.8 Million Credit
of June 22, 1973; Effective Date: November 30, 1973;
Closing Date: March 31, 1982.
Since smallholders and estates prefer a heavier concentration on
replanting and less on rehabilitation, the mix had to be changed, thereby
reducing the overall area from 13,200 ha to about 10,200 ha. Although
production will not be affected, since yields from replanted tea are higher
than from rehabilitated tea, costs will exceed appraisal estimates by about
77%, since replanting is more expensive than rehabilitation and costs have
generally increased because of inflation. Delays were experienced in imple-
menting the institutional framework for long-term lending, a new venture for
Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI). Because of this, and difficulties in involving
the private estates in the project, disbursements are behind appraisal
estimates. A major review of the project is currently being undertaken by the
Resident Staff in Indonesia. While the project has experienced difficulties,
it is estimated that, because of the project-induced spin-off effects, an
area at least equal in size to the project is being improved. Over 500
farmers' groups have been formed to improve tea production supported by a
project training program presently involving nearly 4,000 farmers. These
developments have been helped by a surge in tea prices (2-1/2 times appraisal
estimates). Considerable investment in factory and field development is
taking place outside the project, largely financed by short- and medium-term
loans from BRI and by private investors.
Credit No. 405   Sugar Industry Rehabilitation:  US$50 Million Credit of
June 26, 1973; Effective Date: April 22, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
The rehabilitation of two sugar factories and the construction
of one new factory, financed by the Credit, have been completed on schedule
and trial runs are taking place. The research part of the project is slow in
materializing; the sugar research station still requires a major consultant
input. The two PTPs involved in the rehabilitation process are both in a
particularly weak financial position, and this problem requires attention.
The Government has started an evaluation of the financial status of the
industry, but progress of this study is slow.
Credit No. 480 Fisheries Credit: US$6.5 Million Credit of June 14, 1974;
Effective Date: January 8, 1975; Closing Date:
June 30, 1979.
After some initial delays, the overall project is now about
18 months behind schedule. Construction of shore facilities at Ambon is



- 30 -
ANNEX II
Page 9 of 20 pages
virtually completed.  Boat construction is under way and all related equip-
ment is on site, ready for installation. While the quality of fishpond
lending has suffered some deficiencies in the past, remedial action taken by
Bank Rakyat Indonesia is gradually improving the situation.
Loan No. 1318   Transmigration and Rural Development:  US$30 Million
Loan of July 21, 1976: Effective Date: March 30, 1977;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
Settlement and construction are lagging about a year behind ap-
praisal estimates, partly because of the initial delay in project effective-
ness and weak project organization and management. Nonetheless, 1,300
migrant families have been settled at Baturaja and are successfully growing
food crops. Initial incomes are satisfactory in spite of inadequate fer-
tilizer supplies and poor seed supply, although one third to one half
originates from construction and rubber planting. These incomes are substan-
tially above incomes the transmigrants received in Java. As evidence of the
relative attraction of the Baturaja community, 485 spontaneous settlers have
already been attracted to the site. In the existing settled area at Way
Abung, there has been little improvement in incomes because fertilisers are
not available on site and delayed road construction limits marketing of cash
crops. Experience to date highlights the need for improving project manage-
ment and ensuring that agricultural support services and input supply systems
are in place as settlement proceeds.
Loan No. 1499   Nucleus Estates and Smallholder I:  US$65.0 Million
Loan of November 18,1977; Effective Date: January 12, 1978;
Closing Date: June 30,_1982.
This loan became effective in January 1978. Project implementation
has started slowly, due to inadequate budgeting of local funds and appoint-
ment of key consultants. Land clearing is in progress and planting material
is being distributed to smallholders.
Loan No. 1604   Nucleus Estate and Smallholder II:  US$65.0 Million
Loan of July 12, 1978; Effective Date: September 13, 1978;
Closing Date: December 31, 1983.
This loan has recently become effective.
Agriculture Support Services
Loan No. 1179 Agricultural Research and Extension I: US$21.5 Million Loan
of December 19, 1975; Effective Date: February 23, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
Due to prolonged negotiations over selection and terms and condi-
tions of employment of consultants, including architects and engineers, the



- 31 -
ANNEX II
Page 10 of 20 pages
project is about 18 months behind the appraisal implementation estimates.
Design of all civil works has been completed, construction of extension
information centers is progressing well and expected to be completed in FY79,
and the Agency for Agricultural Research and Development (AARD) plans to let
contracts for the remaining civil works shortly. At the present projected
pace of implementation all components, except fellowships, could be completed
by the Closing Date.
Loan No. 1267 National Food Crops Extension: US$22 Million Loan of June 4,
1976; Effective Date: September 21, 1976; Closing Date:
June 30, 1982.
Good progress is being made in the field and, despite organiza-
tional difficulties, an effective extension service is being created. Ap-
pointments of extension staff are ahead of schedule and the project director-
ate has been strengthened by the appointment of three additional Assistant
Directors. Civil works have been resumed and, after recent approval of
prefinancing requests for 1977-78, the training program has been started.
Disbursement is lagging in every category due to prefinancing difficulties
and delays in submission of withdrawal applications with supporting documen-
tation for equipment and furniture. The new procedure for prefinancing
(outlined by the Finance Ministry in October 1978) is expected to help solve
the problem and speed up project implementation and disbursement.
AGRO-BUSINESS AND CREDIT
Credit No. 785 Small Enterprise Development: US$40.0 Million Credit
of April 7, 1978; Effective Date: August 17, 1978; Closing
Date: December 31. 1981.
This credit became effective on August 17, 1978. Despite start-up
difficulties, Bank Indonesia (BI) is making good progress in revising lending
procedures and establishing new lending approaches to serve the medium-term
credit needs of small entrepreneurs. Training of BI and handling bank staff
is progressing and preparation for studies is on schedule.
Credit No. 827 Rural Credit: US$30.0 Million Credit of June 23, 1978;
Effective Date: November 3. 1978; Closing Date: March 31, 1985.
This project provides long-term credit to about 40,000 smallhold-
ers, primarily for fisheries, perennial crops and livestock, and technical
assistance to Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI) for program development, training,
credit procedures and accounting and management information systems. BRI,
the implementing agency, is in the process of evaluating proposals for
project consultancy and preparing the lending program for the first year
(April 1, 1979 to March 30, 1980).

Credit No. 387   Third Education:  US$13.5 Million Credit of June 1, 1973;
Effective Date: August 29, 1973; Closing Date:
December 31, 1981.
The project finances the production and distribution of 138 million
primary school textbooks in four subjects, and related in-service training
for 350,000 primary school teachers and 2,800 supervisory personnel. About
90 million project books have been printed and 3,800 tutors and administra-
tors and about 400,000 teachers (114% of the project target) have received
training nation-wide. Despite the remarkable quantitative achievements,
problems of management, distribution, technology and pedagogy make the
project less effective than it could be. The training program, although on
schedule and making good progress, is out of phase with book production,
which is almost one year behind schedule due to delays in paper procurement.
Textbooks and teacher manuals would benefit from better design, organization
and illustrations, and their content is limited by the national curricula.
In response to Bank proposals, the Government has started a major review of
the project to focus on its relation to other ongoing Government textbook
programs and overall future needs for production of instructional materials.
Credit No. 869   Polytechnic:  US$49.0 Million Credit of December 29,
1978; Not yet effective; Closing Date: June 30, 1985.
The project is designed to help the Government meet demand for en-
gineering technicians and trained accountants. It will introduce a new system
(polytechnics) for training technicians at the diploma level by establishing
a Technician Education Development Center and six polytechnics in Java and
Sumatera, and improving the quality of accountancy training by establishing
four accountancy development centers in existing universities.
Loan No. 1237 Fourth Education: US$37 Million Loan of April 15,
1976; Effective Date: June 17, 1976; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980.
Initially, all three subprojects - under the Ministry of Education
(MOE), Ministry of Manpower (MOM), and National Institute of Administration
(LAN) respectively - suffered an eight month delay due to late signing of
the Funds-in-Trust (FIT) Agreements with the UN Agencies providing technical
assistance, as well as contracts with the consultant architects. Further delays
have occurred in the tendering and awarding of civil works contracts for the
Manpower and LAN components. Overall, the project is about 1-1/2 years
behind schedule. About 70% of civil works, 40% of furniture, and 100% of
technical assistance have been contracted. Implementation of the technical
assistance programs of all subprojects is in line with the FIT Agreements.
Overall, the Ministry of Education and LAN components are going well, but the
Ministry of Manpower has had difficulty in managing its diverse program of

establishing 17 training centers. Delayed implementation may require post-
ponement of the Closing Date by about six months.
Loan No. 1433 Teacher Training: US$19.0 Million Loan of June 6, 1977;
Effective Date: July 7, 1977; Closing Date: June 30, 1983.
Implementation of the project closely follows the appraisal sched-
ule.  The first and second phases of the program to train 160 Indonesian
educators in ways to improve teacher training and develop new curricula have
been carried out successfully. Curriculum development work is making good
progress, production of learning material is under way, and the research
designs for studies included in the project have been completed. Civil works
are on schedule, but equipment procurement is delayed by about nine months.
There are no specific implementation problems at this stage.
Loan No. 1486 Non-Formal Education: US$15.0 Million Loan of
September 14, 1977; Effective Date: November 4, 1977;
Closing Date:  June 30, 1983.
The project aims at strengthening the nonformal education programs
of the Department of Education in seven Provinces. General progress in
project implementation is satisfactory. Renovation of two existing provin-
cial centers was completed on schedule, construction contracts for four new
centers are being awarded, and furniture and equipment is being tendered.
The technical assistance component is about nine months behind schedule due
to late signing of contracts and the November 1978 devaluation; however, the
training aspects of the project are on schedule. Recruitment of foreign
experts and domestic consultants is accelerating satisfactorily; initial
staff training, learning materials development, and evaluation activities are
being carried out. It will be another two years before the project can be
expected to make a significant impact on field activities.
ENERGY
Credit No. 399 West Java Thermal Power: US$46 Million Credit of June 22,
1973; Effective Date: August 28, 1973: Closing Date:
June 30, 1980.
Project implementation was initially delayed due to the necessity
of making additional financing arrangements to meet much higher costs of
equipment resulting from rapid inflation in 1974/75. However, implementation
is now progressing smoothly. Both 100 MW generating units have been syn-
chronized with the grid and are being loaded slowly.

Loan No. 1127   FouLth Power:  US$41 Million Loan of June 17, 1975; Effective
Date: October 23, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1980.
Construction of the third 100 MW unit at Muara Karang is pro-
gressing satisfactorily. The scheduled commissioning date of February 1980
is about seven months behind the appraisal target, but no further delays are
expected and there is a good possibility that some of the delays may be
made up. The loan disbursement is proceeding as scheduled in the appraisal
report.
Loan No. 1259 Fifth Power: US$90 Million Loan of May 20, 1976; Effective
Date: September 20, 1976; Closing Date: March 31, 1981.
All equipment required for the project is scheduled to be procured
in three lots. Nearly 75% of the equipment which was covered by Lot 1
(valued at $13.6 million) has been received; orders for equipment covered by
Lot 2, (amounting to $32.4 million) are now being placed. The project
suffered an initial setback of about one year in procurement action but is
now progressing satisfactorily. It is expected that loan disbursements will
be completed prior to the Closing Date.
Loan No. 1365 Sixth Power: US$116 Million Loan of February 4, 1977;
Effective Date: June 6, 1977; Closing Date:
December 31, 1982.
Implementation of the project, consisting of 2 x 200 MW steam
generating units at Muara Karang, is progressing satisfactorily. Orders for
major electrical and mechanical equipment were placed during the period
December 1977-February 1978. So far progress is on or slightly ahead of
schedule. Currently, estimated commissioning dates for the units are about
four to six months ahead of the appraisal estimate.
Loan No. 1513 Seventh Power: US$109.0 Million Loan of February 3, 1978;
Effective Date: June 30, 1978; Closing Date:
December 31, 1983.
Tenders for major electrical and mechanical equipment required for
the 200 MW unit, including turbine generator, steam generator, cycle equip-
ment, electrical equipment and power transformer, were opened on August 21,
1978. Bids have been evaluated and the Bank indicated no objection to the
recommendations for award of contracts on February 6, 1979.

Fertilizer Production
Loan No. 1089  Second Fertilizer Expansion:  US$115 Million Loan of
February 28, 1975; Effective Date: April 29, 1975;
Closing Date: August 31, 1979.
The project (PUSRI III) was commissioned April 9, 1977, one month
ahead of schedule. During the eight months of operation in 1977, the project
operated at 66% capacity utilization, which increased sharply to about 92% in
1978 with the overcoming of initial technical problems. Certain auxiliary
facilities, now being installed, are expected to be completed by mid-1979.
The project is not expected to show a cost overrun.
Loan No. 1254 Third Fertilizer Expansion: US$70 Million Loan of May 20,
1976: Effective Date: August 15, 1976; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980.
The project (PUSRI IV) was commissioned November 26, 1977, about
four months ahead of schedule. During 1978, PUSRI IV produced nearly 470,000
tons of urea, reflecting a capacity utilization of 83% in the first year
of operation. Some auxiliary facilities are planned to be expanded by
1980. The project is not expected to show a cost overrun.
Industrial Estates
Credit No. 428 Pulo Gadung Industrial Estate: US$16.5 Million Credit
of September 14, 1973; Effective Date: November 13,
1973: Closing Date: December 31, 1980.
The estate is progressing satisfactorily. Of 430 ha of raw land
earmarked for acquisition, 313 ha has been acquired and acquisition of
another 31 ha is under negotiation. 119 ha of developed land have been sold
to 99 firms. Employment in these firms at full capacity will be around
19,000 and an estimated 1,400 persons are employed on the average in both
factory construction and land development. Overall, operations are profit-
able. The return on capital investment, which is now projected to be 22%, is
significantly higher than the appraisal forecast of 13.4%. This is due to
developed land values rising faster than the cost of raw land and development.
The project's development has been slower than forecast at appraisal, and the
Closing Date has been postponed to December 31, 1980.

Effective Date: September 23, 1977; Closing Date:
September 30, 1981.
At the time of loan appraisal (October 1976) BAPINDO was facing
many problems, including high portfolio arrears and slow loan processing.
Accordingly, the Bank sought and reached understanding with BAPINDO and the
Government on a comprehensive Program of Action designed to remedy BAPINDO's
weaknesses and achieve further improvements. A recent Bank mission found
that BAPINDO has effectively implemented the Program and achieved satisfac-

Credit No. 300  Population:  US$13.2 Million Credit of April 20, 1972;
Effective Date: November 2, 1972; Closing Date:
December 31, 1979.
The Indonesian national family planning program appears to have
slackened somewhat. As of October 31, 1978, 30.0% of eligible couples in
Java and Bali were estimated to be currently using contraception; the
comparable figure for the 10 provinces of the Other Islands covered by
the program is 8.2%. These figures as of March 30, 1978, were 30.1% and
9.6%, respectively. However, during the period covered there have been
some problems with data collection, which may be part of the reason for



- 37 -

the decline. The report of the consultant engaged to determine the needs for
in-house computer facilities for the National Family Planning Coordination
Board (NFPCB) is now being evaluated. Of the construction component, the
remaining two paramedical training schools are scheduled to be completed by
August 1979. No completion date has yet been estimated for one provincial
office building, which was destroyed by fire in September when it was half
completed. Other project activities which remain to be completed, including
the fellowship training program and several research studies, will also be
completed by August 1979.
Loan No. 1472   Second Population:  US$24.5 Million Loan of July 6, 1977;
Effective Date: August 4, 1977; Closing Date:
April 30, 1983.
Considerable progress has been made on the civil works and procure-
ment aspects of the project. Of the 21 facilities, contracts have been
awarded for 20, and design drawings for the remaining building approved. The
provincial offices and training centers are scheduled to be completed by
September 1979, and the National Family Planning Training Center (NFPTC) by
May 1980. Development of the national population education program and the
national family planning training program is proceeding well.
Nutrition
Loan No. 1373   Nutrition'Development:  US$13.0 Million Loan of
March 14, 1977; Effective Date: March 31, 1977; Closing
Date: March 31, 1982.
Initial progress under the project is satisfactory. The Nutrition
Intervention Pilot Project, the anemia control and home gardens components,
as well as the fellowships program, are proceeding with minor delays. The
Nutrition Academy has increased its student enrollment from 100 to 160, and
48 graduates are expected this year, compared with 25 prior to project start.
Construction of the Nutrition Academy was completed in February 1979. The
Food Technology Development Center is about 50% completed, and the Center for
Research and Development in Nutrition about 63%. While monitoring and
evaluation units for each component have been operational for six months, the
central monitoring and evaluation unit of the Project Secretariat is just
starting to be staffed.
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
Credit No. 451 Fourth Technical Assistance: US$5 Million Credit of
January 2, 1974; Effective Date: February 15, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
Progress under the project is satisfactory and the bulk of the
funds have been committed.

1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
The BAKOSURTANAL complex at Cibinong is now structurally completed,
and most of the cartographic, photographic processing, and printing equipment
required to produce maps has arrived and is being installed. Resource evalu-
ation activities, including the compilation of data for Southern Sumatra
and a study for the Directorate-General of Estates of coconut lands to be
replanted in Sulawesi and Lombok, are also proceeding in the new complex.
Recruitment and training of new staff, particularly junior operatives,
has accelerated. The new photography financed under the Canadian parallel
project will shortly be available, by which time BAKOSURTANAL hopes to have
installed color photo processing equipment and to have fully trained special-
ized teams of operatives in the various map production fields.
TRANSPORTATION
Fertilizer Distribution
Loan No. 1139   Fertilizer Distribution:  US$68 Million Loan of
July 10, 1975; Effective Date: August 28, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
The project has been substantially completed at a cost 20% below
the appraisal estimate. Work on the five original port depots is completed
and the sixth depot, which was approved by the Bank in 1977 as an extension
financed from project savings, is nearing completion. All four ships,
including the additional ship approved in 1977 and paid for from project
savings, have been delivered and 52 of 58 inland storage depots are com-
pleted. All the ships, port depots and storage depots are operating.
Shipping operations have not been as cost effective as they could be, due to
some extent to existing large stocks of fertilizer requiring ships to be used
for longer distances for exports. Costs have also been increased because of
delays in ship turnaround time caused by the need to clear customs on inter-
island voyages and the cumbersome procedures involved. These matters are
being taken up with PUSRI and improvements are expected.
Highways
Loan No. 1236   Fourth Highway:  US$130 Million Loan of April 15, 1976;
Effective Date: August 13, 1976; Closing Date: December 31,
1980.
Virtually all key activities in the initial implementation schedule
agreed with the Government have been completed, although with delays of up to
one year. Construction of 1,200 km of roads has been started. Some problems
in executing the road works have been revealed on contracts started in 1976
and delays were encountered in awarding some contracts in 1977, causing a
slower rate of progress than scheduled. The project is about 25% complete.
The delays, combined with slow progress, indicate that the project will
probably be completed about 15-18 months after the Closing Date.

Credit of June 28, 1972; Effective Date: October 19,
1972; Closing Date: September 30, 1979.
Due to sharply increased costs and lack of creditworthy applicants,
just over half the tonnage of shipping expected at appraisal will have been
rehabilitated.  The Credit has been entirely committed and is expected to be
fully disbursed by the Closing Date.
Loan No. 1250   Second Shipping:  US$54 Million Loan of May 20, 1976;
Effective Date: October 8, 1976; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980.
Delay in the appointments of a number of consultants has caused a
slow start to the project and slowed project implementation and disburse-
ments. The acute financial problems of the State Shipping Company (PELNI)
have been tackled by the Government and new management is instituting a
recovery plan. The project entity (PANN) has committed, and the Bank-has
approved, $22.3 million of subprojects; the Bank has disbursed and made
qualified agreement to reimburse, funds totalling $6.0 million as of
December 31, 1978. The recent change in exchange rate may adversely affect
this project in the future and slow disbursements further. This matter is
under study and being reviewed with the Government.
Ports
Loan No. 1337   Tanjung Priok Port Project:  US$32 Million Loan of November 4,
1976; Effective Date: March 3, 1977; Closing Date:
December 31, 1979.
Slow progress on the construction of Government-financed works
has delayed construction of the first component, but progress is being
made and these works are scheduled for completion in July 1979. The first
construction contract for Basin III back up facilities has been awarded and
work is underway. The regional berths component has been delayed by slow
withdrawal of the Army, which was using the site for storage. However, 90%
of the land has now been released, the old buildings are being demolished,
and a contract for the new works has recently been awarded. These delays
will probably postpone overall completion of the project to mid-1981; it is
too early to estimate the full effect of delays on project cost. The Govern-
ment intends to establish statutory agencies (PERUMS) during 1979 for ports
and dredging, functions which are currently administered by government
departments.
Railways
Loan No. 1005   Railway:  US$48.0 Million Loan of June 14, 1974;
Effective Date: August 16, 1974; Closing Date:
June 30, 1979.
Project execution is behind schedule due to initial slow procure-
ment and execution of works. Procurement is now well under way and all
contracts have been placed or are about to be 2iaced. Freight and r,assenger



- 40 -

traffic declined in 1976, due largely to poor service. However, some
improvements have been made since the first half of 1977 following the
arrival of new locomotives and rolling stock, and operations improved
with the aid of consultants. The financial performance of the railway
continues to deteriorate due mainly to increasing costs, including a large
wage raise in early 1977, to low traffic levels, and to inadequate tariffs
for major freight commodities. The Government is completing the reorganiza-
tion of the railway as a Government Department. It has undertaken to review
the role of the railway and determine which traffic should be carried at a
profit and which should be subsidized.
TOURISM
Credit No. 479 Bali Tourism: US$16.0 Million Credit of June 14, 1974;
Effective Date: December 4, 1974; Closing Date:
August 31, 1979.
Construction of major infrastructure and related facilities for
the Nusa Dua tourism estate is under way and scheduled for completion in mid-
1980; construction of the hotel training school has been completed. The
completion of project components outside the estate (i.e., roads) is scheduled
for December 1980, about two years later than planned at project appraisal.
Visitor traffic to Bali has been growing; it rose by 8% in 1977 to 286,000
visitors and by a further 11.5% in the first eight months of 1978. Air
access is improving with the introduction of new international flights from
Singapore. At present, three potential hotel projects for Nusa Dua are under
consideration; however, while no final commitment has yet been made, changes
in the project description (recently approved by the Executive Directors)
which would allow use of savings in credit funds for hotel construction may
encourage hotel investment. It is unlikely that a first hotel at Nusa Dua
could be completed in 1980 to coincide with completion of the infrastructure.
URBAN DEVELOPMENT
Loan No. 1040 Jakarta Urban Development: US$25 Million Loan of
September 27, 1974; Effective Date: January 15, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
The kampung improvement part of the project is substantially
complete. Some 2,080 ha have been upgraded, compared with the original
plan of 1,980 ha. The sites and services component is about 75% complete.
Problems which have arisen with regard to the standard of materials and the
procedures to be utilized in allocating the plots were resolved last year.
About 2,000 settlers have moved on the site and the remaining plots are
currently being allocated.

March 31, 1980.
The progress of civil works is ahead of schedule, and costs are
generally within appraisal estimates. Although land acquisition is causing
some delays, efforts are being made to speed up procedures. Progress is
being made in developing Government capabilities to undertake a nationwide
kampung improvement program in the future.
Loan No. 1653 Third Urban Development: US$54 Million Loan of January 31,
1979; Not yet Effective: Closing Date: December 31, 1983.
The national kampung improvement program has been expanded in this
project to include Ujung Pandang, Semarang and Surakarta, as well as follow-
up components in Surabaya and Jakarta. The latter includes a new solid
wastes component, and will stress drainage and maintenance.
WATER SUPPLY
Loan No. 1049 Five Cities Water Supply: US$14.5 Million Loan of
October 31, 1974; Effective Date: May 21, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980.
Due to administrative and managerial problems the project is now
running 24 months behind schedule. This delay, together with higher rates of
inflation than anticipated, is expected to increase project costs about 15%
above the appraisal estimate. Detailed engineering and preparation of tender
documents have been completed, and contracts for all equipment and for major
civil works have been signed. The project has reached the construction
phase. The reorganization of the Directorate of Sanitary Engineering has
been completed, and the establishment and development of local water enter-
prises is proceeding satisfactorily. In September 1978, the Government
issued an interministerial decree defining relationships between the various
Ministries and the Water Enterprises, which is expected to expedite current
and future projects in the sector.
