F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The Program Development Objective was to promote an efficient and responsive
delivery of public services by the Province of Córdoba within fiscally sound policies. The
operation focused on three main policy areas: public finance, public administration, and
social sectors (health, education, and social protection). The specific objectives within
each of these policy areas are shown below (see Section 1.4).

  Key Indicators were not explicitly defined during appraisal. Output indicators reflected
the policy conditionalities included in the Policy Matrix. No impact indicators were
defined.

Revised Program Development Objectives (if any, as approved by original approving
authority)
PDO were not revised during implementation. However, output indicators, which
reflected the operation's policy conditionalities, were de facto modified in April 2003,
when a number of loan conditions corresponding to the second and third tranche
disbursements were amended as part of the operation's overall restructuring (see Section
1.6).

(incl. %         However, it receives more discretionary transfers as a proportion of current

Comments         Achieved as amended. Although Córdoba has complied with the targets agreed

(incl. %         under the 2002 and 2003 PFO bilateral agreements with the national

achievement)     government, its debt stock has grown comparatively more than for provinces as

of which was generated by provincial governments. In 2000, the incoming De la Rúa
administration initiated a set of economic reforms in an attempt to revitalize economic activity
and boost the confidence of foreign and domestic investors. In addition, the government
negotiated a three-year US$7.4 billion stand-by agreement with the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) that included a deficit target for the national government as well as a consolidated deficit
target for provincial governments. In October-November 2000, external debt markets closed for
Argentine public borrowing, and domestic interest rates rose sharply. The markets were calmed
by the swift action by the government to negotiate a broader international financing package of
$39.7 billion, the so-called 'blindaje', with the IMF and other international and bilateral lenders to
cover most of Argentina's external financing needs for 2001 and part of 2002. Although there
were signs that the political cohesion of the governing political alliance was deteriorating, as
indicated by the resignation of the vice-president in October 2000, the government remained firm
in its commitment toward restoring fiscal balances. The expectation was that the new financing
package would provide the time needed for implementation of the planned economic reforms,
which, in turn, would help restore growth and investors' confidence.

Restoring order in the fiscal accounts at the national and sub-national levels was at the core of the
national government's efforts, which included setting up binding deficit targets as part of the new
Stand-By agreement with the IMF, limiting borrowing at the provincial level, and implementing a
debt relief effort to support small provinces willing to control their spending. In addition, the
national government subscribed to an agreement with provincial governments to transfer a fixed
amount to the provinces during 2000 and 2001 in lieu of the automatic revenue-sharing transfers
(coparticipación) that are proportional to federal taxes. The Bank was asked to assist the larger
provinces in meeting the deficit targets and to support second generation reforms at the provincial
level, focusing mainly on health and education spending. The Bank and the government agreed to
replicate the model piloted by the Second Provincial Reform Loans (PRL-II) in Tucumán, Salta,
San Juan and Río Negro. These operations sought to ensure an efficient and responsive delivery
of public social services within fiscally sound policies by providing support to three pillars of the
provinces' reform program: public finance, education, and health. Córdoba, the third largest
province in Argentina's rich central region, was selected to be the second province in this new
phase. The choice of Córdoba was based on its relative importance. With a population of 3.1
million and a per capita income of $7,900 (about 90 percent of the national average), Córdoba
faced serious challenges, including a history of volatile fiscal performance, high taxes, a large
stock of debt, and inadequate human and physical infrastructure.

Approved in November 2000, Córdoba's PRL was consistent with the objectives of the Joint
IBRD-IFC Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) covering FY 2001-2004 (Report No. 20354-AR,
dated September 8, 2000), which was discussed by the Executive Directors on June 27, 2000,
shortly after the new administration had taken office. Specifically, the FY 2001-2004 CAS
identified the need to: (i) enhance social development, including poverty alleviation and human
resource development; (ii) improve the performance of the state, particularly at the sub-national


                                                   1

level; and (iii) consolidate structural reforms. Together with continuing support for reform in
revenue-sharing, individual provincial reform programs were identified as the main pillars of the
Bank's continued support for provincial reform in Argentina. Likewise, the operation reflected the
recommendations from OED's Country Assistance Evaluation (July 2000), which emphasized the
need to concentrate lending on social sectors and provincial reform, without neglecting the reform
of federal institutions. As discussed in the Board Paper (R96-55) approved in April 1996, the
fiscal justification for sub-national reform lending rested on the link between fiscal deficits and
pressures on the current account of the balance of payments, as provincial fiscal deficits increased
country risks and added to Argentina's vulnerability to external shocks. In addition, provinces
were considered a an important focal point for achieving development objectives in social
development, as they accounted for almost all public spending in health and education, as well as
being responsible for providing basic infrastructure services (pp. 15-18, FY 2001-2004 CAS).

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved):

The Program Development Objective was to promote an efficient and responsive delivery of
public services by the Province of Córdoba within fiscally sound policies. The operation focused
on three main policy areas: public finance, public administration, and social sectors (health,
education, and social protection). The specific objectives within each of these policy areas are
shown below (see Section 1.4).

Key Indicators were not explicitly defined during appraisal. Output indicators reflected the policy
conditionalities included in the Policy Matrix. No impact indicators were defined.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification:

PDO were not revised during implementation. However, output indicators, which reflected the
operation's policy conditionalities, were de facto modified in April 2003, when a number of loan
conditions corresponding to the second and third tranche disbursements were amended as part of
the operation's overall restructuring (see Section 1.6).

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved):

Córdoba's reform program was designed to improve its competitive position in the global
economy and lay the basis for sustained growth through an ambitious program to stabilize
government finances, improve public services, and strengthen human capital formation. The
vision was to create a model provincial administration by reducing the size of the provincial
administration while increasing its efficiency, cutting taxes, redirecting its efforts more to the
social sectors, and improving the efficiency and transparency of its services to citizens. Córdoba's
Provincial Reform Loan (PRL) supported a combination of first and second generation reforms
focusing on three policy areas: (a) strengthening public finances; (b) modernizing public
administration; and (c) reforming the social sector, focusing on health, education and social
protection. The specific objectives within each of the policy areas were as follows:

A. Public Finance: During the 1990s, Córdoba's fiscal performance was highly volatile, largely
as a result of short-term policies and poor management. After a brief improvement between 1996
and 1997, the lack of fiscal restraint resurged once more in 1998. While spending increased as the
elections approached, revenues fell as a result of the protracted economic downturn and the
deficit ballooned to nearly five percent of revenues that year. Unable to turn to the nearly



                                                  2

bankrupted Provincial Bank of Córdoba (BPC), the province sought short term financing from
private banks. Indebtedness increased sharply, even as service standards declined. In turn, poor
fiscal performance undermined economic growth and the ability of the province to pursue more
effective social sector policies. With the support of the PRL, the government undertook several
actions aimed at reaching a sustainable fiscal situation, with a specific focus on:

· Enhancing fiscal performance by striving toward achieving a fiscal balance and limiting the
    unsustainable growth of provincial debt and, if possible, reducing its stock.
· Strengthening tax administration to increase own-source revenues while decreasing the tax
    burden on individual taxpayers and businesses.
· Strengthening municipal finances by supporting the creation of new regional entities to
    consolidate similar functions for groups of municipalities, implementing financial and tax
    administration reforms, and providing technical assistance to support these initiatives.
· Increasing private sector participation by supporting the privatization of the provincial bank
    and the electricity company.

B. Modernizing Public Administration: With PRL support, Córdoba undertook an ambitious
state modernization program aimed at enhancing efficiency, effectiveness, and transparency of
public services to ultimately improve the business climate and provision of services to its citizens.
Specifically, Córdoba's state modernization agenda was aimed at:

· Enhancing financial management, including undertaking the modernization of the Ministry of
    Finance and the adoption of a new budget formulation module for the preparation of the 2002
    provincial budget.
· Promoting civil service reform, including conducting a civil service census, observing
    ceilings on filling vacancies, reviewing civil service policies, and expanding training.
· Undertaking organizational reform, including the undertaking of a pilot program to
    modernize the Ministries of Solidarity and Production.
· Enhancing transparency, including preparing and undertaking an action plan to combat
    corruption and submitting a new procurement law to the legislature.

C. Reforming Social Sectors: With PRL support, Córdoba undertook an ambitious program
aimed at enhancing social services, including health, education, and social protection. The
specific components of Córdoba's state modernization agenda that were supported under the
program included:

a. Health Reforms: With universal access to health services, a life expectancy of 72.8 years,
and a decline in infant mortality, Córdoba's health indicators are reasonable relative to other
provinces of Argentina. Nevertheless, toward the end of the 1990s the province still faced
significant problems in terms of regulation, management and planning of its health care delivery
system that resulted in higher costs, lower quality, and poor oversight of services. Over time, the
Ministry of Health had lost its role as the planning, regulatory and control agency of health
activities in the province, limiting itself primarily to financing/purchasing as well as providing
some health services directly. The health delivery system was oversized and inefficient, with
most public hospitals being old, inadequately maintained, and inefficiently managed. As in the
rest of the country, the quality of care for lower income sectors of the population depends
primarily on public hospitals, with few controls from the Ministry of Health. To address these
shortcomings, the specific actions supported under the program focused on:




                                                  3

· Protecting the health budget, in terms of its size and relative distribution, limiting personnel
     salary and benefit expenditures.
· Enhancing the performance of public hospitals, by increasing cost recovery from patients
     with health care coverage, establishing monitoring systems to systematically oversee
     performance of public hospitals, and developing quality assurance systems of patient care.
· Extending coverage to the uninsured poor by implementing a pilot scheme to identify and
     evaluate the potential costs and impacts associated with adopting a large scale insurance-
     based subsidy scheme for the poor.
· Strengthening of the Ministry of Health, with a focus on enhancing its regulatory functions,
     such as accreditation of health care providers, implementing quality assurance mechanisms,
     and enhancing purchase control systems.
· Strengthening of the province's health insurance agency (Instituto Provincial de Atención
     Médica - IPAM), by supporting its financial solvency, implementing an integrated health care
     network, and enhancing the quality of its health care.

b. Education Reforms: Despite having one of the highest per-student unitary costs in the country,
roughly 11 percent higher than the national average, Córdoba's education system suffered from
relatively low quality, and poor motivation and school attendance by both students and teachers.
With salaries accounting for approximately 95 to 98 percent of the education budget, there was
little funding available for teaching materials and maintenance, resulting in a dearth of needed
books and equipment as well as a deteriorating infrastructure. Other factors hindering the
education sector were high teacher absenteeism, poor teacher training, inequitable distribution of
subsidies to private education, and poor use of human resources. Under the PRL, education
reforms focused on the following areas:

· Enhancing management of education expenditures by implementing a human resource
     management system for educational personnel, reducing teachers' absenteeism, increasing
     student/teacher ratios, implementing a human resource management system for education
     personnel, and rationalizing the use of education resources with an emphasis on increasing
     capital and non-salary expenditures as a proportion of the overall education budget.
· Enhancing quality of education, by implementing a pilot program to monitor students'
     performance and socio-economic status to better target programs to reduce drop-out and
     repetition rates and disseminating the results of provincial and national standardized tests to
     enhance accountability.
· Rationalizing teacher training and teacher training institutes by implementing an
     accreditation system and tying public subsidies to performance.
· Improving the allocation of resources to the private sector by conducting regular independent
     audits to verify that the subsidies are distributed and utilized as intended.
· Promoting decentralized management by giving individual schools increased autonomy in
     resource management and implementing programs targeting students from more vulnerable
     socio-economic backgrounds.

c. Social Protection: Social protection in Córdoba was characterized by inadequate funding and
weak implementation capacity. In the past, the Ministry of Solidarity, which oversees social
assistance programs, had faced serious and unpredictable fluctuations in its cash flow,
undermining program effectiveness. These deficiencies were aggravated by organizational
weaknesses, as evidenced by extremely high administrative costs, high staff-client ratios, and
outmoded and cumbersome administrative procedures. In addition, provincial social assistance
programs were characterized by a generalized lack of transparency in eligibility criteria and poor
targeting. To address these shortcomings, the specific actions supported under the program
focused on:


                                                    4

· Protecting the social protection budget by ensuring the allocation of adequate and predictable
    resources to social protection in the provincial budget.
· Enhancing the quality of provincial social protection programs by conducting an assessment
    of the various programs under the Ministry of Solidarity.
· Improving targeting by developing a register of beneficiaries of social programs.
· Enhancing the organizational structure of the Ministry of Solidarity, including the review of
    its structure, legal framework, substantive goals and business processes, staffing requirements,
    audit operations, and change management needs.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas (if applicable):

N/A

1.6 Other significant changes:

Restructuring: By restructuring the operation in April 2003, the Bank sought to respond to the
profound changes that followed the economic collapse of December 2001, while preserving the
overall objectives of the loan. The decision to restructure the operation instead of canceling the
two undisbursed tranches was based on the substantial progress Córdoba had made in the
implementation of its reform program despite the adverse implementation environment.
Restructuring provided the opportunity to reframe the province's program in a manner that was
feasible given the macroeconomic uncertainties and poor investment climate without detracting
from the operation's original development objectives.

At restructuring, modifications were introduced in both the configuration of the loan tranches and
individual conditions. As original conceived, the loan was structured into three equal tranches of
US$100 million, the first of which was disbursed upon effectiveness. The second tranche-called
the 'floating' tranche-included conditions related to the sale of the provincial bank and electricity
company. The final third tranche was comprehensive and tied to a wide variety of reforms in the
areas of public finance, public administration and the social sectors. At restructuring, the two
pending tranches of US$100 million each were modified as follows:

· Second tranche (US$100 million): It included conditions relating to fiscal performance,
    protection of social funding, and the provincial bank and the electricity company, most of
    which were amended to reflect the post-2001 fiscal and social conditions.
· Third tranche (US$25 million): It was cut back to include only those original conditions in
    the areas of public finance, public administration, and the social sectors that were already met.
    The 15 conditions corresponding to the restructured third tranche were not amended, except
    for a waiver given to a pilot program to provide health insurance to the poor.
· Fourth tranche (US$75 million): A new tranche was created to incorporate conditions
    originally included in the third tranche that were still under implementation. Some of these
    conditions maintained the original targets, and others were amended. The bulk of conditions
    were in the areas of public finances, public administration and social sector reform.
    Additional conditions were added with respect to the provincial bank and the electricity
    company.

The second and third tranches were eligible for immediate disbursement, while the disbursement
of the fourth tranche was to be disbursed once the Province met the corresponding conditions.




                                                 5

In the case of individual conditions that had been rendered infeasible or overly ambitious by the
crisis, an upfront agreement was reached with the province on revised actions that, although
scaled down, were still consistent with the operation's development objectives. Overall, a total of
17 out of 53 conditions were either waived or had their scope modified-five and 12 conditions
corresponding to the original 'floating tranche' and third tranche, respectively. The most important
amendments and waivers related to fiscal targets, the privatization of the provincial bank, the
concession of the electricity company, the elimination of a pilot program to provide health
insurance to the poor, and municipal finances. Specifically, original fiscal targets were replaced
by those included in the 2002 and 2003 PFO bilateral agreements. In the case of the provincial
bank and the electricity company, conditions calling for their privatization or concession were
replaced by amended conditions calling for the implementation of restructuring plans to ensure
the continuing financial and operational strengthening of these entities, so they could be ready for
privatization once market were more favorable. The elimination of a health insurance pilot
program for the poor due the tight fiscal situation clearly constituted a loss for the program
supported under the PRL. In retrospect, some of the amendments weakened original conditions
by replacing result-oriented conditions with less substantial requirements, such as formal
agreements and the presentation of action plans that in practice had little, if any, impact. For
example, the conditions calling for the implementation of municipal fiscal pacts and the
harmonization of municipal cadastres were replaced by actions such as the adoption of formal
agreements and the preparation of technical assistance programs that have had little impact on
improving municipal revenues (see Table 7.1, Annex 7 for a detail of the individual amendments).

Given the severity of the crisis and its adverse consequences, it was clearly impossible to adapt
the operation to the new realities without significant trade-offs. While the development objectives
remained unaltered, the operation's scope was diminished relative to the original expected
outcomes as a result of the restructuring. For example, although steps were taken under the
restructured operation to enhance the operational and financial performance of the bank and
electricity company, these entities remained in the hands of the province. Likewise, revised fiscal
targets were substantially less ambitious than the original ones, particularly in terms of reductions
in the debt stock. However, by restructuring the operation as opposed to canceling it, the Bank
offered the province its support in responding to the crisis, as well as substantial incentives to
continue with the implementation of the critical set of reforms supported by the operation despite
the heightened fiscal and social pressure.

Cancellation: The current Argentina CAS, which was discussed by the Board in June 2006,
proposes a US$3.3 billion lending program that, at the request of the authorities, is made up
exclusively of investment operations. In this context, in agreement with the government, the three
provincial reform loans, including Córdoba's PRL, which were approved prior to the 2004-2005
CAS, were closed on March 31, 2006, and undisbursed tranches totaling US$226 million were
cancelled. These loans are envisaged to be replaced with new investment operations in the
provinces concerned (pp. 44, 49, CY 2006-2008 CAS). In the case of Córdoba, a Provincial Road
Infrastructure Project in the amount of US$75 million, was approved in July 2006 under the new
CAS envelope.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

Following the Board's approval in November 2000, there was rapid progress in the
implementation of various reforms, reflecting the strong commitment on the part of the provincial
authorities, the thoroughness of the preparation process, and the overall effectiveness of the PRL
model. However, the initial momentum was stopped short by the rapid deterioration of
Argentina's macroeconomic conditions, which ultimately lead to a full-blown economic and
political crisis in December 2001. In face of the ensuing economic and institutional chaos,
provincial authorities turned their attention to crisis management and many reforms were
postponed due to lack of adequate fiscal resources and mounting social tensions. Most notably,
the ensuing macroeconomic uncertainty at the national level prevented the province to finalize the
process of privatizing the provincial bank and concessioning its electricity company, as investor
interest in Argentine companies evaporated. Córdoba's financial situation was particularly
difficult during 2001 and 2002. Without the expected privatization receipts, the province (like
many others) had to resort to issuing quasi-money to meet its financial needs in the face of falling
revenues, lack of sources of credit, and discontinuities in the transfer of revenues-sharing funds.
In 2003, Argentina began to emerge from the depth of the crisis. Economic growth rebounded,
reaching 8.8 percent growth in GDP in 2003, as a result of the country's improved
competitiveness due to the currency depreciation of 2002, favorable international market and
financial conditions, and a renewed effort to improve fiscal management. Given Córdoba's
prudent fiscal management in the aftermath of the crisis and its continued progress in the
implementation of its reform program, even throughout the difficult 2001-2002 period, the PRL
was given a new lease on life in April 2003, when it was restructured to adapt its policy
conditionalities to the post-crisis environment. The restructured second and third tranches
amounting to US$125 million were disbursed on May 2003. Although the US$75 million fourth
tranche was cancelled in March 2006, Córdoba succeeded in achieving fully 32 of the 35 fourth-
tranche conditions as restructured (see Section 2.1, Tranche Release Binding Conditions).

The various aspects affecting implementation can be summarized as follows:

Sustained Borrower's Commitment at the Provincial Level: The operation benefited from a strong
commitment on the part of provincial authorities. The present governor came to power in mid-
1999 with a strong reform agenda, including the redefinition of the role of the state, the
imposition of supply-side limits on spending and tax cuts, and the privatization of the provincial
bank, the power company, and the state-run lottery. Having a majority only in the provincial
Senate, the management of the overall reform program depended on support of the opposition
party. Thus, the current and former governors signed a compromise accord on February 2000 to
seek support from their respective legislative factions for a fast track approval of an enabling
legislative package. Approved in April 2000, the three laws included in the new legislative
package provided the cornerstone for the new administration's reform program. The State
Modernization Law (Law No. 8.836) set the foundations for achieving fiscal equilibrium by
setting limits on current expenditures and public indebtedness, creating an information system for
government finances, and restructuring the civil service. The Incorporation of Private Capital into
the Public Sector Law (Law No. 8.837) authorized the privatization and/or concession of
Córdoba's Provincial Bank, the electricity company, and the lottery agency. Finally, the Citizens'
Charter Law (Law No. 8.835) explicitly defined citizens' rights to public services and access to
information-including the establishment of a regulatory agency for water, electricity and transport,
and the creation of the Anti-Corruption Office and Anti-Corruption and White-Collar Crimes
Courts. Provincial authorities provided steadfast support for the reform program, even under
unfavorable conditions. For example, the province voluntarily used Bank procurement procedures



                                                11

and unofficial no-objections in their privatization efforts. Moreover, the provincial government
insisted on pursuing the concession of the electricity company despite opposition from labor
unions; though, in the end, there were no offers presented due to the deterioration in
macroeconomic conditions. The operation has also benefited from political continuity, as the
governor was reelected to a second term in August 2003.

Uneven Support from the National Government: The PRL program was designed to support
reform efforts in selected provinces in a manner consistent with the national sector policy. Indeed,
in many cases, the national government saw the reform efforts spearheaded by provincial
governments as cutting-edge, and hoped they would have a demonstration effect on more hesitant
provincial governments. As such, the reform programs were vetted by the national ministries and,
in some cases, with promises of technical assistance and political support. With the change in the
national administration in late 2001, the level of support was less forthcoming in some areas, such
as education, but became even stronger in other areas, such as health. It is also important to note
that the devaluation had an adverse impact in those provinces engaged in reform and investment
operations with the World Bank and IADB vis-à-vis those provinces who had borrowed from
commercial banks. Specifically, the provinces that had borrowed from development banks saw
the burden of loans from international financial institutions (IFIs) triple overnight, as the loans
had been passed on them in U.S. dollars and they had to bear the exchange risk.

Thorough Preparation Process: The Bank dedicated a significant amount of resources to the
preparation of this operation, which resulted in technical soundness of the policy actions it
supported. Specifically:

· Internal consistency with the Bank's overall strategy: As mentioned above, the operation
    reflected the objectives of the overall Bank's strategy as outlined in FY 2001-2004 and OED's
    Country Assistance Evaluation (July 2000).
· Synergies with other sector operations: The Bank's team effectively capitalized on the
    experience and know-how developed by national-level sector operations, including the Inter-
    American Development Bank's PRISE, the Secondary Education Decentralization Project
    (PRODYMES-I) in education reforms, the National Program for Maternal and Child
    Nutrition and Health Project (PROMIN), the Provincial Health Development Project
    (PRESSAL) and the Health Insurance Reform and Technical Assistance Projects in health
    reforms, the Water Sector Reform and the Provincial Roads Projects for water and transport
    sectors, and the Second Provincial Development (PPD-II) and the Provincial Bank
    Privatization Loan in public sector reform.
· Technical soundness: Project preparation benefited from a series of sector studies, including
    an expenditure review in the health and education sectors as well as of pension expenditures,
    a tax administration assessment, an in-depth analysis of the provincial bank, and an overview
    of the structure of the electricity sector. These studies, which involved the main actors within
    each sector, contributed to expanding the operation's base of support and enhancing the
    technical soundness of the overall reform program.

Operation's Design: Overall, the operation effectively built upon the PRL model and incorporated
the lessons learned during the pilot PRL-II operations. However, policy conditionalities were
overly complex, with those regarding privatization and concessioning proving to be unrealistic
once the macroeconomic environment changed. Specifically, the strengths and weaknesses of the
operation's design can be summarized as follows:




                                                  12

· Effectiveness of the PRL model: The operation replicated the PRL model previously piloted
    under the four preceding PRL-II operations. Actors at all levels, including national and
    provincial authorities and professional staff, as well as the Bank's task managers and sector
    specialists, noted the particular strengths of the PRL's cross-sector approach to public sector
    reform, which simultaneously addressed the need to enhance efficiency and service delivery
    in the social sectors while maintaining a sustainable fiscal framework, thus enhancing the
    medium- and long-term sustainability of the development process. Likewise, by lending
    directly to provincial governments, operations such as Córdoba's PRL can tailor policy
    actions to the specific needs of the provinces, as well as coordinate at the provincial level the
    various sector operations being sponsored at the national level.
· Incorporation of lessons learned: Córdoba's PRL effectively incorporated the lessons
    learned from the previous four PRL-II loans, including: (i) the need to extend the life of the
    operation beyond 12 to 18 months to adapt more realistically to the time needed to implement
    reforms and show initial results; (ii) the need to have broad political support for the reform
    program from civil society, which, in the case of Córdoba, was developed during the election
    campaign; (iii) the importance of capitalizing on ongoing sector operations to provide the
    needed know-how to implement sector reforms; and (iv) ensuring that legislation required for
    the program, including those involving privatization, were already in place.
· Excessive complexity of the policy conditionalities: As originally designed, the 'floating'
    tranche included six well-defined conditions that focused on fiscal targets and key policy
    actions related to the liquidation of the provincial bank and concession of the electricity
    company. In contrast, the third tranche included 47 conditions covering the various policy
    areas targeted under the province's ambitious reform program. The large number of
    conditions made supervision more difficult, particularly as the implementation environment
    itself grew more complex. The elimination of those policy conditions related to technical
    inputs (such as adopting action plans) would have helped streamline the Policy Matrix.

Risk Assessment: At appraisal, the Bank's team correctly identified the main risks affecting the
operation at the provincial level and put in place measures to minimize their impact. Key risk
factors included the administration's commitment toward reducing taxes and its potential negative
effect on fiscal performance, the potential for political commitment to erode over time, and the
possibility that the privatization efforts would be aborted by lack of market demand. To
ameliorate the risk of a drop in provincial revenues due to tax cuts, the administration also
embarked on tax administration reform with IADB support. To ameliorate the risk of waning
political support, the program was designed to be fully implemented during the earlier years of
the provincial administration's four-year term. While the political commitment of provincial
authorities was considered to be strong, the program also included key upfront actions such as the
passage of a law supporting the privatization of the provincial bank, to further demonstrate their
resolve. The program also required legislation to support the policy changes, thus substantially
reducing the risk of reversal. Finally, to address the uncertainty regarding the market's response to
the privatization efforts, the conditions related to the provincial bank and the electricity
companies were included in a 'floating' tranche, thus, ensuring that the third tranche could be
disbursed even if these conditions were not met.

Although at the time of appraisal it was expected that the measures taken by the De la Rúa
administration would succeed in averting a major economic crisis, in retrospect it is now clear
that the risk of deteriorating macroeconomic conditions was underestimated by the markets,
governments, and international financial institutions. This is made evident by the assumptions
behind a forecast of Córdoba's finances performed as part of the project's preparation.
Specifically, the forecast projected a 4.5 percent GDP growth for the 2001-2005. Later events



                                                 13

proved that this scenario was exceedingly optimistic, as Argentina's GDP actually dropped by 11
percent in 2002.

Economic and Political Collapse 2001-2002: By the time the project was declared effective in
August 2001, the political and social situation was deteriorating rapidly. By the end of the year,
capital flight led to the imposition of banking controls, a policy that proved highly unpopular and
the cause of massive protests. In December 2001, President de la Rúa resigned and was
succeeded by several interim presidents in the month after his resignation until President Duhalde
was appointed by the national congress to complete the existing presidential term through May
2003. During the interim presidencies, the parity between the peso and the dollar was abandoned,
and the government announced that it would not service its external debt (except for that with the
IFIs). Meanwhile, the country continued to sink into a deeper recession, with GDP falling by 11
percent in 2002. The social costs of the crisis were profound, with poverty gripping more than 50
percent of the population by July 2002. As mentioned earlier, Córdoba was severely affected by
the crisis; thus, managing the financial and social crisis absorbed much of the administration's
attention during 2002. Given the highly unfavorable implementation environment, the
achievements of Córdoba's PRL and the sustained support of the provincial authorities for its
reform program are particularly noteworthy.

Post-Crisis Economic Environment: Despite the very difficult macroeconomic context, the
federal and provincial governments took extraordinary measures to contain the fiscal situation
during 2002, which led to the eventual stabilization of federal-provincial fiscal relations. The
national government entered into bilateral agreements (Programa de Financiamiento Ordenado
de las Finanzas Provinciales - PFO) with 17 of the 24 provinces, including Córdoba, agreeing to
support debt restructuring and servicing in exchange for the provinces meeting specific fiscal and
debt targets. The government also agreed on a transition program with the IMF, covering the
period of January through August 2003. In view of the more promising macroeconomic
prospects, the original closing date of March 2003 was extended to December 2003 to allow for
the operation's restructuring, which was completed in April 2003 together with the disbursement
of the second and third tranches. After three additional extensions, the operation was finally
closed on March 31, 2006, and the US$75 million corresponding to the fourth tranche were
cancelled. While some conditions were not fully met (i.e., completion of the human resource
management system for the education sector, obtaining final approval from the central bank on
the restructuring plan of the provincial bank, increasing electricity tariffs, and regularly
publishing IPAM's findings on health care quality), the decision to cancel the fourth tranche was
mainly related to continuing uncertainties in the country's macro framework, including concerns
regarding the lack of engagement on the part of national authorities on structural issues affecting
the investment climate and private sector participation. As noted below under lessons learned, the
experience of Córdoba's PRL shows that failings or uncertainties at the macro level that are
beyond the sphere of influence of provincial governments can override substantial achievements
at the provincial level.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

(a)        M&E Design: As mentioned earlier, the Policy Matrix effectively operationalized the
major aspects of Córdoba's reform strategy and the main project outputs associated with the
operation. No additional monitoring and impact indicators were developed at appraisal.

(b)       M&E Implementation: As noted earlier, implementation was severely disrupted by the
2001-2002 economic crisis, which also affected the continuity and fluidity of supervision efforts



                                                 14

during that period. It is important to note, however, that Project Status Reports (PSRs) were still
completed on schedule. Full-fledged supervision efforts resumed in early 2003 to determine the
viability of restructuring the operation and assess the progress made toward the accomplishment
of second-tranche conditions. During supervision, the Policy Matrix and the corresponding
sections in the legal agreement (Schedules 3 and 4) functioned as the main de facto M&E tool for
the operation given the lack of other predetermined indicators.

(c)       M&E Utilization: Particularly noteworthy are the performance contracts between the
electricity company EPEC and the province, which constituted a particular useful M&E tool
designed as part of the operation's restructuring. Specifically, these contracts clearly specify
performance targets on an annual basis, which are formally agreed on by EPEC's board of
directors and the province. These performance contracts have been very useful in monitoring
progress toward the objectives of EPEC's restructuring plan. Concession contracts signed with
almost all electricity cooperatives are expected to play a similar role regarding the monitoring by
the regulatory authority of electricity service quality in areas served by these cooperatives. To
fully capitalize on the potential benefits of these performance contracts in terms of enhancing
transparency and accountability, the provincial government and EPEC's authorities could
consider publishing the performance contract's targets and progress reports on EPEC's website-
although a robust set of statistics on EPEC's performance is currently included in such website, it
has not been updated since 2002 or earlier
(http://www.epec.com.ar/PaginaOficial/index_mapa_sitio.html).

2.4 Expected Next Phases:

The current CAS reflects a significant shift from development policy lending to an investment-led
strategy. As a result, policy-based operations like Córdoba's PRL are not envisioned in the near
future despite a potentially substantial demand at the provincial level. Nevertheless, there are
several operations within the current CAS that can support Córdoba's efforts to further strengthen
public sector management and the delivery of basic infrastructure and social services. Specifically,
the Sub-National Governments Modernization Loan (Loan No. 7352-AR, approved December
2005) is designed to support provincial governments in their efforts to improve their institutional
capabilities, and those of their municipalities, to effectively manage their resources and improve
the quality of public services. Based on a set of eligibility conditions designed to gauge progress
in the core areas of public sector management-i.e., financial administration, tax administration,
cadastres, and property registries-provincial governments can participate in a Basic Module to
complete and consolidate the modernization of these core areas and, those that are more advanced
in their modernization efforts, can also participate in the Advanced Module to focus on the
modernization of other areas in their provincial or municipal administrations. While Córdoba
could potentially be eligible to participate in this operation, for example to pursue its municipal
agenda (i.e., harmonization of provincial and municipal cadastres), the province has not yet
expressed an explicit interest.

In the health sector, the ongoing Maternal-Child Health Insurance APL (Loan No. 7225-AR;
approved October 2003), which supports the implementation of the country's flagship maternal-
child health program (Plan Nacer), is currently being implemented in the nine poorest provinces.
Córdoba would be eligible to participate in the nation-wide rollout of this project (APL 2; Loan
No. 7409-AR; approved November 2006) to continue the expansion of its provincial health
insurance program, although with a focus on mothers and children. The province could also be
potentially eligible to participate in the Essential Health Services Program (Loan No. 7412-AR;
approved November 2006), which will replicate the incentive and governance structures



                                                 15

introduced under the Plan Nacer in public health functions at the provincial level, including
vaccination, as well as implementation of provincial health prevention and promotion activities
for HIV/AIDS, infectious diseases, and health monitoring. In the education sector, Córdoba is
currently participating in the ongoing Rural Education Improvement Project (Loan No. 7353-AR,
approved December 2005), which aims to increase school attendance among children in rural
areas.

Sector operations focusing on basic infrastructure include the recently approved US$75 million
Córdoba's Provincial Road Infrastructure project (Loan No. 7398-AR, approved July 2006). This
loan focuses on upgrading Córdoba's road network and institutional strengthening in areas such as
financial and debt management, project programming and monitoring, as well as management of
contingent liabilities arising from legal claims. The province is also participating in the recently
approved Provincial Roads Infrastructure Project (Loan No. 7301-AR, approved June 2005),
which aims to support the use of CREMA contracts in participating provinces and strengthen the
provincial road agencies. Another opportunity to carry out further reforms in the road sector with
the Bank's support will open in FY 2009, with the Provincial Roads III Project.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation:

As a result of the uncertainties regarding the medium-term macroeconomic framework, together
with the Bank's limited dialogue with the national government in key policy areas, the current
CAS does not include policy-based lending operations. Consequently, policy-based lending
operations directed at provincial governments such as Córdoba's PRL are not included in the
current CAS. However, the objectives of this operation are still consistent with those established
under the current as well as the 2004-2005 CAS. Specifically, by focusing on advancing reforms
in the social sectors while maintaining fiscal responsibility, Córdoba's PRL is fully consistent
with the current CAS objectives of promoting sustained growth with equity, social inclusion, and
improved governance (p. 30, CY 2006-2008 CAS).

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives (including brief discussion of causal
linkages between policy actions supported by operations and outcomes):

In retrospect, the macroeconomic framework that existed at the time of Board approval proved to
be unsustainable in light of the traumatic events of late 2001 and the first half of 2002. In
particular, the vulnerability of the economy to the volatility of private capital flows and the
imbalance in relative factor prices seem to have been underestimated. Also, in retrospect, the debt
situation at the national level turned out to be more one of insolvency than illiquidity, as believed
at the time the international financing package was put together. As a result, the operation's
general objective of supporting macro stability and, implicitly, the convertibility of the exchange
rate was thus not met during this period. However, with its emphasis on fiscal responsibility,
Córdoba's PRL has contributed to restoring macroeconomic stability during the post-crisis
period. Moreover, the operation has largely met its specific development objective of promoting
an efficient and responsive delivery of public services within fiscally sound policies. As in the
rest of the country, Córdoba's finances have improved significantly from 2003 onward. In 2005,
Córdoba enjoyed an overall fiscal surplus and a robust current account surplus, as a result of
responsible fiscal policies. With the support of the PRL, Córdoba has made significant progress
towards modernizing its provincial administration and ensuring a more efficient, transparent and
responsive delivery of key services in education, social protection, and in particular health, where



                                                 16

the achievements have been noteworthy. These accomplishments have taken place despite the
economic, political and social upheaval that ensued after the 2001 crisis. Despite the failed
attempt to privatize the provincial bank and concession the electricity company EPEC, the
province has taken important steps to strengthen these entities, including establishing a regulatory
entity for the electric sector. Achievements under the various policy areas can be summarized as
follows:

A. Public Finance: Moderately Satisfactory Performance. Córdoba's fiscal situation deteriorated
severely during the second half of 2001 and 2002. In the face of rapidly falling revenues, rising
interest rates, and disruptions in the transfer of revenue-sharing resources from the national
government, Córdoba resorted to issuing more than Arg$700 million in provincial bonds (the so-
called LECORs, one out of 15 'cuasimonedas' issued by provincial governments) to meet its
financial needs during 2001 and 2002. The province also adopted other measures to address the
crisis, including strengthening its own tax collection to offset tax cuts, continuing the freeze on
nominal salaries of employees until 2004, reducing salaries of high officials, cutting capital
investments, merging government agencies, and eliminating the upper house of the legislature. In
2002 and 2003, Córdoba signed bilateral agreements with the federal government (Programa de
Financiamiento Ordenado de las Finanzas Provinciales - PFO) that specified agreed annual
deficit reduction targets in exchange for debt refinancing. At restructuring, original fiscal targets
were waived and, instead, the fiscal targets corresponding to the 2002 and 2003 PFO bilateral
agreements were adopted. These targets were met and even exceeded. As in the rest of the
country, Córdoba's finances have improved significantly from 2003 onward. In 2005, Córdoba
achieved a modest overall fiscal surplus, equivalent to 0.5 percent of current revenues and a
larger current account surplus, equivalent to 9.3 percent of current revenues (see Table 1).

Despite its improved fiscal performance, however, Córdoba exhibits less fiscal autonomy than
other provinces, with a smaller share of own-source revenues and, conversely, a higher share of
discretionary transfers from the national government relative to current revenues than other
provinces (see Table 1). This is largely the result of the province's strategic decision to reduce the
tax burden by approximately 30 percent to improve the business climate. While the improvements
in tax administration have been substantial, they have not been sufficient to offset the tax cuts, as
shown by the decrease in the share of provincial own-source revenues with respect to current
revenues between 1999 and 2005. Likewise, Córdoba's debt situation has deteriorated with
respect to other provinces. While Córdoba's level of indebtedness (i.e., stock of debt as a
proportion of current revenues) was lower than that of provinces as a whole by roughly 8
percentage points in 1999, it exceeded it by 19 percentage points in 2005. In addition, the
provincial bank and the electricity company remain in the hands of the province, as their
privatization became unrealistic in the face of the existing macroeconomic environment. In line
with the amended fourth-tranche conditionality, the province has made substantial progress
toward further strengthening the operations of these entities. Despite these improvements, these
two enterprises still pose the threat of future contingent liabilities, as their privatization and
concessioning do not appear likely in the near future. With regard to municipal finances, while
the loan conditions were met as amended, it is not clear they have had a significant impact on
improving municipal finances.

 The accomplishment of the specific objectives under public finances and administration can be
 summarized as follows:

 · Fiscal performance: Accomplished as amended. Although the fiscal targets were met during
      the first half of 2001, Córdoba's fiscal program went severely off track during the second
      semester. In view of Córdoba's inability to meet the original second- and third tranche fiscal
      targets in terms of current account surplus, overall deficit, and debt stock, these conditions
      were waived and amended at restructuring. The new conditions called for compliance with
      the quarterly targets agreed under the 2002 and 2003 PFO bilateral agreements. These targets
      were met and exceeded. In May 2005, Córdoba subscribed to the national Fiscal
      Responsibility Law (Ley Federal de Responsabilidad Fiscal - FRL; Law No. 25.917), which
      sets general rules in terms of fiscal performance and public debt sustainability for the
      Argentinean public sector, including the provincial governments. Córdoba met the
      performance targets corresponding to 2005, including having a debt service of 11 percent of
      current revenues, which is below the 15 percent maximum level allowed under the FRL. In
      2005, Córdoba enjoyed an overall fiscal surplus and a robust current account surplus,
      equivalent to 9.3 percent of current revenues (see Table 1). However, despite its improved
      financial health, Córdoba's relative share of own-source revenues with respect to current
      revenues has decreased since 1999, thus eroding its fiscal autonomy. Personnel expenditures
      increased by 39 percent between 2004 and 2005 and further salary increases have already
      been granted for 2006 and 2007. In addition, the stock of debt with respect to current
      revenues has increased significantly, from 45.2 percent in 1999 to 134.5 percent in 2005.
      Although this increase is partly explained by the devaluation of the peso, the increase in


                                                          18

  Córdoba's debt stock during this period (i.e., 220 percent) surpassed that of provinces as a
  whole (i.e., 150 percent).
· Tax administration: Accomplished as amended. Córdoba's revenues are primarily derived
  from federal revenue sharing and two taxes under provincial jurisdiction-i.e., the gross
  receipts tax (Ingresos Brutos) and the property tax. To improve the business climate and
  strengthen Córdoba's competitive position vis-à-vis other provinces, the new administration
  embarked on a program of phased reductions in tax rates, equivalent to roughly a 30 percent
  reduction in the tax burden. To compensate for the reductions in tax rates, the province
  focused on increasing collections of over-due accounts and enhancing tax administration.
  While an amnesty on penalties and interest was declared in 1999, the government also
  announced that there would be no further provincial tax amnesties and, in line with PRL
  conditionality, has maintained its vow.
  All conditions in the area of tax administration have been met, including reconciling reported
  tax payments with actual bank deposits, incorporating the single taxpayer identification code
  (Clave Única de Identificación Tributaria - CUIT) to the records of taxpayers and property
  owners, implementing a special system to monitor tax returns focusing on large taxpayers,
  and ensuring that at least two thirds of all properties are registered in a computerized cadastre
  data base. In line with fourth-tranche conditions, revenues from the provincial gross receipts
  tax were at least 2 percent higher than revenues from national value-added tax (Impuesto al
  Valor Agregado - IVA) based on a 1999 index base-i.e., Córdoba's revenues from its gross
  receipts tax increased by 230 percent between 1999 and 2005, compared to an increase of 192
  percent for the national government's IVA tax, well exceeding the PRL target. Likewise, no
  new tax amnesties have been granted and the province has implemented its 2003 tax audit
  plan. Moreover, the establishment of an innovative fiscal police force (Policía Fiscal) has
 proven to be highly effective in reducing tax evasion. Despite these efforts, increases in
 overall provincial revenues are below those of provinces as a whole-particularly in property
 taxes-mainly due to tax reductions. Between 1999 and 2005, Córdoba's provincial tax
 revenues increased by 76 percent in nominal terms, compared to an average 136 percent for
 all provinces. As a result, provincial tax revenues accounted for 28.3 percent of current
 revenues in 2005 compared to 35.7 percent in 1999.
· Municipal Finances: Accomplished as amended. Córdoba has over 400 municipal
 governments, many of which suffer from limited technical capacity in managing expenditures
 and generalized overstaffing. As a result, as of the late 1990s, the municipalities had
 accumulated significant levels of debt, particularly with the provincial bank. To address these
 shortcomings, the new administration signed a Fiscal Clean-Up Pact (Pacto de Saneamiento)
 with all municipal governments in 1999. Under this pact, the province agreed to refinance the
 municipal debt, in exchange for municipalities undertaking a comprehensive series of reform
 initiatives, including the creation of new regional entities to consolidate governmental
 functions for groups of municipalities, and financial and tax administration reforms including
 the implementation of cadastres, tax registries, and financial management systems. Technical
 and financial support for these initiatives was anticipated under an IADB municipal operation.
 At the time of restructuring, progress in the area of municipal finances had been limited, in
 part due to the cancellation of the IADB project. As a result and of the need to focus on
 priority areas in the post-crisis environment, the loan conditions relating to municipal
 finances were amended to support a scaled-down program of provincial technical assistance
 and training for groups of municipalities to support the most critical tax, cadastre, and
 financial management improvements. The amendments replaced result-oriented conditions
 for less substantial conditions calling for formal agreements, the presentation of action plans,
 and such (see Annex 7.1). Specifically, the amended conditions required that at least 20
 municipalities be grouped as legal entities, and the province would subscribe technical
 assistance agreements to support 20 municipalities in tax collection, the provision of core


                                                19

  public services, and cadastre harmonization activities. As a result, although the amended
  conditions were met, the impact seems to be negligible.
· Bank of the Province of Córdoba (BPC): Partially accomplished as amended. Córdoba's
  provincial bank was-and still is-one of the largest provincially owned banks in Argentina. A
  long history of poor management, questionable lending practices, and weak loan recovery,
  lead provincial authorities to the decision to privatize up to 87 percent of the BPC's shares,
  thus avoiding the contingent liabilities associated with future recapitalization needs. By the
  time the operation was taken to Board, a privatization law satisfactory to the Bank had been
  approved by the legislature, an independent regulatory body had been established, appropriate
  bidding documents in line with World Bank procurement guidelines had been issued,
  technical support by international investment banking, and consulting firms had been secured.
  The process of developing international investors' interest advanced well during 2000 and
  early 2001. However, the sharp and unanticipated fall in market confidence in mid-2001
  aborted the privation efforts. While a winning bidder for the provincial bank was selected, a
  sales contract was never signed.
  At restructuring, conditions regarding the provincial bank were amended to reflect the
  unfavorable privatization environment and to prevent the further deterioration of the BPC's
  financial and operational situation. By the time of the disbursement of the second tranche, the
  province had taken the first steps in this direction, meeting the amended second-tranche
  conditions, including: employing a consulting firm to conduct an in-depth financial,
  operational and institutional diagnosis of the institution, seeking the Central Bank's guidance
  on adjusting and carrying out a Regularization and Financial Strengthening Plan, and
  initiating the process to outsource the management of its residual assets.
  The restructured fourth-tranche conditions focused on the Central Bank's approval and
  implementation of the BCP's restructuring plans to ensure the institution's continuing
  financial and operational strengthening, so it could be ready for privatization once markets
  were more favorable. Specifically, the fourth-tranche conditions called for: (i) the selection of
  a firm to manage BPC's residual assets; (ii) the submission to the Central Bank of a revised
  Regularization and Financing Plan based on the results of the diagnosis of the external
  consultant firm and the Central Bank's recommendations; and (iii) the central bank's approval
  and BPC's implementation of such plan. The province has met two of these conditions:
  a. Since 2004, a private firm has been effectively managing BPC's residual assets (i.e., old
       non-performing loan portfolio and the credit portfolio of 'Córdoba Bursátil'). The firm is
       responsible for the administration and recovery of residual assets for five years, ending in
       November 2008.
  b. The BPC submitted to the central bank a revised regularization plan on June 2004 and
       subsequent revisions were made in August and October 2004 to reflect the Central Bank's
       observations. The plan focused, among other things, on restructuring the BPC's
       management structure, reductions in personnel and administrative costs, and expansion of
       commercial activities.
  c. Under the regulatory framework of Argentina's banking sector, the central bank does not
       give formal approval of restructuring plans. Although the central bank indicated its
       preliminary acceptance of the revised plan on January 7, 2005, there were still
       disagreements regarding the terms of the US$30 million recapitalization of the BPC that
       is required from the province. On November 7, 2006, a revised version of the BCP's
       restructuring plan was submitted to the central bank for its consideration. According to
       the BPC's management team, this version of the plan reflects all the requirements and
       suggestions previously expressed by the central bank, including the terms of the pending
       recapitalization. Specifically, provincial authorities have agreed to recapitalize the BCP
       in twelve fixed, consecutive, monthly installments, beginning on October 2006. Payment
       is   being   guaranteed    with    the  province's    automatic    revenue-sharing    funds


                                               20

      (coparticipación). The central bank is expected to emit its opinion by February 2007.
      Thus, this condition has not yet been met.
 Although recapitalization is a core issue in ensuring BPC's financial viability and solvency
 over the short, medium and long term, it should be noted that the BPC has made progress
 toward strengthening its operations and improving internal controls and procedures. Under
 new management-one with extensive experience in private sector banking-the BPC has
 implemented organizational and procedural changes to transform its corporate culture,
 aligning it with private sector practices. It has also lowered its operating costs by reducing
 about 320 staff -equivalent to 10.5 percent of the staff-in 2004. Moreover, as Argentina's
 banking sector in general, the BCP has seen an improvement in its finances, as illustrated by
 the Arg$37 million operating surplus attained in 2005. However, the prospects for
 privatization of BPC are dim, and provincial authorities formally announced their decision
 not to proceed with the privatization in early 2006.
· Electric company (Empresa Provincial de Energía de Córdoba - EPEC): Partially
  accomplished as amended. A full service electricity company with generation, transmission,
  and distribution capacities, EPEC was-and still is-among the largest electric companies under
  government control. Despite several operational improvements during the 1990s, EPEC's
  operational performance remained in the lower 50 percent of all electricity distribution
  companies in Argentina, ranking particularly low in terms of energy losses and users per
  employee. EPEC's financial situation was highly vulnerable, with a negative cash flow in two
  of the five years between 1994 and 1999. Moreover, overall assets were stagnating, as the
  level of investments had been low. To address these shortcomings, including reducing
  operational costs and increasing investment, the provincial government opted to increase
  private participation in the entire electricity sector, as authorized by the Law of Incorporation
  of Private Capital into the Public Sector (Law No. 8.837) approved in April 2000.
  Although bid documents for the electricity company were provided in October 2001 to
  interested parties, no offers were forthcoming given investors' rising concerns about the
  macroeconomic environment. Alternatively, the province subsequently sought to improve the
  efficiency of the electric power utility until market conditions allowed resuming the effort to
  incorporate private capital into the sector. In line with the amended second-tranche conditions,
  important steps had been taken in this direction by the time of the disbursement of the second
  tranche, including: obtaining legislative approval of new by-laws that provided for EPEC to
  enter into periodic performance contracts with the province; granting concession contracts to
  at least 50 percent of the private electric cooperatives registered in the province; setting up a
  special environmental unit within EPEC; and establishing a fully functioning power sector
  regulatory public agency (Directorio del Ente Regulador de los Servicios Públicos - ERSeP).
  Likewise, the province has met three of the four amended fourth-tranche conditions,
  including the signature of a performance contract, the completion of an environmental
  assessment and a time-bound action plan to implement mitigating measures, and granting
  concession contracts to 200 of the 203 private electric cooperatives registered in the province.
  The fourth condition, calling for the gradual adjustment of electricity tariffs and the issuance
  by ERSeP of regulations on service obligations has only been met only partially. While
  regulations on service obligation have been issued, the tariff increases that have been
  implemented appear to be insufficient to ensure EPEC's financial sustainability over the
  medium and long term, as denoted by the lack of substantial improvement in EPEC's
  financial position since 2000.
  Specific achievement with regard to EPEC can be summarized as follows:
  a. Performance contracts: The performance-contract approach, which was adopted after the
      failed concessioning attempt, is being implemented. The first performance contract was
      subscribed between EPEC and the province in March 2003 covering the period between
      2003 and 2005. Modeled after the French experience, the performance contract explicitly


                                                21

   defined the set of objectives to be achieved over the specified timeframe, together with
   clearly defined performance indicators with corresponding benchmarks and annual
   targets. A new performance contract was subscribed in early 2006. Based on the progress
   reports that EPEC submits to the province on a quarterly basis, considerable progress has
   been made toward improving EPEC's operational performance in some areas, including
   attaining significant reductions in the time required for connections and other services
   and for addressing customer complaints, significant increases in availability of generating
   plants, as well as important capital investments in the infrastructure supporting
   distribution, transmission, and generation. However, there are areas in which
   performance is lagging, such as technical and commercial losses of energy. Although
   EPEC has been able to reduce these losses by about 2 percentage points in the last three
   years, losses remain at high level (about 20 percent) compared to other, more efficient
   utilities in the region. Furthermore, the performance contract does not include financial
   targets to monitor EPEC's financial performance, which is key to ensure EPEC's
   sustainability in the medium and long term.
b. Environmental assessment and mitigation plan: A special environmental unit has been set
   up within EPEC. This unit is responsible for the implementation of the environmental
   mitigation measures outlined under EPEC's new environmental plan (Plan de Gestión
   Ambiental). One of the specific outcomes has been the clean-up of all transformers
   contaminated with Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCBs-i.e., mixtures of man-made
   chemicals heavily used in electric equipment with levels of toxicity and chemical stability
   that can pose significant environmental damage) in accordance with legally established
   labor and environmental standards. In addition, fluid residues are being regularly tested
   and an environmental management system has been implemented in all the generating
   plants. Disposal of hazardous waste, including electrolyte-powered batteries, is done
   according to environmentally safe standards.
c. Concessions with electric cooperatives: As mentioned above, concession contracts have
   been signed with 200 of the 203 private electric cooperatives registered in the province.
d. Regulatory framework: A new power sector regulatory public agency, ERSeP, has been
   established. On July 1, 2003, ERSeP issued regulations on service obligations in the
   power sector, including quality standards for technical output (e.g., variations in the
   electric supply), technical service (e.g., frequency and duration of blackouts), and
   commercial service (e.g., response times corresponding to inquiries, connection requests
   and such), as well as the corresponding penalties. This constitutes a significant
   improvement, as before EPEC also acted as regulator of its own operations.
e. Tariffs: In terms of tariffs, the federal government and all the provinces have authorized
   increased electricity tariff to large commercial and industrial users to partially reflect
   seasonal higher generation costs and to include additional surcharges to finance new
   investments. In a second step, these increases were made permanent. While the
   remuneration recognized to the distribution companies, the so-called 'Added Value of
   Distribution' (Valor Agregado de Distribución - VAD), is still frozen, in January 2006
   ERSeP authorized a fixed charge to be added to EPEC's tariffs to reflect the costs of
   service expansion. With respect to November 2001, residential tariffs have increased
   about 30 percent, commercial tariffs have increased 70 percent, and tariffs for large
   industrial and commercial consumers have increased about 140 percent as a result of both
   the fixed charge and the tariff increases. While Córdoba is among the provinces that have
   raised electric tariffs to, albeit partially, reflect higher costs, these increases have been
   insufficient to ensure EPEC's financial sustainability over the medium and long term, as
   indicated by the lack of substantial improvement in EPEC's financial position with
   respect to 2000. Thus, this condition has been partially met.



                                              22

    Overall, EPEC exhibits some operational improvements with respect to 2000, despite the
    failed concessioning attempt. However, based on the financial data provided by EPEC, the
    financial situation has not improved since 2000 due to insufficient tariff adjustments in the
    face of rising costs of inputs and labor. Thus, the financial prospects of EPEC in the medium
    and long term are not clear. The prospects for future concessioning seem slim at this
    point. As the provincial government does not intend to concession EPEC, it might be
    necessary to increase the efficiency and governance incentives entailed in the current
    performance contract, including monitoring EPEC's financial performance by incorporating
    financial targets in the performance contracts.

B. Public Administration: Satisfactory Performance. With PRL support, Córdoba embarked on
a broad and ambitious state modernization agenda. The province has implemented a financial
administration system that was used to prepare the FY 2003 and subsequent provincial budgets.
Although not a PRL condition, a new Financial Management Law was also approved, providing
an enabling legal framework for the new financial management system and enhancing the overall
transparency of the budgeting process and its execution. All PRL conditionality relating to civil
service was accomplished by May 2003 when the operation was restructured, including the
completion of a civil service census, the observance of ceilings on vacancies, the review of civil
service policies, and the implementation of an expanded training program. As a result of these
and other actions, the relative importance of personnel expenditures within the provincial budget
has decreased substantially, from 54 percent to 39 percent of current revenues between 1999 and
2005. Moreover, Córdoba continues to have the lowest ratio between provincial employees and
population of all 24 provincial jurisdictions (28 employees per thousand inhabitants compared to
37 for the provinces as a whole in 2004). As part of Córdoba's efforts to enhance transparency, an
Anti-corruption Office has been set up within the Secretariat of Justice to actively fight corruption.
Finally, in accordance with a fourth-tranche condition, a bill was presented to the legislature to
improve the current public procurement law in line with the principles of the new federal
procurement legislation; however, the law has not yet been approved.

· Financial Management. Accomplished. A financial management system in line with
    international standards has been implemented with IADB support. The system, which was
    used to prepare and execute the FY2003 and subsequent budgets, allows for real-time
    controls and reports, as well as substantial reductions in operation costs and enhanced
    transparency. The province regularly publishes on its website its approved and executed
    budgets (http://www.cba.gov.ar/vercanal.jsp?idCanal=36158). In addition, a modern financial
    management law (Ley de Administración Financiera y Control Interno de la Administración
    General - Law No. 9.086) was approved in 2003 providing the legal framework for the
    establishment of the new financial management system. This law also imposes restrictions on
    increasing spending in face of revenues rising above the levels anticipated. While it allows
    for the reallocation of resources within the various spending categories, it does so as long as
    the overall budget and level of indebtedness are not modified. In addition, it limits budgetary
    reductions affecting social services. The passage of the law constitutes an important step
    toward enhancing Córdoba's financial management, exceeding original expectations.
· Civil Service: Accomplished. Under the PRL, the province undertook several actions aimed
    at enhancing civil service, including conducting a census of public employees to determine
    the number and characteristics of all current employees, regulating new hiring, revising
    employment policies, and strengthening training programs. As a result, the relative
    importance of personnel expenditures has decreased substantially, from 53.7 percent to 39.4
    percent of current revenues between 1999 and 2005. While the number of personnel has
    increased relatively more than in provinces as a whole (by 24 percent and 8 percent,
    respectively) between 1999 and 2004, Córdoba remains the province with the fewest public


                                                23

    employees in relation to its population, with 28 public employees per thousand inhabitants
    compared to an average of 37 employees for provinces as a whole in 2004.
· Organizational Reform. Accomplished. With PRL support, Córdoba targeted the Ministries
    of Finance, Production and Labor, and Solidarity as pilots for programs of organizational
    reform. These agencies underwent a review of their structure and function, business processes
    were reengineered, and their management structure was reorganized. The action plans that
    were implemented included performance indicators and specific deadlines. The restructuring
    efforts of the Ministry of Finance went hand-in-hand with the implementation of the new
    financial management system. The modernization of the Ministry of Solidarity is discussed in
    further detail under Social Protection, Section 8.2.C.c.
· Transparency: Accomplished. An Anti-corruption Office (Law No. 8.835) has been
    established within the Secretariat of Justice to actively fight the abuse of power by public
    officials in their own benefit. An action plan to combat corruption has been prepared and
    made public and it is currently under implementation. An electronic mailbox has been set up
    on the Justice Secretariat's website for denunciations (oficina.anticorrupcion@cba.gov.ar). In
    accordance with fourth tranche conditions, a bill to improve the current public procurement
    law, in line with the principles of the new federal procurement legislation, was presented to
    the legislature; however, the law has not been approved.

C. Social Sectors: Satisfactory Performance. With PRL support, there have been substantial
improvements in the provision of key social services, including health, education and social
protection. Specific accomplishments in each of these areas can be summarized as follows:

a. Health Reforms: Satisfactory Performance. The actual achievements in the health sector are
similar to or have exceeded the levels anticipated at project design. Under the PRL, Córdoba
made substantial progress in the reforms of the health sector, particularly in terms of
strengthening the regulatory capacity of the Ministry of Health and incorporating modern
management tools aimed at enhancing resource management. The province has also succeeded in
improving the equity, efficiency and quality of public hospitals, which are now regularly
monitored in terms of quality of service, levels of production, and cost recovery. Although the
implementation of a pilot health insurance program for the poor was waived as part of the 2003
restructuring, Córdoba has advanced toward a more comprehensive universal health insurance
program, the Integrated Provincial Health System. The financial and operational structure of the
Provincial Health Insurance Agency (IPAM) has also improved substantially, a necessary
condition for its recent transformation into a decentralized provincial entity, which will become a
central pillar in the financing of the provincial health insurance system.

The variation in health indicators in Córdoba between 1998 and 2004 was similar to that of
provinces as a whole and, as a result, the province maintains a relatively high performance with
respect to other provinces. Specifically, infant mortality decreased significantly in Córdoba and
the country as a whole between 1998 and 2004, by 4.1 and 4.7 deaths per 1,000 births,
respectively (see Table 2). The percentage of births taking place in health facilities remains at
99.7 percent, which is the same as the national average. The percentage of population without
health insurance or a medical plan has decreased by 8.4 percentage points (from 45.8 to 37.4
percent) between 1998 and 2001, reflecting a better performance than the nation as whole, where
roughly 12 percent of individuals with formal health insurance either discontinued or reduced
their coverage due to rising unemployment and falling real wages during the crisis. Other
indications that reflect the improvements in the health sector include increases in output, as
illustrated by the significant increase in the number of health care services provided to the poor
annually, which increased from 1.6 services in 2000 to 2.8 services in 2006.

· Protecting the health budget: Accomplished. The agreed allocation of nominal resources
    within the health envelope was met over the period 2001-2005, although maintaining overall
    spending in real terms with respect to 2000 became impossible in light of the crisis. The
    health budget grew steadily from Arg$199.5 million in 2000 to Arg$401.6 million in 2005,
    equivalent to a 200 percent nominal increase. Personnel expenditures declined slightly at as a
    proportion of the overall health budget, from 61 percent to 57 percent between 2000 and 2005.
    Spending in primary health care has increased drastically during the same period, from
    representing just 1 percent of the health budget in 2000 to 18.87 percent in 2005. These high
    levels of spending in primary health care reflect Córdoba's decision to decentralize spending
    responsibility for municipal hospitals to the municipalities, as well as the implementation of a
    provincial health care initiative, the so-called 'Red Vida - Salud', which emphasizes primary
    care.
· Strengthening of the Ministry of Health: Accomplished. With PRL support, the Ministry of
    Health has implemented important steps resulting in the strengthening of its regulatory,
    management and overseeing functions.
    i) Quality assurance: A new Customer Service Office, which has been established within
          the Ministry of Health, is now responsible for evaluating the level of service provided by
          hospitals' customer centers. Results of user satisfaction surveys are published online on
          the Ministry of Health's website (http://www.cba.gov.ar/canal.jsp?idCanal=18738).
    ii) Regulatory functions: A new agency (Registro de Unidades de Gestión de Prestaciones -
          REGEPRESA) was created to regulate the activity of the networks (empresas
          gerenciadoras) responsible for managing health care for IPAM's beneficiaries and the
          activities of private insurers and providers. The accreditation system is fully operational,
          with          public            access         to       a        regularly          updated          database
          (http://www.cba.gov.ar/canal.jsp?idCanal=18698).
    iii) Purchasing of medical equipment: The Ministry of Health has strengthened its capacity to
          supervise the purchasing process of medical equipment by developing a purchase control
          system that is fully operational.
    iv) Overseeing of public hospitals: Under the PRL, Córdoba has taken numerous actions
          aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of hospitals, including implementing
          a state-of-the-art system for monitoring levels of production of public hospitals. Initially,
          performance indicators were developed for all public hospitals, together with the



                                                             25

     corresponding baselines and benchmarks. These indicators have evolved into a
     sophisticated hospital management system (Tablero de Control de Hospitales), which is
     used to monitor actual versus potential hospital production of individual hospitals. In this
     way, the Ministry of Health now has real-time information on the actual resources (both
     staff and equipment) available within individual hospitals and compares the output they
     generate against established production standards. For example, the system has
     information on individual clinical physicians assigned to a specific hospital, the patients
     that have been assigned to her/him by admissions, and the patients she/he has actually
     seen-i.e., 'actual level of production.' The system also produces a 'theoretical level of
     production' for that particular physician based on the number of hours that she/he is
     supposed to work and the average time spent per patient as defined by current medical
     standards. Based on the 'actual' versus 'theoretical' level of production, managers, both
     within the individual hospital and the Ministry of Health, can determine whether that
     particular physician is being under- or fully utilized and whether there is a need to assign
     more professionals to that particular area. In this way, hospital managers have a powerful
     tool to rationalize the use of resources and maximize their effectiveness. At the same time,
     the new system has introduced an important element of accountability into the system, as
     it shows actual performance not only of the overall hospital but also disaggregated to the
     level of operational units and individual staff.
· Improving performance of public hospitals: Accomplished as amended. The province has
 effectively decentralized institutional, managerial and cost-recovery capacity of its 35 public
 hospitals, contributing to enhancing cost recovery and gradually improving patients' care.
 Customer satisfaction surveys from patients who had been admitted to public hospitals reveal
 a high level of satisfaction with the care they received. Specific results show the percentage
 of respondents giving a rating of 'good' for medical care, prescription drugs, administrative
 services, and food quality with scores of 92 percent, 90 percent, 85 percent, and 70 percent,
 respectively ('good' was the highest of the three possible ratings). Customer satisfaction
 surveys conducted among patients receiving outpatient care also show high levels of
 satisfaction with the care received from medical and nursing staff (i.e., 90 percent and 82
 percent of respondents rated them as 'good,' respectively), although more dissatisfaction with
 administrative service, waiting times for lab and x-ray results, and waiting times for medical
 appointments (i.e., 63 percent, 56 percent, and 48 percent of respondents rated them as 'good,'
 respectively).
 i) Internal functioning of public hospitals: Actions have also been implemented to enhance
     the internal functioning of public hospitals, including providing all hospital
     administrators with administrative training. Independent evaluations conducted in a
     sample of hospitals during 2002 and 2003 confirmed the steady improvement in several
     performance indicators of quality assurance affecting patient care. Specifically, results for
     2003 indicate that: (i) at least 80 percent of all patient's written inquiries or complaints
     have been formally answered by customer service centers in individual hospitals; (ii) 90
     percent of patients undergoing high risk surgeries have signed the proper consent forms;
     (iii) 81 percent of patients admitted to the hospitals had their medical records properly
     registered and archived; and (iv) 84.5 percent of hospital staff are wearing their I.D. tags.
     The 2003 results reflect a considerable improvement over 2002, suggesting that ongoing
     monitoring has had a positive effect on compliance.
 ii) Cost recovery: Hospitals have been equipped with information and financial management
     systems that allow them to bill insurers for the services provided to those patients with
     health coverage. As of June 2006, all provincial hospitals were billing all insured patients
     and recovering on average 83.6 percent of the billed amounts, denoting a steady
     improvement with respect to previous years-e.g., between January and October 2003, the
     actual cost recovery rate was 72.8 percent. The financial impact of cost recovery has been


                                              26

       substantial, increasing from Arg$1.4 million in 2001 to Arg$7 million in 2004. Hospitals
       retain 90 percent of the costs recovered, which are used for performance-based bonuses,
       thus creating incentives among hospital staff. Information on health insurance coverage is
       provided by the National Health Insurance Superintendence. The province has built its
       own register of patients without health insurance by having public hospitals register them
       in a central database. All patients-both with and without insurance coverage-are currently
       in the process of receiving a magnetic I.D. card that has information on the individual's
       personal identification (clave única de identificación sanitaria), health coverage, medical
       records (Historia Clínica Única), and prescription drugs. This card will be required to
       receive services at provincial hospitals, ensuring patients' proper identification. It
       constitutes an important step toward the implementation of the Integrated Provincial
       Health System, Córdoba's ambitious new health initiative.
  iii) Discrimination of noninsured patients in public hospitals: Under the PRL, an independent
       field study was conducted on potential discrimination against patients based on their
       insurance coverage. Results from personal interviews conducted with 2,696 patients at 21
       hospitals throughout the province indicate that, while the large majority of patients did
       not perceive any differences in the attention they received, 13 percent of patients
       perceived that those with health insurance coverage receive better care, while 3 percent
       consider that the difference in care is in favor of those without health coverage.
  iv) Demand-based budgeting: Córdoba is in the process of developing a more transparent
       budget process for public hospitals based on demand parameters rather than incremental
       adjustments to past budgets. With the support of the PRL, a study on hospital budget
       planning was completed and an action plan has been prepared to establish a demand-
       based budget system as recommended by the study. The hospital staff has been trained
       and the needed modifications in personnel management have taken place. The ongoing
       implementation of the provincial health management system (Tablero de Control) that
       will eventually include input/output data on all public health care providers, including 35
       provincial hospitals, 101 municipal hospitals, and 900 primary health care posts, will
       make possible the migration toward a fully decentralized, demand-driven system.
· Expanding health coverage among the poor: Waived. A pilot scheme of health insurance for
  the uninsured was to be implemented in the west region (Área Oeste) to identify and evaluate
  the cost, impact and feasibility of switching from supply-side to insurance-based subsidies for
  the poor. Its main objective was to help narrow the gap in equity between the individuals
  covered by insurance and those who only have access to public hospitals. As a result of the
  2001 crisis, the province lacked the necessary resources to pilot a universal health care
  scheme and this condition was waived. However, Córdoba has made substantial progress
  toward establishing an Integrated Provincial Health System (Sistema Integrado de Salud
  Provincial; Law No. 9.133) that received legislative approval in 2003. With a strong
  emphasis on self-care, preventive medicine, and primary health care, this ambitious health
  initiative sets the foundations for the restructuring of health service delivery and financing
  within the province, with the ultimate objective of ensuring that all sectors of the population
  have equal access to not only public health care but also to all accredited private providers
  operating in the province in the case of services not provided by public providers. Under the
  new system, individuals will be assigned an explicit basic benefit package based on
  geographic location and the level of vulnerability determined by medical evidence. In this
  way, although the pilot program originally envisioned under the PRL was not implemented,
  the province has continued to make progress toward expanding health coverage among all
  socio-economic sectors of the population.
· Strengthening the provincial health insurance agency IPAM: Partially accomplished. IPAM
  is a key player in Córdoba's health delivery system, providing health insurance coverage to
  over 450,000 people, equivalent to 18 percent of the overall population and 33 percent of


                                                 27

     those with health insurance. IPAM accounts for 30 percent of health financing in the province,
     making it a key factor in the sustainability of health care providers, both private and public
     ones. In late 1999, IPAM faced serious financial and administrative challenges, including
     more than nine months in arrears to health care providers amounting to Arg$50 million, an
     obsolete technological platform, and the loss of key personnel during previous years as a
     result of voluntary retirement. Under the new administration, the IPAM was drastically
     revamped. On the financial side, an agreement was reached with health care providers to
     renegotiate the outstanding debt, including a 30 percent debt reduction and a new repayment
     schedule. In addition, outstanding debts in favor of IPAM from municipal governments
     (Arg$50 million) and the provincial social security agency (Arg$230 million) were
     regularized and automatic deduction mechanisms were set in place to ensure the regular flow
     of resources into IPAM. Since 2002, IPAM has maintained fiscal balance, with expenditures
     not exceeding its revenues. Moreover, payments to providers are made within 60 days and
     currently there are no pending payments exceeding this time limit.
     IPAM's financial reversal was also the result of extensive changes on the operational side, as
     the service structure was fundamentally restructured in October 2000 when a new managed
     care system was adopted, with integrated networks of health care providers (gerenciadoras)
     selected on a competitive basis. These networks are organized around a system of primary
     physicians that are responsible for referrals to specialists. A new payment system was also
     introduced, based on a service-package and per-capita funding formula, thus bringing
     predictability to IPAM's expenditures. The system was subsequently modified in 2004 and
     early 2005 to increase competition among the networks and ensure a fair level of payment for
     individual providers. The implementation of the new system was supported with a new
     technological platform, which, through magnetic cards, allowed the identification of
     individual beneficiaries and the pre-approval of the services to be rendered. A regulatory
     framework has been established and a provincial entity (Registro de Unidades de Gestiones
     de Prestadores de Salud - RuGePreSa) was assigned responsibility for regulatory
     functions. The new system is subjected to regular management audits designed to safeguard
     quality of service.
     In December 2005, IPAM was transformed into the Administration of the Provincial Health
     Insurance (Administración Provincial del Seguro de Salud - APROSS), a decentralized entity
     responsible for developing and administering a provincial health insurance system. On top of
     the automatic increase in revenues resulting from the recent salary increases, APROSS'
     revenues were also augmented by increasing the overall contribution to 10 percent of the
     salary (equivalent to an increase of 0.5 percent for the employee and 1 percent for the
     employer), which will further strengthen its financial position.
     It should be noted that, although APROSS (formerly IPAM) conducts periodic surveys to
     monitor health care quality, findings are not issued on a regular basis, as required by fourth-
     tranche conditionality. Thus, this condition was not met. APROSS expects to begin
     publishing these findings regularly during 2007.

b. Education Reforms: Satisfactory Performance. Over the past years, provincial education
authorities have engaged in a participatory and far-reaching reform effort of primary and
secondary levels. Córdoba was the first province to have fully implemented the new federally
prescribed upper secondary education structure, and it produced in the academic year 1999 its
first graduates under this system. With PRL support, Córdoba has taken additional steps toward
enhancing efficiency, equity and quality of education while meeting expanding enrollment.
Specific accomplishments include strengthening absenteeism controls, rationalizing public
teacher training institutions, and overseeing the mechanisms to allocate public subsidies to private
schools. In addition, Córdoba has advanced in the implementation of a human resource
management system to include all teachers in the public sector and those in private schools


                                                 28

      receiving public subsidies. Savings arising from the implementation of these administrative
      reforms have permitted to allocate more resources for learning materials and other non-salary
      expenditures. Likewise, the administrative and organizational reforms supported under the PRL
      will strengthen Córdoba's capacity to design and manage educational policies and strategies.

      The impact of the reform efforts is evident in Córdoba's performance in key indicators of quality
      of education. Specifically, between 1998 and 2003, there has been a significant improvement in
      promotion, repetition rates, and drop-out rates, which have remained largely stagnant among
      other provinces (see Table 3). Illiteracy rates have also continued to steadily decline, from 3.2
      percent to 2.1 percent between 1998 and 2003. Córdoba is one of the provinces of the Central
      Region, which has the highest test scores of all the regions in the country. Unfortunately, the lack
      of data at the provincial level on standardized test scores (results at the provincial level were last
      made public in 1999) prevents inter-year comparison for individual provinces. The overall
      student/teacher ratio, however, declined between 1998 and 2003, partly as result of the province's
      decentralization strategy and the construction of 237 new schools.

      Specific achievements within the education sector can be summarized as follows:

      · Enhancing management of education expenditure: Several actions have been implemented to
          rationalize the allocation of education expenditures and enhance their management,
          including:
          i)   Improving human resource management: Under implementation. With PRL support,
               Córdoba is implementing a comprehensive human resources management system for all
               teachers and staff in the education sector. Based on a single teacher file (Legajo Único
               Electrónico), the implementation of this system represents an important tool for human
               resource management. Currently, there are 33,264 teaching posts already incorporated
               into the system, corresponding to all the 1,060 primary schools in the province serving a
               population of 418,000 students. The remaining 106,078 teaching posts corresponding to


                                                               29

     the 519 intermediate schools in the province serving 295,000 students are still being
     incorporated into the system. Its completion is expected by mid-2007, thus, this condition
     was only partially met. This new system constitutes a significant step toward improving
     the efficiency of educational expenditures, as it provides a match between staff positions
     (cargos) and the individuals who occupy them, thus enhancing transparency of payroll
     expenditures. The system will also offer a true representation of the allocation of the
     teaching and non-teaching staffs in individual schools, thus making it possible to identify
     deviations from established staffing norms. Eventually, the system will also incorporate
     the 970 private schools that receive public subsidies for teachers' salaries, helping to
     better oversee the use of these subsidies.
ii) Reducing teachers' absenteeism: Accomplished as amended. Abuses of leave rules by
    teachers were endemic in Córdoba, resulting in an estimated additional 18 percent excess
    in personnel expenditures. Under the PRL, a study evaluating the privatized system of
    medical monitoring of teachers was completed, revealing that the main health causes
    resulting in sick leaves were voice-related problems, depression, and varicose problems,
    which provided the foundations to devise preventive actions to reduce their incidence
    among teachers. In addition, the province established a new system to improve the
    medical certification on sick leaves to reduce absenteeism and a private firm was hired to
    verify levels of absenteeism in the various areas of the provincial central administration.
    Although the 2000 benchmark is not fully reliable since there was no centralized system
    in place at the time, the results of the private firm's audits point to a significant reduction
    in absenteeism due to medical leaves, from 12.5 percent in 2000 to an average 2.7 percent
    between November 2003 and July 2004 (absenteeism is measured as the percentage of
    teachers' days lost due to sick leave compared to all teachers' days in a month). Therefore,
    the actual levels of absenteeism during such a period were well below the PRL target of
    10 percent-equivalent to 80 percent of the 2000 rate. From 2005 onward, the province
    resumed responsibility for verifying absenteeism and no data has been made available.
iii) Increasing student/teacher ratios: Accomplished as amended. The province succeeded
    in increasing the student/teacher ratio for the upper cycle in high schools in urban areas to
    the original target of 28:1 by 2003. However, the original targets for primary and
    intermediate education were not achieved, mainly due to the need to staff the newly
    constructed schools and the province's overall decentralization strategy in the education
    sector. At restructuring, the original condition was amended to require the submission of
    an action plan aimed at attaining these ratios rather than their actual attainment. The
    condition was met as amended. Between 1998 and 2004, the student/teacher ratio for the
    public school system as a whole increased from 20:6 to 21:4. Córdoba has the third
    highest student/teacher ratio of all provinces.
iv) Rationalizing educational expenditures: Accomplished. The PRL has helped rationalize
    educational expenditures by increasing capital and non-salary spending as a proportion of
    the overall education budget. In 2003, a total of Arg$1.04 billion were allocated to the
    education budget, of which Arg$153.5 million were allocated to capital expenditures
    (equivalent to 18 percent of the overall education budget), exceeding the original 10
    percent target. As a result, Córdoba has been able to implement an aggressive campaign
    to improve schools' infrastructure by remodeling 1,000 of the 3,800 schools in the public
    system and adding 237 new schools. In addition, non-personnel expenditures amounted
    to Arg$123.8 million, equivalent to 17.6 percent of all recurrent education expenditures,
    thus, amply exceeding the 8 percent target. This is a remarkable achievement,
    considering that non-personnel recurrent expenditures constituted a negligible amount in
    1999. Resources allocated to education have continued to increase since 2003, with the
     overall education budget doubling between 2003 and 2006 to amount to Arg$1.4 billion,
     with non-salary expenditures representing 26.8 percent of all recurrent expenditures. All


                                              30

      school maintenance and supply expenditures are now self-administered by individual
      schools. The rationalization of resources has permitted increased spending on educational
      materials such as books and equipment, and infrastructure, as well as on programs aimed
      at decreasing drop-out rates among poor children and improving the quality of rural
      schools.
· Enhancing education quality: Several actions have been implemented to enhance the quality
  of education, particularly among students from more disadvantaged socio-economic groups,
  including:
  i)  Reducing drop-out and repetition rates: Accomplished. The education authorities have
      implemented a socio-economic student monitoring system, which has been implemented
      in 400 public schools. This system has helped target the poorest students and improve
      equity. Measures have been implemented to reduce the repetition and drop-out rates in
      primary and secondary schools, benefiting mainly the poorest students. Processes and
      procedures have been developed to improve tracking of student performance aiming to
      help identify problems earlier so as to reduce repetition and dropout rates. The overall
      reduction in repetition rates, with Córdoba's ranking improving from 8th to 3rd among all
      provinces between 1998 and 2003, points to the success of this initiative.
  ii) Dissemination of standardized test results: Accomplished as amended. While the
      province completed an evaluation of Córdoba's education performance and disseminated
      the results, it could not publish a comparison with those of the standardized national
      testing system (Operativo Nacional de Educación - ONE), as this information has not
      been provided by federal authorities. Results from the provincial 2005 evaluations reflect
      a better performance in elementary education vis-à-vis intermediate education, both in
      language skills and math. Students in rural areas showed a better performance than their
      urban counterparts in both language skills and math. The results from these evaluations
      have been distributed to individual schools and they are being used as inputs into the
      design of teaching strategies.
· Decentralization of school management: Accomplished. A pilot program has been
  implemented to decentralize management to individual schools to test its potential in
  enhancing school autonomy and accountability. The 400 schools participating in this pilot
  program have been given responsibility for managing non-salary recurrent funds. School
  directors and staff have been provided with management and administrative training.
· Rationalizing teacher training institutes: Accomplished. The quality of Córdoba's teacher
 training system is low, as demonstrated by the fact that only 1,900 out of 10,000 graduates
 from 152 teacher training institutes met the requirements for a teaching degree in 1998. To
 address this weakness, the province developed accreditation criteria for teacher training
 institutes focusing on efficiency and output quality. The accreditation system is fully
 operational, with teacher training institutes being accredited based on transparent and
 verifiable performance indicators according to newly developed guidelines. Those teacher
 training institutions that did not succeed in obtaining accreditation will have their public
 subsidies phased out. These efforts are an important step in making teacher training institutes
 more cost-efficient, inducing the closure and merger of those that are less effective, and
 improving the overall quality of the teacher training.
· Enhancing public subsidies to private schools: Accomplished. About 24 percent of the public
  education budget is currently transferred to 970 private schools in the form of subsidies based
  on the number of teachers. Under the PRL, the province has carried out the auditing of
  private schools receiving public funds to verify that they are complying with the current
  legislation. A total of 329 audits were conducted in 2002 and 2003 (62 and 257 audits,
  respectively), representing approximately 34 percent of all private schools, thus meeting the
  PRL target of at least 30 percent. Some irregularities were detected (in terms of both under-
  and over-payment of teachers' salaries) and were corrected. As of 2004, private schools


                                              31

    receiving public subsidies are required to submit the information related to the subsidies as
    part of their monthly report (Informe Mensual de Escuela), for which all schools-as opposed
    to just a sample-will be regularly monitored.

c. Social Protection: Satisfactory Performance. Córdoba's PRL was the first provincial reform
operation in Argentina to include an explicit component to safeguard social protection
expenditures targeted at the most vulnerable groups. The actual achievements in social protection
are similar to or have exceeded the levels anticipated at project design, as these were not affected
by the operation's restructuring. Specifically, the Ministry of Solidarity was identified as a
priority to participate in a pilot organizational reform program. The targets for maintaining a
minimum level of resources for social protection have been and continue to be exceeded. The
goal set for registering beneficiaries from social programs has been amply exceeded, with more
than 1.5 million individuals currently being registered compared to the PRL target of 80,000. An
assessment of the province's social protection programs has been completed and social programs
have been modified accordingly. As a result, Córdoba made substantial progress in enhancing its
social protection, particularly in terms of ensuring an adequate allocation of resources and
increasing their predictability, as well as enhancing the quality and equity of the various
provincial social assistance programs. These achievements were particularly important for
addressing the mounting social needs that arose in the aftermath of the 2001 crisis.

The specific accomplishments in the area of social protection include:

· Social protection budget: Accomplished. The PRL ensured the allocation of adequate and
    predictable resources to social protection in the provincial budget in the post-2001 period.
    Specifically, the budgetary resources assigned to social protection have exceeded the
    minimum targets established under the PRL. Between 2001 and 2003, Córdoba has assigned
    a larger percentage of its budget to social protection than other provinces, averaging 6.2
    percent compared to 5 percent for provinces as a whole. Likewise, the resources allocated to
    social protection have almost doubled in nominal terms over the past five years, from
    Arg$93.3 million in 2001 to Arg$181.3 million in 2006 (including the resources allocated to
    the Sub-Secretariat for Children and Adolescents that were under the Ministry of Solidarity
    until 2004).
· Quality of provincial social protection programs: Accomplished. The Ministry of Solidarity
    conducted an assessment of the various programs under its administration, including the
    family-oriented program (Programa Permanente de Atención a Nivel de la Familia) and its
    youth-oriented program (Programa de Desarrollo Solidario para Jóvenes 'SOL'), among
    others. The province has continued to systematically evaluate its programs and their delivery
    systems with technical assistance from the National University of Córdoba's Economics
    Department, including assessing the performance of non-government organizations that act as
    intermediaries in the implementation of various provincial social programs.
· Targeting of provincial social protection programs: Accomplished. Under the PRL, Córdoba
    has developed a single register of beneficiaries of social programs (Sistema Único de Acción
    Social - SUAS), which centralizes information on benefits assigned by the Ministry of
    Solidarity such as non-contributive pensions, as well as social programs at the provincial and
    national levels. In addition to registering all the social benefits received by an individual and
    members in her/his family, the SUAS is linked to the provincial budgeting system (Sistema
    Experto de Ejecución Presupuestaria - SEEJEP) to issue orders for payment of benefits to
    individuals. In turn, the SEEJEP informs the SUAS once these payments have been
    made. Currently, the SUAS contains information on over 1.5 million individuals and their
    family relationships, corresponding to 877,000 households. The number of actual
    beneficiaries included in SUAS amply exceeds the original target of 80,000 beneficiaries.


                                                 32

     Information on the SUAS database is periodically checked against the provincial payroll, the
     national Heads of Household program, and SINTyS (Sistema de Identificación Nacional
     Tributario y Social) to identify inappropriate benefits and, thus, enhance targeting of
     provincial programs.
· Organizational structure of the Ministry of Solidarity: Accomplished. The Ministry of
     Solidarity was one of two provincial ministries to participate in a pilot organizational reform
     program. The Ministry of Solidarity's functional structure has been reformulated to support
     the new provincial strategy toward social protection, which focuses on the harmonization of
     national and provincial interventions, the involvement of municipal governments and non-
     government organizations in the administration of social assistance programs, and the strong
     coordination with other provincial ministries, the Ministry of Production in particular.
     Moreover, the new functional structure reflects the three pillars that organize Córdoba's social
     promotion efforts: family-centered interventions, productive initiatives, and cultural and
     recreational activities. The new programs that are being created exhibit a shift away from the
     social assistance emphasis that characterized post-2001 social programs and toward a new
     emphasis on social promotion, focusing on fostering the sustainable welfare of vulnerable
     families.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating (combining relevance, achievement of PDOs):

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The operation has largely achieved its development objectives-i.e., to promote an efficient and
responsive delivery of public services within fiscally sound policies-which remained unchanged
at restructuring. However, some of the key outcome targets as reflected in the loan's policy
conditionalies were formally revised at restructuring to reflect the macroeconomic and social
changes that resulted from the economic collapse of December 2001. Thus, the operation's overall
outcome rating has been assessed against both the original and revised key outcome targets, in
accordance with the Harmonized Evaluation Criteria for ICR and IEG Evaluations and the new
ICR guidelines issued in August 2006.

With respect to the original key outcomes, the operation is rated 'Unsatisfactory.' Despite the
operation's substantial achievements in the areas of public administration and social sector
reforms, some key original outcomes, mainly in the area of public finances, were not met as a
result of the deterioration of the macroeconomic environment. Specifically, the original debt
stock target was not attained; the privatization of the provincial bank and the concession of the
electricity company were not finalized; a pilot health-insurance program for the poor was aborted;
and financial and cadastre modernization plans were not implemented by at least 20
municipalities as called by original loan conditions that were either waived or amended. However,
it is important to note that, although the conditions were not met, substantial progress has been
made in most of these areas in accordance with the amended loan conditionalities (see Annex 7.2).

With respect to revised key outcomes, the operation is rated 'Satisfactory.' All conditions of the
restructured second and third tranche were met and the corresponding tranches were disbursed.
Although the fourth tranche was cancelled in agreement with the government as part of the
negotiations of the new CAS envelope, all but four of its conditionalities were also met. Two of
the conditions that were not met are being implemented (i.e., ongoing negotiations with Central
Bank on recapitalization to obtain final approval of BPC restructuring plan and ongoing
implementation of human resources management system for the education sector), one has been
partially implemented (i.e., gradual increases in electricity tariffs have been implemented,



                                                 33

although they do not fully reflect EPEC's cost structure), and the fourth has not been met but will
reportedly be implemented in 2007 (i.e., APROSS-formerly IPAM does not publish its findings
on heath care quality but plans to begin in 2007). (See Table 7.2, Annex 7).

Taking into consideration the operation's overall achievement, Córdoba's PRL is considered
'Moderately Satisfactory' (see Table 7.2, Annex 7 for specific calculations weighing original and
revised key outcomes). Although the provincial bank and the electricity company still remain in
the province's hands and the stock of debt is higher than originally envisioned, the operation has
been successful in introducing substantial improvements into the management of provincial
resources and in enhancing social protection, health and education services in a framework of
fiscal responsibility. The operation has also resulted in significant institutional strengthening by
supporting the adoption of sound management tools and legislation. Likewise, Córdoba's PRL
helped protect the public safety net that provided support to the poor during the social and
economic crisis that unfolded in December 2001. In terms of the operation's overall relevance, the
objectives pursued by the operation are still highly pertinent vis-à-vis the current priorities of both
the Kirchner administration and the Bank's current CAS.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts (If any, where not previously covered or
to amplify discussion above):

(a)      Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Although Córdoba's per capita income is close to the national average, serious poverty exists
compounded by gaps in the delivery of health, education, and social protection services. By
requiring a at least a minimum level of expenditures in education, health, and social protection,
the PRL effectively protected the public safety net that provided support to the poor during the
social and economic crisis that unfolded in December 2001. As shown on Table 4, Córdoba has
consistently allocated a higher share of its budget to social protection than provinces as a whole
between 1999 and 2004. Within the health sector, the number of health care services received by
the poor annually has increased in average from 1.6 in 2000 to 2.8 in 2006. Likewise, although
the implementation of a pilot health insurance program for the poor was waived as part of the
2003 restructuring, Córdoba has advanced toward a more comprehensive universal health
insurance program, the Integrated Provincial Health System that received legislative approval in
2003. In terms of education, a monitoring system based on socio-economic variables was
implemented to oversee drop-out and repetition rates in 400 schools. The notable improvements
in drop-out and promotion rates obtained under the PRL affect primarily students from lower
socio-economic backgrounds.

(b)      Institutional Change/Strengthening (particularly with reference to impacts on longer-
term capacity and institutional development)

The operation has had a substantial impact on Córdoba's institutional development, as it has
introduced innovative management tools that are likely to enhance public management,
transparency and institutional development over the medium and long term in the areas of
financial management, health, education, and social protection. Some of the specific
advancements are:

· Financial management: The recently enacted Financial Administration Law constitutes an
    essential step toward enhancing the management of provincial resources. In combination with
    the newly implemented financial management system, the new law has enhanced the overall
    transparency and efficacy of the budgeting process.
· Human resource administration: The new system will enhance the province's ability to
    manage human resources within the education sector, ultimately contributing to a more
    efficient, effective, and equitable allocation of resources. The new system is already being
    used to automatically generate the ranking of individual teachers (puntaje) for new openings
    in primary education, adding substantial transparency to the designation process.
· Cost recovery mechanisms by individual hospitals: In this regard, it is important to bring
    attention to the sequencing of the reforms and the creation of a sound system of incentives. In
    terms of sequencing, the PRL capitalized on the existence of an enabling legal framework and
    subsequently, its actual implementation and actual results. Likewise, it benefited from the
    progress achieved under other operations, such as the creation of a national registry of
    beneficiaries of all national insurance carriers that is currently maintained by the SNSS.
    Without this database, the implementation of cost recovery mechanisms would be unfeasible.
    The financial viability of IPAM is another key component for the long-terms success of the
    strategy. In terms of incentives, cost-recovery proceeds from individual hospitals are used to
    fund salary bonuses, creating a clear link between performance and rewards. Awards are
    distributed uniformly among all personnel within each hospital and, although not
    theoretically perfect, this approach has helped overcome resistance and gain support among
    the staff.
· Provincial register of beneficiaries of social programs: The centralized registry of
    beneficiaries from social programs, SUAS, has helped identify inappropriate benefits and,
    thus, enhance targeting of provincial programs.
· Transparency: The establishment of an Anti-Corruption Office as well as anti-fraud courts
    has been an important step in combating corruption. In addition, all the management tools
    described above have also contributed to enhancing transparency in the management of
    provincial resources.
· Regulatory entity for the electric sector: While EPEC is still a provincial enterprise, a
    regulatory body for the electric sector is now functioning, effectively separating regulatory
    from management functions. In particular, ERSEP is administering customer complaints and
    the application of the social tariff program.

(c)      Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

The operation has helped provincial authorities to maintain their focus on their reform program in
spite of the difficult financial and social circumstances they faced during 2001 and 2002.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

Presently, the risk that development outcomes will not be maintained is considered moderate in
most respects. In general, policy actions undertaken under the PRL have either survived or were
implemented during the traumatic 2001-2002 period, which is a good indicator of their
sustainability. Other factors contributing to the sustainability of the operation's development
outcomes include the favorable macroeconomic conditions prevailing in Argentina since 2003
and a robust flow of public revenues due to increases, primarily in automatic transfers from the
national government (coparticipación) but also own-source revenues. At the national level, the
Fiscal Responsibility Law establishes fiscal performance indicators and provides for the
monitoring over time of fiscal results as well as for possible sanctions in the case of deviations
from the provisions of the law. While the high level of discretion and the consensual approach
under the Fiscal Responsibility Law create a potential risk that fiscal discipline will not be
sustained, such an approach may also increase provincial ownership, which is critical given
Argentina's strong federal character. It remains to be seen whether the Fiscal Responsibility Law
will be more successful in improving provincial and national fiscal performance than the many
national and provincial fiscal responsibility laws that preceded it, despite its relatively less
stringent provisions when compared to similar pieces of legislation adopted in other countries in
Latin America, such as Brazil.

Specific observations regarding the degree of the sustainability of the reforms pursued under the
various policy areas can be summarized as follows:

A. Public Finances: The sustainability of the reforms in the area of public finances is considered
to be moderately likely, with the exception of the privatization of the bank and electricity
company. The province has succeeded in keeping increases in expenditures below those of
revenues, thus, generating a current account and overall surplus. It has also capitalized on the
robust increase in revenues from 2003 onward to establish a Arg$150 million fiscal reserve fund
to meet unexpected drops in revenues, face financial obligations, finance public works or meet
other emergencies. However, the fiscal surpluses of the consolidated provincial sector are
expected to decline in 2006 and 2007. In this context, and as is true for most Argentine provinces,
the sustainability of the recent improvements in Cordoba's public finances will depend on a
number of factors, some of which are under the control of the province, while others are outside
its sphere of influence. The large reductions in real public sector salaries and investment spending
that were partly responsible for large fiscal surpluses in the years immediately following the crisis
are no longer feasible or desirable. To maintain the health of provincial public finances, increases
in own tax revenues and prudent management of the wage bill are required. These can be
controlled in part by the province, although they are also constrained by federal legislation and
precedents regarding tax responsibilities and salaries. In the case of Córdoba, current spending
has been rising rapidly since 2005, primarily as a result of personnel spending, which increased
by 39 percent in 2005. Further payroll increases are expected for 2006 and 2007. Likewise,
Córdoba's fiscal performance is less impressive when noting that its 2005 current account surplus
is almost equivalent to the current transfers received from the federal government during the same
period. While the bulk of these current transfers (over 70 percent) reflects the 1999 Federal
Agreement's provisions (Law No. 25.235, Section XII) to compensate those provinces, including
Córdoba, that have not transferred their pension funds to the federal government, they point to
Córdoba's increasing dependency on the federal government to meet its pension liabilities.
Likewise, Córdoba is burdened by a heavier stock of debt than provinces as a whole, which limits



                                                 36

its ability to react swiftly to economic downturns. In addition, the provincial bank and the
electricity company remain in the hands of the province and, although both entities are now
operationally stronger than in 1999, they still pose the threat of future contingent liabilities.
Moreover, the pending US$30 million recapitalization of the provincial bank will add to
Córdoba's already substantial debt stock. Another potential contingent liability relates to
municipal finances. Although loan conditions in this area were met, the task of introducing
modern management tools and procedures at the municipal level (including cadastres, tax
administration, financial management systems, budgeting procedures) is still pending, as the
IADB operation that was intended to finance these improvements was cancelled. Some of these
improvements, such as the harmonization of municipal and provincial cadastres are also critical to
fiscal sustainability at the provincial level, as provincial property taxes-the province's second
largest own-source revenue source-depend on such harmonization. As noted above, Córdoba's
provincial authorities have desisted from their privatization efforts; thus, the bank and the
electricity company are expected to remain in the hands of the province in the near future,
increasing uncertainty regarding the prospects for the continued strengthening of these
institutions' financial and operational performance. The recapitalization of the provincial bank
and the further adjustment of electricity tariffs to fully reflect EPEC's cost structure are two
critical issues that remain pending.

B. Public Administration: The sustainability of the progress attained in the area of public
administration varies greatly among the various areas, being highly likely in terms of financial
management but less certain in the areas of civil service and procurement. Specifically, the
approval of the Financial Management Law is an important step toward ensuring the
sustainability of the newly implemented financial management system, as it not only provides an
enabling legal framework but also makes its reversal more difficult. In terms of civil service
reform, it is important to note that the number of provincial employees increased more in
Córdoba than in provinces as a whole between 1999 and 2004, by 24 percent and 8 percent,
respectively. Conversely, personnel expenditures increased substantially less in Córdoba than in
provinces as whole during the same period, by 17 percent and 30 percent, respectively. These two
opposing trends point to an undesirable flattening of the civil service structure and the possibility
of disproportionate incorporation of public employees with limited technical skills. In terms of
the impact of salary increases on the province's finances, provincial authorities have agreed with
labor unions representing provincial employees that salary increases for 2007 will be tied to
increases in the consumer price index and provincial tax revenues, to avoid the erosion of salaries
in real terms without threatening the province's fiscal solvency. Finally, as mentioned above,
although the new procurement law was presented to the legislature as required by the PRL
conditionality, its approval is still pending.

C. Social Sectors: The sustainability of the achievements in health, education, and social
protection are considered likely.

     a. Health sector: In the health sector, sustainability is considered highly likely, as the
         passage of the key legislation has gone hand-in-hand with the development of modern
         management systems that support their implementation. However, the departure of the
         former Minister of Health from his post in July 2006 will certainly present a test for the
         sector, as he served as a 'champion.'
     b. Education sector: Achievements in the education sector are considered likely. The human
         resource management system is being implemented at a slower pace than originally
         anticipated. Its completion is expected by 2007. In terms of absenteeism, no data has
         been made available for 2005, thus it is not possible to assess the sustainability of this
         particular achievement. With respect to education, it is also important to note that the


                                                37

        national government has not published the provincial test scores corresponding to
        standardized national test scores (ONE) since 2005, when it made public the scores
        corresponding to 2003 tests. This deprives provincial governments of a valuable tool to
        measure performance within each province and relative to other provinces. Perhaps more
        importantly, by not making provincial test scores public, the national government is
        foregoing an important element of accountability that could play a major factor in
        enhancing quality of education in the long run. It is relevant to note that one of the main
        arguments in favor of decentralizing education to the provincial level was the expectation
        that increasing the proximity between citizens and those officials responsible for
        education would enhance accountability and, consequently, performance. The
        performance information provided by ONE scores is an important element toward
        building this accountability, thus, an important element in the ultimate success of the
        decentralization process.
    c. Social protection: The sustainability of the SUAS is also considered likely given the
        thorough insertion that this centralized system has within the various areas of the
        provincial administration.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance (relating to design,
implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance:

(a)     Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank's performance in identifying, preparing and appraising the operation was satisfactory.
The Bank devised an effective strategy towards public sector reform at the sub-national level by
focusing resources on select provinces with demonstrated willingness and ability to implement
reforms, thus capitalizing on the window of opportunity provided by the presence of reform-
minded administrations at the provincial levels. Likewise, the Bank's strategy correctly identified
the need to promote reforms in the social sectors-education, health, and social protection-in a
framework of fiscal soundness. Social sectors are central to the medium and long-term success of
any provincial reform strategy, as they represent a significant share of provincial budgets.
Moreover, the services in health and education are critical in determining the level of human
capital development of the province in the medium and long term, while strengthening social
protection was particularly important given the abrupt increase in poverty as a result of the crisis.

The Bank embarked on a thorough preparation process, including in-depth technical analysis
within the various sectors. The Bank's staff helped to identify and prepare an operation consistent
with both the Borrower's interests and the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy. The Policy Matrix
effectively made operational key aspects of Córdoba's reform strategy supported by the operation
that were ambitious but still feasible. The Bank worked in close collaboration with the provincial
government and maintained a high degree of coordination between the PRL and other Bank
operations, both provincial and sector loans.

Córdoba proved to be a sound choice for participating in the PRL. The province had
demonstrated a commitment toward reform, with strong political support from the legislature and
a remarkable implementation capacity. Despite by its high level of indebtedness, Córdoba was
able to undertake social reforms while at the same striving toward fiscal adjustment. Despite the



                                                38

unprecedented difficulties posed by the 2001-2002 implementation environment, Córdoba's
performance under the PRL successfully demonstrated that difficult reforms can be advanced
even in difficult implementation environments when there is substantial political will.

(b)       Quality of Supervision (including M&E arrangements)

Rating: Satisfactory

Even under normal circumstances, policy development operations pose a challenge in terms of
supervision, as they require both precision and agility. In the case of Córdoba's PRL, this
challenge was exponentially more complex given the extraordinary circumstances under which
the operation was implemented during 2001 and 2002. Once the macroeconomic environment
situation improved, the Bank moved quickly to restructure the operation as to adapt it to the new
realities. The supervision team that was constituted by staff from various networks succeeded in
supporting the implementation of reforms in multiple sectors while maintaining internal
cohesiveness. In this regard, PREM provided overall coordination and encouraged the other
networks to take responsibility for supervising their sector reform programs; in turn, the
Infrastructure and Human Development networks were fully cooperative and fully supported the
operation. Thus, the experience of Córdoba's PRL-as well as those in Santa Fe and Catamarca-
could be considered an example of successful cross-sector coordination between multiple
networks-PREM, Infrastructure, and Human Development. In turn, the supervision team forged a
close relationship with provincial authorities through periodic visits and fluid communication. At
times when relations were tense between the government and IFIs, the task manager and the PRL
team succeeded in maintaining the channels of communication open with provincial authorities
and the professional staff working in the various sectors covered under the operation. During the
interviews conducted as part of the ICR preparation, professional staff and authorities repeatedly
praised the input of their Bank counterparts in terms of policy making and rigorous monitoring,
reporting it as an important value-added benefit of the operation. The project was very well
documented, as all official records, communications, e-mails and reports presented by the
borrower and sector task managers during the life of the project were archived in the Bank's IRIS
(Integrated Records Information System). This reflects a substantial effort, as many of the lengthy
reports produced by the borrower were presented as hard copies, which required their manual
scanning.

(c)      Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Given the severity of the economic collapse of December 2001, it is, of course, relevant to
question whether the Bank should have predicted such an outcome. However, given the many
different views on the causes of the crisis and whether it might have been avoided, this question
can be more adequately addressed as part of the evaluation of the overall Bank strategy toward
Argentina than as part of this ICR, which focuses on the specific reforms supported by the
operation. Although the debate over what was the appropriate strategy under the conditions
prevailing at the time is likely to continue, the implementation of Córdoba's PRL indicates that
adjustment operations can help ensure the sustainability of ongoing reforms during difficult
periods. Moreover, the specific reforms supported by the operation were necessary in any event,
as illustrated by their impact on provincial management and service delivery as well as the
sustained momentum for their continuing implementation-with the exception of privatization
efforts. For the reasons outlined above, the Bank's performance is considered satisfactory with
regard to the preparation and implementation of this particular operation.

5.2 Borrower Performance:

(a)      Government Performance

Rating: Not Applicable

During preparation, the province provided full collaboration. Staff from the various provincial
ministries and agencies participated in the preparatory work, ensuring that the proposed actions
were consistent with the province's reform program. Córdoba had strong ownership of the reform
program, illustrating the ideal case in which a Bank operation fully supports provincial
objectives. The highly transparent approach used by Córdoba's authorities, by which key reforms
were subjected to the legislature's scrutiny, was critical in developing support for the program
being supported under the PRL.

The supervision of the program was entrusted to an Executing Unit that served as an effective
interface between the different actors, including the governor, the provincial ministries, the Bank,
and the executing units of other related projects. While the Ministry of Finance took the lead in
implementing the reform program, the Ministries of Education, Health, Social Protection, and
Production participated as well. Weekly meetings with those responsible for the implementation
of the reforms in the various areas were important in ensuring internal coordination. In some
cases, such as the health sector, the minister served as a champion for the reforms being
supported under the operation. The Bank's supervision team was kept well informed of all
relevant developments-both of progress and occasional difficulties-that took place during the
implementation of the program. Adequate documentation was made available to support the
request for disbursement of the second and third tranches. In general, the province emphasized
formal compliance, submitting to the Bank legal documentation that provided legal proof of
compliance, paying less attention to the substantial achievements-some of them quite remarkable-
behind each of the conditions. The province demonstrated a strong internal cohesiveness during
the implementation of the operation, articulating political support from the top with a
demonstrated ability for implementation throughout the end of 2003. This fluidity was
particularly noteworthy in the management of public finances and the health sector, which,
despite their complexity, benefited from a uniting vision. The government also made genuine,
good faith efforts to privatize EPEC and the BPC. Finally, the operation has benefited from
political continuity, as the governor was elected to a second term in 2003.

(b)      Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Not Applicable

(c)      Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The lack of fiscal resources and the mounting social tensions that resulted from the country's
economic collapse posed a difficult test for provincial authorities and their commitment toward
reform. However, as opposed to abandoning their reform program, they continued with their
efforts, pushing for difficult reforms on various fronts, even though privatization efforts failed
due to lack of market demand. At the national level, the operation benefited from the clearly
defined framework established by the national government for managing the fiscal situation of
the provinces in the aftermath of the 2001 crisis, using the orderly financing agreements first, and

subsequently the Fiscal Responsibility Law. For these reasons and the ones noted above, the
borrower's overall performance is considered satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned (both operation-specific and of wide general application)

Provincial policy development operations such as Córdoba's PRL are only appropriate
under stable macroeconomic conditions. While this type of operation requires an overall
satisfactory macroeconomic policy framework, such framework is the responsibility of the
national government and beyond the sphere of action of provincial authorities. As illustrated by
the experience of Córdoba's PRL, failings or uncertainties at the macroeconomic level can
override substantial achievements at the provincial level, leading to loan cancellation.

Under stable macroeconomic conditions, policy-based operations supporting a well-defined
set of reforms can be effective tools in promoting structural adjustment at the sub-national
level. Direct provincial lending using fast-disbursing operations have the advantages of: (i)
addressing the needs of individual provinces more specifically; and (ii) introducing a critical mass
of financial incentives and technical support that can effectively accelerate the pace of the reform
process within individual provinces. In addition, operations such as Córdoba's PRL foster
provincial ownership, internal consistency of provincial sector policies, and cross-sector
coordination during their implementation. As reported by provincial authorities, the direct
relationship with the Bank also brings added legitimacy and credibility to the province's reform
program, as well as valuable technical assistance in the development of sector policies and
methodological rigor in implementation, monitoring and evaluation.

Provincial operations can be effective complements of sector reforms and operations at the
national level. While sector-specific investment operations targeting provincial governments
provide for a sharper sector focus and longer term engagement, multi-sector provincial-level
operations such as Córdoba's PRL can help promote sector objectives by boosting political will to
take key policy actions at the provincial level. This is particularly important in the case of
Argentina, where highly autonomous provinces play a predominant role in providing critical
public services, such as education and health. On the downside, direct provincial lending
concentrates risk on specific provinces-as opposed to national sector operations that diversify risk
among multiple participating provinces.

For reforms to be successful, they have to follow the right sequence, take into consideration
interrelationship of intermediate steps, and be supported by a sound incentive system. The
successful implementation of the cost-recovery mechanisms by public hospitals underlines the
importance of having in place not only an adequate legal framework but also the tools needed for
implementation-in this case, the national register of beneficiaries of national insurance carriers.
Likewise, consolidating the financial viability of the IPAM is an important factor determining the
overall success of the cost recovery system, given that it provides health insurance to over 18
percent of the population. In addition, the rewards system tying cost recovery to salary bonuses
for hospital workers ensures that there are strong incentives ensuring its sustainability.

For provinces to be fiscally responsible over the long term, a consistent system of incentives
must be in place at the national level. A clear strategy of the national government towards the
provinces is a prerequisite for broader fiscal adjustment among sub-national governments, such as
the determination to avoid bailouts of fiscally irresponsible provincial governments. In this regard,
the operation has benefited from the clearly defined framework established by the national
government for managing the fiscal situation of the provinces in the post-2001 period, using the



                                                 41

orderly financing agreements first, and subsequently the Fiscal Responsibility Law. It is
important to note, however, that the high level of discretion and political nature of bilateral
financing arrangements under the Financial Responsibility Law generates uncertainties as to
whether the law will ultimately lead to sustained fiscal discipline.

The Bank's continuous engagement during critical periods can help sustain ongoing
reforms and protect previous achievements. The experience of Córdoba's PRL indicates it was
beneficial to have an operation in place providing a clear roadmap for enhancing service delivery
in key social sectors during times of economic, political and institutional chaos. The substantial
financial resources attached to the PRL became even more attractive in face of the overall lack of
liquidity in the country in 2001-2002, providing the province additional incentives to sustain the
ongoing reforms in the short and medium term. The experience of Córdoba's PRL also shows that
sector reforms are possible even when the overriding priority is fiscal adjustment; however, sector
budgets need to be protected, in particular to ensure that cost savings from efficiency gains can be
reinvested into the sector.

Uncertain macroeconomic conditions can undermine reforms focusing on privatization and
concession, even when they have the full commitment of the authorities. The experience of
Córdoba and the failed privatization efforts of the provincial bank and its electricity company
show that lack of market demand can undermine privatization efforts, even when there is full
commitment on the part of the provincial government.

The success of SAL loans depends on a combination of factors, the most important of which
is strong political support. In the case Córdoba, the ambitious set of reforms supported under
the PRL succeeded as a result of a unique combination of strong political support from the
governor and the provincial legislature, as well as a solid leadership in the individual sectors.

Loan conditionality should focus on results, going beyond the enactment of legislation. Like
many structural adjustment operations, Córdoba's PRL illustrates the danger of having
conditionality that can be met despite not having any significant impact. In this particular case,
the conditions related to municipal finances, which focused on formal agreements and the
preparation of action plans, had little or no impact on strengthening municipal governments' in
their capacity to manage resources.

Overly complex operations with a large number of conditionalities that lack a clear
hierarchy are difficult to implement and supervise. These difficulties became evident during
the implementation of Córdoba's PRL, which initially included over 50 conditionalities to cover
the province's ambitious reform program. Reducing the number of conditionalities and
establishing a clear hierarchy between them can improve overall design. In this regard, it might
be useful to focus primarily on major policy actions and the achievement of specific targets,
rather than including the satisfactory completion of technical inputs, such as studies and action
plans, as policy conditions.

Cross-sector operations at the provincial level require strong coordination during both
preparation and implementation. On the side of the borrower, this type of operation requires
strong coordination efforts, both horizontal (i.e., between across multiple government agencies at
the provincial level) and vertical (i.e., between ministries at the national and provincial levels).
On the Bank side, operations such as Córdoba's PRL demand strong cooperation and coordination
between the various sector teams. While successfully achieved in this case, the need for effective
coordination could pose risks to other operations of similar complexity.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a)      Borrower/Implementing agencies

Project Design, Objectives and Implementation Experience: The original project design
clearly responded to the policy agenda of top provincial authorities, which, in turn, was consistent
with the Bank's strategy for the region. Three laws provided the cornerstone for the new
administration's reform program: the State Modernization Law (Law No. 8.836), the
Incorporation of Private Capital into the Public Sector Law (Law No. 8.837), and the Citizens'
Charter Law (Law No. 8.835). The loan's objectives targeted systematically those aspects of the
provincial public sector that were considered critical to strengthen public finances, public
administration and social sectors. The strong conviction and support of top provincial authorities
were critical in transforming these objectives into strategic lines of action within the various
provincial ministries and ensuring the strong commitment among various actors to their
implementation. This is illustrated by the fact that, despite having one of the deepest crises in the
history of Argentina as a backdrop, significant structural reforms were implemented, despite the
high level of effort they required. Provincial authorities saw the 2001 crisis as a negative factor
that, although it could perhaps delay the implementation of the reform program, would not cut it
short.

Achievement of Objectives: The level of achievement has been noteworthy. Out of
approximately 80 conditionalities corresponding to the four tranches, only a handful was not met,
largely due to factors beyond the control of provincial authorities. According to the province's
own assessment, approximately 97 percent of the conditions were met, although it is, of course,
clear than not all conditions were equally important. In addition, it is important to underscore the
critical importance of the structural reforms that were undertaken. In addition, it is once again
important to underscore that the successful level of achievement of the loan could not have been
attained without clear policy guidelines from top provincial authorities, which provided the
executing unit and those responsible for project implementation a very precise definition of the
expected results as well as their full support. Finally, the loan has indirectly enhanced the
technical capacity of participating provincial technical staff.

Bank's Performance: The Bank's performance during project implementation was critical in
ensuring in a satisfactory manner the achievement of original and, subsequently, revised
objectives. The flexibility and understanding exhibited by the Bank's authorities in relation to the
2001 crisis permitted the revision of original loan targets without detracting from the overall
program objectives, and the continuation with the implementation of needed structural reforms. In
this way, provincial authorities were able to achieve and, in some cases, exceed the targets
corresponding to the second and third tranche, and even the fourth tranche, notwithstanding its
mutually agreed cancellation, reflecting their firm commitment toward the loan's overall
objectives.

Lessons Learned: Some of the lessons learned during the implementation of the Loan No. 4585-
AR include:

1. Macroeconomic variables beyond the control of provincial authorities can affect the
     implementation of projects focusing on structural reforms, as well as limit the availability of
     provincial financial resources.
2. To minimize resistance, structural reforms should be designed by those government areas that
     will be directly affected by the reforms or that will be responsible for their implementation. In



                                                  43

    this case, participation was strongly promoted, with staff from different levels within each
    ministry being included in the process.
3. The implementation of structural reforms often involves the reconfiguration of operational
    procedures and the improvement of information systems within a large number of public
    entities, resulting in time requirements that exceed the expected lifetime of the operation.
4. It is crucial to have in place strategies to maintain the program as a top government priority,
   even after provincial authorities are replaced.
5. It is important to maintain a certain degree of flexibility during implementation to incorporate
   or eliminate activities as determined by unpredicted circumstances or demands.
6. It is important to establish a hierarchy among program goals and define implementation and
   supervision instruments that reflect the relative importance of the various goals.
7. It is vital to the success of project implementation to ensure from the onset that the provincial
   executing unit has adequate organization and capacity. In addition, it is important to balance
   the central control of the executing unit with the autonomy of the various ministries that
   participate in program implementation.
8. Assigning responsibility for coordinating program implementation at the provincial level and
   serving as the interface with the Bank to a centralized executing unit is important to ensure a
   successful implementation process.
9. Those goals that require coordinated actions of multiple provincial entities must be
   established jointly, taking into consideration the time requirements, availability of resources,
   and responsibilities of each of the parties.
10. In the context of future operations, it would be important to limit the number of loan
    conditionalities. As originally designed, the operation supported a broad and ambitious
    structural reform program that included several areas of the provincial public sector,
    including public finances, public administration, and social services. The implementation of
    such a program involved multiple actors across various ministries.

7.1 Restructuring:

By restructuring the operation in April 2003, the Bank sought to address the drastic changes that
followed the economic collapse of December 2001 while preserving the overall objectives of the
loan. The decision to restructure the operation instead of it as originally scheduled and canceling
the two undisbursed tranches was based on the substantial progress Córdoba had made in the
implementation of its reform program despite the adverse implementation environment.
Restructuring provided the opportunity to reframe the province's program in a manner that was
feasible given the macroeconomic uncertainties and poor investment climate without detracting
from the operation's original development objectives.

At restructuring, modifications were introduced in both the configuration of its tranches and
individual conditions. As original conceived, the loan was structured into three equal tranches of
US$100 million, the first of which was disbursed upon effectiveness. The second tranche--called
the `floating' tranche--was linked to sale of the provincial bank and electricity company. The
final third tranche was comprehensive and tied to a wide variety of reforms in the areas of public
finance, public administration and the social sectors. At restructuring, the two pending tranches of
US$100 million each were modified as follows:

· Second tranche (US$100 million): It included conditions relating to fiscal performance,
    protection of social funding, and the provincial bank and the electricity company, most of
    which were amended to reflect the post-2001 fiscal and social conditions.
· Third tranche (US$25 million): It was cut back to include only those original conditions in
    the areas of public finance, public administration, and the social sectors that were already met.
    The 15 conditions corresponding to the restructured third tranche were not amended, except
    for a waiver given to a pilot program to provide health insurance to the poor.
· Fourth tranche (US$75 million): A new tranche was created to incorporate conditions
    originally included in the third tranche that were still under implementation. Some of these
    conditions maintained the original targets, and others were amended. The bulk of conditions
    were in the areas of public finances, public administration and social sector reform.
    Additional conditions were added with respect to the provincial bank and the electricity
    company.

The second and third tranches were eligible for immediate disbursement, while the disbursement
of the fourth tranche was to be disbursed once the Province met the corresponding conditions.

In the case of individual conditions that had been rendered unfeasible or overly ambitious by the
crisis, an upfront agreement was reached with the province on revised targets that, although
scaled down, were still consistent with the operation's development objectives. Overall, a total of
17 out of 53 conditions were either waived or their targets modified--five and 12 conditions
corresponding to the original `floating tranche' and third tranche, respectively. The most
important amendments and waivers related to fiscal targets, the privatization of the provincial
bank, the concession of the electricity company, the elimination of a pilot program to provide
health insurance to the poor, and municipal finances. Specifically, original fiscal targets were
replaced by those included in the 2002 and 2003 PFO bilateral agreements. In the case of the
provincial bank and the electricity company, conditions calling for their privatization or
concession were waived. Instead, amended conditions called for the implementation of



                                                50

restructuring plans to ensure the continuing financial and operational strengthening of these
entities, so they could be ready for privatization once market were more favorable. The
elimination of a health insurance pilot program for the poor due to financial constraints clearly
constituted a loss for the program supported under the PRL. In addition, some of the amendments
weakened original conditions by replacing result-oriented conditions for less substantial
requirements, such as formal agreements and the presentation of action plans that, in hindsight,
had little impact. For example, the conditions calling for the implementation of municipal fiscal
pacts and the harmonization of municipal cadastres were replaced by the adoption of formal
agreements and the preparation of technical assistance programs that have had little impact on
improving municipal revenues. Table 7.1 provides details of the individual amendments.

Given the severity of the crisis and its adverse consequences, it was clearly impossible to adapt
the operation to the new realities without any significant trade-offs. While the development
objectives remained unaltered, the operation's actual level of achievement was diminished
relative to the original expected key outcomes as a result of the restructuring. Specifically,
although steps were taken under the restructured operation to enhance the operational and
financial performance of the bank and electricity company, they remained in the hands of the
province. Likewise, revised fiscal targets were substantially less ambitious than originally
envisioned, particularly in terms of reductions in the debt stock. However, by restructuring the
operation as opposed to canceling it, the Bank offered the province its support as well as
substantial incentives to continue with the implementation of the critical set of reforms supported
by the operation despite the heightened fiscal and social pressure.

7.2. Rating the Outcome of Projects with Formally Revised Objectives:

As noted earlier, the operation's development objectives--i.e., to promote an efficient and
responsive delivery of public services within fiscally sound policies--remained unchanged at
restructuring. While the operation has largely met its development objectives, some of the key
outcome targets as operationalized by the loan's policy conditions were formally revised at
restructuring to reflect the macroeconomic and social changes that resulted from the economic
collapse of December 2001. Thus, the operation's overall outcome rating has been assessed
against both the original and revised key outcome targets, in accordance with the Harmonized
Evaluation Criteria for ICR and IEG Evaluations and the new ICR guidelines issued in August
2006.

Assessment of outcome with respect to original key outcome targets: Unsatisfactory.
Although the operation has clearly succeeded in supporting Córdoba in its efforts to enhance
efficiency and responsiveness in the delivery of public services within fiscally sound policies,
some of the key outcome targets envisioned at approval were not achieved. Not surprisingly in
view of the severity of the 2001-2002 crisis, the outcome targets that were not achieved relate
primarily to public finances. Because of the substantial achievements in the areas of public
administration, health, education and social protection, the operation is rated `Unsatisfactory'
instead of `Highly Unsatisfactory.' The operation's achievement with respect to the key original
outcomes can be summarized as follows:




                                                   54

A. Public Finances: Several key of the original conditions were not met, including:

    · Fiscal targets: The original fiscal target regarding the debt stock calling for a ratio not
        greater that 0.7 of current revenues was not met. In 2005, Córdoba's debt stock
        represented almost twice the original target at 134.5 percent of current revenues, in large
        part due to the peso devaluation with respect to the US dollar. Although with delays, the
        province met the remaining original fiscal targets that called for a current account surplus
        higher than 9 percent of current revenues and overall deficit of less than $78 million, as
        Córdoba's fiscal accounts for 2005 showed a current account surplus equivalent to 9.3
        percent of current revenues and an, although modest, an overall surplus (see Table 1).
    · Increased private sector participation: The privatization of the provincial bank and the
        concession of the electricity company were not met due to the unfavorable
        macroeconomic conditions and the dismal investment climate. The two entities, however,
        have made progress toward enhancing their operational performance.
    · Municipal finances: The original conditions calling for the implementation of municipal
        fiscal plans and cadastre modernization in 20 municipalities were not achieved, mainly
        due to the cancellation of the IADB operation that provided technical and financial
        support for these activities.

B. Public Administration: All original outcomes were achieved or exceeded.

C. Social Sectors: All original key outcomes were achieved or exceeded, with the exception of:
    a. Health: While some health-sector conditions were modified at restructuring, the changes
    represented mainly marginal adjustments to the operation's original outcomes. The most
    notable exception was the waiver given to the implementation of a pilot health insurance
    program for the poor (see Table in Section H). However, although the pilot program was not
    implemented, Córdoba has continued to make progress toward expanding health coverage
    among all socio-economic sectors of the population under the Integrated Provincial Health
    System (Sistema Integrado de Salud Provincial) that received legislative approval in 2003. In
    addition, APROSS (formerly IPAM) does not regularly publish its findings on health care
    quality, although it reportedly plans to begin in 2007.
    b. Education: At restructuring, some of the original outcomes were modified to address
    technical aspects identified during implementation (see Table in Section H). Thus, except for
    the partial implementation of the human resources management system that is addressed
    below, there were no major deviations from key original outcomes.
    c. Social Protection: All original outcomes were achieved or exceeded.

Assessment of outcome with respect to revised key outcome targets: Satisfactory. All
conditions of the restructured second and third tranche were met and the corresponding tranches
were disbursed. Although the fourth tranche was cancelled in agreement with the government as
part of the negotiations of the new CAS envelope, all but three of its conditions were also met.
Two of the conditions that were not met are being implemented and their achievement is expected,
one was partially implemented and a fourth was not met but will be reportedly implemented
during 2007. Specifically:

· Obtaining central bank approval of the restructuring plan of the provincial bank: The central
    bank and the province are still negotiating the terms of the US$30 million recapitalization
    package; thus, this condition was not met. However, under new management the provincial
    bank has taken important steps toward enhancing the competitiveness of the institution. In
    addition, a private firm has been managing residual assets since 2004.



                                                 55

· Improving human resources management: The implementation of the human resources
    management system based on a single teacher file (Legajo Único Electrónico) is well
    advanced, including teachers in responsible for approximately 59 percent of the student
    population and 67 percent of the schools. Its completion is anticipated for 2007. Thus, this
    condition was partially met.
· Gradual increase in electricity tariffs: While Córdoba is among the provinces that have
    raised electric tariffs to, albeit partially, reflect higher costs, these increases have been
    insufficient to ensure EPEC's financial sustainability over the medium and long term, as
    indicated by the lack of substantial improvement in EPEC's financial position with respect to
    2000. Thus, this condition was partially met.
· IPAM's regular issuing of findings on health care quality: Although APROSS (formerly
    IPAM) conducts periodic surveys to monitor health care quality, findings are not issued on a
    regular basis, as required by fourth-tranche conditionality. APROSS expects to begin
    publishing these findings regularly during 2007. This condition was not met.

Weighted Overall Project Outcome: Moderately Satisfactory.               Weighing the operation's
ratings with respect to original and revised objectives based on the share of actual disbursements
before and after the revision took place renders an overall outcome of Moderately Satisfactory, as
shown on Table 7.2.
