adjustment loan project (PRL) were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Lessons learned from the project were as follows: 1)\n            Provincial policy development operations such as\n            Cordoba's PRL are only appropriate under stable\n            macroeconomic conditions; 2) Under stable macroeconomic\n            conditions, policy-based operations supporting a\n            well-defined set of reforms can be effective tools in\n            promoting structural adjustment at the sub-national level;\n            3) Provincial operations can be effective complements of\n            sector reforms and operations at the national level; 4) For\n            reforms to be successful, they have to follow the right\n            sequence, take into consideration interrelationship of\n            intermediate steps, and be supported by a sound incentive\n            system; 5) For provinces to be fiscally responsible over the\n            long term, a consistent system of incentives must be in\n            place at the national level; 6) The Bank's continuous\n            engagement during critical periods can help sustain ongoing\n            reforms and protect previous achievements; 7) Uncertain\n            macroeconomic conditions can undermine reforms focusing on\n            privatization and concession, even when they have the full\n            commitment of the authorities; 8) The success of SAL loans\n            depends on a combination of factors, the most important of\n            which is strong political support; 9) Loan conditionality\n            should focus on results, going beyond the enactment of\n            legislation; 10) Overly complex operations with a large\n            number of conditionalities that lack a clear hierarchy are\n            difficult to implement and supervise; and 11) Cross-sector\n            operations at the provincial level require strong\n            coordination during both preparation and implementation."}, "docdt": "2007-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
