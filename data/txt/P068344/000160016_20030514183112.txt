Loan 
- 
Cordoba 
(Loan 4585-AR) 
Proposed 
Amendments 
and 
Waivers 
to 
Second 
and 
Third 
Tranches, 
Creation 
of 
Fourth 
Tranche, 
and 
Release 
of 
the 
Second 
and 
Third 
Tranches 
1. 
This 
memorandum 
seeks 
the 
approval 
of 
the 
Executive Directors to 
amend 
the 
loan 
agreement 
for 
the 
Cordoba Provincial 
Reform 
Loan 
(4585-AR) 
on 
the 
terms 
described 
in 
paragraphs 
14-24 below. 
The 
proposed 
amendment 
would 
allow 
the 
Province 
of 
Cordoba 
to 
meet 
the 
overall 
objectives 
of 
its 
reform 
program, 
as 
previously 
approved 
by 
the 
Board, 
by 
taking 
into 
account 
the 
impact 
of 
subsequent 
and 
fundamental 
changes 
in 
the 
macroeconomic 
and 
investment 
environment 
and 
social conditions 
in 
Argentina. 
The 
proposed 
amendment 
remains 
firmly 
grounded 
in 
the 
overall 
objectives 
of 
the 
loan to 
promote 
fiscal stability 
at 
the 
provincial 
level, 
strengthen 
the 
role 
of 
private 
capital 
and 
the 
business 
climate, 
and 
promote  structural  reforms 
to 
improve 
the 
efficiency,  quality 
and 
equity 
of 
public 
spending, 
particularly 
in 
the 
social 
sectors, 
in 
Cordoba. 
2. 
The 
proposed 
reformulation 
would 
amend 
the 
original 
second 
and 
third 
tranches 
of 
$100 
million 
each, 
while 
splitting 
the 
original 
third 
tranche 
into 
a 
revised 
third 
tranche 
of 
$25 
million 
and 
a 
new 
fourth 
tranche 
of 
$75 
million. 
This 
approach 
reflects 
the 
substantial 
progress 
made 
so 
far 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
reform 
program, 
and 
it 
provides 
for 
the 
reframing 
of 
a 
consistent 
program 
in 
response 
to 
the 
changes 
in 
the 
country 
environment through 
an 
upfront 
agreement 
on revised 
targets 
to 
achieve 
the 
agreed 
development 
goals. 
Upon 
the 
Board’s approval 
of 
the 
proposed 
reformulation, 
and 
the 
declaration of 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
legal 
amendment, 
the 
Bank 
would 
advise 
the 
authorities 
that 
the 
revised 
second and 
third 
tranches 
for 
a 
total 
amount 
of 
$125 
million 
would 
be 
available 
for 
withdrawal.

Economic Performance 
and 
Prospects 
3. 
After 
plunging 
into 
a 
deep 
crisis 
in 
the 
first 
few  months 
of 
2002, 
the 
Argentine 
economy 
reached 
a 
certain 
degree 
of 
stability 
in 
the 
second 
half 
of 
last 
year. 
This 
stability 
was 
characterized 
by: 
(i) 
an 
interruption 
in 
output 
decline, 
and 
gradual 
recovery toward 
the 
latter 
part 
of 
the 
year; 
(ii) 
a 
stabilization 
of 
the 
exchange 
rate, 
albeit 
at 
a 
much 
depreciated 
level; 
and 
(iii) 
a 
broad 
balance 
between 
revenues and 
non-interest 
expenditures, 
although 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
non 
payment 
of 
public 
debt 
obligations 
and 
the 
compression 
in 
the 
real 
value 
of 
public 
sector 
wages 
and 
pension 
benefits. 
This 
stabilization 
has 
engendered an 
overall 
increase 
in 
optimism 
about 
the 
short 
run 
prospects 
of 
the 
country 
and 
set 
the 
stage 
for 
Argentina to 
reach 
a 
short-term 
agreement 
with 
the 
IMF 
for 
the 
January-August 2003 
period.

4. 
Fiscal 
developments 
in 
2002. 
Central 
to 
achieving 
the 
economic 
stabilization 
in 
the 
second 
half 
of 
2002 
was 
the 
improvement 
of 
the 
consolidated 
fiscal 
position 
on 
a 
cash basis. 
At 
the 
federal government 
level, 
there 
was 
a 
shift 
from 
a 
balanced 
primary position 
in 
2001 
to 
a 
0.7 
percent 
of 
GDP 
primary 
surplus 
in 
2002. 
The 
improvement 
in 
the 
fiscal position 
at 
the 
federal 
level 
reflected 
the 
revision 
of 
tax 
sharing 
agreements 
with 
the 
provinces 
(see 
below), 
the 
broadening 
of 
the 
tax 
base, 
and 
tight 
controls 
of 
expenditures. 
Broadening 
of 
the 
tax 
base 
resulted 
primarily from 
higher 
taxes 
on 
exports, 
which 
by 
end-December accounted 
for 
12 
percent 
of 
total 
tax 
revenues, 
and 
the 
impact 
of 
inflation 
on 
revenues 
in 
general, 
including 
the 
financial 
transactions tax. 
On 
the 
expenditure 
side, 
there 
was 
compression 
in 
public 
wages 
and 
pensions 
through 
inflation,  leading 
to 
a 
loss 
of 
around one-quarter 
of 
their 
real 
value. 
Cash 
interest 
payments 
also 
fell 
sharply 
following 
the 
default 
on 
most 
of 
the 
public 
debt 
in 
late 
2001. 
5. 
Provincial 
finances 
in 
2002. 
At 
the 
provincial 
level, 
there 
was 
a 
72 
percent 
decline 
in 
the 
overall 
primary deficit, 
from 
1.5 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2001 to 
near 
balance 
in 
2002. 
A 
decline 
in 
expenditures 
accounted 
for 
93 
percent 
of 
the 
deficit 
reduction, 
while 
an 
increase 
in 
revenues 
explained 
the 
remaining 
7 
percent. 
Lower 
spending 
on 
interest 
payments 
was 
the 
main 
factor 
explaining 
the 
decline 
in 
expenditures, 
although 
lower 
capital 
expenditures 
and 
the 
erosion 
in 
the 
real 
value 
of 
spending 
on 
personnel 
and 
transfers 
to 
households 
also 
contributed 
to 
the 
expenditure  decline. 
While 
overall 
revenues 
remained almost 
unchanged, 
there 
were 
significant variations 
across 
revenue 
categories. 
There 
were declines 
in 
revenues 
coming 
from 
the 
federal 
government 
and 
most non-tax 
revenues. 
These 
declines were 
partially  offset 
however 
by 
increases 
in 
provincial 
own 
tax 
revenues 
and 
royalties 
from 
oil 
production. 
6. 
Monetary and 
exchange 
rate 
stability. 
The 
government's 
balanced 
cash 
fiscal 
position 
meant 
that 
monetary 
policy 
could 
focus 
on 
stabilizing 
the 
exchange 
rate. 
Exchange 
rate 
stability 
was 
achieved 
by 
mid-year 
due, 
to 
a 
large 
extent, 
to  foreign 
currency regulations 
requiring 
exporters 
to 
surrender 
export 
earnings 
to 
the 
central 
bank. 
Foreign 
currency regulations 
provided 
the 
Argentine 
authorities 
with 
ample 
supply 
of 
foreign 
currency, 
albeit 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
debt 
servicing 
due 
to 
the 
default 
status, 
allowing 
international 
reserves 
to  stabilize 
and 
slowly 
recover. 
The 
increase 
in 
international 
reserves, 
combined 
with 
a 
gradual recovery 
of 
deposits 
in 
the 
banking 
system, 
led 
in 
turn 
to rapid 
monetary 
expansion, 
especially 
in 
the 
last 
quarter 
of 
2002, 
despite 
sterilization 
efforts 
by 
the 
central 
bank. 
Also, 
large 
trade 
surpluses and 
weak 
demand 
for 
dollars 
meant 
that 
the 
peso 
gradually 
gained  strength 
against 
the 
dollar. 
The 
currency 
appreciation 
provided 
the 
government 
with 
the 
opportunity to 
ease 
some 
of 
the 
foreign 
exchange 
regulations,' 
signaling 
an 
important 
first 
step 
toward 
normalizing 
the 
operations 
of 
the 
foreign 
exchange 
market. 
To 
ensure 
monetary 
and  exchange 
rate 
stability 
in 
2003, 
however, 
more 
will 
need 
to 
be 
done 
by 
generating larger 
fiscal 
Importers of 
capital 
goods and 
spare 
parts 
were 
allowed 
to 
pay 
100 
percent 
cash 
in 
advance, 
reducing 
barriers 
to 
new 
investments. 
Similarly, 
exporters 
of 
capital 
goods were 
no 
longer 
subject 
to 
the 
export 
tax. 
More 
importantly, 
the 
Central 
Bank 
lifted 
restrictions on 
external 
debt payments 
by 
the 
private 
sector, 
with 
no restrictions 
on 
interest 
payments and 
fewer 
restrictions 
on 
principal 
repayments. 
Finally, 
the 
limit 
on 
foreign 
currency 
in 
bank 
portfolios 
were increased, and 
the 
monthly 
ceiling 
on foreign 
currency 
purchases 
by 
individuals 
and 
corporations 
raised 
from 
US$ 
100,000 
to 
US$ 
150,000.

surpluses 
and 
by 
allowing 
trade 
surpluses 
to 
be 
used 
for 
resuming 
interest 
payments 
on 
public 
debt 
currently 
in 
default. 
7. 
IMF 
program. 
The 
IMF’s 
short-term 
transitional 
program 
aims 
at 
bridging 
the 
period 
between 
the 
Presidential election on 
April 
27 
and 
the 
first 
few 
months 
of 
the 
next administration 
by 
ensuring 
fiscal 
and 
monetary 
stability during 
the 
transition. 
This 
would 
set 
the 
stage 
for 
a 
more 
comprehensive 
program 
of 
fundamental reforms, 
tackling 
the 
structural 
problems 
confronting 
Argentina. 
The 
transitional 
program includes 
actions 
to: 
(i) 
raise 
tax 
revenue 
to 
ensure 
fiscal stability 
at 
all 
levels 
of 
government; 
(ii) 
initiate 
the 
normalization 
of 
relations 
with 
foreign 
investors, 
including 
initial 
contacts 
with 
foreign 
bondholders, 
and 
an 
assessment 
of 
the 
legal 
and 
regulatory 
framework 
in 
which 
the 
renegotiation 
of 
public 
services 
and 
infrastructure 
concessions 
is 
being 
conducted; 
and 
(iii) 
renewal of last 
year’s 
the 
federal-provincial 
agreement, 
ensuring 
that 
the 
latter 
meet 
agreed 
fiscal 
targets. 
In 
parallel, 
the 
federal 
and 
the 
provincial 
governments have 
agreed 
to 
continue 
undertaking 
reforms 
aimed 
at: 
(i) 
ensuring 
that 
the 
provinces 
are 
able 
to 
continue 
delivering 
key  social 
services 
(health, 
education 
and 
social 
assistance), 
especially 
those 
targeted 
to 
the 
poor; 
(ii) 
strengthening 
the 
equity 
and 
financial 
sustainability of 
the 
national 
public 
pension 
system; and 
(iii) 
raising 
the 
efficiency 
of 
tax 
administration. 
The 
IMF 
supported 
program 
is 
on 
track.

Prospects. 
Argentina’s 
prospects 
for 
2003 
are 
the 
continuation 
of 
the 
current 
recovery 
in 
output 
and 
the 
maintenance 
of 
the 
fiscal 
and 
monetary 
stability 
reached 
over 
the 
second 
half 
of 
last 
year. 
The 
prospects 
for 
output recovery 
reflects 
the 
depth 
of 
the 
output decline 
in 
the 
last 
4 
years 
(20 
percent) 
and 
the 
opportunities 
provided 
by 
the 
sharp 
devaluation 
of 
the 
currency. 
Export 
and 
import  substituting activities 
will 
therefore 
continue 
leading 
the 
recovery, 
with 
real 
GDP 
growth 
projected 
in 
the 
3.5 
to 
4 
percent 
range. 
To 
sustain 
the 
recovery, 
vigorous 
fiscal 
management 
will 
need 
to 
continue 
targeting 
consolidated 
primary fiscal 
surpluses, 
increasing 
from 
a 
slight 
surplus 
in 
2002 
to 
a 
2.5 
percent 
of 
GDP 
surplus 
by 
end-2003. 
Also, 
tax 
administration 
will 
need 
to 
continue 
to 
improve, 
so 
that 
tax  receipts 
keep 
rising 
with 
output. 
Strong 
fiscal 
management and 
a 
stable 
exchange 
rate 
should 
restrain 
inflation, 
curtailing 
demands 
for 
adjustments 
in 
expenditures (especially 
wages, 
salaries 
and 
pension 
benefits). 
9. 
In 
view 
of 
the 
above, 
Argentina’s 
current macroeconomic 
framework 
provides 
the 
basis 
for 
a 
transitional 
program 
with 
the 
IFIs. 
This 
transitional 
program 
seeks 
to 
ensure 
fiscal 
and 
monetary 
stability 
by 
taking 
steps 
to 
guarantee 
(i) 
a 
broad 
balance 
between 
revenues 
and 
non-interest 
expenditures; 
(ii) 
the 
provision 
of 
key 
public 
services, 
especially 
those 
targeted 
to 
the 
poor; 
and 
(iii) 
the 
continuation 
of 
reforms 
aimed 
at 
improving 
efficiency 
in 
tax 
administration 
and 
expenditure 
management. 
Success 
in 
implementing 
this 
transitory 
program 
will 
be measured 
by 
achievements 
in 
preserving 
the 
stability 
reached 
over 
the 
second 
half 
of 
last 
year, 
and 
sustaining 
the 
current 
output 
recovery. 
10. 
Investment 
Climate. 
Since 
Argentina 
defaulted 
on 
its 
sovereign 
debt 
and 
abandoned 
the 
currency 
board 
regime 
in 
early 
2002, 
privatized 
services 
including 
telecom, 
gas, 
electricity, 
water, 
and 
transport, 
have 
been 
subject 
to 
extreme 
conditions. 
These 
include 
the 
“pesification” 
of 
their 
tariffs 
(a 
contractual 
breakdown 
since 
tariffs 
were 
by 
contract 
linked 
to 
the 
dollar), 
the 
balance

clients 
(due 
to

further 
aggravated 
since 
the

which 
led 
to 
a 
rapid

The 
legal

economic 
uncertainty 
in 
the

was 
further 
exacerbated 
by 
changes 
to 
the 
bankruptcy

pesification

all

that 
eroded 
property rights

perhaps 
even

Social 
Situation 
12. 
The 
social 
impact 
of 
the 
crisis 
has 
been 
devastating. 
Using 
data 
from 
the 
official 
household survey 
and 
recently compiled 
World 
Bank 
household survey 
(with 
greater 
geographical 
coverage), 
this 
section 
documents 
the 
effects 
of 
the 
crisis 
on poverty, 
and 
labor 
markets 
(see 
Figure 
1 
and 
Table 
1). 
During 
2002, 
poverty 
trends  worsened 
dramatically. 
The 
share 
of 
population 
considered 
poor 
grew 
by 
roughly 
58 
percentage 
points 
while 
the 
number 
of 
extreme 
poor 
nearly 
doubled.

13. 
The 
economic 
crisis 
has 
had 
a 
strong 
negative 
impact 
on 
the 
access 
and 
use 
of 
education 
and 
health 
services 
and there 
is 
growing 
evidence 
of 
the 
deterioration 
in 
service 
delivery 
and 
key 
indicators 
of 
well-being. 
Coverage 
and 
financing 
of 
formal 
health 
insurance 
has 
dropped 
significantly, 
following 
the 
destruction 
of 
jobs 
in 
the 
formal 
sector. 
Roughly 
12 
percent 
of 
individuals 
with 
formal 
health 
insurance 
either 
discontinued 
(60 
percent 
of 
the 
total), 
or 
reduced 
their 
coverage. 
The 
trend 
has 
contributed 
to 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
use 
of 
already 
financially 
strapped 
public 
hospitals, 
the 
traditional provider 
for 
the 
uninsured. 
The 
crisis 
has 
forced 
families 
to 
cut 
down 
on 
health 
services. 
More 
than 
one-third 
of 
households 
with 
children 
under 
the 
age 
of 
12 
reported 
having 
reduced 
the 
frequency 
with 
which 
they 
take 
their 
children 
for 
medical 
checkups 
(roughly 
half 
of 
those 
households 
belong to 
the 
lowest 
quintile 
of 
the 
income 
distribution). 
There 
are 
concems 
about 
the 
emergence 
of 
cases 
of child 
malnutrition. 
2 
14. 
In 
the 
education 
sector 
there 
are 
no 
indications 
of 
aggravated 
dropout 
and 
desertion 
rates 
due 
to 
the 
crisis. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
a 
large 
proportion 
of 
households 
report 
that 
they 
have 
reduced 
school 
and 
learning 
material 
purchases. 
The 
most 
serious 
negative effects 
of 
the 
crisis 
on 
the 
education 
sector 
are 
linked 
to 
the 
fiscal 
provincial 
crisis. 
The 
lack 
of 
financing 
experienced 
by 
several 
provinces 
has 
generated 
difficulties 
to  comply 
with 
payments 
to 
their 
employees, 
including 
teachers. 
Delays 
in 
wage 
payments 
have 
had 
an 
impact 
on 
the 
continuity 
of 
classes. 
While 
experiences have 
differed 
within 
the 
country 
due 
in 
part 
to 
the 
higher 
or 
lower 
solvency 
in 
which 
each 
state, 
the 
2002 
school 
year was 
irreparably 
affected 
in 
some 
provinces 
(San 
Juan, 
Entre 
Rios), 
very seriously affected 
in 
others 
(TucumAn, 
Jujuy, 
Rio 
Negro), 
and 
had 
partial 
scope 
in 
a 
third 
group 
of 
provinces 
(Misiones, 
Formosa, 
Chubut). 
The 
difference 
among 
them 
is 
the 
number 
of 
school 
days 
lost, 
ranging 
from 
about 
a 
quarter 
to 
almost 
half 
of 
the 
school 
year.3 
15. 
What 
is 
different 
is 
that 
2002 
has 
made 
the 
social situation 
even 
more 
difficult 
for 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
population 
and 
the 
need 
for 
action more 
urgent. 
Discussions 
and 
reform 
proposals 
to 
correct 
the 
underlying 
problems 
have 
been 
ongoing 
for 
several 
years 
without 
reaching 
a 
conclusion 
as 
a 
result 
of 
insufficient 
political 
support 
and 
social 
consensus. 
The 
Government 
now 
faces 
a 
particularly 
difficult 
challenge: 
increasing 
demands 
for 
social 
assistance 
in 
the 
context 
of 
falling 
fiscal 
resources 
and 
extremely 
limited 
administrative 
Many 
of 
these 
social 
problems 
have 
existed 
before 
in 
Argentina. 
While 
there 
is 
no 
updated 
aggregate 
official 
data 
that 
would allow 
to 
determine 
the 
extent to 
which 
there 
has 
been 
a 
deterioration 
in 
infant 
mortality 
and 
malnutrition, 
evidence 
of 
serious 
child 
malnutrition 
(and 
a 
failure 
of 
existing 
programs 
to 
identify 
those 
cases 
in 
time) 
has 
emerged 
recently 
in 
several 
provinces 
raising 
the 
concern 
that, 
if 
left 
unattended, 
this 
could 
develop 
into 
a 
graver 
health 
emergency. 
The 
interruption 
of 
the 
educational 
process 
has 
a 
strong impact on 
students' 
learning 
processes. 
The 
abandonment 
of 
the 
"school 
routine", 
the 
fewer school 
days, 
the 
impossibility 
to consolidate 
and 
correct 
learning, 
the 
tension 
in 
the 
relationship 
of 
schools 
with 
families, 
are 
all 
factors 
that 
seriously affect 
schooling 
attainments. The 
responses 
to 
these 
situations 
has 
led 
some 
school 
systems 
to 
lower 
academic 
requirements 
by 
promoting 
students 
who 
have 
not 
reached 
the 
minimum level 
for 
each 
grade/ 
year.

capabilities 
to 
innovate 
and 
coordinate 
responses. 
Nevertheless, 
recognizing 
the 
seriousness 
of 
the 
social situation, 
the 
government 
has 
moved 
decisively 
to 
expand 
key 
safety 
net 
programs, 
including 
the 
Heads 
of 
Household 
program, 
prioritizing 
spending 
on 
them 
and 
consolidating social 
programs around 
a 
smaller 
number 
of 
key 
initiatives. 
In 
addition, 
the 
recent 
creation 
of 
the 
National 
Coordination 
Council 
for 
Social 
Policies 
constitutes 
an 
important 
step 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
improving 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
social 
policies 
as 
it 
allows 
for 
better 
coordination 
among 
the 
various 
actors 
at 
the 
national 
level 
and 
between 
different jurisdictions. 
16. 
To 
meet 
the 
challenge 
of 
a 
deteriorating social 
environment, 
the 
government 
has 
launched 
a 
Social 
Emergency 
Program. 
The 
Bank, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
IDB, 
have 
been 
actively 
supporting 
this 
program 
with 
an 
initial 
reallocation 
of 
US$105.9 
million 
from 
ongoing 
health 
and 
education 
operations, 
followed 
by 
recent 
Board 
approval 
(October 
15, 
2002) 
of 
the 
reformulation 
of 
other 
ongoing Bank 
investment loans 
to provide 
a 
further 
US$141 
million 
to 
cover 
emergency 
needs 
for 
2003. 
Further 
support 
for 
the 
social 
emergency 
program 
from 
the 
Bank 
includes 
the 
recently 
approved 
Jefes 
de 
Hogar 
(Heads 
of 
Household) 
Program Project 
to 
support 
workfare 
programs.

Part 
I1 
- 
Implementation 
of 
the 
Program 
and 
Proposed 
Restructuring 
17. 
Cordoba’s 
reform 
program 
was 
designed 
to improve 
its 
competitive position 
in 
the 
global 
economy 
and 
lay 
the 
basis 
for 
sustained 
growth through 
an 
ambitious program 
to stabilize 
government 
finances, 
improve 
public 
services, and 
strengthen 
human 
capital 
formation. 
The 
vision 
is 
to 
create 
a 
model 
provincial 
administration 
by 
redefining 
the 
state-reducing 
the 
size 
and 
tax burden 
of 
government, 
redirecting 
its 
efforts 
more 
to 
the 
social 
sectors, 
and 
improving 
the 
efficiency 
and 
transparency 
of 
its 
services 
to 
citizens. 
The 
program, 
a 
combination 
of 
first 
and second 
generation reforms, 
has 
three 
main 
components: 
(i) 
strengthening 
public 
finances 
(including 
privatization 
or concessioning 
of 
several 
state 
enterprises, 
tax 
reduction 
accompanied 
by 
strengthened 
tax 
administration, pension reform, 
a 
clean 
up 
of 
municipal 
finances, 
and 
debt 
reduction): 
(ii) 
modernizing 
public 
administration (including 
reforms 
in 
financial 
management, 
civil 
service, 
and 
business 
processes 
and 
organizational 
structure); 
and 
(iii) 
social 
sector 
reform 
(health, 
education, 
and 
social protection). 
As 
indicated 
in 
the 
Letter 
of 
Provincial 
Reform 
in 
Annex 
A 
(the 
Revised 
Program), 
the 
Provincial 
government 
remains 
committed to 
a 
revised 
reform 
program 
and 
has 
made 
major efforts 
to 
advance 
it. 
18. 
In 
support 
of 
Cordoba’s 
program 
the 
Board 
approved 
in 
November 
2000 
a 
$303 
million 
Provincial  Reform 
Loan 
(PRL). 
The 
Loan 
Agreement 
became 
effective 
on 
August 
2, 
2001. 
The 
first 
of 
three 
equal 
tranches 
was 
disbursed 
upon 
effectiveness.  The 
second 
tranche 
(called 
the 
“floating” 
tranche) 
was 
linked to 
sale 
of 
the 
Province’s 
bank 
and 
electricity 
company. 
The 
final 
third 
tranche 
was 
comprehensive 
and 
tied to 
a 
wide 
variety 
of 
public 
finance, 
public 
administration, 
and 
social 
sector 
reforms. 
In 
the 
event, 
disbursements 
of 
the 
last 
two 
tranches 
were 
interrupted 
due 
to 
the 
macroeconomic 
crisis 
in 
Argentina, collapse 
in 
investor 
interest 
in 
purchasing 
public 
enterprises, 
and 
a 
severe 
disruption 
in 
provincial fiscal 
results. 
As 
the 
loan’s 
overall 
objectives 
remain 
valid 
and 
8 
Page  11
feasible, 
if 
on 
a 
different 
timeframe, 
it 
is 
therefore 
proposed 
to 
restructure 
the 
loan to 
better 
reflect 
current 
circumstances 
and 
program 
advances. 
19. 
The 
proposed 
amendments 
would 
include 
two 
waivers 
and  amendments 
to 
specific 
conditions 
as 
well 
as 
a 
restructuring 
of 
tranches. 
The 
floating 
tranche 
would 
be 
amended 
and 
renamed 
as 
the 
second 
tranche, and 
the 
original 
final 
$100 
million 
tranche 
would 
be 
split 
in 
two. 
A 
new 
third 
tranche 
of 
$25 
million 
would 
include 
those 
conditions 
in 
the 
original 
final 
tranche 
that 
have 
been 
met, 
and 
thus 
would 
be 
eligible 
for 
disbursement. 
The 
fourth 
tranche 
of 
$75 
million 
would 
include 
those  targets, 
some 
amended, 
still 
under 
implementation. 
This 
proposed 
restructuring 
would 
take 
into 
account 
the  balance 
of 
payments  circumstances 
of 
Argentina, 
conform 
the 
revised 
program 
to 
current 
economic 
circumstances, 
and 
give  credit 
for 
program 
advances 
already achieved. 
The 
Province 
has 
complied 
with 
proposed 
second and 
third 
tranche 
conditions. 
To 
summarize, 
the 
new structure 
would 
be 
as 
follows: 
Second 
tranche: 
$100 
million; 
amended 
conditions 
relating to 
adherence 
to 
fiscal 
pact 
and 
restructuring 
programs 
for 
the 
provincial 
bank 
and 
electricity 
company, 
plus 
social protection 
funding; 
eligible for 
immediate 
disbursement. 
Third 
tranche: 
$25 
million;  original 
targets 
related 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
public 
finance, 
public 
administration, 
and 
social 
sector 
reform 
that 
have been 
met; 
eligible for 
immediate 
disbursement. 
Fourth 
tranche: 
$75 
million; 
original 
or 
amended 
targets 
in 
public 
finances 
including 
the 
provincial 
bank 
and 
electricity 
company, 
public 
administration, 
and 
social 
sector 
reform. 
20. 
The 
status 
of 
program 
implementation 
in 
major 
component 
areas 
is 
described 
below. 
The 
original 
and 
proposed 
waived 
and  amended 
conditions comprising 
the 
reformulated 
tranches 
are 
presented 
in 
detail 
in 
Annex 
B. 
A 
condition 
of 
disbursement 
for 
the 
second and 
third 
tranches 
is 
that 
the 
macro 
policy 
framework 
is 
satisfactory 
to 
the 
Bank 
and 
that 
the 
Bank 
is 
satisfied 
with 
the 
progress 
achieved 
by 
the 
Province 
in 
carrying 
out 
the 
revised 
program. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
macro situation, 
taking 
into 
account 
the 
results 
of 
the 
first 
review 
of Argentina's 
arrangement 
with 
the 
IMF 
just 
completed 
on 
March 
19, 
2003, 
on 
balance macroeconomic 
policies 
under 
the 
current 
transitional 
program 
appear 
overall 
adequate, 
even 
while 
there 
remain 
substantial 
uncertainties 
and 
challenges 
as 
well 
as 
major 
risks. 
As 
detailed 
below 
and 
in 
the 
Letter 
of 
Provincial 
Reform 
progress 
in 
carrying 
out 
the 
revised 
program 
by 
the 
Province 
is 
satisfactory. 
Strengthening 
Public Finance 
21. 
Macro-fiscal. 
There 
are 
three 
main 
provincial 
macro-fiscal 
areas 
of 
the 
current 
reform 
program 
of 
Cordoba 
that 
have 
been 
affected 
by 
the 
changes 
in 
the 
macroeconomic 
context: 
current 
surplus, 
fiscal 
balance, and 
debt stock. 
During 
the 
first 
half 
of 
2001 
fiscal 
targets were 
met, 
but 
in 
the 
second 
semester 
national 
macroeconomic 
and 
fiscal 
performance 
declined 
sharply, 
noticeably 
impacting 
the 
Province. 
Macro-fiscal 
targets 
were 
not 
met, 
and 
in 
light 
of 
emergency 
spending 
needs 
and 
to 
prevent 
a 
further 
collapse 
of 
the 
economy, 
the 
Province 
issued 
bonds (quasi money) 
equivalent 
to 
A$196 
million 
in 
9 
Page  12
2001 
and 
a 
further 
A$ 
600 
million 
in 
early 
2002. 
The 
Province 
points to 
the 
sharp 
deterioration 
in 
the 
national fiscal 
and 
macroeconomic 
situation 
as 
the 
primary 
cause 
for 
these 
results. 
Specific 
problems 
included 
a 
fall 
in 
revenues 
due 
to 
an 
economic 
contraction 
more 
rapid 
than 
any 
possible 
offsetting fiscal 
response, 
interruptions 
and 
unpredictability 
in 
federal 
revenue 
sharing 
aggravating 
the 
downward 
trend, 
urgent 
emergency 
spending 
to 
meet 
ballooning 
social 
needs 
and 
municipal 
crises, and 
continued 
high 
debt 
service 
payments 
as 
planned 
privatizations failed 
to 
materialize 
and 
interest 
rates 
soared. 
Between 
2001 
and 
2002 
the 
number 
of 
Cordobans 
below 
the 
extreme 
poverty 
line 
more 
than 
doubled 
to 
28 
percent 
and those 
below 
the 
poverty 
line 
rose 
from 
36 
to 
59 
percent 
and 
the 
estimated 
unemployment 
rate 
rose 
to  nearly 
20  percent. 
Cordoba, 
however, 
took 
measures 
to 
redress 
the 
situation 
by 
strengthening 
its 
own 
tax 
collection, continuing 
the 
freeze 
on nominal 
salaries 
of 
employees, 
reducing 
salaries 
of 
high 
officials, cutting capital 
investments, 
merging 
government 
agencies, 
and 
eliminating 
the 
upper  house 
of 
the 
legislature. 
In 
July 
2002, 
it 
signed 
a 
fiscal 
pact 
(Convenio 
Bilateral 
- 
Programa 
de 
Financiamiento 
Ordenado 
de 
las Finanzas 
Provinciales) 
with 
the 
federal 
government 
which 
called for, 
among other things, 
a 
50 
percent 
reduction 
in 
the 
2002 
deficit from 
its 
2001 level. 
The 
Province 
signed 
on February 
17, 
2003 
a 
fiscal 
pact 
for 
2003 
which 
essentially 
posits 
an 
overall 
balanced budget, 
with 
specific quarterly 
targets. 
These 
fiscal 
pacts, 
a 
pillar 
of 
the 
national stabilization 
effort 
and 
part 
of 
the 
overall 
agreement 
with 
the 
IMF, 
would 
replace 
the 
original  provincial 
macro-fiscal 
conditions.

The 
proposed 
amended 
macro-fiscal conditions 
would 
be 
as 
follows: 
Second 
Tranche: 
(a) 
Compliance 
with 
the 
2002 
Fiscal 
Pact 
including 
a 
reduction 
in 
its 
overall 
deficit 
of 
at 
least 
50 
percent 
as 
well 
as 
signing 
and 
legislative 
approval 
of 
the 
2003 
Fiscal 
Pact. 
The 
condition 
has 
been 
met 
as 
the 
Province 
cut 
its 
deficit 
by 
nearly 
60 
percent 
in 
2002 
and 
the 
legislature 
has 
approved 
the 
2003 
Fiscal 
Pact;  (b) 
as 
the 
Province failed to 
attain 
the 
agreed 
target 
for 
a 
current 
surplus, 
this 
condition 
has 
not 
been 
met 
and 
a 
waiver 
is 
requested. 
Fourth 
Tranche: 
Compliance 
with 
the 
quarterly 
targets 
of 
the 
2003 
Fiscal 
Pact 
for 
the 
period immediately preceding 
the 
fourth 
tranche 
release 
date. 
Original 
conditions relating to 
the 
attainment 
of 
the 
agreed 
targets 
of 
a 
public 
sector 
deficit 
and 
public 
sector 
debt 
will 
not 
be 
met 
and 
would 
be 
eliminated 
10

Privatization 
and 
Outsourcing. 
Cordoba 
sought 
to 
publicly 
tender 
its 
electric 
distribution 
company 
as 
well 
as 
its 
public 
bank 
as 
floating 
tranche 
conditions. 
A 
privatization 
law 
satisfactory 
to 
the 
Bank 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
Legislature, 
a 
power 
sector 
regulatory 
agency  was 
established, 
appropriate 
bidding 
documents 
in 
line 
with 
World 
Bank 
procurement 
guidelines 
were 
issued, 
technical 
support 
by 
international 
investment 
banking 
and 
consulting 
firms 
were 
secured, 
and 
the 
process 
of 
developing 
international investor 
interest 
advanced 
well 
during 
2000 
and 
early 
2001. 
The 
sharp 
and 
unanticipated 
fall 
in 
market 
confidence 
in 
mid 
2001, 
however, 
has 
forced 
an 
adjustment 
in 
this 
element 
of 
the 
reform 
program. 
While 
a 
winning 
bidder 
for 
the 
provincial 
bank 
was 
selected, 
a 
sales 
contract 
was 
not 
signed; 
similarly 
while 
bid 
documents 
for 
the 
electricity 
company 
were 
provided  to 
requesting  interested 
parties 
no 
offers 
were 
forthcoming. 
Nevertheless, 
the 
Province 
remains 
committed to 
its 
fundamental goal 
of 
increasing 
the 
role 
of 
private  capital 
in 
these 
sectors. 
BPC 
is 
now 
under 
new 
management (one 
with 
extensive 
experience 
in 
private 
sector 
banking) 
and 
it 
is 
seeking 
to 
stabilize 
its 
finances 
and 
improve 
its 
performance 
with 
the 
aim 
of 
increasing 
its 
marketability  pending 
improvement 
in 
the 
investment 
climate. 
The 
Province 
is 
also 
seeking 
to 
improve 
the 
efficiency 
of 
the 
electric 
power 
utility 
until 
market 
conditions 
allow 
resuming 
the 
effort 
to 
incorporate 
private capital 
into 
the 
sector. 
The 
specific 
conditions 
and 
tranching 
for 
these 
two 
entities 
would 
be 
amended 
as 
follows: 
Provincial Bank 
of 
Cordoba 
(BPC) 
Second 
Tranche: 
(i) 
BPC 
has 
employed 
a 
consulting 
firm 
under 
terms 
of 
reference 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank 
to 
conduct 
a 
comprehensive 
financial 
operational 
and 
institutional 
diagnostic; 
(ii) 
the 
Central 
Bank 
of 
Argentina 
has 
provided to 
BPC preliminary 
guidance 
on adjusting 
and 
carrying 
out 
the 
Regularization 
and 
Financial 
Strengthening 
Plan; 
and 
(iii) 
BPC 
has 
initiated 
a 
process 
to 
employ 
a 
firm 
to 
manage 
its 
residual 
(bad) 
assets. 
This 
condition 
has 
been 
met. 
Fourth 
Tranche: 
(i) 
BPC 
has 
submitted 
to 
the 
Central 
Bank 
a 
revised 
Regularization 
and 
Financing 
Plan 
based 
on 
the 
results 
of 
the 
diagnostic 
of 
an 
external 
firm 
and 
recommendations 
of 
the 
Superintendency 
of 
Banks; 
(ii) 
the 
Central 
Bank 
has 
approved 
the 
revised 
Plan 
and 
BPC 
is 
implementing 
the 
Plan; 
and 
(iii) 
a 
firm 
has 
been 
selected 
and 
initiated 
operations 
to 
manage 
BPC’s 
residual 
assets. 
Electricity 
Company 
(EPEC) 
Second 
Tranche: 
(i) 
the 
legislature 
has 
approved 
new 
by-laws which 
provide 
EPEC 
to 
enter 
into 
periodic 
performance  contracts 
with 
the 
Province; 
(ii) 
concession 
contracts 
have 
been 
granted 
to 
at 
least 
50 
percent 
of 
the 
private 
electric 
cooperatives registered 
in 
the 
Province; 
(iv) 
a 
special 
environmental 
unit 
has 
been 
established 
and 
fully 
staffed; 
and 
(vi) 
a 
fully 
functioning 
power 
sector 
regulatory 
public 
agency 
created, 
staffed, 
and 
operating. 
These 
conditions 
have 
been 
met. 
11 
Page  14
Fourth 
Tranche: 
(i) 
the 
environmental 
unit 
of 
EPEC 
has 
completed 
an 
environmental 
assessment 
and 
prepared 
a 
time-bound action 
plan to 
implement 
mitigating 
measures; 
(ii) 
the 
regulatory 
agency 
is 
implementing 
a 
plan 
to 
gradually 
adjust 
the 
structure 
of 
EPEC’s 
electricity 
tariffs 
and 
has 
issued 
regulations 
on 
service 
obligations 
in 
the 
power 
sector; 
(iii) 
EPEC 
has 
signed 
a 
performance 
contract 
to improve 
its 
operational 
performance; 
and 
(iv) 
concession 
contracts 
have 
been 
granted 
to 
all 
private electric 
cooperatives 
registered 
in 
the 
Province. 
23. 
In 
the 
area 
of 
tax administration 
nearly 
all 
programs 
have 
been 
implemented. 
Despite 
these 
reforms, however, 
overall collection 
of 
provincial 
revenue 
has 
fallen 
below 
the 
original 
targets, 
which 
is 
not surprising given 
the 
severe 
recession.  The 
Province’s 
program 
of 
tax 
audit 
was 
undermined 
in 
2001 
and 
early 
2002 
by 
the 
crisis 
which 
impacted 
both 
the 
climate 
for 
conducting 
field 
audits 
as 
well 
as 
the 
availability 
of 
budget 
resources. 
Since 
mid 
2002 
the 
Province 
has 
been 
able 
to 
undertake 
a 
concerted 
effort 
to 
improve 
tax 
auditing, 
and 
overall 
the 
results 
of 
its 
tax 
effort 
have exceeded 
that 
of 
the 
national 
government. 
Although 
an 
IDB 
project to 
support 
an 
ambitious program 
to 
strengthen 
municipal 
finances 
was 
cancelled 
in 
part 
due 
to 
severe 
constraints 
on 
counterpart 
funds, 
the 
government instead 
is 
implementing 
a 
scaled 
down program 
of 
self-financed 
technical 
assistance and 
training 
to 
groupings 
of 
municipalities 
to 
support 
the 
most 
critical 
tax, 
cadastre,  and 
financial 
management 
improvements. 
The 
proposed 
third 
tranche 
conditions 
are 
comprised 
of 
original 
targets 
that 
have been 
met, 
while 
the 
fourth 
tranche 
conditions 
are 
amended 
and/or 
still 
in 
implementation: 
Third 
Tranche: 
(i) 
reconciliation 
of 
reported 
tax 
payments 
and 
reporting 
bank 
statements; 
(ii) 
single 
taxpayer 
identification 
code system 
(CUIT) 
operational; 
(iii) 
special 
system 
to  monitor 
tax 
returning 
filing 
and 
payments 
by 
large 
taxpayers 
functioning; 
(iv) 
system 
in 
operation 
to 
use 
the 
CUIT 
system 
to 
identify 
property 
owners; 
and  (v) 
two 
thirds 
of 
all 
properties 
are 
registered 
in 
a 
computerized 
data 
base. 
These 
conditions 
have 
been 
met. 
Fourth 
Tranche: 
(i) 
provincial 
tax 
collection running 
at 
least 
2 
percent 
higher 
than 
national 
tax 
collection 
based 
on 
a 
1999 
index 
base; 
(ii) 
adherence 
to 
the 
2003 
tax 
audit 
plan; 
(iii) 
no 
provincial 
tax 
amnesties 
have 
been 
provided 
since 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
program; 
and 
(iv)  municipalities 
would 
be 
grouped 
as 
legal 
entities 
and 
the 
Province 
would 
provide 
training 
to 
them 
on 
tax 
collection, 
the 
provision 
of 
core 
public 
services, 
and 
cadastre 
harmonization activities. 
Modernizing 
Public Administration 
24. 
The 
bulk 
of 
programmed 
reforms 
in 
financial 
management, 
civil 
service, 
organizational reform, 
and 
transparency have 
been 
met. 
A 
modern financial 
management 
law 
has 
been 
approved 
and 
the 
FY2003 
budget 
was 
prepared 
with 
an 
information 
technology 
based 
system 
in 
line 
with 
the 
legislation. 
The 
government 
is 
preparing 
a 
bill 
to improve 
the 
public 
procurement 
law 
in 
line 
with 
the 
principles 
of 
the 
new federal 
procurement 
legislation. 
A 
census 
has 
been 
completed 
on 
public 
employees, 
new 
hiring 
strongly 
regulated, 
employment 
policies 
revised, 
and 
training 
programs 
strengthened. 
12 
Page  15
The 
number 
of 
permanent 
staff 
authorized 
in 
the 
budget 
has 
fallen 
by 
6 
percent 
from 
67,578 
in 
2001 
to 
63, 
503 
in 
2003. 
Both 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Solidarity 
(transformed 
into 
the 
Cordoba 
Solidarity 
Agency) 
and 
Ministry 
of 
Production 
and 
Finance 
(formerly 
Ministry 
of 
Production, 
and 
Ministry 
of 
Finance) 
are 
undergoing restructuring. 
The 
government 
is 
developing 
a program 
to 
explicitly 
address 
corruption 
(and 
complement 
the 
above 
actions 
in 
financial 
management)  and 
is 
preparing 
a 
diagnosis 
and 
action 
plan. 
It 
has 
also 
reduced 
the 
number 
of 
ministries 
and agencies 
(from 
eight 
ministries to 
four, 
and 
five 
agencies 
to 
four), 
and 
actively 
supported 
the 
public’s 
approval 
through 
a 
referendum 
of 
a 
reduction 
in 
the 
legislature 
to 
one 
house 
(reducing 
the 
number 
of 
legislators 
from 
136 to 
70 
at 
the 
same 
time). 
The 
proposed 
third 
tranche 
conditions 
are 
comprised 
of 
original 
targets 
that 
have 
been 
met, 
while 
the 
fourth 
tranche 
conditions 
are 
amended 
and/or 
still 
in 
implementation: 
Third 
Tranche: 
(i) 
a 
civil 
service 
census 
completed; 
(ii) 
ceilings 
on 
filling 
vacancies 
observed; 
(iii) 
review 
of 
civil 
service 
policies 
conducted; 
and 
(iv) 
an 
expanded 
training program 
implemented. 
These 
conditions 
have 
been 
met. 
Fourth 
Tranche: 
(i) 
an 
action plan  to 
combat 
corruption 
will 
be 
prepared, 
announced, and 
undertaken; 
(ii) 
a 
new 
procurement 
law 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank 
will 
be 
submitted 
to 
the 
legislature; 
and 
(iii) 
an 
action  plan 
to 
modernize 
administration 
of 
the 
Province’s  Cordoba 
Solidarity 
Agency 
and 
Ministry 
of 
Production 
and 
Finance 
has 
been agreed 
to 
and 
is 
under 
implementation. 
Social Sector 
Reform 
25. 
The 
combined 
fiscal 
and 
social 
crisis 
hitting 
Cordoba 
has 
unsurprisingly 
affected 
its 
social 
sector 
reform 
program. 
The 
targets 
for 
maintaining 
(as 
a 
minimum) 
the 
level 
and 
flow 
of 
resources 
for 
social protection 
have been and 
continue 
to 
be 
exceeded, 
the 
goal 
set 
for 
registering 
beneficiaries 
has 
been 
fully 
met, 
and 
an 
assessment 
of 
the 
Province’s 
basket 
of 
social protection 
programs completed. 
The 
strengthening 
of 
the 
safety 
net 
in 
response 
to 
the 
social 
and 
economic 
crisis 
during 
2002 
was 
led 
and 
financed 
largely 
by 
the 
national 
government. 
This 
included 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
Heads 
of 
Household 
Program, 
a 
large-scale 
effort 
to provide social 
assistance 
to 
a 
large 
number 
of 
families 
at 
risk. 
This 
is 
a 
workfare program 
directed 
at 
households 
containing children 
under 
the 
age 
of 
18 
and whose 
head 
is 
unemployed. 
In 
exchange 
for 
a 
transfer 
of 
150 
Argentine 
pesodmonth, 
the 
participants 
must 
participate 
in 
workfare or 
eligible training 
activities. 
As 
of 
early 
2002, 
the 
Program 
was 
paying nearly 
2 
million 
beneficiaries 
throughout 
the 
country. 
The 
national 
government 
also increased 
spending 
on 
feeding 
programs. 
This 
included 
both block 
grants 
to 
provinces, 
as 
well 
as 
expanded 
funding for 
school  feeding 
and 
for 
soup 
kitchens, 
mainly 
serving 
children, 
operated 
by 
non- 
governmental 
organizations 
and 
community 
groups. 
Both 
the 
Heads 
of 
Household 
Program 
and 
the 
feeding  programs 
operated 
by 
non-governmental 
groups 
are 
being 
supported 
by 
the 
World 
Bank. 
The 
proposed 
third 
tranche 
conditions 
are 
comprised 
of 
original 
targets 
that 
have 
been 
met, 
while 
the 
fourth 
tranche 
conditions 
are 
amended 
and/or 
still 
in 
implementation:

Second 
Tranche: 
Stipulated 
budget 
funding 
for 
social protection activities 
of 
the 
Province. 
This 
condition 
has 
been

Third 
Tranche: 
(i) 
completing 
an 
assessment 
of 
its 
core 
social

of 
beneficiaries. 
These

for 
social protection activities 
of 
the 
Province. 
26. 
In 
health 
the 
government 
designed 
a 
program aimed 
at 
strengthening 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health, 
restructuring 
health 
care 
financing, 
and 
improving 
the 
equity, 
efficiency 
and 
quality 
of 
the 
operations 
of 
public 
hospitals. 
The 
agreed 
allocation 
of 
nominal 
resources 
within 
the 
health 
envelope 
was 
met, 
although 
maintaining overall 
spending 
in 
real 
terms 
became 
impossible 
in 
light 
of 
the 
rapid growth 
in 
inflation 
following 
the 
devaluation. 
An 
independent 
evaluation 
of 
public 
hospitals 
has 
been 
contracted 
to 
confirm 
the 
achievement 
of 
several 
performance 
indicators. 
All 
hospital 
administrators 
have 
finished 
the 
administrative training 
program, 
and 
initiatives 
have 
been 
successful 
in 
improving 
medical 
equipment  procurement, 
monitoring 
the 
quality 
of 
hospital 
services, 
and 
activation 
of 
an 
internet 
based 
system 
for 
citizens 
to 
monitor 
performance 
data 
of 
health 
care 
providers. 
The 
identification 
and 
billing of 
patients 
has 
improved 
as 
planned, 
even 
though 
bill 
collections 
from 
patients 
who 
are 
members 
of 
“Obras 
Sociales” 
failed 
to 
meet 
the 
target 
of 
40 
percent 
as 
these 
insurance 
funds 
faced 
financial 
drains 
and 
essentially 
stopped 
paying 
public 
hospitals. 
A 
field 
study/survey 
of 
public 
sector 
hospitals 
will 
be 
conducted 
although 
due 
to 
budget constraints 
a 
second 
will 
be 
postponed. 
A 
study 
of 
hospital 
budget 
planning 
has 
been 
completed. 
The 
recommended 
move 
to 
a 
decentralized 
demand 
driven 
system 
will 
remain 
as 
a 
priority 
once 
budget 
circumstances 
permit. 
In 
light 
of 
the 
budget 
crisis 
and 
emerging 
policy 
concerns about the 
sustainability 
of 
such 
a 
program 
the 
Province 
was 
unable 
to 
pilot 
a 
universal 
health 
care 
scheme 
and 
this 
condition 
would 
be 
waived. 
The 
proposed 
third 
tranche 
conditions 
are 
comprised 
of 
original 
targets 
that 
have 
been 
met, 
while 
the 
fourth 
tranche 
conditions 
are 
amended 
and/or 
still 
in 
implementation: 
Third 
Tranche: 
(i) 
performance 
indicators 
and 
benchmarks established 
for 
all 
public 
hospitals; 
and 
(ii) 
IPAM 
(the 
Province’s 
health 
insurance 
agency) 
is 
implementing 
an 
integrated 
health 
care 
network. 
These 
conditions 
have 
been 
met. 
Implementation 
of 
a 
pilot 
universal 
public 
insurance 
scheme 
is 
not 
met 
and 
a 
waiver 
is 
requested. 
Fourth 
Tranche: 
(i) 
the 
size 
and 
distribution 
of 
the 
health 
budget 
is 
maintained 
at 
least 
in 
nominal 
terms 
(and 
a 
specified 
floor for  public 
health 
and 
ceiling for 
personnel salary 
and 
benefits 
is 
respected); 
(ii) 
independent 
evaluation 
of 
public 
hospitals confirms 
attainment 
for 
at 
least 
two 
continuous months 
of 
specified 
indicators 
of 
quality 
assurance 
affecting  patient 
care; 
(iii) 
for 
at 
least 
six 
continuous months 
all 
public 
hospital 
patients 
have 
been 
identified, 
those 
without 
insurance 
have 
been 
registered 
in 
a 
central 
data 
base, 
hospitals 
have 
been 
issuing 
invoices 
for 
all 
patients 
covered 
by 
insurance 
or pre-paid 
health 
plans 
and have 
14 
Page  17
collected 
at 
least 
15 
percent of 
payments 
due; 
(iv) 
at 
least 
one 
independent 
field 
study or 
survey 
on discrimination 
against 
the 
uninsured 
has 
been 
conducted 
and 
made 
publicly 
available;  (v) 
a 
study 
on 
hospital 
budget 
planning 
has 
been 
completed 
and 
an 
action  plan  to 
establish 
a 
demand  based 
budget 
system 
prepared; 
hospital 
staff 
training 
and 
personnel 
management 
modifications 
completed; 
(vi) 
IPAM 
has 
prepared 
and made 
public 
audited 
financial 
statements 
of 
its 
operations, 
which 
show 
that 
expenditures 
are 
not 
exceeding 
its 
revenues; 
(vii) 
IPAM 
is 
regularly issuing findings 
on 
its 
health 
care 
quality; 
(viii) 
the 
Province’s 
medical 
equipment 
purchase 
control 
system 
is 
functioning properly; 
(ix) 
the 
Health 
Ministry’s 
Customer  Service 
Office 
has 
evaluated 
hospitals’ 
customer service 
centers 
and 
is 
making 
public 
the 
results 
of 
user 
satisfaction 
surveys; 
and 
(x) 
an 
accreditation 
system 
for 
all 
health 
service 
facilities 
in 
the 
Province 
is 
operating 
with 
public 
access 
to 
a 
regularly 
updated 
database. 
27. 
The 
program 
to 
support 
reforms 
in 
education 
to 
enhance 
quality 
and 
increase 
efficiency 
and 
equity 
remains 
largely 
on 
track 
and 
compliance 
is 
expected 
for 
the 
bulk 
of 
its 
conditions.  Accomplishments 
to 
date 
include 
evaluations 
of 
teacher 
training 
institutes 
and 
private 
schools 
and 
their 
use 
in 
accreditation 
decisions. 
The 
Province 
is 
implementing 
the 
application 
of 
a 
modem 
information 
technology 
system 
to 
better 
control 
human 
resources and 
better 
account 
for 
teacher 
absenteeism, 
increasing 
relative 
spending 
on 
construction 
and 
maintenance, 
and 
developing 
new 
instruments 
for 
decentralized school 
administration 
for 
the 
provision 
of 
books, equipment, 
training, 
and 
maintenance 
services 
to 
school 
buildings. 
It 
has 
made 
adjustments 
in 
processes 
and 
procedures, 
and 
has 
improved tracking 
of 
student 
performance 
aiming 
to 
help 
identify 
problems 
earlier 
so 
as 
to 
reduce 
repetition 
and 
dropout 
rates. 
On 
the 
other 
hand Cordoba 
has 
not 
yet 
been 
able 
to 
reach 
the 
agreed 
reduced 
teacherhtudent 
ratio 
in 
part 
because 
an 
ongoing 
school 
construction 
program 
necessarily 
led 
to 
the 
hiring 
of 
some 
teachers. 
Reducing 
teacher 
absenteeism 
is 
a 
primary  goal 
and 
the 
govemment 
instituted 
an 
innovative 
system 
to monitor, verify, 
and 
ultimately 
reduce 
absences 
due 
to 
sickness. 
The 
overall 
rate 
has 
yet 
to 
fall 
because 
teachers 
have 
increased 
training 
days 
in 
response 
to 
the 
need 
to 
meet 
more 
difficult 
licensing 
requirements. 
The 
Province 
is 
completing 
a 
comprehensive 
study 
of 
student 
assignments 
to 
schools 
and 
enrollment totals 
which 
will 
also 
provide information 
for 
adjustments 
in 
resource 
and teacher 
allocation. 
Also, 
while 
the 
Province 
completed 
an 
evaluation 
of 
Cordoba’s 
education  performance 
and 
disseminated 
the 
results, 
it 
could not 
simultaneously 
publish 
a 
comparison 
with 
OECD 
indicators 
as 
this 
information 
was 
not provided 
as 
required 
by 
federal authorities. 
The 
proposed 
third 
tranche 
conditions 
are 
comprised 
of 
original 
targets 
that 
have 
been 
met, 
while 
the 
fourth 
tranche 
conditions 
are 
amended 
and/or 
still 
in 
implementation: 
Third 
Tranche: 
(i) 
specified 
student/section 
ratio for 
the 
Specialization 
Cycle 
of 
public 
secondary 
schools 
in 
urban 
areas 
achieved; 
and 
(ii) 
publicly 
funded 
teacher 
training 
institutes 
evaluated 
with 
results 
published 
and 
accreditation 
linked 
to 
agreed 
guidelines. 
These 
conditions 
have 
been 
met. 
Fourth 
Tranche: 
(i) 
a 
unified 
computerized 
personnel 
registry 
and 
single 
file 
for 
individual 
teachers 
fully 
established; 
(ii) 
a 
time-bound action plan 
prepared 
to 
attain 
a 
new 
student/teacher 
ratio 
in 
urban 
primary 
schools; 
(iii) 
a 
study 
evaluating

the 
privatized 
system 
of 
medical monitoring 
of 
teachers 
completed 
as 
well 
as

education  reforms; 
(iv) 
education 
budget 
approved 
with 
no 
less 
than 
ten 
percent to 
capital 
investment, 
no 
more 
than 
92 
percent 
of 
all 
recurrent expenditures 
to 
personnel 
salary 
and 
benefits; 
and 
all 
maintenance 
and 
consumable 
school 
supply 
expenditures 
self-administered 
by 
schools.; 
(v) 
reduction 
in 
teacher 
absenteeism 
due 
to 
sickness 
to 
no 
more 
than 
80 
percent 
of 
its 
2000 
rate; 
(vi) 
an 
assessment 
of 
the 
Province’s  educational 
performance 
completed 
and 
publicly 
disseminated; 
(vii) 
a 
student 
performance 
monitoring 
system 
created 
in 
at 
least 
400 
schools 
and 
dropout 
and 
repetition 
rates 
cut 
by 
25 
percent 
each 
from 
their 
1999 
levels; 
and 
(viii) 
at 
least 
30 
percent 
of 
publicly 
funded 
private 
schools 
are 
evaluated 
with 
results 
published 
and 
public 
subsidies adjusted 
in 
line 
with 
the 
results. 
28. 
As 
a 
fourth 
tranche 
is 
being 
created, 
the 
sub-loan 
agreement 
between 
the 
federal 
government 
and 
the 
Province 
will 
be 
amended. 
That 
amendment 
will 
be 
a 
condition 
of 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
Legal 
Amendment 
with 
the 
Bank. 
Part 
111 
- 
Benefits 
and 
Risks 
29. 
The 
main 
benefit 
would 
be 
in 
maintaining 
and 
advancing 
reforms 
in 
public 
finances, 
public 
administration, 
as 
well 
as 
in 
the 
social 
sectors, 
where 
90 
percent 
of 
health 
and 
basic education 
are 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
Cordoba government. 
It 
would 
support 
the 
government’s 
efforts to 
adapt 
to 
the 
changed 
macro-economic 
circumstances 
and advance 
toward 
the 
goal 
of 
privatizing 
the 
provincial 
bank 
and 
increasing private 
sector 
funding 
in 
the 
electricity 
company 
despite 
the 
changed 
environment 
by 
strengthening 
their 
operations 
pending improvement 
in 
market 
conditions. 
The 
reforms 
under 
implementation 
in 
the 
social 
sectors 
represent 
important 
steps 
toward 
strengthening 
the 
efficiency 
and 
effectiveness 
of 
government 
interventions 
in 
those 
areas 
at 
a 
crucial 
time. 
Beyond 
Cordoba, 
this 
program 
will 
contribute 
to 
consolidate 
the 
incipient 
economic 
recovery 
and 
enhance 
the 
conditions 
for 
the 
continuation 
of 
a 
longer-term 
reform 
program 
in 
Argentina. 
30. 
Even 
with 
the 
proposed 
amendment 
the 
Province may 
fail 
to 
meet 
its 
reform 
goals, 
either 
because 
of 
a 
lack 
of 
commitment 
or 
a 
further 
deterioration 
in 
the 
macroeconomic 
and 
social 
environment. 
A 
related 
risk 
is 
that, 
while 
a 
provincial 
government 
is 
able 
to 
meet 
its 
reform 
commitments, 
the 
Federal 
government 
may 
fail 
to 
maintain 
a 
satisfactory  macroeconomic 
framework 
or 
subsequently  deviates 
from 
an 
agreed 
program. 
Third, 
uncertainties related 
to 
the 
upcoming presidential 
as 
well 
as 
Provincial 
elections 
pose 
a 
risk 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
program. 
Beyond 
these 
risks, 
a 
continued 
economic 
slow 
down, 
including 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
general 
world 
economy 
and 
the 
war 
in 
Iraq, 
would 
also present 
serious 
risks 
to 
the 
fragile 
macroeconomic 
situation. 
Mitigating 
these 
risks 
is 
the 
commitment 
by 
the 
provinces 
including 
Cordoba 
to 
reduce 
the 
overall 
provincial  deficit 
and 
produce 
sustained 
primary 
surpluses. 
The 
much 
better 
than 
anticipated performance 
in 
2002 
by 
the 
provinces 
and 
their 
commitment 
to 
implement 
the 
2003 
targets 
are 
hopeful 
signs 
that 
they 
will 
carry out 
the 
2003 
agreements. 
There 
are 
several 
substantial 
risks.

: 
Letter 
of 
Provincial 
Reform 
(translation) 
Cordoba, 
March 
3 
1,2003 
Mr. 
James 
D. 
Wolfensohn 
President 
of 
the 
World 
Bank 
Dear 
Mr. 
Wolfensohn: 
1. 
This letter 
provides 
a 
summary 
of 
the 
political, 
economic, 
and 
social 
situation 
that 
has 
affected 
our  province 
over 
the 
last 
two 
years, 
the 
progress 
achieved 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
our 
reform 
program  supported 
by 
the 
Cordoba 
Provincial 
Reform 
Loan, 
and 
our commitment 
to 
carry 
out 
the 
revised 
reform 
Program 
as 
described 
below. 
2. 
On 
assuming 
office 
as 
Governor 
of 
Cordoba 
on 
July 
12, 
1999, 
I 
did 
so 
with 
the 
conviction 
that 
major 
changes 
would 
be 
necessary 
in 
order 
to 
modernize 
the 
province 
and 
lay 
the 
groundwork 
for 
sustainable 
economic 
growth 
and social development. 
The 
most 
important component 
of 
this 
program 
was 
to 
change 
relations 
between 
citizens 
and 
the 
state, 
and 
to 
use 
this 
new relationship 
as 
the catalyst 
for 
a 
far-reaching 
modernization 
process 
of 
institutions 
that 
would 
pave 
the 
way 
for 
better 
services 
to 
be provided 
to 
the 
people. 
3. 
Today, 
after 
three 
and a 
half 
years, 
I 
can 
say 
that 
it 
was 
possible 
to 
implement 
a 
number 
of 
important 
changes 
which 
will, without 
a 
doubt, establish 
the 
foundation 
for 
a 
better 
future 
for 
the province. 
However, 
I 
must 
also 
say 
that 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
major 
political, 
social,  and economic 
problems that 
Argentina 
has 
experienced, 
fulfillment 
of 
our objectives 
has 
been 
delayed. 
Despite 
this, 
we 
never 
strayed 
from 
the course 
that 
we 
charted; we 
merely 
suffered 
setbacks 
that 
we 
hope 
to 
overcome 
in 
the 
months 
ahead. 
The 
Crisis 
4. 
As 
you 
know 
1998 
marked 
the 
beginning 
of 
one 
the 
most 
protracted 
and 
severe 
economic 
crises 
in 
Argentina's 
history, and 
this 
crisis 
worsened 
in 
2001. 
A 
number 
of 
external 
shocks 
had 
a 
very 
negative 
impact 
on 
the 
productive 
activities 
of 
the 
country. 
Some 
of 
these 
external 
shocks, 
such 
as 
the 
devaluation 
of 
the 
Brazilian 
currency, 
took 
a 
particularly 
heavy 
toll 
on 
the 
traditional 
exports 
of 
Cordoba, 
and 
in 
general, 
on 
its 
most 
important 
productive 
activities. 
5. 
A 
host 
of 
serious and 
unanticipated 
problems 
also 
emerged 
in 
the 
political 
and 
institutional 
spheres. 
Many 
misguided 
decisions 
at 
the 
national 
level 
led 
to 
a 
recession 
that many 
thought 
would 
prove 
fleeting, 
but 
which 
turned 
out to 
be 
truly 
disastrous 
from 
18 
Page  22
an 
economic, 
social, 
and 
institutional 
standpoint, 
amounting 
to 
a 
veritable  fiasco. 
Naturally, 
this 
situation 
spawned greater 
ills, 
ranging 
from 
the  chaotic 
cessation 
of 
international 
debt payments 
to 
the free 
fall 
of 
the 
peso 
and 
the 
descent 
into 
poverty 
of 
almost 
half 
of 
Argentine 
households. 
6. 
on 
time: 
Due 
to 
these 
developments Cordoba 
was 
unable 
to 
achieve 
a 
number 
of 
our 
goals 
Unanticipated 
revenue shortfalls: 
the 
combination 
of 
falling 
economic 
activity 
and 
disruptions 
in 
federal  revenue 
sharing 
emerged 
during 
the 
2001  fiscal 
year, 
particularly 
during 
the 
second 
semester. 
A 
dearth 
of 
international 
credit: 
recurring fiscal 
imbalances 
at 
the 
national 
level 
created 
the 
impression 
among  external  creditors  that 
Argentina 
could  not 
meet 
its 
international 
commitments, 
and 
credit 
became 
increasingly restricted 
until 
it 
was 
reduced 
to 
zero. 
In 
a national 
context, 
this 
made 
it 
impossible 
to 
refinance 
maturing 
debt, 
with 
the 
attendant 
loss 
of 
reserves. 
Loss 
of 
confidence 
at 
the 
domestic 
level: 
the 
loss 
of 
reserves, 
which 
pushed 
risk 
indicators 
into 
the 
number 
one 
position 
at 
the 
global 
level, 
also 
led 
to 
a 
loss 
of 
confidence 
on 
the part 
of 
savers 
in 
the 
financial 
system. 
They 
began 
to 
withdraw 
their 
money 
from 
banks, 
initially 
at 
a 
steady 
pace 
and 
later 
in 
droves. 
The 
main 
result 
of 
this 
was 
a record 
rise 
in 
interest 
rates, 
which 
particularly 
affected 
provinces 
such 
as 
Cordoba 
with 
high 
debt 
profile. 
The 
freezing 
of 
deposits, 
default, and devaluation: 
as 
a result 
of 
the 
two 
events 
described 
above, 
the 
national 
government 
initially 
restricted 
access 
to 
bank 
deposits 
and 
then 
froze 
them, 
in 
order 
to 
avoid 
the collapse 
of 
the 
financial 
system. 
This 
situation 
was 
compounded 
by 
the 
default 
on 
external 
debt 
and 
the 
loss 
of 
convertibility 
of 
our currency. 
7. 
The 
sequence 
of 
events described 
above 
led to 
substantial 
and 
drastic 
change 
in 
the 
economic 
conditions 
in 
Cordoba Province 
and 
the 
handling 
of 
public 
finances 
in 
relation to 
initial 
projections. 
The 
first 
noticeable 
effect 
was 
a 
decline 
in 
economic 
activity. 
At 
the 
end 
of 
2001, 
real 
gross 
product 
fell 
by 
5 
percent 
at 
the 
national 
level, 
and 
at 
the 
provincial 
level, 
this 
figure 
was 
even 
higher. 
8. 
This situation 
fell 
far 
short 
of 
the 
scenarios 
on 
which 
our 
fiscal 
projections 
were 
based; 
i.e., 
a 
2.5 
percent increase 
in 
GDP. 
This 
immediately 
led 
to 
a decline 
in 
income 
at 
both 
the 
national 
and 
provincial 
levels, 
the 
result 
being 
that  actual 
figures 
were 
well 
below 
original 
projections. 
9. 
On 
the 
expenditure 
side, 
there 
was 
an 
almost 
100 
percent increase 
in 
interest’s 
payments, 
stemming 
from 
the 
lack 
of 
liquidity 
of 
the 
financial 
system, 
which 
prompted 
the 
tripling 
of 
interest 
rates 
between 
the 
first 
half 
and second 
half 
of 
2001. 
Another 
significant 
increase 
was 
seen 
in 
the 
spending 
for 
personnel, 
goods, 
and 
non 
personnel 
services, 
due 
to 
the 
increased 
attention 
that 
had 
to 
be 
paid to 
the 
provision 
of 
services 
by 
19 
Page  23
the 
provincial 
public 
sector 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
deteriorating 
social 
situation 
described 
below. 
10. 
One 
significant 
event that 
contributed 
to 
a 
worse than expected 
situation 
during 
the 
second 
half 
of 
2001 
linked to 
the 
crisis 
described 
above 
was 
the 
fact that investment 
of 
private capital 
in 
public 
sector companies 
could 
not 
take 
place. 
This 
prevented the 
province 
from 
servicing 
its 
debt 
as 
was 
planned 
from 
the 
funds 
to be 
obtained 
largely 
from 
the concessioning 
of 
the 
power company and the 
privatization 
of 
the 
lottery 
and 
casino 
businesses. 
In 
addition, 
debt 
stocks 
rose 
above 
projected 
levels, 
largely 
because 
of 
the 
assistance 
that 
had 
to 
be 
provided to 
the 
Provincial 
Bank, 
which 
we were 
unable 
to 
privatize 
despite 
a 
major 
effort 
by 
the 
Province. 
11. 
The 
following 
year 
turned 
out 
to 
be 
extremely 
difficult 
as 
well; 
perhaps 
the 
worst 
in 
the recent 
history 
of 
Argentina. 
Economic 
activity 
fell 
by 
11 
percent, 
with 
troughs 
in 
such 
areas 
as 
construction 
(32.4%); 
trade 
(22.7%); 
and 
financial intermediation 
(21.5%). 
Activity 
in 
the 
automotive 
industry  declined 
by 
66 
percent 
(one 
of 
Cordoba’s 
major 
industries) 
bringing 
production to 
the 
level 
of 
1959. 
This 
had 
a 
serious 
impact 
on 
the 
province, 
where 
unemployment 
reached 
25.3 
percent 
and, 
if 
we 
include 
underemployed 
persons, 
34.3 
percent. 
This 
means 
that 
more 
than 
400,000 
homes 
in 
Cordoba 
experienced serious employment problems. 
In 
terms 
of 
a 
basic basket 
of 
goods, 
inflation 
reached 
73 
percent, 
which 
means 
that the 
erosion 
of 
salaries 
was great. 
Social 
and 
Fiscal 
Impact 
12. 
This 
crisis 
has 
taken 
a 
heavy 
toll 
on 
society 
in 
the 
same 
year 
time. 
Consequently, 
despite 
the 
fact 
that 
in 
2002 
the 
province received $230 
million 
less 
than 
the 
previous 
year 
from 
the federal 
government, 
the 
provincial 
government 
had 
to 
redouble 
its 
efforts 
to 
provide 
special 
assistance 
to 
the 
people 
of 
Cordoba. 
For 
example, the number 
of 
visits 
by 
patients 
to 
public 
hospitals 
rose 
by 
one 
million 
in 
our 
province 
in 
the 
past 
year. 
The 
number 
of 
students 
attending 
public 
schools 
in 
Cordoba 
also 
increased 
as 
parents 
withdrew them 
from 
private 
schools. 
At 
the 
primary 
school level, 
student numbers rose 
by 
15,000, 
and 
at 
the 
intermediate level, 
by 
14,000. 
In 
the past three 
years, 
enrolment 
at 
the 
intermediate 
level 
in 
the 
rural 
sectors 
has 
tripled, 
as 
it 
has at 
special 
schools. 
Demand 
for  food 
increased, 
and 
the 
number 
of 
persons 
receiving 
assistance 
has 
risen 
from 
130,000 
to 
220,000 
in 
the 
past 
twelve 
months. 
Added 
to 
this 
are 
the 
25,000 
children 
who 
eat 
every  day 
in 
provincial 
cafeterias 
and the 
18,000 
senior 
citizens 
and 
the 
210,000 
youngsters 
who 
receive 
daily 
assistance 
through 
the 
PAICOR 
(Comprehensive 
Assistance 
Program 
of 
Cordoba). 
13. 
In 
the 
midst 
of 
the 
crisis, 
we 
are 
helping families 
and 
we 
are 
confident 
that 
we 
are 
doing 
so 
properly. 
Beginning 
last 
year, 
for 
the 
first 
time 
in 
our 
history,  Cordoba 
introduced a single 
plan for 
all 
the 
beneficiaries 
of 
the 
different 
social 
plans 
in 
the 
province, 
which 
permits 
greater 
control 
to 
be 
exercised over social 
assistance 
and 
much 
greater  transparency 
in 
the 
handling 
of 
that 
assistance. 
Each 
box 
of 
food, 
each 
employment  plan, 
each 
subsidy, 
and 
each 
form 
of 
assistance 
to 
the 
elderly 
and 
the 
disabled 
bears 
the 
first 
and last 
names 
of 
the 
recipient. 
20 
Page  24
14. 
Faced 
with 
growing 
demand, 
we have 
been 
forced 
to 
reallocate 
resources. 
We 
have made 
the 
decision 
to 
refrain 
from 
increasing 
taxes, 
to 
keep 
schools 
open, 
and 
to 
ensure 
that 
hospitals 
are 
running.  Also, 
we 
are 
not 
exacerbating 
the 
crisis 
by 
cutting 
the 
salaries 
of 
employees 
or 
the 
pension 
of 
retirees. 
Instead, 
we  have  chosen 
to 
lower 
salaries 
for 
political 
positions, 
we  have 
made 
further 
adjustments 
to 
government 
structures, 
we 
have 
eliminated 
secretariats, 
and we 
are 
merging ministries 
and 
agencies, 
all 
with 
the sole 
aim 
of 
ensuring that people 
do 
not 
go 
hungry 
and 
are 
not 
left 
to 
their 
own 
devices 
during 
this 
period. 
15. 
Consequently  our 
deficit 
-based 
on 
federal 
government's 
methodology 
of 
accounting- reached 
A$716 
million 
in 
2001. 
This 
was 
the context 
in 
which 
we 
issued 
Provincial Debt 
Payment Instruments 
(LECOP 
CORDOBA 
or 
LECOR), 
which 
we 
are 
now 
withdrawing 
from 
circulation 
and expect 
to 
redeem 
fully 
in 
the 
months 
ahead. 
These 
instruments 
provided 
a 
mechanism 
for 
maintaining 
economic 
activity 
in 
our 
province 
and 
saving 
the 
jobs 
of 
thousands 
of 
families. 
People were able 
to 
continue 
their 
purchases 
and 
to 
be paid, and 
the 
economy 
did 
not 
grind 
to 
a 
complete 
halt. 
During 
2002 
we 
were able 
to 
reduce 
the 
deficit 
by 
60 
percent 
and 
eliminate 
dependence 
on 
LECORs. 
For 
2003 
we 
project 
a balanced 
budget. 
Cordoba's Continued 
Reform 
Effort 
16. 
My 
government 
remains 
committed 
to 
the 
vision 
of 
a strong 
and 
small 
state 
aimed 
at  necessary 
investments 
in 
human 
capital 
and 
providing 
the 
appropriate 
climate 
for 
savings, 
investment, 
and 
growth. 
Unfortunately 
full 
achievement 
of 
these 
goals 
is 
not 
totally 
in 
our 
hands. 
However we 
will 
do 
our 
part. 
We 
would 
ask 
you 
as 
our partner 
to 
consider amending the 
loan 
agreement 
to 
reflect 
targets 
more 
appropriate 
for 
current 
circumstances. 
17. 
Public 
Finances. 
While 
unable 
to 
meet 
the 
original 
fiscal 
goals 
of 
the 
program 
due 
to 
the 
macroeconomic 
deterioration  noted 
above, 
we  have 
complied 
with 
the 
Programa 
de 
Financiamiento 
Ordenado 
2002, based 
on 
Acuerdo 
Nacion 
Provincias 
sobre 
Relacion 
Financiera 
y 
Bases 
de 
un 
Regimen 
de 
Coparticipacion Federal 
and have 
signed 
the 
Programa 
de 
Financiamiento 
Ordenado 
2003. 
Under 
these 
so 
called Fiscal 
Pacts 
we 
sharply reduced our 
deficit 
in 
2002 
and 
are 
committed to 
a 
balanced 
budget 
in 
2003 
including 
adherence 
to 
all 
the 
quarterly 
targets 
under 
Pact. 
Our 
program 
of 
improved 
tax 
administration 
is 
registering 
real 
progress 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
application 
of 
information 
technology, crossing 
of 
data 
bases, 
improved 
coordination 
with 
banks. 
The 
ITAX 
system 
was 
introduced, 
which 
permits 
taxpayers 
to 
issue 
the 
bills 
to 
pay 
taxes 
due 
or to 
make 
installment 
payments 
via 
the 
Internet. 
A 
judicial 
module 
was 
also 
introduced 
in 
the 
Otax 
system, 
with 
training 
being 
provided 
for 
all 
staff 
in 
the 
Judicial 
Collection 
Division 
of 
the 
Revenue 
Department. 
In 
addition, 
"small 
sample" operations 
involving 
taxpayers 
and 
comprehensive audits 
by 
specialized 
teams 
took 
place. 
Cooperation 
agreements 
were 
concluded 
with 
the 
national tax 
agency 
and 
the 
municipalities. 
The 
roperty 
database 
was 
improved, 
with 
a 
view 
to 
collecting 
taxes 
on 
a 
total 
of 
2,144,425 
m 
, 
measured 
in 
the 
field. 
More 
than 
39,000 
notifications 
were 
sent 
to 
delinquent 
taxpayers 
for 
taxes 
owed 
on 
r 
21 
Page  25
real 
estate 
and 
gross 
income. 
As 
a result, 
despite 
the 
fall 
in 
overall 
economic 
activity 
our 
relative 
level 
of 
tax 
collection 
is 
running 
higher 
to 
that 
of 
the federal government. 
We 
are 
making 
a concerted 
efforts  to 
expand tax  audits 
during 
2003. 
Improvements 
in 
municipal 
finances 
and 
cadastres 
is 
a 
top 
priority 
as 
well, 
and 
we 
are 
moving to 
replace 
from 
our 
own 
resources, 
technical 
assistance 
to 
selected 
groups 
of 
municipalities 
which 
had 
been 
anticipated 
from 
another 
multilateral institution. 
18. 
In 
the 
area 
of 
public 
agencies 
my 
government 
is 
implementing 
a 
program 
of 
reform 
and 
restructuring 
designed 
to 
strengthen 
the 
management, 
accountability, 
finances, 
and 
services 
of 
both 
the 
Provincial 
Bank 
of 
Cordoba 
(BPC) 
and 
our 
electricity 
company (EPEC). 
For 
BPC 
we have 
changed 
its 
management 
by 
bringing 
in 
experienced 
professionals 
from 
the 
Argentine  private 
banking 
sector, 
submitted 
to 
the 
Argentine 
Central 
Bank 
(BCRA) 
a 
Plan 
for 
BPC’s 
restructuring, 
initiated 
several 
interim 
measures, 
and 
are 
seeking 
through 
competitive 
bidding 
to 
outsource 
the 
management 
and 
retrieval 
of 
BPC’s 
negatively 
rated 
assets. 
We 
have contracted 
an 
international 
management 
firm 
to 
conduct a comprehensive diagnosis 
of 
BPC 
in 
order 
to 
further 
refine 
the 
Restructuring 
Plan 
presented 
to 
BCRA 
and 
we 
commit 
ourselves 
to 
full 
implementation 
of 
the 
Plan 
ultimately 
supported 
by 
the 
Central Bank. 
Our 
aim 
is 
to 
convert 
BPC 
into 
a corporate 
entity 
(Sociedad 
Anonima) 
within 
the 
public 
sector 
and 
strengthen 
its 
finances 
with 
the 
goal 
of 
permitting 
its 
sale 
when 
market 
conditions 
permit. 
Our 
legislature 
has 
approved 
new 
legislation 
strengthening 
the 
governance, 
accountability, 
and 
performance 
orientation 
of 
the 
EPEC 
with 
the 
goal 
of 
improving 
both 
services 
to 
customers and 
return 
on public 
assets. 
My 
administration 
will 
sign 
an 
explicit 
performance 
contract 
with 
EPEC to 
help 
increase 
the 
focus 
on 
performance and 
public 
accountability. 
It 
is 
also 
our 
hope 
that 
when 
market 
conditions 
improve 
the 
incorporation 
of 
the 
private 
capital 
so 
desperately needed 
to 
expand 
power 
capacity 
will 
be 
forthcoming. 
19. 
Public 
Administration. 
Here too 
major 
progress 
is 
being 
made. 
In 
the 
area 
of 
budget administration, 
along 
with 
new 
financial 
management 
information 
system, 
a 
law 
was 
submitted and approved that 
is 
compatible 
with 
the federal 
government’s 
system. 
This 
supersedes 
our 
old 
accounting 
law. 
Changes 
have already 
been 
made 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
Revenue and 
Expenditure 
Budget 
for 
FY 
2003, 
which 
was 
submitted 
to 
the 
Legislature 
within 
the 
stipulated 
time 
period 
and 
has 
already been 
approved. 
The 
internal 
computer 
network 
system 
was 
replaced 
with 
a new 
and 
more 
modern 
system 
that 
is 
connected 
to 
all 
the 
government 
departments, 
thereby 
optimizing 
the 
administrative 
functioning 
of 
this 
system. 
Accounting 
records were established 
as 
well 
as 
mechanisms 
to 
oversee 
the 
economic, 
financial, 
and 
property-related 
management 
of 
state 
authorities 
and 
officials 
with 
accounting 
responsibility 
for 
state-owned 
funds, 
assets, 
and 
property. 
We 
have reduced the 
number 
of 
ministries 
and 
secretariats 
and, 
following 
a 
public 
referendum 
reduced the 
number 
of 
legislators 
and 
eliminated 
one 
house 
of 
the 
Provincial 
legislature. 
We 
have 
introduced 
a 
civil 
service 
management 
information 
system that 
providing 
more 
comprehensive, 
reliable 
and 
updated 
information 
of 
all 
public 
sector employees, 
as 
well 
as 
oversight over 
the 
selection, 
hiring, 
training 
and 
firing 
processes. 
We 
have 
drafted 
and 
will 
submit 
shortly draft 
legislation 
to 
modernize 
public 
procurement. 
My 
administration 
is 
also 
announcing  and 
implementing 
a 
22 
Page  26
complementary  program 
to 
increase transparency 
and attack 
corruption 
in 
the 
public 
sector. 
20. 
Social 
Sector. 
We 
have 
made, 
and 
will 
continue 
to 
make, 
serious 
efforts 
to 
maximize 
the efficiency 
and 
effectiveness 
in 
human 
capital 
spending 
in 
health, 
education, 
and 
social 
protection 
within 
the 
severe 
constraints we 
face. 
The 
processes 
underway 
involving 
privatizations, 
concessions, 
and 
contracting 
of 
the 
functions 
of 
the 
Provincial 
Bank, 
the 
provincial 
power 
company, 
and the 
casino and 
lottery 
businesses, 
will 
over 
time 
enable 
us 
to 
reduce 
our 
debt 
and 
to 
begin 
to 
make 
the 
capital 
investments that 
are 
essential 
in 
order 
to 
enhance 
the 
productive 
profile 
of 
our province. 
As 
indicated 
above, 
social 
protection 
remains 
a 
top 
priority 
in 
terms 
of 
funding 
and 
measures 
to 
better target 
and account 
for 
resources. 
In 
the 
health 
sector 
we have taken numerous 
measures 
to 
improve 
the 
efficiency 
and effectiveness 
of 
hospitals and the 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
despite 
severe 
constraints 
on 
resources 
and 
increased 
demand. 
We 
are 
evaluating 
the 
progress 
achieved 
in 
public 
hospitals 
against 
specific performance 
indicators 
as 
a 
means 
to 
further 
adjust the 
reform 
effort. 
Progress 
has 
been achieved 
in 
terms 
of 
quality 
monitoring, 
training, 
and 
procurement, 
and 
we 
will 
continue focusing 
on 
areas 
of 
bill 
collection 
and 
better 
hospital 
budget 
planning. 
I 
regret that 
we 
have 
not 
been 
able 
to 
pilot 
an 
innovative 
scheme 
of 
universal  health 
care 
-a 
goal 
that 
will 
need 
to 
be 
pursued 
in 
the 
future 
following 
economic recovery. 
I 
am 
especially 
proud 
of 
the 
gains 
registered 
in 
education, 
even 
though 
much 
remains 
to be 
done. 
Despite 
the 
switch 
of 
many 
students 
to 
public 
schools we have 
been 
able 
to 
strengthen 
accreditation 
systems, 
spending 
on 
maintenance 
and 
new 
construction, 
improve 
management 
of 
human 
resources, 
decentralize 
many 
decisions 
to 
schools, 
better track 
student 
performance 
and 
needs, 
and 
increase 
public 
information 
on 
school performance. 
A 
remaining 
challenge 
is 
to 
reduce 
our 
ratio 
of 
teachers 
to 
students. 
Teacher 
absenteeism 
has 
declined (although 
not 
as 
much 
as 
planned 
as 
many 
teachers 
responded 
to 
new 
license  requirements 
by 
increasing their 
training 
efforts) 
because 
we have 
instituted 
a 
successful 
new 
system 
to 
better 
monitor 
and 
verify 
teacher absenteeism due 
to 
medical 
reasons. 
The 
Future 
21. 
The 
continued 
support 
of 
the 
World 
Bank 
is 
critical 
to 
our 
reform 
process. 
In 
addition 
to 
financing, 
the 
presence 
of 
the 
Bank, 
its 
technical 
assistance 
and 
its 
credibility 
as 
a neutral 
party 
has 
been 
of 
notable 
help 
as 
we 
try 
to 
keep 
the 
momentum 
for 
the 
reform 
so 
necessary 
for 
sustained 
development 
in 
this 
province 
and 
nation 
and 
the 
well 
being 
of 
our 
citizens.  Despite 
the serious 
challenges 
confronting 
Argentina 
we 
are 
confident 
that 
Cordoba 
will 
achieve 
in 
the near 
term 
the 
revised objectives 
supported 
by 
its 
loan 
with 
the 
World 
Bank, and 
we 
are 
committed 
to 
carry out 
the 
Revised 
Program 
in 
accordance 
with 
its 
terms. 
Sincerely, 
Dr. 
JosC 
Manuel 
de 
la 
Sota 
Governor 
of 
the 
Province 
of 
Cordoba
