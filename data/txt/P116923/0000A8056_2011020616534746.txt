                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall Project Performance has been sub optimal since the project became effective in October 2009. About 24.48% % or US$ 1,462,701.51 of the total outlay had been spent by
                         24 January 2011. Nearly 90% of the project allocation is dedicated to procuring goods, works and services, and poor performance of this function is a key factor of slow progress.

                         Other notable reasons for low performance include the inability of the PCU to operate as a cohesive team, and lack of appropriate office space and logistics such as vehicles, V Sat,
                         generators, which could not be procured throughout the first project year and which also contributed to poor PCU outputs.

                         The redeeming feature is that the procurement progress picked up considerably during September ­ November 2010, particularly after an international procurement consultant joined
                         the PCU. All major procurement items have reached final stage of documentation and project team expressed confidence that contracts would be signed before end January 2011 for
                         a total amount of approximately US$3.0 million. As the contracts are of less than 5 months duration the mission expects that with diligent implementation assured by the PCU and
                         tight monitoring promised by the AAA, these would be completed on time. Improved performance in the last quarter 2010 as evidenced by the progress summarized below reinforces
                         the confidence expressed by the project team and the AAA.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         To ensure that the project does not suffer any more slippages it was consensually (task team, MOFNE, AAA, PCU) decided that a running monitoring arrangement at various levels
                         needs to be put in place. The key actionable points would be reviewed regularly at the AAA level, MOFNE and World Bank levels so that flags are raised and remedial action initiated
                         as soon as slippages come to attention. A revised Action Plan was finalized jointly and would be the key document to be the subject of:

                         (a)        Monthly review by the Secretary General of the AAA;
                         (b)        a review every two months to be conducted by the Finance Minister of AAA who also chairs the project steering committee (PSC); and
                         (c)        A monthly review of the updated dashboards (to be provided by the project coordinator at the conclusion of each review meeting) would be conducted by the MOFNE and
                         the World Bank task team. In case any slippage is detected the task team and MOFNE would bring the deficiency to the attention of the Governor and Finance Minister of AAA and
                         call for a more vigorous supervisory action to remedy the situation. If the poor performance persists the World Bank and MoFNE will conduct a special review on site in Abyei in
                         March 2011, and in consultation with AAA recommend next steps including restructuring of the implementation arrangements.
