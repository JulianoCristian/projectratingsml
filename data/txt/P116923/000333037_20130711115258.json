follows: outcomes were\n            highly unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            high, the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and\n            the Grantee performance was highly unsatisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included:  the project was designed and\n            implemented early in the Bank's Sudan re-engagement,\n            but after the start of other emergency projects in\n            transitional border areas. The time during which ASEP was\n            implemented was also a time when the Bank's strategy on\n            Sudan and Southern Sudan was emerging. ASEP was thus largely\n            a learning-by-doing approach that drew from early\n            implementation modalities under Multi Donor Trust Fund\n            (MDTF)-funded projects, and reflected an understanding of\n            the low-capacity environment in which it was to operate and\n            the need for design simplicity and flexibility.  In\n            extremely difficult and politically volatile situations such\n            as Abyei, alternative emergency project implementation\n            arrangements should be considered even if they involve\n            trade-offs with capacity building. Emergency development\n            interventions in unstable FCS are by nature high-risk, high\n            reward undertakings, but Bank Management (and donors) should\n            be prepared to pull out and return to the drawing board when\n            failure is evident."}, "docdt": "2013-06-13T00:00:00Z"}
