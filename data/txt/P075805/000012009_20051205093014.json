Findings identified to\n            have implications for subsequent operations include: 1)\n            during implementation it became clear it is important to\n            stand firmly by prior actions, and triggers in the PAF\n            matrix, as agreed with the Government and donors. Small\n            deviations from actions intended in the agreed PAF, can\n            cause unnecessary disagreements. Thus, subsequent operations\n            should use even the same wording as in selected prior\n            actions and triggers; 2) budgetary support is evidently,\n            more effective if provided in coordination with other\n            donors' assistance, concurrent with the\n            Government's budget process. The following second\n            operation has been aligned with the budget process, and\n            subsequent poverty reduction support credits will follow the\n            same line of thought; and, 3) project experience showed that\n            timing of reform implementation would be more realistic if\n            electoral cycles are taken into consideration, for example,\n            the labor law and procurement law were designed to be\n            approved during an election year, but subsequently delayed."}, "docdt": "2005-11-29T00:00:00Z"}
