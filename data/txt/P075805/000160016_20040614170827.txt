                   employment and also strengthening governance and public
                   sector management. PRSCl will also consolidatethe basis for
                   helping the Government to attack poverty ina comprehensive
                   manner. Furthersingle-tranche operations (PRSC2 and PRSC3)
                   are expectedto follow inFY05 and FY06.
Benefits:          Themainandultimate benefit ofthe operation is expectedto be
                   acceleratedprogresstowards the MillenniumDevelopment
                   Goals (MDGs) as a result of higher growth and improved
                   service delivery achievedthrough implementation of the
                   program supportedby the credit. Inaddition, the operation will
                   helpthe Government to maintain macroeconomic stability by
                   helping to close an external financing gap as well as generate
                   the domestic funds requiredto execute the policies and
                   programs included inthe PARPA.

Risks:             Theprogram faces severalrisks: (i)      macroeconomic or
                   financial sector instability as a result of terms oftrade shocks,
                   regional instability, or deteriorating financial sector
                   performance; (ii)  capacity limitations constraining program
                   implementation; (iii)  social or politicalpressures, possibly
                   resulting from weaker Government commitment to reform
                   undermining sustainability; and (iv) residual fiduciary risks to
                   resource flows.

                                    A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
                              THE REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE
                 FORA FIRSTPOVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT

                                     I. INTRODUCTION

1.       Thisprogram documentproposes a single-tranche Poverty Reduction Support Credit
(PRSCl) to the Republic of Mozambiquefor SDR40.9 million ($60 million equivalent), on
standard I D A terms. The proposed operation i s an integral part o f the Bank's strategy to support
the implementation o f Mozambique's Action Plan for the Reduction o f Absolute Poverty
(PARPA), as updated inApril 2004 through Government revision o f a rolling three-year matrix
o f priority actions and indicators agreed with its external partners. A key feature o f the PRSC
framework, which is proposed to include three operations to be deliveredover FY04-06, is its
focus on cross-cutting and institutional issues. Besides providing financial support to PARPA
implementation, the PRSC will help close Government financing gaps which have fiscal and
balance-of-payments origins.

2.      Bilateral and multilateral donor assistance will be needed to implement the PARPA, as
the country's own resourcesfall short of the levels required to achieve the PARPA's
objectives, including the MDGs. The Government o fMozambique has made significant
progress inraising revenues and improving public financial management, including completion
o f a medium-term financial framework (MTFF) and two recent Public Expenditure Reviews
(PERs), progressive implementationo f an integrated public financial management system
(SISTAFE), and actionto fight corruption. Nonetheless, Government-generated resources fall
short o f financing Mozambique's modest medium-term development goals by about $750
million per annum. Encouraged by the Government's track record since 1992, a group o f donors
(now numbering 15 and known as the Group o f 15 (G15)) have agreed to provide general budget
or balance-of-payments support to the Government under a formally-agreed joint program. Over
2003-04, this group o f donors improvedharmonizationby agreeing to commit and disburse
budgetor balance-of-payments support against Government progress inimplementing a results-
orientedmatrix o f agreed actions and indicators that updates the PARPA. This matrix provides a
framework for policy dialogue and decisions linked to PARPA implementation, and the
proposed PRSC i s fully aligned with it.

3.       ThePRSC is consistentwith the Bank's Country AssistanceStrategy (CAS), which the
Board considered on November 20,2003, and also provides continuing support to the reforms
supported by the recently-completed Economic Management and Private Sector Operation
(EMPSO), which aimed to improve public financial management andcreate a better environment
for private sector-led growth. EMPSO supported: (i)      actions identified by the PARPA inthe
areas o f public financial management and financial sector supervision to reduce the risk o f
financial crisis; (ii)
                     improving macroeconomic stability as a prerequisite for sustaining growth
over the medium-term; (iii)   improving the investment climate for the private sector; and
(iv) laying the foundation for legal andjudicial reform, bothto sustain growth and also to enable
the sector to address key legal challenges o fmodemsocieties.

4.    Thisfirst PRSCseriesfor Mozambique will deepen Bank support to the Government's
reform agenda by: (i) buildingpublic sector capacity and accountability through
strengtheningpublicfinancial management, decreasingaid dependency,improving
monitoring and evaluation (M&E), and acceleratingpublic sector reform; (ii) improvingthe
investment climate throughstrengtheningthefinancial sector, easingconstraintsin the
regulatory environment,and expandinginfrastructure services; and (iii) enhancingservice
delivery in health, education,and water and sanitation, While the PRSC operations will
provide financial support for implementing the whole of the PARPA, they are proposedto
disburseagainstthe upfront completion of a small numberof specific reformmeasures (prior
actions) identified inthe program matrix (see Annex 1). For PRSCl, these prior actions will
focus on ensuring that spending allocations are inline with agreedpriorities, that risks inthe
fiduciary environment are reducedthrough progressiveimplementation of SISTAFE, that
revenue-raising measurescontinue to be deployed, that public sector reform (including
decentralization to localauthorities) leadsto improved service delivery, andthat efforts to
combat corruption proceedwith due speed. They will also beginto focus on the completion of
reforms that improve the investment climate and promote pro-poor growth. Inaddition, as Bank
project-basedfinancing insupport of sector-wide approaches(SWAps) inagriculture, health and
education comesto a close, PRSC2 and 3-thought      not PRSCl-will     continue to support the
SWAps inthese sectorswith a view to optimizing their impact on poverty. Inparticular, Bank
staff will continue to participate inSWAP reviews andprovide technical assistance as needed,
while the PRSC series will provide financial support to the SWAps.

5.    ThePRSC is based on extensiveanalytical work completedover thepastfew years,
includingtwo PERs (FYOI and FY03), a Poverty Assessment (FY04), a Country Economic
Memorandum (CEM, FYOl), a Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA, FY02), a
Country ProcurementAssessment Review (CPAR, FY03), an Investment Climate Assessment
(ICA, FY03), and a Financial Sector Assessment (FY03). Bank-Fund work on tracking public
expendituresinHIPC countries has also played a major role inprogram design.

6.    TheBank's strategy, as stated in the CAS, and consistentlywith the strategy of most
major donorsin Mozambique, isprogressively to increasethe share of the assistanceprogram
deliveredin programmaticform. The PRSC begins this processfor IDA. Continuing
weaknesses inMozambique's fiduciary framework indicate that there are risks inproviding
increasing levels of programmatic support, but PRSCl helpsto mitigate those risks, andthe
residual risks are worth taking as the Bank's PRSC will helpto sustainnational interest in
implementing the PARPA, promote greater harmonization among the donors, and improve the
accountability of the Government to Parliament andto the people of Mozambique.

            11.     ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND POVERTY REDUCTION

A. CONTEXTOFTHE PARPA

7.    Though Mozambique remains one of the world'spoorest countries, with a GDPper
capita of $210, it experiencedstrongpoverty reduction over 1997-2003. The 1996-97national
poverty assessment found that the poverty headcountwas 69% (71% mral and 62% urban) and
the poverty gap 29%. The 2002-03 poverty assessment found substantialimprovement inboth
measures, with the poverty headcountfalling to 54%-well     belowthe PARPA target of 60% by
2005-and    the poverty gap to 21%. Thus, not only i s a smaller share of the population below the
poverty line, but the average consumption levels ofthose remaining below the poverty line has


                                               2

increased inreal terms (from 58% o f the poverty line in 1996-97 to 62% in2002-03). While the
poverty headcount is still higher inrural areas (55.3%) than inurbanareas (51.5%), inrelative
terms poverty fell more rapidly inrural areas (by 16 percentage points) than inurban areas (I     1
percentage points). Inaddition, access to basic services and asset ownership bothimproved
strongly over the reportedperiod. (Table 1shows progress against selected indicators.) Even so,
                                                         poverty remains deep inthe rural areas,
                                                         where 70% o f Mozambicans live. Rural
                                                         per capitaincomes are still believedto be
                                                         about $100per annum, or halfthe
                                                         national average, andhealth and
                                                         educational services, safer water and
                                                         electricity, are still hardto obtain (see the
                                                         October 2003 CAS). Most Mozambican
                                                         farmers live on fewer than three hectares
                                                         o f landand only about one inten i s able
                                                         to sell surplus produce, chiefly due to
                                                         poor infrastructure.

8.    Studies are now under way to evaluate the linkages between economicgrowth and
poverty reduction in Mozambique. Preliminary indications are that the linkages betweenrapid
growth and poverty reduction are strong. Sectors experiencing significant growth have been
construction, food and beverages, services, andtourism, most of which are labor-intensive. In
addition, the agricultural sector, which accounts for 26% of GDP, grew by 6 4 % a year over
1996-2002, which helps explain the sharp reductiono f poverty inrural areas. Recent surveys
show that poverty varies considerably across provinces andwithin communities, limiting the
effectiveness of geographical targeting and community-based development initiatives. Further
analytical work i s plannedto help determine what has been drivingthese results and why the
decline inurbanpoverty has been smaller thanexpected.


B. Policies,GrowthandPovertyReductioninMozambique

9.      Structural reforms were initiated in Mozambique in the 1990s, even before war ended.
Since 1992,the Government has restructured or privatized over 850 companies. It has reformed
the financial sector by creating a central bank; adopting regulations on licensing, capital
adequacy, and exposure limits; and privatizing the two state-owned banks. The Government also
established a progressive investmentregime, promoted free trade zones for manufactured
exports, transformed the Investment Promotion Center from a regulatory to a promotion agency,
and reduced administrative redtape for investors. Mozambique today has one o f the most open
trade regimesinsouthern Africa. Prices have beenliberalized, except for a few consumer goods;
import licenses have been abolished; andthe exchange rate i s fully flexible. Mozambique has
also made progress intrade policy: the top tariff rate i s now 25%; rates on capital goods and
intermediates are between 5% and 10%; further reductions will follow as the SADC trade
protocol i s implemented; and collection increases resulting from improved customs management
more thancompensated for the decline inrates duringthe 1990s. New tax legislation has also
beenprepared. With a view to long-term fiscal sustainability, a value-added tax (VAT) was
introducedin 1999;a large taxpayer unit was established in2001;and a new income tax law was
passed in2002, rationalizing corporate andpersonal income taxes, reducing the corporate tax



                                                 3

 from 35% to 32%, andbroadeningthe tax base. Inaddition, anew code of fiscal incentives was
 passed, establishing standardconcessionsandtransparent rules for foreign investors.

 10.     Gradualfiscal adjustment in a context of improved revenues and sustained aid has
 enabled Mozambique to increasespending on roads, health and education. Today 55% of the
 27,000 kmroad network is ingood or fair condition, and only 10% sometimes impassable,
 comparedto 10% and 30% respectively in 1992. From 1994to 1998, the Government nearly
 doubledits share of current expenditureon health (from 10% to 18%) and education (from 5% to
 10%). Health care has improved as over 300 first-level facilities were rehabilitated or
 constructed, often inremote ruralareas, and about nineinten reliably carry essentialdrugs and
 medical supplies. Inaddition, over 3,000 lower primary schools have beenrehabilitated or
 constructedover the 1 9 9 0 ~ ~doubling the numberthat existed at the end of the war.

 11.      Prudent monetary andfiscal policies have been maintained in spite of shocks. Very
 high inflationinthe early 1990swas brought downto single digits by 1996 and, except for flood-
 related rises in2000 and 2002, it has remainedmanageable. For 2003, inflationwas 13.5%, due

 12.     Thepartial privatization of two large state-owned banks in 1995-96 helped to lower
 inflation, but the banking system requiresfurther strengthening. Liquidity crises at Banco
 Austral (BAu) and Banco Commercial de Moqambique (BCM) necessitatedGovernment
 contributions to recapitalizations inboth2001 and2002, amounting to 4% of GDP. The
 Government is no longer apartner inBAu, which was reprivatized inDecember2OOl-though7
 as requiredby law, it still holds 20% of the bank's equity intrust for the bank's employees-and
 itintendsto withdraw from the Banco Internacional de Mopnbique (BIM, the successor to
 BCM), while also strengthening supervision capacities at the central bank. InMarch2004, the
 commercial bank lending rate was 26% (comparedto 35% at end-2002), but spreads were still
 15-16%.

 13.     Sustained structural reforms and macroeconomicstability raised averagegrowth to 9%
 per annumfrom 1997 to 2002, despite flood emergenciesinboth2000 and 2001. The main
 drivers ofthis growthwere foreign investment, strong agricultural performance, and large-scale
 project construction andproduction. Economic growth was 7.1% in2003 and i s projected at 7-
 8% annually until2006, with fluctuations mostly due to megaproject construction. Agricultural

production grew at 6% per annumsince 1992, as aresult of liberalization, macroeconomic
stabilization, infrastructure rehabilitation, input expansion, andthe absence (until 2000) of
weather-relatedshocks to production. Inaddition, Mozambique has attractedlarge-scaleforeign
direct investment (FDI), suchas the Mozal aluminumsmelter and the Sasol gas developments,
which helpedto boost economic activity, raisemanufacturing outputs, improve the trade balance,
and increasegovernment revenues. Partly as aconsequence ofthis FDI, the construction
industry has grown strongly, increasing                Figure 1: GDP growth and inflation
its share of GDP from 6.6% in 1996to
11.7% in2002. Therewas also a
strongpostwar rebound inmanufactur-
ing, which resultedfrom firms                  15.0 --
bringingidleproduction facilities back
online: the averagerate of capacity
utilizationrose from 20% in 1989to
48% in 1998. GDP growth in2003
was sourcedinagriculture (7.5%),
trade (6.O%), extractive industry                     1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003
(31.6%), manufacturing (l2.8%), and
transport and communications (8.6%),
indicating a widening base.

14.     Thisgrowth has reducedpoverty, but sustainability, which is critical to reach
Mozambique's poverty-reduction targets, is an increasing concern. Sustainability will require
significantly higher levels of broad-basedprivate-sector investment. Newprivate investmenthas
beenmodest even during the highgrowth period of the 1990s, when it accountedfor merely2-
3% of GDP. Inaddition, large-scale projects will not createthejobs neededto reduce poverty on
the scale that the PARPA envisages. Current and plannedlarge-scale project investmentsof
about $10 billion will employ only about 20,000 people, or less than 1%of the 3.7 million new
workers projectedto enter the job market by 2010. For the same investment, the average
Mozambican firm cancreate about 100times the jobs of a large-scale project.

15.     Due to the limited size of the domestic market, greater penetration of international
export markets represents the best long-term growth prospectfor theprivate sector. As a result
of low wages, richnatural resources, a liberaltrade regime, andprudentmacroeconomic and
exchangerate management, Mozambique has potential for expanding a broadrange of exports
(including tourism) and attracting more FDI. To date there has beenlimitedrealization ofthis
potential beyondthe few large-scale projects, andmost exports remain primarily resource-based
andagricultural. Increasing manufacturing sales to export markets (only 6% of total sales in
2001) will be a large challenge: manufacturing remains highly concentrated; capacity utilization
inthe sectorremains low, at about 50%; and subsectorsthat haveserved many developing
countries as a platform for exports have struggled inthe face of international competition.

16.     Making signijkantprogress towards thepoverty reduction goals will require
increasing labor-intensive manufactured exports and developing more linkages between the
large-scale projects and localproducers. To tap this potential, the cost of doing business needs
to be reduced. Despiterecent progress, regulations remain burdensome,with the consequence
that local producersof simple consumer goods, such as garments and many food products (which
enjoy tariff protection of about 25% andnatural protection from hightransport costs), are often
unable to compete with similar imports. Labor inflexibility, highbusiness registration costs, and


                                                  5

difficult access to land and capital are key factors inhibitingentry and the efficient allocation o f
resources as well as contributing to low productivity and competitiveness.

C. Medium-TermProspects

17.     Prospects are goodfor maintaining annual GDPgrowth rates at 74% and bringing
inflation below 10% over the medium-term. Inthe base case economic scenario, small-holder
agriculture, large-scale commercial agriculture, and manufacturing across all sectors and innon-
traditional areas are expected to continue to grow andcreate jobs, while deeper regulatory reform
should encourage investment ininfrastructure (see Table 3). Assuming no adverse exogenous
shocks and satisfactory implementationo f the reform program, large-scale project construction
(Mozal2 and the gas and titanium sand developments) will drive growth inthe near term and
also explainits main fluctuations. As these projects begin their productive activities, they will
help further to expandand diversify the export base, bring growth to local enterprises through
upstream and downstream linkages, and create significant spin-off effects, such as employee
training, connected infrastructure developments, andhigher Government tax revenues that can
support pro-poor spending. Hydroelectric power exports will also contribute to growth, and
current prospectingsuggests that coal, petroleum andmineral resources may contribute inthe
long term. Ifsustainably managed, Mozambique's agro-ecological resources will remain a good
basis for economic expansion. Agricultural growth i s expected to remain strong, at 7% per
annum or more, with rapid expansion intobacco and sugar (the latter behind protective barriers),
as only a fifth o f arable land i s now cultivated and there i s ample scope for yield improvements,
including through irrigation. With a 2,700 kmcoast that has manyunique habitats, tourism i s
expected to remain one o f Mozambique's fastest growing industriesand to continue expanding
vigorously (luxuryhotel rooms inMaputo increased from 730 in 1999 to 1,370 in2003).
Services, stemming inpart from government expenditure, will also continue to expand inthe
medium term, particularly intransportation, accommodation, and food.




18.     Sustaining growth will require a secondgeneration of reforms designedto improve
agriculturalproductivity,expand labor-intensivemanufacturing and services, and increase
the efficiency and eflectiveness of public spending in thepoverty-reducing sectors. It is
especially important that Mozambican firms become more competitive inworld markets. As

 shown inthe 2001 CEM, for Mozambique to take full advantage o f identified sources o f growth,
 the Government should act decisively infive areas:
         Strengthening the macroeconomic environment: Mozambique needs to reduce its fiscal
         deficit, improve public expenditure management, reform the financial sector, and
         strengthen its external balance by expanding the export base and raising manufacturing
         and cash-crop exports back to pre-independence levels.
         Unleashing agriculture'spoverty-redwing potential: Itneeds to improve landtenure,
         expand access to key inputs, and facilitate rural trade by expanding roadtransportation.
         Removing the impediments toprivate sector growth: The investment climate, particularly
         for high-potential sectors such as transport, tourism, and labor-intensive manufacturing,
         needs to be improvedthrough removing administrative barriers and increasingprivate-
         sector-participation ininfrastructure.
         Improvinghuman capital: Improving health services, expanding access to education, and
         controlling HIV and malaria are key to improving skills and productivity levels.
         Protectingnatural resources: To maximize returns from natural resource extraction,
         Mozambique needs to strengthen its environmental institutions and policies inways that
         promote growth and protect the environment.

 D. ExternalAssistanceto Mozambique

 19.     Mozambique has benefited enormouslyfrom foreign aid, which amounts to about 15%
 o f GDP today, compared to 64% for the rest o f sub-Saharan Africa (excluding South Africa),
 and covers half o f public expenditures. Evenincluding this aid, the Government's overall
 resource envelope remains far short o fthe requirements for meeting the MDGs. Butthe biggest
 challenge lies ahead. Aid flows to Mozambique are moving down inreal terms toward the
 regional average, and this trend i s expected to continue. Coping with this decline will require a
 substantial fiscal effort inthe next few years. To protect macroeconomicbalances, public
 spendingwill needto fall instep withthe decline inaid, except to the extent that domestic
 resources can be mobilized. Since 1998, spending has risen sharply, while revenues have grown
 more modestly. Although much o f the recent rise inspending i s attributable to flood relief and
 banking recapitalization, such events cannot be ruled out inthe next few years. Over the long
 term, increased revenue collection demands sustained growth, and here improving private sector
 performance is critical.

 20.     Continuedand stablesupport in theform of bilateral and multilateral grants and
 credits will be needed to enableMozambiqueto meet its development objectives. Excluding
 large-scaleprojects, Mozambique requires about $750 millionper annuminexternal assistance
 (see Table 4). At the October 2003 Consultative Group meeting, Mozambique's external
 partnerspledged$790 million inexternal assistance for 2004 (75% ingrants, and 40% inbudget
 support), which is more thanenough to meet the country's financing requirementsfor this year.
 Reliance on aid flows i s projected to decline gradually over the next decade, as strong growth
 and increasedprivate sector financing reduce aid's share of GDP and of the budget.

 21.     Mozambique'sdebt is high but has been reducedto sustainablelevels. In2002 the
 Government paid$52 million indebt service, of which $39 million were domestic interest
 payments. Public debt of $2.7 billion (57% of total external debt) is mostly long-term debt owed
 to governments and multilateral institutions. The Bank i s Mozambique's largest creditor,
                                                                           holding $1.O billion. Total public

       111. THE ACTION PLANFOR THE REDUCTION OF ABSOLUTE POVERTY

 A. The Strategy of the PARPA

 22.     ThePARPA is the Government'smain instrumentfor harmonizing international
 support around a locally-owned developmentprogram. InApril 2001the Council of Ministers
 approvedthe PARPA for 2001-2005, and inAugust 2001 the Bank and FundBoards endorsed it
 as Mozambique's first full PRSP. The PARPA'Spublic action strategy emphasizeseconomic
 growth, public investment inhuman capital andproductive infrastructure, and institutional
 reform to improve the environment for private investment. Growthi s expected to come from
 large-scale capital-intensive projects financed by private foreign capital; productivity andvalue-
 addedgains inagriculture and manufacturing; and a general expansion ininternal trade, transport
 andservices. To implementthis strategy, the PARPA identifies six priority areas for action:
 health, education, infrastructure, agriculture andrural development, governance, and
 macroeconomic and financial policies.

 23,     ThePARPA's goals, objectives and strategies are appropriatetoMozambique's
 circumstancestoday. A soundprogram of economic reformandmanagement-based                           on


                                                             8

privatization, financial sector reform, investment promotion, trade andprice liberalization,
prudentmacroeconomic management and substantial public investment-has                                  underpinned
Mozambique's ongoing economic transformation and growth record. InMarch2004 the MPF
reported on PARPA implementation inits annual Balanqo do Plano Econdmico and Social
(BdPES), which reports on budget execution inthe previous fiscal year to the National
Assembly. The Joint Staff Assessment (JSA) o fthe BdPES, which i s before the Boardtoday
withthis operation, concludedthat Mozambique's efforts to implement the PARPAare sufficient
evidence o f its commitment to poverty reduction, and that the strategy continues to provide a
credible poverty reduction framework and a sound basis for concessional assistance.

B. FinancingNeedsfor the PARPA and MDGs

24.       Despitestrenuous efforts in the 1990s,Mozambique did notprogress at apacefast
enough to reach the MDGs. The PARPA's targeted 8% growth rate would reduce the poverty
rate to 50% by 2010 and double the consumptionlevel o fpoor households in 12 years. Inline
withthis projection, allocations to poverty-orientedexpenditures have (appropriately) risen. In
particular, current budget allocations to health and education rose from 4.1% o f GDP in 1998to
7.5% in2003 (see Table 5), on top o f cumulative GDP growth o f 35% inreal terms inthe period.
Moreover (as shown inthe PER 2003), with the exception o f upper secondary school andtertiary
health services, education and healthbenefits have been distributed progressively compared to
the distribution o fconsumption. Sustainedpriority spending (education andhealth) is
anticipated inthe PARPA and this i s likely to ensure progress towards the PARPA goals and the
MDGs, butprogress will not be fast enough.

25.       Moreover,pro-poor expenditures continueto depend heavily on external assistance.
The split between recurrentand investment expenditures can only be examinedfor 2000, as full
information on donor funding i s available for that year only (see Table 5). In2000, donor
fundingaccounted for 46% o f all spending on education, 70% inhealth, and75% inroads and
water-much          on the recurrent account (for example, drugs andperiodic road maintenance).




projectededucation, health, water and roads expendituresare subtractedfrom ceiling recurrent expenditures. It also includes
all sectors other than general administration, education, health, agriculture, roadsand water. Boldedfigures includemost
externalfinancing, while non-bolded exclude it. Differenceis more evident in the investmentbudget thaninthe recurrentone.

26.       A 2003 analysisof Mozambique's developmentprospects concludedthat, with current
policies and aidflows, the MDGs that are likely to be met include only incomepoverty, hunger
andprimary enrolment. The PER2003 found that:




                                                                9

    0  Inhealth, reallocations withinthe sector will not suffice to provide modest assistanceto
       HIV/AIDS patients, much less meet the health and HIV/AIDS MDGs;
    0  Ineducation, in-sector reallocations andefficiency improvementswould suffice to
       achieve the key reforms, but the goal o f universal primary school completion i s unlikely
       to be attained by 2015;

27.    ThePER 2003 alsofound that thereis some scopefor pro-poor spending reallocations
within the Government'soverallbudget. Among the PARPA non-priority sectors (35% of the
budget), the PARPAidentifiedactivities that are "complementary" to the priority sectors,
including policies for sustainable growth (transport and communications, technology, environ-
mental management), social welfare programs, sectoral policies that contribute to income
generation (business development, fisheries, mining, industry, tourism), and programs to reduce
vulnerability to natural disasters. The 2003 PER suggested that consideration be given to
reducing spending on these activities by holding their allocations constant inreal terms or
applying a modest percentage decrease throughout as they are not the key priorities.




28.    Analytical work hasshown that absorptive capacity is an issue in all PARPApriority
sectors, and especially inhealth, with its weak links betweeninputsand outputs, and inwater,
where substantial under-executiono f the budget has beenthe norm. As a result, makingfaster


                                                10

progress towards the MDGswould require significant policy and institutional reform as well as
substantial additional resources that are explicitly targeted on, and succeed in, raising absorptive
capacity. With this combination, by 2015 the MDGscould also be met with regard to primary
completion, HIV/AIDS and access to water, though the gender as well as the child and maternal
mortality goals likely will not be met even inthis scenario (see Figure3).

29.     Given Mozambique's needfor official development assistance to reach the MDGs, even
with very high levels of growth, direct budget support is the best way to absorb such a large
increase. As donors have attempted to "ringfence" their projects using technical assistance,
foreign experts, and quasi-independent project implementationunits (PIUs), Government
systems for service delivery have not improved. Instead, transaction costs have risen; spending
has been inefficient; Government capacity and accountability has been eroded by parallel
structures; and budgetary resources have been highly unpredictable. A shift to programmatic
lending would help to redress these deficiencies by aligning donor financing fully with the
principleso f Government ownership and leadership, as established inthe PARPA, andby using
Government policies and the budget as the key instruments for implementingthe PARPA.

30.     The Government of Mozambique has managed levels of external assistance to GDPin
the range of 12-15% of GDPper annumforfive years or so, without ill effect. To be able to
absorb these levels o f assistance, Mozambique has appropriately focused on measures to increase
its absorptive capacity. Decentralization, capacity-building, andpublic sector reform are central
inthis respect. Dutchdisease effectsassociatedwith increased aidrevenues are unlikely to have
a negative impact on the tradable goods sector or overall economic growth. Macroeconomic
models indicatethat about US$400 million or so that Mozambique receives annually inexternal
grant assistanceaccounts for about five percentage points o f annual growth, but much o f that
assistance consists inimports o f goods and services and capacity building, which raise the
productivity o f Mozambican residents and businesses. Budgetsupport, o f which part is spent on
nontradables, tends to strengthen the exchange rate, butthere is little evidence o f undue
strengthening to date, as agricultural products remain competitive on world markets.

C.        PARPA ImplementationProcesses

31.       SinceApril 2003, the Governmenthas reoriented PARPA implementation to achieving
three major goals: (i) improving the effectiveness of government systems; (ii) increasing
external assistancein theform of budget support; and (iii) improving budget certainty, both
for the MPF andfor the line ministries. InMozambique's post-conflict period, resources for
service delivery have beentransferred through the Government's fiscal transfer system as well as
through direct financing channels from the donors, resultinginparallel structures, off-budget
expenditures, and special staffing structures as well as the hightransaction costs that these
arrangements entail. Inaddition, unpredictability indonor flows has repeatedly resulted in
delayed budget allocations from the MPF to spending authorities, particularly at the beginningo f
the fiscal year. The Governmentwants and needsto improve performance inthis area andhas
sought assistance from its partners, who have committed to providing a larger proportion o ftheir
aid inthe form o f budget support and according to a predictable calendar linked to the
Government's budget timetable. As a key step inthis process, the Government worked with its
external partners, including the Bank and the IMF, to formulate a single plan o f action for the
entire partnership,with a tighter prioritizationo f actions andindicators than i s given inthe
PARPA itself. This action plan, known as the Performance Assessment Framework (PAF)
matrix, aims to ensure that all groups financing the Government's development program act ina
coordinated manner and that redundancy and procedural duplication are minimized.

32.       The Government will continue to work with its developmentpartners to refine the sub-
set of priority actions and indicators included in the PAF matrix and to monitor
implementation. The partnership has agreed to holdbiennial meetings to do so, inMarch-April
andAugust-September of eachyear, andthe Governmenthas agreedto be heldaccountable for
completing the actions thus defined while inreturn its partners have agreed to provide financial
support on a more predictable basis and increasingly inthe form of programmatic support. The
most recent review meeting took place inMarch-April 2004, and was based on Government
plans (as reflected inthe PARPA, the PES, andthe PAF matrices) and achievements (as
described inits BdPES, budget execution reports, and various monitoring reports completed in
the recent past) over 2003. This review consisted ina backward-looking exercise that assessed
 Government performance over 2003, and a forward-looking exercise that articulatedmore fully
the partners' priorities for 2004 and beyond, through agreement on a revised core PAF matrix.
Twenty working groups completed detailed reviews inassigned areas,' and subsequently a
 supra-technical steering group, chaired by the MPF, reviewed the group outputs and, in
 consultation with line ministries and the G15 donorsY2articulated a revised PAFmatrix o f key
 overall actions and indicators against which the Government agreed to be held accountable over
the mediumterm (2003-06) (see Annex 2). The overall conclusions and recommendations o f
this Joint Review are presentedinBox 1(on page 13).


   The technicalworking groups focusedon: (i)growth andmacroeconomicstability; (ii)           poverty; (iii)
                                                                                                           monitoring

          Box 1: Overall conclusionsand recommendations of the March-April 2004 Joint Review
     Implementation in 2003: The Joint Review found that PARPA implementation in2003 was broadly
  positive. Data from the 2002-03 householdsurvey show that the poverty headcountand poverty gap fell
  sharply, while growth was strong. PAF outcometargets inPARPA priority sectors (education, health,
  agriculture and infrastructure) were largely met. Interms of cross-cuttingreforms, notable achievements in
  2003 were the revision of the labor decree, the financial audit of BIM,the rise intax revenues, integration
  of PARPA implementation reporting into the BdPES, passingofthe decentralizationlaw and introduction
  of districtplanning in21 districts, functional analyses inkey sectors, the launching of a corruption survey,
  approval ofthe legal andjustice sector strategic plan, and good progress with implementing SISTAFE.
  Nonetheless, the Review found some shortfalls inmeetingPAF outcometargets and fulfilling PAF priority
  actions. EP1 completion rates fell short oftarget and are off-track for meetingthe MDG goal. Progress in
  roadsrehabilitation andperiodic maintenancewas slow due inpart to appreciationofthe Randand concerns
  within the VAT refundsystem. Pro-poor spendingin2003 was below the 67% PARPA target. The new
  procurement decree was not yet adopted, and legal andjudicial reform was slow, with a continuedpoor
  record inprosecutingcorruption cases and arise incaseload backlog. Itwas also notedthat Government
  operationswere hamperedby the fact that donors' disbursements didnot arrive inatimely manner.
     Priorities for 2004: The Review confirmedthe importanceof implementingpriorities outlined inthe
  2004 PAF and wider commitmentsidentified inthe 2004 PES. Emphasiswas placed on acceleratingthe
  implementation ofthe national HIVIAIDS responseprogram and on initiating a forensic audit of BAu.
  Plans to improve planning andbudgetingby streamlining and clarifying the M&Esystemand improving
  budget execution and transparency (by fully reflectingthe functional classification) were welcomed. The
  Review stressed the importanceofthe Government's good governance priorities for 2004 to adopt anew
  procurement code and movethe legal andjudicial reformprogram from planningto action. Actions
  proposedon aVAT taskforce, customs clearances, labor regulationsandbusiness registration were
  confirmed as important for improving the investmentclimate, and partners urged action to implement
  commitments inthe areas ofexternalaudit and procurement. Inthe macroeconomic area, strongsupport
  was given to Government's commitmentsto controllinginflation, by limitingliquidity andrecourseto
  banking-sectorfinancing for the budgetand by donors disbursingfunds more evenly andpredictably over
  the financial year; and to helping reduceinterestrates, by implementing acareful and sustainedfinancial
  sector reformprogram that increasesbanking-sectorcompetition. Reflecting the country's changing
  priorities, ina few cases, actions from the 2004 PES were addedto or chosento replace actions previously
  identified inthe PAF matrix. These included submittingthe revised commercial code to parliament,
  divesting public equities inthe banking sector, reforming the insurancesector, increasingresources
  allocatedto anti-corruption units, and reforming and unifying the prison system. Moreover, it was agreed
  that some PAF indicators inthe health and educationsectors shouldbe exchanged for others from the PES,
  since they would give a better indication ofperformance. A limitednumber of2004 PES actions were also
  highlighted as being very important for PARPA implementation in2004. These included accelerating
  procurementreform, achieving budget execution accordingto PARPA priority sectors, and ensuringa
  smooth flow of funds during the year by establishingsounddisbursementtargets.
     Isyues to be considered for 2005 PESE'AF and budget. It was agreedthat the key issues to be
  consideredduring the 2005 PES and OE process would largely relate to continuing and strengtheningsector
  strategies andthe cross-cuttingreforms underway. Inthe latter area, these would include completion ofthe
  forensic audit of BAuand implementation of IAS inthe financial sector, submissionof anew and less
  restrictive labor law to parliament, considerationof setting quarterly disbursementtargets, implementing
  programbudgeting, extending SISTAFE implementation, achieving progresson procurementreform,
  strengtheningaudit functions, hrtherintroducing participatory district planning, implementingrestructuring
  plans inthe key Governmentministries, approving an affordable medium-termpay policy, approving and
  implementing of a responsiveanti-corruption action plan, andsimplifying key codes and laws.
     Inconclusion, the Joint Review foundthat goodprogresshadbeenachievedinanumber ofareas, giving
  areliable basis for the G14 donors andthe World Bank to continueto provide budgetor balance-of-
  payments support to Mozambique.


33.      TheJoint Review's PAF matrix, of which thepolicy actions and triggers to be
completed with the support of the PRSC are a subset, has clarified the relationship between
inputs, outputs,and expected outcomes in the PARPA. Outcome indicators specified inthe
matrix are being usedto measure the achievement of development goals, butbecause these
indicators are subject to external risks or assumptions about the behaviors of stakeholders outside

the Government's control, the Government andmost ofits partners agreed that output indicators
would be utilized to measure Government performance annually as the basis for release of
budget support. A subset o fthese output indicators will consist o f policy actions and constitute
prior actions and triggers to be completed before the approval o f eachPRSC.

34.    SincePARPA implementation is occurringthrough Governmentsystems, the
Governmenthas begun to align thePARPA with its MTFF,PES, and annual budget. It has
also encouraged donors to align their annual review anddecision-making processes with the
Government calendar. Figure4 describes the ideal sequencing to be reached ina "steady state",
towards which there i s necessarily a transition, andFigure 5 how the PRSC i s embedded inthe
PAF M&E structure and developed over its three-year life. Specific changes include that:

       PARPA implementationwill be aligned with the Government's financial year (January to
       December). The measuremento f output andoutcome targets would be aligned with the
       measurement of fiscal outturns and reported inMPF's annual report on PES
       implementation to the parliament, the BdPES, inlate February or early March.
       The sequence and timing of existing SWAP review processes will be aligned with the
       annual PARPA and PES review process, which would occur about two months after the
       end o fthe fiscal year (i.e. inlate February or early March), thus allowing fiscal results
       from the previous fiscal year (January to December) to inform these reviews.
       The PARPA andPES review would precede Government-G15 agreement on an updated
       PAF matrix. This would allow all parties to review past progress andmake indicative
       commitments on the basis o f actual outcomes inthe previous fiscal year.
       The PER process will be annualized andintegrated into the cycle by being split into two
       parts-a review ofthe outturnso fthe previous fiscal year will be undertakenintime for
       the annual PARPA and PES review, and inaddition evaluation o f the budget for the next
       fiscal year's budget will occur separately inAugust/September, before MPF finalizes and
       submits the budget to parliament.


D. Credibilityof the BudgetProcess

35.    The Governmentof Mozambique has madeprogress in improvingmacroeconomic
management and budgetformulation, execution,and reporting, thoughfurther work remains
to be done. During200I,the IMFand the Bank engaged the Government, inthe context of the
HIPC initiative, inan overall plan for public expenditure management reform which draws on
different elements, including the 2001 PER, SISTAFE, and items inthe Fund's last Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement. This exercise developed 15 benchmarks o f
the quality ofpublic expenditure management. As of January 2004, Mozambique (inline with
many HIPC countries) metonly five (see Table 7). The actionplans developedinthe context o f
the PERs o f 2001 and2003, the CFAA and the CPAR, reportedinAnnex 3, summarize the key
problemsinpublic expendituremanagement as well as the status ofthe actions which the
Government is takingto improve the situation.

completed an adjustment through demand restriction. The effects of this adjustment are likely to

affect the economy for some time. Onthe fiscal side, the late 1990s saw a large expansionin
spending, whichis now expectedto be contained to 26% of GDP by 2006. Growth averaged
8.6% from 1997 to 2003 (Table 8), but there is no room for complacency. Over the medium
term, highgrowth rates, inparticular inagriculture, will dependon increasingproductivity,
which inturndepends on satisfactorily addressingkey constraints such as landuse rights,
transportation costs and volatile international prices. Mozambique is also experiencing the
consequences of easy money inthe late 1990s. Inthe mid 1990s,reorganization of the banking
systemandtight moneyresultedinsingle-digit inflation, but loose monetary policy in 1999 (M2
growth was 35%) brought inflationto 13% in2000 and, as the exchange rate weakenedpari
passu, it roseto 17% in2002. Inresponse, monetary policy during 2002 was steadily tightened
by increasingreserve requirementsand raisingthe bank rate. Inflation finally fell back to 9% by
the endof2002, at the cost of extremely highinterest rates (35% at end-2002). Partly as aresult
of these high interest rates, it is believed that Mozambique's small and medium-sized enterprise

  37.      Deficits after grants were less than 3% until 2000, when they began to rangefrom 6%
  to 8%(see Table 9). A prudentfiscal and monetary stance, accompanied by substantial external
  assistanceand structural reforms based mainly on privatization, tax and customs reform and
  trade liberalization, resultedinlow inflation, highprivate investment andhighgrowth rates. At
  the same time, since 1998 there has been a shift inresources infavor ofhealth, education and
  agriculture, reflecting an increasing anti-poverty focus. Education, health and agriculture
  increased their combined share intotal budgetary allocations from 29% in 1998 to 39% in2001.

  38.     Since 2000,fiscalpolicy has resulted in high deficits before grants, rising to about 20%
  in2001 and2002. These results were dueto asubstantialincrease inspending, whichgrew at
  17% annually inreal terms from 1997to 2002, andwhich was not matched by higher revenue
  (though revenue growth was also high). The major factors behindthis sharp increasein 1999-
  2002 were: (i)     the Government's paymentof capital contributions into BAuandBCM/BIM,
 pari passu with its shareholdings inthese loss-making banks; (ii) increase inthe civil service
                                                                                      an
  wage billof 46% inreal terms (growth of 13%per year); and (iii) social spending made higher
 possible by debt relief granted under the HIPC initiative.

  39.     Thefiscalposition of 2000-02 cannot be maintained and will be correctedby
  increasing revenues and constraining expenditures. The Government's deficit levels to date
  have been possible only due to high levels of foreign grants. While external assistance is likely
  to remain high inthe short run, inthe longrunit i s likely to converge towards the 6-8% average
  for sub-SaharanAfrica. Therefore, fiscal adjustment, involvinga relatively demanding revenue
  effort with measures to restrain expenditures, has become apriority of Government policy.
  Although there is no IMF-monitoredprogram at present(the previous PRGF arrangement
  expired inJune 2003 and anew arrangementwill be presentedto the IMF's Board inJune 2004),
  the IMFandthe Government have agreeda fiscal framework (see Table 10) under which the
  overall deficit is programmedto fall to -3.2% of GDP in2006.

  40.     The macroeconomicframework envisages important changes on the revenue and
  spendingsides. The macroeconomic scenario presented inTable 10 i s basedon reasonable
  assumptionsof economic growth, revenuecapability, anddonor contributions. The fluctuations
  ingrowth reflect the large-scaleprojects (withtheir contributions risingduringconstruction) as
  well as other direct foreign investment, continued donor support, and agricultural expansion.
  Budget revenueshave beengrowing fast andsteadily, increasing by 10% per annum inreal terms
  between1998and2003 from $450 millionequivalent in 1998to about $610million in2003.
  For sustainability, revenue should reach 16% to 17%percent by 2010, and this target is



                                                              19

achievable. O nthe expenditure side, spendingi s programmedto fall, inline with the medium-
term perspective o f the PAWA, from 34.1% o f GDP in2002 to 25.8% in2006. This represents
a considerable reduction (two percentage points per year) but inreal terms expenditures are still
growingat 4% per year between 2002 and 2010, so it is not politically unrealistic. Inaddition,
this effort shouldbe accompanied by re-focusing public expendituresonpriority areaswhile
improvingthe efficiency and poverty incidence of public spending.

4I. I n 2003, the Governmentreceived $655 million either throughpolicy-based lending or
budget support, and in FY04 the Government's budgetprojects receipts of $710 million.
Projected receipts include the credit that i s before the Boardtoday. Ifthis credit were not made
available to the Government, Mozambique law requires that the budgetwould need to be revised
either to reduce projected expenditures by the credit amount or to show alternative methods o f
financing the ensuing gap.

(3)      Budgetformulation

42.      Like many countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Mozambique experiences weak
government leadership and limited prioritization in budgetformulation. Historically, this has
been linked with a limitedorientation towards results and limitedexperience inresults-based
management. Partly due to the substantial external aid that Mozambique receives, the
Government i s not always able to direct expenditures inline with nationally-determined
objectives. Because the MTFF i s not well integrated into the budgetprocess, annual budget
adjustmentsare made across lines and institutions without taking into account previous
performance or emerging needs, which means that the Government is not making informed,
strategic, and contestable choices on inter- and intrasectoral resource allocations. Moreover, the
policy process does not always and explicitly consist inGovernment formulation o f a strategy,
which donors then agree to finance inspecified parts. Instead, donors makeproject proposals
and, ina decentralized fashion, the Government commits itselfto implementing some o f those
projects. The result i s a poorly-integrated mosaic o f programs based on different philosophies,
o f differing quality, and with widely differing cost structures. The symptoms o f this fundamental
problem manifest themselves inseveral forms:

    0    Financialprojections inthe MTFFand P A W A are loosely relatedto actions undertaken.
    0    Government strategies can consist inbroadly expressed ideals and statements o f intention
         to produce precise analyses and recommendations (e.g. the Health Sector Strategic Plan).
    0    Outcomes are often not measured or reported, and ingeneral have a weak connection
         with the policyprocess.
    0    Program data are limited. Basic information such as their geographical location, the
         intendedbeneficiaries, disbursements, measures o f their outputand impact, and so forth
         are not systematically collected or reported, with the result that they can be hardto find,
         includinginthe key social sectors (education, health, water and sanitation).
    0    Actual donor financing for any givenfiscal year is hardto obtain, and so it i s also hardto
         obtain information on unit costs and almost impossible, without a dedicated PER-type o f
         exercise, to compare the relative efficiency o f differing approaches and programs.

43.      The main objectives of the 2004 budget are to increase domestic revenues, allocate
about 65%of total expendituresto the PARPA'spriority sectors, and increase budget deposits
in the banking system to decreasedomestic debt and contribute to lowering inflation.


                                                  20

 Revenues are expectedto reach 14.6% of GDP in2004, comparedto 14.3% in2003, with
 additional revenues generatedthrough enhancedtax administration. Total expendituresandnet
 lending will be reducedfrom 29.4% of GDP in2003 to 27.7% in2004. Salaries and other
remunerationare expectedto decrease (from 7.5% of GDP in2003 to 7.3% in2004), and goods
 and services are expectedto increase (from 3.9% of GDP to 4.0%). Interest payments will
 continue to be somewhat elevated, at about 1.2% of GDP, with about 75% being for domestic
 debt obligations.

 (c)     Budget execution

44.      Preliminary budget executionfiguresfor 2003 indicate that the overall share of actual
expenditures allocated to the PARPApriority sectors, excluding election spending and interest
payments, was 64.9%. Within this, the priority sectorsreceivedjust below 50% of the recurrent
budget but over 75% ofthe total investment budget. The variability betweenthe budget and
actual spendinginMozambique remains a concern. The overall recurrentbudget i s usually
implementedwithin 9598% ofplannedspending, while averagevariability inthe capital budget
over the past ten years hasbeen around 80-85%, with the biggest variation by far coming in
donor disbursements. This may indicate an absorption problem, butmuchof the explanation for
the large difference betweenbudgetedaid andreportedbudgetoutturn is under-reportingand, to
 some extent, overly optimistic budgeting for grant-funded donor-run projects. By reducing
variability indonor disbursements,the shift to budget support should reduce the variability in
Mozambique's capital budget.

 45.     Functional classi@ers have been introduced into the budget to enable the identification
of poverty-reducing expenditures, as agreed in 2001, but important additional work remains to
 be done to bring it to the appropriate level of detail. Inparticular, the functional, territorial and
 organic classifiers needto be revised for use inthe budget andthe budget execution reports, and
the Government needs to proceedwith its plansto introduce a source-of-funds classifier which
will enable it to track the source of funds for specific projects. Inthis context, too, the
 Government needs to do more work both(i) capture all funds that are "off-b~dget"~-and
                                                    to
 (ii)makethebudgetexecutionreportsmeaningful(the4Q-FY03reportlackedanalysis,and
    to
there are discrepancies betweenMPF and sectoral data). The implementation of SISTAFE
 should helpto ensure the incorporation of donor funding for particular projects as well as a
 clearer picture ofbudget execution patterns through the application of the functional classifiers.

46.      The 2003PER showed that some sectors in Mozambique regularly underspend while
others overspend. Underspending especially affects the water and health sectors, and insome
years the roads sector. The water sector spent an average of 63% of its current budget allocation
over 1999to 2001, while the health sector spent 86% of its recurrent budget in 1999 and 80% in
2000. Provincial spending also appears to be unequal, though this impressionmay arise from
 incomplete data coverage as data do not reflect some centralized activities. There are also
considerable intra-province differences inexecution rates: for example, inZambCziainthe
health sector, execution rates for the 1999budget range from 98% to 52%. The PER 2003 found
that there are two main causes of underspending: (i)          a lack of capacity to operate the duode`cimo

~~




  While the MPF through cross-checkinghas beenableto track an estimated38% oftotal donor off-budget flows
andreport on those funds through the budget,the failure of donors to ensure that their funds are capturedby the
MPF continuesdirectly to disempower the MPF vis-a-vis spendingagencies that receive substantialfimds directly
 from donors.

allocation system, which involves replenishingaccounts against a rendering o f accounts (viz.
proofo f correct use o f the funds) inthe previous month; and (ii)timing problem, as late arrival
                                                                   a
o fthe first duode`cimos puts some sectors, whose greatest needs arise at the beginningo fthe
year (for example, education), indifficulty. The replenishment arrangement, which i s standard
inthe region, is appropriate becauseit creates apowerful incentive for accountability andhelps
limit overspending. Yet trainingcontinues to beneededinaccountingandthe use ofthe
duode`cimo system to make it work without undue delays. The timingproblem can be addressed
by having the relevantsectoral ministriesagree with MPF to align the time patternof advances
more closely to the time pattern o f expenditures. Starting in2005 with the rollout o f SISTAFE,
this arrangement should change: more operational unitswill be broughtunderthe single treasury
account and cash advances will be eliminated as operational units instead will make
commitments for whichthe payments will be executed by the treasury.

47.   Over thepastfew years, the Bank has worked with the Government and other donors to
completean extensive review of Mozambique's publicfinancial management arrangements,
coveringitspublic expenditure,procurement andfinancial management systems. A CFAA
was completed inDecember 2001;a CPAR inearly 2004; andPERs inDecember 2001 and
September 2003. A full account o fthis analytical work can be found inAnnex 3. Boththe
Bank's October 2003 CAS andthis PRSC seriesare designed to support implementationofthe
action plans included inthese documents.

                        IV. THE WORLD BANKGROUP STRATEGY

48.      Theproposed PRSCl is based on the Government'sstrong record over thepast ten
years in successfully implementing macroeconomicand structural reforms supported by the
Bank, the IMF, and other donors. Successive PRGF reviews, PERs, and supervision missions
for the Bank's adjustment operationhave confirmed these achievements.

A. Consistency of the PRSCwith the CAS

49.      ThePRSC is consistent with the CAS. The base case scenario o fthe CAS for FY04-07
envisages a PRSC to support Mozambique's efforts inbuildingpublic-sector capacity and
accountability, improving the investment climate, and expanding service delivery and as a basis
for sustainable development. It was planned that the Bank through the PRSC would
systematically addressthe issues o fpoverty reduction across sectors identified inthe PARPA.
To support the implementation o f the PARPA, efforts to maintainmacroeconomic stability will
continue, but the focus is increasingly shifting to cross-cutting public sector management and to
sector-level issues, with the key challenge being to replicate a strong macroeconomic policy and
implementationrecord at the sector level to facilitate economic transformation and permanent
poverty reduction. One o f the key CAS objectives i s to achieve a full alignment o f Bank
instruments withthe principles o f local ownership and leadership. Because Government policies
andthe Government budget are the key instruments for implementingthe PARPA, the Bank is
committed increasingly to providing assistance inthe form o f balance o f payments support.
Over the medium term, and provided that the Government achieves expected improvements in
budget formulation and execution, the PRSC, accompanied by appropriate technical assistance,
will become the maininstrument for policy dialogue andthe transfer of financial resources.




                                                 22

50.      Thisshijl in lending modalities is needed because investmentprojects have been
characterized by variable local ownershipandpoor integration with Government-funded
sectoral activities, with the result that impact andsustainabilityhas been low. As donors
(including the Bank) have attempted to "ringfence" the service-delivery systems intheir projects
usingfree-standing technical assistance, foreign experts, andquasi-independent PIUs, they have
failed to achieve improvements inGovernment systems for service delivery. Instead, investment
projects have tended to: (i)     involve hightransaction costs; (ii)
                                                                  promote inefficient spending (as
aid has been "tied" to donor-sourced goods and services andlor allocated to donors' favored
projects); (iii) the effectiveness o f Government structures by promoting parallel structures,
                  lower
off-budget expenditures, and special staffing arrangements; (iv) corrode the normal structures o f
accountability by making government account to donors rather thanto the Administrative
Tribunal andNational Assembly; and (v) impedepredictability inbudgetary resources, due to the
wide range o f disbursement conditions and implementation requirements connected to large
numbers of projects. To correct these imbalances, the Government has asked donors to shift to
programmatic lending. Such a shift i sjustified on three grounds: (i)  the PARPAandthe PAF
matrix have evolved into the overarching framework for policy dialogue and formulation both
withinMozambique andbetween the Government andmost ofits externalpartners; (ii)           progress
on the macroeconomic front has lessenedthe need for traditional adjustment lending; and (iii)
progress inplanning and budget management provides increasing confidence that public
resource allocations are consistent with the Government's poverty-reduction priorities.

51.     I t is envisaged that the transitionto general budget support will be a gradual one.
PRSC support will coexist initially with investment support to well-articulated sector programs
andtechnical assistanceto the development o f government systems and capacities necessary for
an increased reliance on those systems and capacities to channel external support. The share o f
programmatic financing inoverall financing inFY04 andFY05 will be approximately 35% (or
$120 million in $295 million o f newfinancing over the two years taken together). PRSCl will
cover primarily cross-cutting issues, policy dialogue, and other Government actions with no
physical impact, while PRSC2 and 3 will increasingly embrace sectoral support (agriculture and
health inFY04; educationand rural water supply inFY05), thus enabling both Bank and
Government learning and a continued evaluation o fthe appropriateness o fthis approach. Within
each supported sector, poverty priorities will be specified inthe context o f PARPA
implementation as reportedinthe BdPES. The PRSC recognizes that conditionality initself i s
ineffective inimproving economic policy andthat domestic considerations, which are relatively
immuneto donor pressures, are the primefactor inachieving and sustaining economic and
institutionalreform. Domestic support for reforms i s particularly important at this stage in
Mozambique's development, to cushion against a potential backlash from utility and
infrastructure privatization and to ensure policy continuity into the new Government (to be
elected inDecember 2004), and so the PRSC will continue to draw conditions from the PAF
matrix as revised from time to time through biennialjoint reviews.

B. SupportingPARPAimplementationthrougha PRSC

52.     Theprimary aim of the PRSC is to help achieve, and monitor progress toward
achieving,a strategic subset of the objectives defined in the updatedPAF matrix. Given the
fact that this i s the first cycle of PRSC multisectoral program support, a strong focus on PARPA
implementation processes is required. Disbursements will be contingent on progress toward a
subset o fthe PARPA's medium-term objectives, as set out inthe biennially updated PAF matrix
agreed betweenthe Government and its external partners. Particular emphasis i s put on


                                                  23

establishing an adequate M&E system for the prior actions andtriggers included inthe PRSC
series, takingcare to ensure that this system also strengthens the Government's poverty
monitoring system, includingthe Poverty Observatory. The information derived from the M&E
system will permit an assessment o f the impact and results o f PRSC-supported activities, and
future PRSC operations will be contingent on demonstrated progress against these activities.
Finally, the resources provided throughthe PRSC will complement Government andother donor
resources infinancing priority programs for poverty reduction-including       particularly budget
andbalance-of-payments support providedbythe G15.

53.      ThePRSCseries will also serve as the vehiclefor policy dialogue on buildingpublic-
sector capacity and accountability, with a strongfocus on strengtheningpublicfinancial
management; improving the investment climate; and (in PRSC2 and PRSC3) expanding
service delivery. The PRSC series will leverage the Bank's policy dialogue, and other Bank and
donor instrumentswill be usedto provide technical assistanceto define and implement reforms,
including support to the public sector reform program, legal andjudicial reform, regulatory
reform in selected infrastructure sectors, anddecentralization to municipalities and district
authorities. The PRSC series will also be complementary to parallel efforts to reduce income
poverty, supported through a large portfolio o f investment projects aiming to fight HIV/AIDS
andexpandaccess to education, water andsanitation, energy andtransportationservices. As o f
March2004, total Bank commitments amounted to $810million($8 1million grants), o fwhich
$474 million was allocated to these priority sectors and $101millionto public sector reform,
includingdecentralization of planningand managementauthority to local levels (see Table 11).

C. Alignment betweenthe Bankand other donors insupportof the PARPA

54.      Consultations between the Government and the G15 donors in 2003-04 emphasized
four goals and mechanismsfor coordinatingpolicy dialogue, taking into account the desire
for greater coherenceand efficiency in supportingpoverty reduction initiatives:

    0    The overall development program for Mozambique i s set out inthe PARPA and all
         external support should be aligned with the PAF matrix, which serves as the framework
         for determining priorities and assessingthe impact o f chosen interventions.
    0    Coherence inpolicy dialogue around the PARPA andthe progress review process applies
         not only to cross-cutting issues but also to sectoral interventions.
    0    Efficiency indonor approaches to policy dialogue, performance assessment, andproject
        management i s essential to delivering effective support for poverty reduction. Given the
        hightransaction costs ofmultiple policy dialogues andmultiple systems o fprocurement,
         financial management, monitoring andreporting for projects, the G15 donors agreed the
         goals of rationalizing and ensuring consistency indialogue and performance assessment
         andusing Government systems, processes, andprocedures to the fullest extent possible.
    0    General budget support helps to enhance the flexibility and predictability o f aid flows.

55.     Agreement on theseprinciples leads to mutual accountability-of          the donors to the
Government and of the Government to the donors and to its citizens. Inthis context, it was
agreed that the donors should increase the share o f their financing that i s channeled through the
budgetand, inorder to increase donor confidence inthe fiduciary system, the Government
should aggressively pursue its program o fpublic financial management reform, including
procurement reform, improved accounting and auditing, and implementation o f SISTAFE. To



                                                 24

this end, the Government andthe G15 donors, which together account for morethanxx% oftotal
official development assistance andxx% o f general budgetsupport to Mozambique, have
established ajoint program to support PARPA implementation, centered around the PAF matrix.
InApril 2004, a Memorandum o fUnderstanding (MoU) was negotiated betweenthe
Governmentandthe G15 as a basis for harmonizing the G15 financing instruments, ensuring
predictable flows, minimizing transactions costs, and ensuringconsistency o f policy dialogue.
As is the case for other participatingdonors, withinthe framework o f the MoU,the Bankretains
flexibility to determine specific benchmarks and form an independent judgment as to whether the
Government has made significant progress. Nonetheless, all parties to these documents are
committed to minimizing differences to the greatest extent possible, inan effort to achieve

agreed efficiency objectives and greaterpredictability inresourceflows. As an example ofthe
Bank's commitment to harmonization, all seven triggers for PRSC2 are explicitly includedinthe
restricted PAF matrix agreedbetweenthe Government and its partners inApril 2004.

56.      It is expectedthat the PRSCwill bealignedwiththe IMF's nextPRGF
arrangement. Mozambique hashadfour Fund-supportedprograms since 1987. The IMF
concludedthe fifth and final review of its most recent program, a PRGF arrangement, inJune
2003 and, inline with new guidelines for prolongedusers of Fundresources, staff subsequently
preparedan ex-post assessment ofprogressunder this andprevious programs. To helpaddress
the unfinishedagenda, including inparticular inmattersthat fall into the Fund's core
competencies(fiscal consolidation, financial sector reform, andmonetary andexchangerate
management), the Government requesteda successor Fundprogram. Inlight ofthe
Government's request, Fundstaff completed discussions on a macroeconomic framework for
2004-06 as well as structural reforms to be supportedby a successor arrangement, which, if
approved, would offer Mozambique IMFresources at levels below its quota. It is expectedthat a
new PRGF arrangement will be presentedto the Fund's Board on June 21,2004, just before this
PRSC is presented, thus enabling the Bank andthe Fundto alignthe PRSC andPRGF cycles.

D. Analytic Underpinningsofthe PRSC

57.     As Table 12 shows, the first PRSC series is builton analytical work that was completed
inimplementing the PARPA andthat informsthe PRSCwithrespectto the adequacyofpolicies
and institutions inareas relating to fiduciary and environmental safeguards.

58.     Poverty assessment: Usingthe nationally representativehousehold surveys of 1996-07
and 2002-03, the poverty headcount is estimatedto have fallen from 69% to 54% inthe
intervening period. Thus, the goal set inthe PARPA of a poverty rate of 60% by 2005 has
already beenachieved, with the reductions slightly swifter inrural areas. These findings, which
indicate that the Government's overall poverty program is on the right track and achieving
results, broadly agree with results from other data sources: (i)MADERdataindicate that the per
capita growth rate of cereal crop productionwas 14% inthe six-year period 1996-2002(Le., a
little over 2% annually); (ii)qualitative indicators survey (QUIBB) in2000/01 found that
                              a
poverty had decreased by ninepercentagepoints, using an econometric technique to linkthe
(purely qualitative) QUIBB with the household survey of 1996; (iii)     agricultural surveys indicate
growth of total maize output of 7% per annum 1996-2002, while the median crop income per
capita increased27%; (iv) inthe householdand agricultural surveys, dramatic increaseswere
found inthe numbersof bicycles, radios and other assets over 1996-2003; and finally (v)
education and health indicator surveys found strong improvements, particularly inthe areas of
primary school attendance, vaccination coverage, and attendedbirths, over 1996-2003.

59.     Country economicmemorandum:The last CEMwas preparedinFebruary 2001, in
close collaboration with the Government. Its recommendations,which are still relevant today,
focused on identifying Government actions requiredto improve macroeconomic stability,
agricultural productivity, private-sector-led growth, andprotecting the natural resourcebase (see
paragraph 18). A new CEM, now under preparation, will reviewthe findings of the 2001 CEM,
update its recommendations,and (inlight o f the recent poverty assessment) analyze more fully
the linkages betweenpoverty andeconomic growth inMozambique. Itwill also develop policies
for the optimal use of natural resources-including   land, forestry, fisheries, mining and water-



                                                26

and integrate their management into the overall growth strategy andthe general policy debate
about growth. Analytical work on rural development and tourism, supported by the Bank, will
contribute to this exercise. Some o f the findings of these inquiries are expected to be
incorporatedinto the new PAWA for the period 2006-2010.

the CFAA) and FY04 ina participatory process that brought together central and sectoral
government institutions, local and international academic and research institutes, the private
sector, and a variety o f donors. The recommendations o fthese PERs focus on improving budget
formulation, execution and reporting to enable better tracking and informed decision-making
concerning poverty-relatedexpenditures. As the Bank and other donors provide larger
proportions o ftheir assistance inthe form o f budget or balance-of-payments support, the PER
process will be annualized and closely integratedwith the Government's budget cycle to support
specific reforms inthe budgetprocess. The objective o f these annual PERs will be, in'thefirst
instance, to open the budget process within the executive and to stakeholders beyond the
executive, to integrate donor financing within the budget, andto provide required technical
support. To improve results-based M&E, some public expenditure analysis andreview will be
progressively integrated into the cycle of financial management (e.g. through analyzing several
sectors eachyear). This will require buildingcapacity through, inter alia, creating a cadre o f
public policy analysts, as MPF is now seeking to do in-house.

have also been completed. All notedrecent improvements andcontinuing challenges in

issues. Government actions being supported by the PRSC series will play a central role in
helpingto implement these action plans (see Annex 3).

62.     Procurement: A CPAR was preparedin 2003 and the Government agreed with its
findings, including the key recommendations o f the Action Plan. Inline with these
recommendations, and with the support o fthis PRSC, a newprocurement decree following
international practice will be submittedto Parliament for approval, following consultations with
main stakeholders. Dissemination workshops for the new procurement legislationare being
planned, and a new Central Policy Directoratewill be established. Inaddition, new national
standard biddingdocuments are being drafted and capacity-building programs inprocurement
will be offeredto staff inkey ministries. These new procurement practices will be integrated
into SISTAFE, with the result that procurement practices will become clearer and more
transparent, leading to fewer procurement problems and therefore lower procurement costs.

63.     Financialsector analyses: Since 2000, the Bank has completed a study o f the financial
sector, M A on Mozambique's compliance with the Base1Principles, and a formal financial
sector assessmentjointly with the IMF (FSAP). The May 2003 FSAPassessment found that the
potential vulnerabilities of the banking system lie mostly inits loan portfolio; that banksare
exposed to highcredit risk due to highand volatile lending rates (themselves due to volatile
inflation, highinterest rate spreads and a poor lending environment); that highinterest rate
spreads result from large provisioning requirements, highoverheads, and (for smaller well-run
banks) highprofit margins; and that the poor lendingenvironment results from highcorporate
leverage, a low number o fbankable projects, a weak repayment culture, and various legal and
institutional impedimentsto credit selection and recovery. It also found that the volatility o f the
metical threatens financial sector stability and development by promoting dollarization and
raisingthe cost o f domestic public debt. The PRSC addresses a number o f these issues by
supporting Government action to strengthen banking supervision; improve market oversight
through transitioning the banks to international accounting standards (IAS); complete the
Government's divestiture from the bankingsystem; and improve the lending environment
throughneeded legalreforms (including the adoptiono f a newCommercial Code). Inaddition, a
proposed Financial Sector Technical Assistance (TA) investment project will provide follow-up
TA to facilitate the implementation ofthe mainFSAPrecommendations.

64.     Legal andjudicial sector assessment: This Bank assessment, which is under
Government review, found that: (i)    Mozambique's legal andjudicial sector institutions have not
keptpace with economic growth inthe 199Os, with the result that public confidence inthem is
low and they are now perceived to be a deterrent to investment and a hindrance to growth; (ii)
the sector's keyproblem is arelative lack o f skilledhumanresources; (iii) sector needsto
                                                                             the
develop results-focused management practices and a culture of accountability for results; (iv)
while some laws (e.g. regarding landand labor) are a hindrance to growth and shouldberevised,
the main effort should focus not on legislative but on administrative reform; (v) sector
institutions must fight andbe seen to fight corruption, or their reform efforts overall will become
irrelevant. The PRSC series responds to these findings by including conditionality linkedto


                                                 28

corruption; helpingto institute a results-focused management process within Government; and
benchmarking Government actions intended to improve the administration o fjustice and also to
be supported through a proposed Legal and Judicial Sector Capacity-Building project.

65.      Investment climate assessment (ICA): The Bank, together with the Investment
Promotion Center and the Confederation o f Economic Associations o f Mozambique, completed
an I C A in2003. From an analysis o f 193 firms surveyed in2002, the I C A found that the most
severe constraints to doing business inMozambique included: (i)      lack o f access to and the high
cost o f finance (cited by 78% o f the sample); (ii)Mozambique's uncertain policy environment;
(iii) costsimposedbyregulatoryandadministrativeprocedures;andfinally(iv)inadequate
     the
infrastructure. The PRSC series will help the Government to complete actions designed to ease
some o fthese key constraints, including with respect to the time and cost involved inregistering
a business; labor regulations governing short-term hires, expatriate hires andretrenchment
benefits; the time involved inclearing imports and exports, including inparticular at the Ressano
Garcia border post with South Africa; as well as the cost and reliability of electricity and
telecommunications services. Policy dialogue will also address emergingissues, such as undue
delays inthe Government payment of VAT refunds.

66.      Rural development strategy: The Government is expected to complete its rural
development strategy by the end o f 2004. This strategy i s expected to underpin a revised
PARPA(expected in2005) and couldprovide the framework for a new reform agenda. A draft
Government concept note indicates that the strategic vision i s to increase the resources available
for holistic rural development. Key elements o f the strategy include: (i)    sustainable rural
development with a multi-disciplinary andpluralistic approach to poverty, social and gender
equity, local economic development, natural resource management, and governance; and (ii)         an
agriculture focus that is achieved by integrating infrastructure, technologies, institutions and
capacity-building, non-farm activities, andhumancapital development. The strategy is expected
to benefit from the poverty assessment andthe agriculture income survey that were bothrecently
completed. With a view to informing Government work on the strategy, the Bank i s currently
helping to complete strategic pieces o f sector work on rural finance, natural resource
management, public expenditure inthe rural space, community-driven activities, andcommercial
agriculture. The findings and recommendations that emerge from this work will shape the
Bank's support to agriculture and rural development inPRSC2 andPRSC3.

67.      Poverty and SocialImpactAnalysis: Participatory poverty andsocial impact analyses
(PSIAs) are beingcarried out as part o f the monitoring o f PARPA implementation. This
includes work recently initiated by the Bank on the impact o f lowering primary school fees and
plannedwork on labor markets. Inhealth care delivery, a planned exercise inMarginal
Budgetingfor Bottleneckswill helpto estimate the marginal costs o f overcoming bottlenecks in
the availability o f inputs, access, adequacy o f coverage and quality o fthree types o f health sector
services (clinical services, outreach services, and family/community services), thus enabling
decision-makers to choose betweendifferent combinations o f these services to increase coverage
and improve the epidemiological impact o f the service provided.

68.      OEDreview of recent adjustmentlending in Mozambique: DuringFY02, OED inone
document reviewed eight IDA projects, including four adjustment operations, provided to
Mozambique during FY90-FYO1. The adjustment operations aimed to stabilize the post-war
economy, improve public sector management, transform the economy from a centrally-planned
to a market-oriented one, reallocate public spending to poverty-reducing activities, andbegin to


                                                  29

create the conditions for private-sector-led growth. While criticizing the adjustment operations
for having failed to achieve poverty reduction through private-sector-led growth-a    criticism
that the recently-completed poverty assessmentindicates may be misplaced-the        OED review
also identifiedseveral key lessons. First, Government ownership and successful implementation
o f an adjustment program may not suffice to achieve its objectives. Inaddition the operation
needs to be developed infull appreciation o f Mozambique's political economy at the micro level
and complemented byprojectsthat could ameliorate some ofthe weaknesses. This is
particularly true regardingthe ability o f Mozambicans to participate effectively inthe
privatization program. Second, sequencing financial sector reforms is critical to bothfinancial
andprivate sector development. Inparticular, weak state-owned banks should be privatized
before they are restructured or recapitalized; state-owned banks should beprivatized before large
numbers o f other enterprises are privatized, or else inappropriate resource allocation may occur;
state-owned banks should be privatized without permittinga sizeable residual government
ownership, as this ownership could result incontinued connected lending, insolvency and budget
obligations; and the absence o f world-class prudential regulations and supervision as well as a
functioning legal system when the private sector enter the financial sector may invite moral
hazard problems. The PRSC series has taken these lessons into account.

                     V. THE PROPOSEDPRSCl REFORM PROGRAM

A. Overview and Objectives of the PRSC Series

69.     ThePRSCs constitutea series of one-tranche operations over threeyears, designedto
align thepolicy agenda supported by the World Bank with national policy priorities in the
PARPA. The financing needs and levels will be basedonthe medium-termfinancing plan
contained inthe Government's MTFF. While recognizing the importance o f each o fthe
fundamental areas inthe PARPA, the PRSC series will focus the policy dialogue initially on
cross-cutting issues, including particularly ingovernance and public financial management,
before expanding the dialogue to other PARPA priority areas, such as education, healthand
agriculture. Within this general framework, there were four key considerations inMozambique.

    0   Given that this is the first PRSC cycle, a focus on the Government's PARPA
        implementation processes is highly appropriate.
    0   A focus onplanning, budgeting andmanagingpublic service delivery, including through
        government restructuring andthe introduction o f SISTAFE, will have an important
        medium-and long-term benefit for service delivery.
    0   As indicated inthe recent ICA, Mozambique's growth opportunities can only berealized
        through decisive action to address various longstandingconstraints to businesses,
        including the highcost o f banking, labor law inflexibilities, and the highcost involved in
        business registration; hence these are also appropriate areas o f focus.
    0   While the Bank will continue, duringPRSCl,to support sector development programs in
        agriculture and educationthrough existing investmentprojects, policy dialogue inthese
        sectors will shift to the PRSC as these projects close during subsequent PRSC operations.

70.     PRSCl will support cross-sectoralactions to strengthenpublic sectorperformance and
enhance efficiency and effectiveness in the use of public resources. These measures will have
a direct impact on poverty reduction, as they will enhance public sector capacity to implement
poverty reduction programs inthe priority sectors and generate additional funds for poverty


                                                 30

reductionby reducing leakages inthe form o f low allocative or operational efficiency o fpublic
expenditures. Key areas o f reform include strengthening public financial management through
implementingSISTAFE; reformingpublic procurement; reducing aid dependency through
implementingrevenue-enhancing measures; achieving demonstrable results inthe public sector
reform program; advancing decentralization to local authorities; and implementinga sound anti-
corruption strategy. It also supports reducingthe highest tariff levy, from 30% to 25%.

71.     PRSC2 will continueto support actionstostrengthenpublicfinancial management
and will also intensify the Bank's engagementon the investmentclimate. Inparticular, a
decree will be approved establishing new procurement practices that accord with international
standards; a new Financial Institutions law, a bank bankruptcy law, as well as a new Commercial
Code will come into force; and decree 57/03 will be revisedto ease restrictions on hiring foreign
I~
labor. PRSC2 would also begin to add a sectoral focus on agriculture andhealthcare.

       Box 2: Selection criteria applied in choosing the componentsof PRSC1-2 from the PAF matrix

  Inselecting focal areas for PRSC1-2 fromthe PAFmatrix, the Banktook into accountthe followingcriteria:
        Bank's comparativeadvantage: ExtensiveAAA since 2000 has helpedto diagnose the problemsand
        identify solutions regardinginparticular public financial management,governance, andthe investment
        climate. Ithas also equippedthe Bankto provideadvice andtechnicalassistance on designingand
        implementingpolicyand institutionalreformsinthese areas, where donorsare seekingBank leadership.
        Expected developmentalbenefits: The developmentalbenefitsof the conditionsincludedinPRSCs 1and
        2 for povertyreductionare expectedto be high, as they will helpto secure sustainedbroad-basedgrowth
        as well as to improve the efficiency of public spending inthe key poverty-reducingsectors andcreate a
        strongbasis for increasedlendingthroughdevelopmentpolicy operations.
        Governmentownership: Governmentcommitmentto reforms inthe areas indicatedis highand long-
        standing, andit will help to ensurethe successfulimplementationof measuresto improvethe systems.
        Governmentinstitutionalcapacity: Althoughthe Government's capacity insomeofthe reformareas
        (e.g. accounting,auditing, bankingsupervision, and legalandjudicial process) remainslimited,the
        PRSCsandcomplementaryinvestmentprojectsare intendedpreciselyto help strengthenthese capacities.
        Potential role of conditionality: Inmany cases, the conditionalityincludedinthe PRSCswill helpthe
        Govemmentto designthe reformprogramingreaterdetail andensure its implementation.


72.     PRSC3 would consolidatereform efforts regardingpublicfinancial managementand
the investmentclimate, and begin to add a sectoralfocus on education and rural water supply.
The areas o f intensive engagement for PRSC3 are indicative at this stage and would needto be
reconfirmed and specified more concretely duringthe appraisal o f PRSC2 (May 2005).

B. The ProposedCredit

73.     Theprogram that the PRSC will support and that has been agreed between the
Governmentand the G15 is based on thePAF matrix. The Government explicitly designed the
first page o f this core matrix (see Annex 2) to consist inoutcomes that are not directly inits
control, such as the MDGs, and the following pages to include only actions that are directly inits
control. Inrecognition o f this distinction, the PRSC matrix draws its prior actions andtriggers
from the second and thirdpages, while maintaining an important monitoring stance vis-a-vis
actions and indicators appearing on the first page. The Government's commitment to addressing
theMDGsis strong and is reflectedinthe PAWA andthe PAFmatrix; the overall objectives o f
these instruments are to sustain highlevels o f broad-based growth and to reduce poverty. The




                                                        31

program defined inthese instruments, and inthe PRSC program matrix, will be implemented
through Government systems controlled by the Government's PES and its annual budget.

74.     PRSCl benchmarksprogress in completing Governmentactions under three
components, drawnfrom the Government'sLetter of DevelopmentPolicy (Annex 4, para. 5):

        Buildingpublic-sector capacity and accountability: Underthis component, the
        Government i s committedto maintainingmacroeconomic stability, improving public
        financial management, and enhancing governance. The Government will maintain
        macroeconomic stability through adhering to an appropriate macroeconomic framework
        withconsistent fiscal andmonetarypolicies. Itwill improve public financial
        management through: monitoring closely and allocating 65% o f its resources to pro-poor
        spending; increasing budgetaryefficiency, transparency and accountability by expanding
        coverage, ensuringa timely flow o f funds, and implementingSISTAFE; and improving
        the timeliness and quality o fthe national accounts, auditing and budgetary reporting. In
        addition, it will reduce aid dependency through mobilizing further domestic resources;
        deepen its understanding o f the incidence and causes o f poverty through completing and
        analyzing the results o f the second household income survey; and update the PARPA to
        reflect the country's changed circumstances as well as progress inimplementing reforms.
        Finally, the Government aims to improve governance by bringingpublic procurement
        into line with internationalpractice; restructuring its key sectoral ministries to be more
        responsive to citizen needs; decentralizing the delivery o f services to local authorities to
        expand community participation and government accountability; and fighting corruption.
        Improving the investmentclimate: Government action inthis areais intendedto:
        strengthen the financial sector, particularly by enhancing the supervision exercised by the
        central bank and completing the divestiture o f Government ownership inthe banking
        sector; improve the regulatory framework by reducing impediments to entry and exit and
        increasing the flexibility o f the labor law; and expand infrastructure services by reducing
        communicationcosts and makingelectricity less expensive and more reliable-all           with a
        view to makingdomestic productionmore competitive.
        Expansion of service delivery: Government action inthis areaunder PRSC1 is limited.
        It will include enablingprimary schools to finance locally-identified needs for basic
        supplies on a timely basis, through continuing the Direct Support to Schools program,
        which provides all schools with small grants. Inaddition, public expenditure reviews
        and environmentalwork will be completedinthe agriculture and healthsectors in
        preparation for bringingthese two sectors into PRSC2. Inhealth, this will involve
        completing a planning and costing exercise to address the removal o f constraints inthe
        health system andhelp improve the link betweenhealthbudgetingand outcomes, while
        inagriculture andrural development, itwill involve benchmarkingprogress in
        establishing (i)UnifiedNational Agriculture Institute and (ii)
                         a                                                 MADER's Strategic and
        Operational Monitoring System inall o f its central and provincial institutions.

C. BuildingPublic-SectorCapacityand Accountability

75.     Under this component,the Governmentis committedto maintaining macroeconomic
stability,improvingpublicfinancial management, and enhancinggovernance. Government
actions underthis component are at the core o f PRSCl as well as critical to reducing fiduciary
risk inMozambique; they are also inareas where the Bank (often working with the IMF)has a



                                                   32

comparative advantage vis-&vis other donors. Critical follow-up actions will be supported under
the remainder o fthe PRSC series, to ensurethat gains are consolidated.

Maintaining macroeconomicstability:

76.     Maintaining macroeconomicstability is critical to sustaininggrowth. The Government
has beenable to control inflation, despite some slippage since 2000-01 when flood emergencies
affected the country, but volatility as well as recent rates o f about 13% over the last two years
indicate that continued vigilance is required. Inaddition, domestic interest rates needto be
reduced, as they are highinreal terms and involve highspreads. Underthe PRSC, the Govern-
ment is committed to continuingto develop and implement a macroeconomic framework that it
i s agreed with the IMF to ensure that the policies relating to the budget, the management o f
money and credit, and the exchange rate as well as to the regulation and supervision o f banksand
other financial institutions are consistent and allow the effective pursuito f sustainable economic
growth, low inflation, and highemployment. Inthis area, the Government andthe Bank will
continue to work closely with the IMF, which will remainthe lead institution on the donor side.

77.     To reduce aid dependency, the Governmentis committedto maintaining strong
performance in revenue mobilization. About 50% o ftotal expenditures are donor-financed
through direct budget support or investmentprojects, includingSWAps. Moreover, donor
contributions to Government spending amount to about 10% o f GDP, which i s more than the
average for sub-Saharan Afi-ica, and likely to decline over the long term. Current levels o f
budget expenditure will not be sustainable over the long term and a fiscal adjustment i s needed.
This adjustment will require the Government to imposeupper limitsontotal expenditures as well
as on the budget deficit, which could inturntrigger a reductionon the impetus that fiscal policy
has beengenerating into the economy's growth (it has been estimated to contribute some 3% to
4% per year o f annual growth). To ensure that this impetusis maintained, the economy needs to
continue to grow at 7% or 8% per annum; public expenditure needs to reachhigher levels o f
efficiency and efficacy; budgetcoverage needs to be expanded and enhanced to ensure that all
available resources are aligned with the poverty reductionpriorities as established inthe PAF;
and inaddition domestic revenues needto continue to grow. Despite progress inimplementing
new direct taxes introduced in2003 and earlier, efforts to strengthen the tax system need to
continue in2004, inparticular inconsolidating implemented taxes and reinforcing
administration. It will be critically important to ensure adequate financial and human resources
for full operationo fthe new computerized system o f taxpayers registration and tax collection
system. StrengtheningVAT implementationi s also key, including inparticular improving the
Government's efficiency inprocessing VAT reimbursement claims.

78.      To enhance revenuecollection, the Governmentiscommittedto establishinga central
revenueauthority (CRA). Constituent activities inthis process are benchmarkedinthe PRSC.
This will involve restructuring tax administration by reforming the National Director of Taxes
(DNIA)with aview to makingit a semi-autonomous directorate general (DGI). Inaddition,
customs administration i s strengthening its internal management and undergoing institutional
change with a view to integratingwith DGIinthe future CRA. As the Aide Mbmoire o fthe
2004 Joint Review noted, critical action to be pursued on tax policy includes: (i)    approval o fthe
regulations and procedures for legally establishing the CRA in2005; (ii) development o f
                                                                              the
common information, communication and computerized systems for tax and customs
administrations, also in2005; and (iii)  the effective establishment o fthe CRA with unified



                                                  33

training and collection systems, in2006. Inaddition, further capacity-building i s required in
 revenue collection, tax projections and modeling, andtax policy analysis.

 79.     Through supportingsuch actions,PRSCl and its successor operations will help the
  Governmentto increasedomestic resource mobilization. The Government has hadremarkable
 success inincreasingrevenues over the past five years, and this performance is expected to
 continue. InMay 2003 it implementedfuel tariff adjustments and inNovember 2003 it
 introduced a withholding tax on civil service incomes: these measures together increased
 Government revenues in2003 by about 0.7% o f GDP. During2004, it will increase specific fuel
taxes to compensate for accumulated inflation since May 2003 and adopt an automatic quarterly
adjustment mechanismto prevent their further erosion inreal terms. Inaddition, the
 Government will consolidate the system for collecting indirect taxes; create a municipal tax
 system; and also introduce a documento anico for the collection o f all taxes. A draft general tax
law setting out the principles o fthe law, the guarantees and obligations o f taxpayers, and the
treatment to be accorded to tax crimes will also be submittedto the National Assembly. These
efforts are projected to increase total revenue by 0.3 percentage points o f GDP in2004, to 14.6%
o f GDP. Increased domestic revenues, combined with steady foreign financing at a level of
 $650 millionper annum, should produce a gradual reduction o f external budget dependency. In
addition, the Government will continue to follow its budget rule, prohibiting recourse to
domestic bankingfinance to cover its deficit and setting a cap on total budget expenditure and
net lending. This rule helpsnot only to maintain budget discipline but also gradually to reduce
the deficit and ensure economic stability. Evenso, itremains the casethat available revenues are
not expected to be sufficient to attain the MDGs-an          issue that requires further in-depth study.

Improvingpublicfinancia1management:

 80.     PRSCl willsupport ongoing Governmentefforts tostrengthenpublicfinancial
managementby improvingbudgetformulation, execution and reporting. Transparency and
accountability inthe use o f public resources i s a key citizen right and government responsibility
as well as a key contributor to ensuringthe efficiency andefficacy o fpublic administration. It i s
also a legitimate donor interest, which grows as donors begin to transfer increasingproportions
o f their resources throughthe state budget. To meet its responsibilities inthis area, the
Government has been modernizing its public financial management systemto improve controls,
decentralize planning and execution, and increase transparency and accountability. Inthe past
decade, to sustain highgrowth rates and reduce poverty, the Government has allocated about
65% o f total expenditures, excluding interest payments, to the PARPA's priority sector^.^ Inthe
context o f the April 2004 Joint Review, the Government committed to maintaining pro-poor
spendingat 65% o ftotal expenditures for 2004, with the social sectors receiving halfo fthat
amount, though it was also agreed that pro-poor spending targets would be revised in2005
duringpreparationo fthe new PARPA to ensure that the target is realistic. Through 2004-06, the
Government is also implementing a multi-faceted public sector reform program and, on the basis
o f a CFAA and the two recent PERs, improving public financial management. Maintaining and


~~      ~



  Resourceallocation to PARPA priorities was about 66.5% oftotal primary expenditurein2003, but it fell to 64.9%
in2004, principallydueto extraordinary expendituresonthe municipal electionsheld inlate2003. Eventhough
there has beenadecline inpro-poor spendingas apercentageofGDP since 2000, as aconsequence ofthe strong
growth of the Mozambican economy during the interveningperiod, real priority spendinghas risenconsiderably. In
other words, despite the decline inpro-poor spendingas apercentageof GDP, more resources were infact allocated
to the PARPA priorities in2003 than in2000.


                                                     34

deepening this orientation will also help the Government to meet additional HIPC expenditure-
tracking indicators.

81.      Most of the medium-term actions identified in the 2001 PERfor correcting deficiencies
in Mozambique'sfinancial management system have been executed. The 2001PER found
serious deficiencies infiscal management, particularly inaccounting (which covered less than
half o f Government spending), cash management (which included a multiplicity o funtracked
Government accounts) and auditing (which was underfundedand ineffective). To address these
deficiencies, the Government in2001passeda new Financial Management law to initiate
modernizationo f the Government's fiscal management system. This law aims to ensure: that
allocations inthe (one-year) state budgetare based on and consistent with the PARPA and
analyses drawn from the MTFF; that allocations incorporate a functional classification that
enables strategic andresults-oriented resource allocation; that accounting is cash-based, in
accordance with international standards, so that it i s possible to present a balance sheet that
reflects all state assets and liabilities as well as multidimensional information customized to
individual sector needs; that the payment system i s computerized, on-line, integrated with the
registration o f accounts, andmakinguse o f a single treasury account (conta zinica) that registers
all information on payments from all other (physical and virtual) Government bank accounts on a
daily basis; that all state assets are registered andvalued on a daily basis, usinginternational
depreciation practices (an important control for sectors, such as health, that operate a large
networkwith expensiveequipment); andthat ensures the completion of adequate financial and
performance auditing. Fully implementing the new law is a multi-yearprocess. Complete
implementation, to which the Government i s strongly committed, will help significantly to
reduce the level o f fiduciary risk inMozambique.

82.      The key reform included in the new Financial Management law is the introduction of
an integratedfinancial management system, SISTAFE,now underway. Introducing SISTAFE
into the Government i s a complex exercise, which i s beingbenchmarked by the PRSC series. It
i s not without risk, and it i s also likely to require more time than originally anticipated. While
implementation i s proceeding deliberately and insequence, delays have been frequent, and
tangible improvements inpublic financial management are still some time off. To date, to
prepare for this introduction, the Government has completed a number o f key preparatory
reforms, Inparticular, it has: (i)     issued regulations for the Financial Managementlaw; (ii)
initiated the introduction o f a new and more-detailed functional classifier into the budget; (iii)
started to formulate the budget incurrent prices; (iv) introducedrestrictions on banks accounts
held by public institutions; (v) started to incorporate off-budget-or "consigned"-revenues         (Le.
revenues collected at the level o f the Government's different spendingauthorities) as well as
donor-funded expenditures into the budget; (vi) reduced the so-called "complementary period"
after the end o f the fiscal year (during which payments may be made for commitments made
duringthe financial year) from three to two months; (vii) initiatedtraining for budgetstaff in
double-entry accounting; and (viii) established a consolidated electronic treasury account, which
will helpto improve control oftreasury operations andcash management.

83.      Much remains to be done to improve cash management, accounting and internal
control before SISTAFE can befully and successfully implemented. While the Government
was originally expected to shift from a duodkimo replenishment system to modified accrual
accounting inanticipation o f SISTAFE, it has become clear through implementation experience
to date that this shift is too ambitious at present. With the implementation o f SISTAFE, a
modified cashbasis o f accounting will be applied through the introduction of a budget credit


                                                     35

system against which commitments will be registered and accounted for when a transaction i s
incurred; the credit releases will serve as virtual cash allocations and will determine and control
the spending ceiling for each budget item. The run-upto implementing SISTAFE will require
the introduction of double-entry accounting, under a cash basis, and should include as well the
introduction of monthly and annual cashplans into spending agencies to enable a more rational
use o f resources. To enable MPF to obtain accurate real-time accounting information,
"globalizing accounts" have been created to facilitate movement to a single interlinked account
.arrangement,but not all accounts have yet beeninventoriedor interlinked, so it remains
impossible for the MPF to read off the cash balance o f the Government inreal time. The April
2004 Joint Review agreed that, inmid2004, the top priorities are: further development o f
SISTAFEand e-CUTfisica (an electronic systemof control over the Government's accounts) as
well as their integration; testingthe system to avoid future breakdownanduser disappointment;
establishing and testing a recovery andbackupplan; and strengthening the management o f the

international recruitment^.^ It was also agreed that the Government should continue to target a
Technical Unit of the Financial Management Reform Program (UTRAFE) through planned

rollout to MPF by June 2004 andtesting inMINEDby end 2004, before the rollout proceeds to
other ministries, to enable the IT systems to be tested ina full-production environment. Provided
that these targets are met, the Joint Review found that for 2005 it was possible to complete a
rollout to ministries covering 60% o fthe budget and for 2006 a rollout to all remaining
ministries, thoughthe rollout to municipalities and other autonomous spending authorities would
probably not be possible before 2007.

84.      The Joint Review alsofound a continuing need to improve execution of the audit
function in Mozambique. The Review proposed that inthe 2005 PES and PAF matrix, there
should be measurable targets for (i)   implementing an action planfor strengthening internal audit
functions, at the sectoral, provincial and, indue course, municipal levels; (ii) improving the
timeliness, quality and coverage o f external auditing; and (iii) more completely implementing the
recommendations o f the audit reports in2004 and earlier years. The Government i s expected to
finalize a proposal for the institutional role and the functioning o f the external audit by the end of
2004, with a focus on strengthening parliamentary control and follow-up measures, including
legal, disciplinary and other responses to instances o f mismanagement and corruption. The
PRSC i s benchmarking Government actions intended to help achieve these goals. To this end,
the internal audit department (IGF) is expectedto hireadditional staff, andthe Administrative
Tribunal, which has already seen its budget increase by 10%inreal terms over 2001-03, is
expected to make more effective use o fpartnershipswith private auditing firms. By 2005, the
Government i s expected to have progressed significantly towards its goal of auditing state
accounts within 12 months o f the close o fthe financial year (it now takes more than 24 months).

85.      Other actions are also needed and contemplated, including improving the role of the
MTFF and integrating the Government's variousplanning and budgetinginstrumentsmore
fully. Makingthe MTFF an operational instrument and integratingit fully with the PARPA and
the PESwill improve budgetingand executioninthe PARPA priority sectors; doing so will also
help to strengthen the Government's M&Esystems, whichare critically important to assessing
its performance inimplementing the PARPA. At present the lack o f a medium-term perspective
results inincrementalbudgeting (i.e. budgetadjustments are made across lines and institutions
without taking into account previous performance or emerging needs), which means that the


  A second advisor fromthe IMF was recently recruited.


                                                     36

Government i s not makinginformed, strategic, and contestable choices on inter- and intrasectoral
resource allocations. To help address this lacuna, the Government andthe donors have agreed
that the PAFmatrix will be updated annually and fully reflected inthe MTFF and inthe annual
statutorily-required management instruments o fthe Government, namely, the PES and the
budget. Inaddition, the BdPES will be further improved as a monitoring instrument, and a more
comprehensible format will be developed for the Quarterly Budget Execution Reports (QBERs).
Inthe context ofthe April 2004 Joint Review, itwas agreedthat, in2005, the QBERs will be
publishedon the internet; the BdPES will be harmonizedwith them and any differences
explained; andthe MTFFwill be made a publicdocument.

86.   ThePRSCseries will support continued work in implementing the complex reforms that
are designed to improvepublicfinancial management. Inparticular, each PRSC will ensure
that budget formulation provides allocations to the PARPA's priority sectors as agreed inthe
annual reviewsandthat budget execution i s consistent with these allocations. The PRSC will
support continued work to expandbudget coverage by includingconsigned revenues anddonor-
fundedexpenditures: inthe remainder of 2004, work will be done to establish the legalbasis for
capturing these funds, with a particular focus on MINED and the Ministry o f the Interior
(Migration). A study will also be done to examine how to include off-budgets inthe budget as
well as the effect ofthis inclusiononrecorded revenues andexpenditures. Throughsupporting
the SISTAFE roll-out, the PRSC will help to improve the reliability o fbudgettransactions (as
measured, for example, by a budget deviation index that expresses the sum o f all shortfalls and
overruns as a percenta e o fthe total budget); introduce a functional classification systemthat
meets U.N.standards; and enable the clear and detailed identification o f poverty-reducing
                          %
expenditures. Progress inthese areas i s expected to help the Government to meet as many as ten
o f the 15 HIPC expenditure-tracking indicators by 2007 (as compared to five met today).

87.   Tosupport specificreforms in the budgetprocess and monitor their implementation,the
Governmentand the Bank have also agreed to annualize thePERprocess and integrate it into
the Government'sbudget cycle. This will be achieved through opening the budgetprocess with-
inthe executive andto stakeholders beyondthe executive, integratingdonor financing withinthe
budget, andproviding required technical support. These reforms are expected to improve the
timing o fthe budgetframework exercise; address capacity constraints on sector andintersectoral
budget analysis; improve the linkages betweenthe budget and other integrativeprocesses, such
as the PES and the PAWA; clarify the respective roles o fthe executive, the legislature and other
stakeholders, including the donors; and minimize the impact o fprior agreements with donors
outside the budget process. By providing TA on an ongoing basis to build (inaddition to the
traditional focus on expenditure controls) a focus on defining and reporting budget outputs and
outcomes and feeding this information back into the design o f the next budget, these reforms are
expected to result ina stronger performance orientation o f budgetdiscussions. This will enable
budgetdiscussions betweenthe MPF andother spendingauthorities to involve an exchange o f
proposals and counterproposals backed by properly-developed arguments justifying the
proposals by linking resource-allocation with goal-setting andperformance reviews. It will also
enable the Council o f Ministers to make more informed, strategic and contestable choices on
resource allocations. To help address the demands o f continued coordination o fthe process, the
hightransaction costs o fconsultation, andrisingexpectations andtechnical standards onbudget
formulation andperformance reporting, the Bank and other donors have agreed to provide TA to
assist the Government inthese activities. Throughout, the effort will be to ensure that new

 The system will include functional, territorial, organic and source-of-funds classifiers.


                                                         37

demands on public financial management are realistic and met as far as possible by incremental
adjustments inexisting processes andthat resident advisers can continue to provide effective
advice to the MPF while also developing opportunities for value-adding external review. Hence
the outcome o fthese annual PERs will not consist ina report butinsupport to a developing
process that rationalizes the budgetprocess and clarifies its link to policy coordination.

Improving governance:

88.     Improving governanceremains a key priority of the PARPA. Many Government
structures and processes inMozambique remain inefficient, including inareas important to
business, and incentives to civil servants to perform their duties are limited. The Government i s
proceeding with the decentralization o f authority, including for planning and financing, but
capacities at the local level remain very weak. The legal framework i s inmany places outdated
and inadditionenforcement is weak and often subject to such long delays that it is rendered
almost meaningless. Moreover, corruptioni s widely believedto be growing, and recently
approved anti-corruption legislation i s taking time to be fully enforced. To diagnose the current
situation more exactly, the Technical Unit for Public Sector Reform (UTRESP) has launched a
governance diagnostic assessmentwith TA from the Bank. The assessment will provide data
and initial benchmark indicators on key governance dimensions usinginformation about actual
experiences (as opposed to perceptions) gathered from citizens, business people and public
officials. The results o f the governance assessmentwill also serve as an input for the revision
andfinalization o fthe National Governance Strategy that UTRESP is preparing.

89.      The Government's overall governanceprogram aims to reduce bureaucracy,
deconcentrateand decentralizeservice delivery, reform public institutions to make them more
responsiveto citizens' needs, and improve the capacity and efficiency to thejustice system.
The main instrument for operationalizingthis governance program is the Government's Public
Sector Reform Program for 2001-11 (PSR), which has five components: rationalizing and
decentralizingthe structures and processes o f service delivery; improving policy formulation and
monitoring processes; professionalizing human resources inthe public sector; improving
financial management and accountability; and fighting corruption. At present, the major task
being implemented under the PSR involves completing functional analyses o f all Government
ministries inpreparation for restructuringtheir functions andhumanresources to improve
program formulation, management andmonitoring. This process i s being coordinated with
cross-cutting work on decentralization, pay reform, and budget formulation and execution. At
present, MPF, MAE, MINED, MADER, M I C and M I S A U are nearing completion o f their
functional analyses: M I C has presented its analysis to the Interministerial Commission for
Public Sector Reform (CIRESP), the last step, while MAE,MADER, MINED, and MPF have
presented theirs to UTRESP,whichreviewsthem and issues written recommendations for
improvement (UTRESP reports to CIRESP). UTRESP's quality review o f February 2004 shows
that ministries are usingparticipatory approaches that include critical thinkingabout what each
ministry does andhow it does it; amassingsignificant amounts o fdata, information andanalysis
that help to clarify the strengths and weaknesses o f the ministry; and incorporatingthe
decentralization policy and the Local State Organisms Law (LOLE) 8/2003. Most ministries
have also included restructuring strategies intheir functional analyses, including base estimates
of the financial and human resource needs.




                                                 38

  90.    ThePRSC is benchmarking efforts to restructure Governmentministriesand also
 providing complementary TAthrough thePublic Sector Reform investmentproject. As
 UTRESP's report indicates, much work remains to be done to strengthen line ministry capacity
  inplanning, budgetingandfinancial management. UTRESPhas foundthat ministries' reports
 tendto be weak in: assessingthe policy challenges facing eachministry; linking policy
  challenges to goals and outcomes; eliminating non-core functions to focus on a core mission;
  assessing resource implications andinparticular respecting budgetceilings; and fully
 incorporating the implications of the Local State Organs Law (LOLE 8/2003), inpart because
 the corresponding regulations are not yet approved. Experience also shows that the teams
 undertaking the functional analyses, to be effective, needto include individuals with sufficient
 authority, public sector reform experience, and substantive knowledge o fthe affected sector; that
 general TORSneedto be tailored to the specific ministry being analyzed; that a communications
  strategy must be developed and deployed for each ministry to ensure broad involvement and
 ownership; and that mission statements for each ministry should be allowed to go beyondthe
 legal mandate o f the ministryto ensure flexibility and responsiveness to future challenges. The
 Bank will play a key advisory role inhelpingthe Government to implementthe restructuring
 plans that emerge from the functional analyses o fthe ministries,with a view to improving the
 policy reform design, implementation, and impact. Through the PRSC and the PSR project, it
 will also support the implementation o f several high-visibilityresults o fthe PSR, which in2003
 included accelerating landregistration and enabling visas to be obtained at the border (these were
 prior actions for PRSCl), in2004 i s expected to include simplifyingpublic sector
                             and
 recruitment, improving the pensionpayments process, and simplifying and accelerating hospital
  administration and patient registration.

. 91.    ThePRSC will benchmarkprogress in implementingthe civil servicepay reform
 initiative. The pay reform initiative is expected to revise civil servants' incentives and relate
 them to performance. This i s expected to permita further increase inpermanent employment in
 some priority areas while also reducing the wage bill from 7.5% o f GDP in2003 to 7.3% in
 2004. To this end the Government is expected to limit the average wage increase for civil
  servantsto projectedinflation and to exercise stricter control over temporary employment in
  some provinces. It i s also expected to initiate a process o fverification and rationalization o f
 pensionbeneficiaries. To enhance professionalism inthe public sector, it was agreed duringthat
 April 2004 Joint Review that personnel databaseswill be harmonizedandthe career
 remunerationsystem (SCR) revised during2004. Inaddition, a MediumTerm Pay Policy
  (MTPP) will be considered by CIRESP; a pensionreview initiated; andthe first phase o f change
 management orientation training will be delivered to senior staff in2004. The Joint Reviewalso
 found that, beyond 2004, agreement is needed on strategies to mainstreamgender and take better
 account of the impact o f HIV/AIDS on the public sector.

 92.     ThePRSC will also benchmarkprogress in implementingthe Government's
 decentralizationprogram, which is expectedto help build the capacity of local authoritiesin
 planning, budgetingandfinancial management. The National Assembly recently approved a
 new law on decentralization, the LOLE (this was a prior action under PRSC1). Based on a
 model o f "integrated administration" which strengthens the territorial dimension o f public sector
 management vis-&vis the currently-predominantsectoral management model, the LOLE reform
 gives greater powersto district authorities and also provides the legal basis for treating a district
 authority as a budgetentity for the first time inMozambique's history. Inthis context, the
 Government has identifieddecentralized participatory planningas a key element o f its strategy



                                                   39

for public sector reform and rural development at the district level and developed a National
Strategy for DecentralizedPlanning and Finance, which is being funded in large part by an IDA
investmentproject andwhich aims to develop the capacity o flocal authorities to identify,
appraise and implementsmall-scale infrastructure projects using grant resources to "learn by
doing". Ina complementary fashion, the PRSC will benchmark Government action to further
this work, includingapproval ofthe regulations for LOLEand implementationprogress as
indicatedby an increasingnumber o f districts that have participatory planning processes inplace.
The LOLEregulations, which will helpto ensure consistency inthe approach o f line ministries
to decentralization, are ready for approval for piloting in30 districts. Participatory planning i s
now being rolled out to an initial 37 districts and inaddition the Government i s expected to start
preparingan overall decentralization strategy that clearly distinguishes the roles o f
decentralization and deconcentration and reconciles relevant legislation. Inthis context, a
functional analysis i s planned for completion inMaputo in2004, and improvements are planned
to monitor financial performance o f municipalities anddistricts. Regulationsunder the
municipal tax code are also under preparation.

93,      ThePRSC will also benchmark continuing Government efforts to reduce corruption by
removing opportunities and effectively exposing and sanctioning corrupt acts. While
Mozambique compares well with low-income and other African countries inpolitical stability,
government effectiveness, and rule of law, it compares poorly incontrolling corruption, where
relative performance has declined since 1996. The Government is committed to minimizing
corruption. Its anti-corruption strategy involves setting ethical standards, reorganizing
institutions to minimize opportunity for corruption, and strengthening investigatory and
prosecutory agencies. The Government i s currently establishing a working committee to update
the October 2001anti-corruption strategy inlight o fa nationalcorruption survey that itis
undertakingwith DFIDand WBI assistance. It is also promoting policy and administrative
reforms inknown corruption-prone areas such as the judiciary, the police, public financial
management, public procurement, privatisation, customs, andtax administration. Inparticular,
the MinistryofJustice (MoJ), Administrative Court, Supreme Court, and Attorney General's
Office have finalized an overall reform plan, to be implemented through 2006; the MoJhas
established an Anti-Corruption Unit;and the National Assembly unanimously passed a new anti-
corruptionlaw inMay 2004 (a prior action for PRSCl), thus legally establishing a specialized
anti-corruption prosecutorial unit.7There i s now an urgent need to supply this unitwith adequate
staff and financial resources (operations to date have been marginal, as the unit has had no
permanent staff and no dedicated budget) as well as to strengthen the capacity o fthe Attorney
General's Office. Following-up on these developments, the PRSC series will benchmark the
Government's anti-corruption efforts by supporting the completion o f corruption surveys (to
households, business people and public officials) using a reputable and independent firm to
establish baseline data andmonitor trends; the revision o f the Governance and Anti-Corruption
Strategy; andthe establishment an anti-corruption agency within the Attorney's General Office.

94.      ThePRSC will also support ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency of Mozambique's
courts and legal system, which are inefficient and which significantly increase the risk and
uncertainty of doing business. Courts take a longtime to render decisions inMozambique, and

'The National Assembly approvedan earlier version ofthe anti-corruption bill inOctober 2003, but President
Chissano requestedchanges to ensure its constitutionality before he would sign it into law. After appropriate
changes were draftedinto the bill, it was re-presentedto the NationalAssembly, which approved it unanimously on
May 13, PresidentChissano signedthe bill and sent it for publication on May 31.


                                                       40

  executingjudgments is even more problematic. Consequently, businesses avoid usingthem to
  settle disputes as muchas possible. Inthe Bank's Doing Business database, Mozambique ranks
  79 out o f 84 countries on how long it takes to resolve a business dispute from the time a suit is
  filed untilajudgment is enforced (see also Table 13). Recently, some stakeholders have
  reportedthat the courts are improving; and some bankers suggested that ifthey use a skilled
  lawyer and carefully prepare documents, they are able to obtain quickerjudgments. Even so, for
 the vast majority o f Mozambique's businesspeople, the judicial system i s not seen as a viable
  option to resolve disputes. Recently an alternative disputeresolution system of arbitration was
  established, but o f 193 firms sampled inthe I C A survey in2003, none reportedusing it. It i s
  clear that civil case disposition, particularly relating to property rights and contract enforcement,
  i s essential to enhance the business climate for national and foreign investments. Within the
  court system, productivity (case resolved perjudge) and efficiency (lengtho ftime for case
  resolution) mustbe improved, and inparticular the trendline inthe caseload backlog, which was
  still rising in 2004, needs to beginto decline. The April 2004 Joint Review found that budget
 resources to the sector needto be increased and, to help ensure an efficient use o f resources, all
  sector institutions mustbe involved inapproving the budget andbudget execution (which i s not
 the case at present). Efforts are also requiredto prevent, detect and penalize corruption inthe
                                                  sector through procedural simplification andthe
                                                  implementation o f performance evaluation,
                                                  inspection, and disciplinary procedures. A study on
I Botswana              I         77           I how corruption inthe sector manifests will begin in

  Mozambique                      540             in2004 to assessperformance o fthe sector, andthe
                                                  sector should also complete the preparationo f
  guidelines for the restructuring and reformprogram o fthejustice system. To date, Government
  efforts to improve the sector's outcomes have been focused on updating several o f the basic legal
  codes-the     Commercial Code, the Code o f Civil Procedure (which includes most o f
  Mozambique's bankruptcy law), the Civil Registry and Notary Code-and            implementing the
  reform plans prepared by the four brancheso f the legal andjudicial sector-the       Ministry o f
 Justice, the Attorney General's Office, the Administrative Tribunal, and the Supreme Court-but
  progress has been disappointing. To helpensure promulgation o f a new Commercial Code,
  discussion o f the new Code inthe National Assembly i s a trigger for PRSC2 (see para. 115).

  95.       With the support of the PRSC, the Government will also implement actions intended to
 introduce clarity, transparency, and efficiency intoprocurement practices, with a view to
 minimizingprocurementproblems and loweringprocurement costs. At present, Mozambique
 has a weak legal framework for procurement as well as poor enforcement mechanisms.
 Recently, the MPF completed its review o f a Bank-prepared CPAR and agreed with its principal
  findings and recommendations. Onthis basis, it is preparinga newprocurementdecree that will
  follow international practice, for submission to the National Assembly later this year, after
  consultations with the maininterested stakeholders are completed. Inaddition, newnational
  standard biddingdocuments are beingdrafted; capacity-building programs inprocurement are



                                                    41

being initiated for staff inkey ministries; and a new Central Policy Directorate i s being
established. The newprocurement processes are also beingintegrated into SISTAFE. All o f
these activities are beingbenchmarked inthe PRSC. As indicatedinthe PAF matrix annexed to
the April 2004 Joint ReviewAide MCmoire, some "quick wins" may be available: a draft o f the
newprocurement decree could bepresentedfor discussion by mid-2004; selectedprocurement
audits could be done inseveral ministriesand their top recommendations implemented; and to
speedup the reform, a National Commissionfor Procurement Reform could be established, to
operate until such time as the new regulatory body comes into being. Looking forward to 2005,
the independent appeal function for bidder complaints withinthe Tribunal Administrativo could
be strengthened and audits o fprocurement inthe five major ministries, on a random sample
basis, could be completed.

96.     Work should also be done, on an urgent basis, to remove the bottleneck that has been
created by the TribunalAdministrativo exercising its legal obligation to completea
fiscalizagdo prhia @re-review) of all state contracts, regardless of size. Duringthe Joint
Review, it was agreed that a review o fthe legislationand the function o f the Tribunal will be
completed in2004 to indicate how the reviewing responsibility o fthe TA may be shiftedto a
randomlyselective post-review regime; at the sametime the Governmenthas been urgedto
evaluate the possibility o f establishing minimumthreshold amounts for contracts due for
submission to the Tribunal, for possible application in2005. Inaddition, a review o f pertinent
legislationand functions o f the Tribunal should aim at strengthening its ability to handle bidder
complaints and ex-post random audits o f public sector procurement. Inthis context, the
Government i s expected to preparean action plan, for execution in2005 and 2006, to improve
the procurement process and its review andaudit procedures

97. I n conclusion, under the componentfocused on building public-sector capacity and
accountability, PRSCl expects to achieve thefollowing results:

    0   The PARPA, and inparticular its macroeconomic and structural reform program, will
        have beenimplemented, which inturnshould help to maintain a stable economy and
        investment climate that maintains economic growth at more than 7% per annum and
        brings inflation to about 6% to 8% per annum. This overall result will help to reduce the
        poverty headcount to 50% by 2006-07-n       target to reach the associated MDG;
    0   An allocation o f 65% or more o fbudget expenditures (excluding interest payments) will
        have been made to the PARPA's priority sectors, and a two-month credit limit ceiling
        applied to the key service delivery agencies inJanuary, with the result that social sector
        spending and outcomes will continue to improve, though not at a fast enoughrate to
        achieve the associated MDGs;
    0   SISTAFE regulations will have been issued and the roll-out completed for the MPF and
        MINED,which will result inenhanced, more transparent, andmore timely management
        o fthe budget as well as quarterly budget executionreports makinguse o f more detailed
        functional classifications-both   with a view to improving transparency and
        accountability inpublic financial management and equippingpolitical decision-makers to
        make informed choices about the policy options that they have before them;

D. Improvingthe InvestmentClimate

98.      Thesecond component of the PRSC will support Government efforts to improve the
investment climate,particularly for small- and medium-sized businesses. To reduce poverty,
Mozambique needs rapid growth sourced inagriculture and labor-intensive manufacturing and
services. Improving agricultural productivity will require usingyield-improving inputs and
technologies and rehabilitating essential rural infrastructure. Expanding manufacturing and
services will require easing key business constraints, which entrepreneurs consistently identify as
lack o f access to andhighcost o f credit, highregulatory and administrative barriers, and
inefficiencies inkey infrastructure. PRSCl will help to alleviate some o f these constraints
through supporting efforts to: (i)  strengthen the financial sector; (ii)
                                                                       improve the regulatory
environment; and (iii)  improve infrastructure services.

Strengthening thefinancial sector:

99.A lack of affordablefinance continues to be one of thefundamental businessproblems in
Mozambique. Very few firms are usingexternal credit. Inthe sample includedinthe Bank's
2002 ICA, it was found that enterprises relied on their own funds for 90% o f working capital
requirements and almost two-thirds o f their investmentneeds. According to the survey, 12%o f
respondents had bank overdrafts, while 29% reportedhaving bank loans. Almost all respondents
declared that collateral was a requirement for their most recent overdraft or bank loan, and the
amount requiredaveraged 140% o fthe credit amount. Firmsalso stated that highinterest rates
impededthe use of bank financing: the nominal interest rate for bank credit reportedby the
sampled firms averaged 28%, implyingreal interest rates o f around 13-1 8%. These highrates
result from weaknesses inthe lending environment, the large provisioning requirements
experienced at several of the larger banks, highbank overheads, and (at least for smaller well-run
banks) highprofit margins. One o fthe principal aims o fthis PRSC series is to support
Government efforts to makethe banking sector more efficient and credit easier to obtain. This
involves continued implementation o f a comprehensive financial sector reform program that has
experienced some setbacks over the past few years.

100.    Strengthening transparency in thefinancial sector through introducing International
Accounting Standards (US) and divestingthe Government's remaining ownership stakes will


                                                 43

confirm the Government'scommitment to good governance, anti-corruption, andfiscal
transparency and responsibility, thereby encouraging intermediation of credit to theprivate
sector as well asprivate direct investment and capital inflows. The need for the Government, as
a minority shareholder, to contribute to the recapitalizationo f BAuand BCM/BIM over 2001-03
created enormous pressures on public expenditures, with successive contributions totaling about
4% of GDP. BAu, which today accounts for about 20% o f loans and deposits inMozambique,
came into being as a result of the partial privatization o f a Government-ownedbank inthe mid-
1990s. The bank's financial position deteriorated significantly inthe following years and by
2000 it was insolvent. The private majority shareholder refused to recapitalize the bank and
abandoned its investmentin2001. The central bank intervened inthe same year and offeredthe
bank for re-sale. InDecember 2001,AmalgamatedBank o f SouthAfrica (ABSA) purchased
80% o f the bank's outstanding shares (the remaining20% is heldby the employees o f the bank).
BCM, which was the largest commercial bank inMozambique inthe 1990s, with 35% o f loans
and deposits, experienced a similar history. Itwas created in 1992 by incorporatingthe
commercial activities o fthe central bank and partly privatized in 1996 by selling a 51% stake to
a consortium ledby the Mello Group o f Portugal. By 1999 B C Mwas reporting large losses and
inlate 2000 andearly 2001 itwas recapitalized, withthe Government as holder ofa49% stake
paying about half o f the new capital. At the beginning o f 2000 the Mello Group was acquired by
Banco Commercial Portugues (BCP), a Portuguese bank that already owned BIM. To rationalize

retained the name o fBIM,became the largest commercial bank inMozambique, with more than
its Mozambican operations, BCP merged BIMwith B C M in2001,andthe merged bank, which

50% o f loans anddeposits. Despite two previous recapitalizations, the new entity continuedto
have a capital shortfall and was recapitalizeda thirdtime inearly 2002. Inthe context o fthe
Bank's EMPSO operation, the Government in2003 committed itselfto notusingany further
publicresources for bank recapitalizations.

101.   BAu and BIMareperforming at a more satisfactory level since they have beenplaced
under new ownership. ABSA has restructured BAu, closing unprofitable branches,
strengthening internal controls and information systems and shedding workers. Since end-2002,
BIMhas embarkedon arestructuringprocess that will involvebranchclosures, employee
retrenchments, and a gradual modernization o fprocesses. Although the bank hasjust initiated
this operational restructuring, its loanportfolio is now adequately provisionedandthe bank is in
compliance with prudential regulations.

102.    The recent history of these banks has shown theperil, to the Government, of weak
banking supervision combined with minority Government shareholdings. First, the
Government's presence may encourage riskybehavior on the part o f the banks' private
management, which may harbor expectations that the Government will practice forbearance
when the banks that it partly owns encounter financial difficulties. Second, it has also shown
that banking supervision inMozambique requires strengthening andthat domestic accounting
standards are belowthe standard requiredto ensure financial health andstability withinthe
system. Infact, the supervision o f non-banking financial institutions (such as insurers and
pensionfunds) is also weak and may generate problems inthe future; inparticular the public
social security system may already represent a sizeable contingent fiscal liability, as the
accounting, reporting and management systems usedby INSS are reported to be weak.
Recognizingthese weaknesses, the Government is implementing a multifaceted programto
improve the financial sector. Inparticular, it i s improving the management o f monetary policy
andthe useo fmonetary instruments, with a view to controlling inflation andreducinginterest



                                                 44

rates andtheir volatility; undertaking a diagnostic review ofthree ofthe largestbanks (in
addition to the one bankreview already completed); revisingthe charter of accounts; improving
the supervision capacitiesofthe centralbank; requiring all financial institutions inMozambique
to operateunder IAS; and assessingthe impact of IAS implementation on tax administration in
the financial sector. The Government i s also committed to preparing the privatization of the
remaining Government stakes inthe banking sector so that these stakes can bebrought to the
point of sale. Action inseveralof these areas has already beeninitiated underthe Bank's
EMPSO operation.

103.      Under EMPSO, the Governmentagreed to report on the compliance of all commercial
banks with IAS and to ensure that non-compliant banks undertook appropriate corrective
measures; dialogue around the PRSC will continue to monitor performance in this area.
Usinglocal Mozambican accounting standards, which fall materially short of IAS8,the
Government is now furnishing quarterly, and insome cases monthly, data on prudentialratios for
each ofthe twelve commercial banks inthe countr). For every period, these data show which
banksare inand out of compliance with prudentialratios using domestic accounting standards,
enabling the Government to issue corrective guidelines to non-compliant banks andmonitor their
observance. The Government i s implementing anaction planto bring all commercial banks in
Mozambique into compliance with IAS. O fthe twelve commercial banks, two of the larger ones
(BAuandthe StandardBank of Mozambique (SBM)), which are bothsubsidiariesof South
African-owned banks, submit accounts according to SouthAfrican standards, which approximate
IAS-hence       the transition to IAS for these banksi s not expectedto be onerous. Inaddition, the
other larger Mozambican banks that are owned by Portuguesebanks (BIMand Banco
Commercial e de Investimentos (BCI), which recently mergedwith Banco de Fomento) will be
transitioning to IAS along with their parentbanks, which are expectedunder Portugueselaw to
adopt IAS fully by the time they submit their annual accounts for 2005. Currently, the target
date for transition to IAS for all banks inMozambique is for the accounting reports for the year
2006, which is compatible with the plannedtransition inPortugal and also allows sufficient time
for smallbanksto complete the tran~ition.~

104.      I n keeping withprevious commitments to the Board, the PRSC is benchmarking
Governmentaction to ensure that timelyprogress is made in transitioning to IAS. With
support from the EMPSO operation andother technical assistance from the Bank, the central
bank in2002 issuedadecreeto make IAS obligatory for all banksand also developedand started
to implementan action planfor bringingall banks into compliance. InMarch2004, the
authorities completed a diagnostic review of the largestnon-IAS compliant commercial bank,
BIM,to analyzeits financial situation inaccordancewith IAS. The central bank has defined
terms of reference and arranged the financing to conduct an IAS compliance review of the three
larger remaining banks (BAu, BCI and SBM) inthe systemandtraining for the banking
supervision department to support the central bank's transition to IAS. The reviews for the


  IAS are more demanding than domestic accounting standardsregarding(inter alia) disclosure, the treatment o f
deferrals, and the provisioning o f loan losses and therefore give a more accurate statement o f a bank's financial
situation, but they are not yet observed inMozambique. Inter alia, IASrequires applyingprovisioning rules to the
total amount o f a non-performing loan, notjust its past-due component, as well as switching from pure performance-
basedevaluation to a forward-looking-based evaluation.
 The processoftransitioning to IAS may prove to be particularly burdensome for some of the small banks because
the technical demands as well as the costs associated, for example, with changing accounting information
technology (IT) can be high.


                                                          45

remaining larger banks are expectedto be completedby end-2004. Ifnecessary, aremedial
action planwill bepreparedand implementedby each bank as its financial situation becomes
known. The outstanding agenda relates to: (i)     analyzing the tax implications of transition to IAS;
(ii) identifyingthe transition challenges facing the smaller banks and supporting their IAS
transition; (iii)providingprogramsto supportthe training of banking, accounting and auditing
professionals so as to ensure that they are conversantwith the new accounting practices; and (iv)
designing the new chart of accounts and supervisoryregulations as well as a detailed transition
planfor adoption ofthe new standards. Providedthat all parties make adedicatedeffort, it is
possible for the system as a whole, including the central bank, to complete training for and
implementing the transition to IAS in2006. As the introduction of new accounting standards i s a
complex task involvingmultiple actors, the authorities have agreedto establish a high-level task
force includingall involvedparties (the banks, accounting and auditing professionals as well as
the central bank) to preparethe transitionprocess, identifytraining needs, andadvise on
transition timetable and implementation issues.

105.     ThePRSC will support theprivatization of the Government's remaining stakes in BIM
and BAu according to a carefully planned process. The privatization ofthe Government's
remaining ownership stakes inthe banks raises complex issues, includingthe Government's
obligations to the employees, the shareholders' agreementsbetweenthe Government andthe
majority shareholdersof the banks, andthe distribution ofthe costs and revenues of various
divestiture options as betweenthe Government andthe employees. The processof preparing for
the privatizations may be supportedthrough the Bank's proposedFinancial Sector Technical
Assistance project (FSTAP) by financing: (i)resident expert on banking supervision to assist
                                                 a
the central bank inactively monitoring and supervising the condition of the banks; (ii)     an
investment bank to advise on how to proceedwith due diligence, choice of sales method, and
conducting the sale; and (iii)  the preparationof documents describing the method of divestiture,
information on the banks' financial situation, and the intendedsale procedure. Proceeding
according to this program will enable the Government to launch tenders in2005; once the
tenders are received, the winners can be selected andthe transactions can proceedto closure
withinthe following twelve months.

106.     Within the context of the PRSC, the Government is working closely with the Bank to
ensure that the diagnostic reviews and actionplansfor transition to U S are duly completed
and that theprocess of preparingfor the divestiture of the Government's remaining stakes in
the banking system isprogressing according toplan. A Project PreparationFacility (PPF)
advance for the FSTAP project has already beenmade available for this purpose. This advance
i s supporting the implementation of initialreforms inthe financial sector, including some of the
diagnostic work requiredto initiate the transition to IAS. The technical assistance under FSTAP
will helpthe Government to finance the capacity-building requiredto undertakethe reforms of
the financial sector envisagedunderthe PRSC. The PRSCwill also support financial sector
reformmore generally andprovide complementary support to help the Government to:


0    Revise the Financial Institutions law, to give the central bank responsibility for issuing and
     revoking licenses for financial institutions, provide automatic application of penalties for
     noncompliance with prudential regulations, andmake managersof financial institutions
     liable for gross violations of banking regulations (approval of this law by the National
     Assembly is atrigger for PRSC2);
0    Submit anew bank bankruptcy law to theNationalAssembly;



                                                  46

0   Divest completely from the financial sector and, inparticular, bring all bankingsector assets
    to the point o f sale;
0   Complete an actuarial study o fthe social security system and design a strategy and action
    planto modernize it and ensure that it is fully funded andproperly supervised; and finally
0   Prepare an action planto make the insurance industry compliant with IAS and adequately
    supervised.

107.    While these reforms are not guaranteedto reduce interest rates or the cost of credit,
together with reforms to improvethe lending environmentand thejudiciary (which theBank
is supportingthrough the FSTAP) they will address the structuralproblems that appear to
contribute to these high rates. Restructuringthe dominant banks inthe system shouldhelpthem
to increase their operational efficiency and reduce the share o f nonperforming loans intheir
portfolios, and this inturn shouldput downward pressure on the profit marginso f the smaller,
healthier, banks. Other things being equal, this should help to lower credit costs and improve
access to finance. That said, it i s also clear that these reforms will not inthemselves eliminate all
o fthe factors that create a poor lending environment inMozambique, including (for example)
highcorporate leverage, a lownumber ofbankable projects, aweak repayment culture, and
various legal and institutional impedimentsto credit selection and recovery, so the impact i s
likely to be limited untilthese factors are also addressed.

Improving the regulatory environment:

108.    Another area of critical importanceis the regulatoryframework for commercial
enterprises. The Government has created a more business-friendly environment inrecent years.
For example, Public Administration Decree 30/2001 o f 15 October 2001 requires government
agencies to respond to requests for decisions withina fixed time; inaddition, there are now
provisions for export processing zones (called Industrial Free Zones (IFZ) inMozambique) as
well as several investmentand export incentives. The Government has also introduced new
customs procedures andtransformedthe tax system, including through the introduction o f a
VAT. The highestlevel of import dutieswas reduced from 30% to 25% for 2004-a             prior action
underPRSCl-and        it is expected to be lowered further, to 20%, in2006. The business
community has welcomedthese changes, but they have not yet hadthe expected impact. Inthe
I C A survey, it was found that business managers believe government officials retain too much
discretion inimplementing new laws and regulations, with the effect that the laws are often
renderedineffective-because      officials obstruct implementationo f new policies by delaying or
ignoring decrees and insome cases because local officials are still ignorant o f the legislated
changes. As a result o f this discretion, businesses experience regional differences inthe
application o f law and therefore greater levels of government-related uncertainty. Inaddition, a
numbero fkey constraints to business havenot yet been addressed. As notedinthe Bank's
October 2003 CAS, the Bank intends to focus attention duringthe next few years on several
policy and institutional reforms that fall into this category. The CAS results framework includes
three specific targets to be achieved over the CAS period.

109.    Thefirst target involvesbringing down to international norms the cost (now 97% of
GNIper capita) and time (now 153 days) involved in registering a business. Open economies,
where firms can easily enter and exit, have higher growth rates thanless open ones; the
competition fostered by new entrants forces existing firms to raise their productivity and improve
their competitiveness or be drivenfrom the market. Highbarriers to entry allow low-



                                                   47

productivity firms to survive and make it costly to reallocate resources to the most efficient uses;
they also discourage foreign investment, which has provento be one o fthe most effective ways
o ftransferringtechnology and raisingproductivity. At present, entry into the Mozambican
market involvestime-consuming and expensiveprocedures for firmlicensing and registration.
As few entrepreneurs are willing to endure the process, much economic activity remains
unregistered. Those firms that do attempt to register are typically forced to hire a consultant who
specializes inregistering firms and (for fees rangingfrom $1,000 to $1,500, which are addedto
the government fees) cancomplete the process inthree to five months, depending onthe nature
o fthe business, how politically connected the firm is, and how muchthe firm i s willing to pay.
But even after a firmhas registered, it cannot yet beginoperations: it must thenregister with the
tax department, and ifa foreign firm it must apply to open a bank account and begin applications
for residence, work, and import permits. These tasks can easily add another three or four months
to the wait. There is anecdotal evidence that these bureaucratic burdens persuade some
companies to abandon thoughts o f investinginMozambique. One o fthe key objectives o fthe
PRSC is to reduce these barriers to entry. This goal will be pursued inthe context o f a larger
effort-included        inthe Bank's country dialogue-to           reduce significantly the burdenscreated by
the Government's regulations requiringnotarial services.

110.      To reduce the cost and time involved in registering a new business, the Government
under the PRSC is considering computerizing the registration process; integrating the


                                                            48

operations of the three institutions involved in thisprocess; and outsourcing somefunctions to
theprivate sector. A "one-stop" shop for business registration is already beingestablished in
Maputo and Bank staff are closely monitoring Government efforts to reduce the time and cost
involved inregistering a business and will continue to do so. Inparallel, new regulations
concerningthe licensing o f industrial and commercial activities will be producedto expedite
entry and exit and to reduce the cumbersome process o f inspections that needto be done during
the productionprocess.

111.    Thesecond target involves obtaining a morejlexible labor market. To be
internationally competitive, firms mustretain the flexibility correctly to size their work force,
while also respecting the rightsandprotections o ftheir workers. This is particularly important
for labor-intensive manufacturing firms, whichdepend on customer orders to keeptheir workers
employed. Mozambican firms that wish to retrenchworkers when business slows down or when
they adopt labor-savingtechnology can do so only at a highcost. Article 69 o f the Labor Law o f
20 July 1998 requires that a retrenched worker receive up to three months pay for every two
years o f service. As a result, many firms (37% o f respondents inthe I C A survey) retain more
workers thanthey consider optimal; on average these firms would preferto retain only 63% o f
their current work force, withthe results that they are spending on average about 20%ofannual
sales to pay unneeded workers. This i s a particularly big burdenfor privatized firms, which were
required to take on all current workers and then retrenchthem paying the normal severance. The
highcost ofretrenchment also discourages firms from expanding production or enteringnew
markets. Firmsalso need to be able to hire skilled labor, butthis i s difficult inMozambique, as
the workforce lacks sufficient skilled labor. The 2003 I C A shows that firms inMozambique, on
average, have very low labor productivity compared to other countries insub-Sahara Africa. Ina
comparisonwith Cameroon, C6te d'Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe,
Mozambique was the lowest for value-added per worker, and this more than offsets the low
wages" that Mozambique offers andthat would have given the country a competitive edge on
the wage-productivity ratio, ifproductivity were higher. Inthis context, it i s important for firms
to be able to enhance productivity through improved access to skilled foreign laborers andthe
training opportunities that they provide. Infact, the Bank's Enterprise Development project
shows that firms that hire foreign experts to help them are able significantly to increase sales,
productivity and profitability. But it i s difficult for firms inMozambique to obtain permits for
expatriate workers. Inthe I C A survey, firms reported that on average it took 90 days and almost
$400 to obtain a work permit; some firms took as long as two years and nearly $1,250 to do so.
Firmsdeal with these issues indifferent, inefficient ways-all            o f which drive up the cost o f




loInfact, the minimumwage inMozambique,by developingworldstandards, is not so low, at about $47per month
comparedto (say) $30 per monthinChina. $47 per monthinMozambiquetotals about a $564 per annum, which is
almost twiceMozambique's GDP per capita. At present, Mozambiquecannot sustainsuchahighminimumwage.
Taking intoaccount the higher educationandproductivitylevelsprevailinginChina(and inmanyother countries),
Mozambique'srelativelyhighminimumwage andlow labor productivityplainly impedecompetitiveness. Ifin
additionadministrativebarriersto productivityincreases (such as the hiringofexpatriate labor) andhighcost short-
termhiringare factored intothe matter, labormarketconditions emerge as akey issuefor the sustainability of
growth andemployment.

business. Some bring inexperts on tourist visas and force them to leave the country every 30-90
days to renew their visas; others have expatriates begin work before obtaining legal authority;
and others chose not to invest innew technologies because o fthe difficulty inhiringexperts.
Interviews suggest that restrictions on employing expatriates are a significant reasonwhy some
                                                                               investors stay away

                                                                               I C A sample said that
                                                                               hiringexpatriates
                                                                               was a major problem
                                                                               for their business.

112.    With supportfrom the PRSC,furtherflexibility will by introduced into the labor law by
permitting remuneration through piece rates, simpler and cheaperforeign hires (aprior
action under PRSCl), and lower severancepayments. Following protractednegotiations
betweenthe Ministry of Labor, the Ministryo f Industryand Trade, andrepresentatives ofthe
private sector businesses, Decree 5712003 was revisedto allow firms to hire expatriates without
obtaining explicit Government approval to do so (a hire i s legally permittedto proceed ifthe
Government does not object to it within 15 days o f receiving notification o f the intention to hire).
This is expected to constitute a major improvement, and to helpto raise skills-transfer levels and
shiftthe balance away from capital-intensive andtowards labor-intensiveenterprises. Bankstaff
are closely monitoring the impact o f the new decree as well as the expected articulation o f a new
comprehensive labor law, expected in2005.

113.    The third target involves lowering customs clearance times, with a focus on the center
andthe north ofthe country, where the delays are longest, and on ground shipmentsfrom South
Africa border. Since 1998, it has become easier to obtain import licenses; inspections are more
efficient; and recently the pre-declaration system, which required firms to pay a deposit o f 15%
o f duties owing before they were permittedto import, was abolished. But there are still long
delays inclearing goods. The I C A found that, in2002, the mediantime that it took to clear
goods after they arrived at the port o f entry was seven days; the average time almost twelve days;
and there was wide variation. Clearingtrucks from SouthAfrica required seven days on
average, negating the advantage o f proximity to South African markets, which are only a few
hours away by road, and encouraging smuggling. Firmsalso reportedthat they could reduce
their inventories by 21% on average, andfree up significant capital for investment, ifcontainer
clearance times were reduced to 24 hours-as       some Asian countries have done. Exporting from
Mozambique i s also difficult, with exporting firms reporting that, in2002, it took an average o f
17 days to clear a shipment-even ifthe firm was shipping goods by sea to another port within
Mozambique. Ina world where turnaround times and guaranteed delivery are critical, no
enterprise can hope to be internationally competitive given these delays and uncertainties.
Knowing that importing and exporting i s difficult and uncertain, most companies adjust their
business plans, keep large stocks o f raw materials, anddo not enter contracts that require strict
deadlines-with    the result that potentially profitable business opportunities are foregone.

114.    Further work will be done to determine the bottlenecks in customs clearance and
remove them. Specific targets will be benchmarked: inparticular, the average number o f days



                                                  50

for clearing exports will target seven days or less and for clearing imports at Ressano Garcia will
target five days or less. This will help firms to obtain critical inputs ina timely manner, meet
strict delivery deadlines, compete better inexport markets, tie-up fewer resources ininventories,
andbemore responsive to their customers.

115.    I n addition, the PRSC will support revision of the Commercial Code, which datesfrom
the late 1800s and is completely outdated. Virtually all stakeholders agree that the Commercial
Code needs an overhaul, but there i s still widespread disagreement about what form that
overhaul should take. A new Commercial Code has been drafted and presented to the National
Assembly, where it has languishedfor about a year, mired incontroversy. Itappearsthat some
members o f parliament believe that the new draft has serious deficiencies: for example, some
financing methods (such as leasing) that are already inuse inMozambique are not mentionedin
the proposed Code. Inaddition, the private sector has complained that the drafters o f the
document did not consult sufficiently (although there were public consultations) and inaddition
that some o fthe comments that they offered were not taken into account. Finally, there are
differences between MIC-which        prepared the new draft-and     MoJ about the form and content
of the draft Code. To ensure that Mozambicanbusinesses have the benefit o f a sound
commercial code withina reasonable timeframe, the PRSC benchmarks progress inrevisingthe
draft and obtaining parliamentary approval. Written comments have been solicited from both
parliament and the private sector so that their concerns can be analyzed and addressed. With
support from the Bank's Enterprise Development project (PoDE), M I C i s reviewing comments
andrevisingthe draft Code, both inform andinsubstance. Technical assistance for reviewing
the comments and drafting appropriate revisions will be provided, as needed. Discussiono f a
new Commercial Code by the National Assembly is atrigger for PRSC2.

116.     Country dialogue around the PRSC will alsofocus on several issues of importance to
private investors where appropriate action has notyet been agreed, including Government
payment of VATrefunds. A key issue for many Mozambican businesses is the Government's
failure to pay VAT refunds ina timely manner. Inthe I C A survey o f 193 firms, 24 reported
beingowed government refunds onproducts that they had exported or on VAT-exempt products
that they had imported, and the average amount was more than 13% o f their annual sales. Those
companies that received refunds reportedhaving to pay bribes and waiting an average o f 99 days
to receive their refunds (the median time was 30 days). Some companies spoke o f having to wait
years becausethey were unwillingto pay up to 10% inunofficial fees to the officials involved.
Similar experiences were reported with respect to other investmentincentives, such as duty
drawbacks. N o firms reportedreceiving refunds ina timely manner. These delayed refunds
seriously affect the firms' ability to manage cash flow and, ina country with highreal interest
rates, impose an enormous cost on some firms. Investment incentives are useful only ifthey are
credible and firms believe that they will actually receive what has beenpromised. Mozambique
has appropriate incentives, but it is indanger o f developing a reputation, especially among
foreign investors, as a country unableto deliver on its promises. As part o f the PRSC dialogue
on the investment climate, the Bank will bring this issue to prominence. The Government has
stated that delayed VAT refundsresult from delayed donor disbursements as well as various
technical problems. Evenso, Bank staff inpolicy dialogue will urge the Government to
undertake to meet reasonable standards (e.g. repayment within 30 days) and pay market rates o f
interest on late repayments or, alternatively, to implement a system that allows exporters access
to importedraw materials and intermediate goods at international prices, eliminating the need to




                                                 51

pay the VAT andthen await refunds. Inthe context ofthe April 2004 Joint Review, the
Government agreedto establishatask force to look into this important issue in2004.

117.    Another issue of importance to many Mozambican businesses is the number of
Government inspectionsper annum, which many businesses consider to be excessive. The
ICA indicates that Government inspections(health, labor, etc.), particularly inthe center of the
country, now average six innumberper annum (with localofficials responsible for the higher
administrative costs incurred), constituting avery high administrative burdenon businesses.
Labor regulations and inspectionsare an irritantfor some firms, and there appears to have been
little improvement since 1998, when 37% of surveyed firms saidthat dealing with the
Inspectorateof Labor was aproblem. The 2002 interviews cited a similar share ofthe overall
sample, with almost 50% of firms with more than200 workers reported that the Inspectorateof
Labor was aproblem comparedto only 32% of smaller firms. Labor regulations andinspections
impose a cost on all firms, but they are particularly burdensomefor foreign-owned firms and
large firms, further discouragingthem from increasing their size or formally registering. This
issue too will be investigatedand discussed inthe context of the PRSC-supporteddialogue on
the investment climate. Inparticular, work will be done to helpthe Government to review its
inspectionsregime, rationalize it and limit the discretion of government officials to interpret it.

118.    Improving the security and transferability of urban land use rights is also expected to
be an important objective of the dialogue supported by the PRSC. After independencein 1975,
landinMozambique becamethe property ofthe state. Although urban landuse rights canbe
acquiredthrough a legal procedureof plot assignment, the proceduresrequiredexceed the
competence of municipal authorities and are complex, time-consuming and expensive (in
Maputo, 103 steps and atotal of about $50 infees and stamps are requiredto register an ordinary
plot for residential purposes). Ingeneral, landassignments are poorly documentedand rarely
registered; poor records and lack of criteria for assignmentallow discretionary behavior and
corruption; andplots are sometimes allocated without any overall landuse plan, or inconsistently
with existing plans. The result is that alarge proportion ofthe urbanreal estate marketinvolves
illegaltrade inplots. This lack of an urban landmanagementsystem that can provide security of
tenure, facilitate the transfer of land use rights, avoid duplication of allocations and support
enforcementof establishedrights creates serious obstaclesto urbanplanning, efficient and
transparentlanduse administration, and a well-developed housing finance market. Italso
discourages local andforeign investment. A new legal framework addressinglandregulation
needs to be introduced; this should include introducing and/or updating the cadastral systems;
reducingthe bureaucracyfor landassignment and assigningclear responsibilities for planning,
assignmentand developmentto central and local levels of administration. While changes in
urbanlandmanagement laws andregulations could facilitate the transition to private leasehold
tenure, staff recognize that this i s currently unlikely to happen. The Interministerial Commission
on Land establishedto produce proposalsfor improvingurban land use regulations didnot
consider the possibility of creating freehold tenure andfacilitating development of a free market,
and it appearsthat the politicalwillto pursuethis route does not currently exist inMozambique.
Nonetheless, work i s currently underway withinthe Government to improvethe regulation of
urbanland use.

Improving infrastructure services:

119.    Improving infrastructure services is also critically important toprivate-sector-led
growth. The provision o f reliable and affordable cross-cutting infrastructureto businesses is at
the core o f Mozambique's growth strategy. The key areas o f concern to Mozambique's
businessesare electrical energy and transportation (whether by road, rail, or air). Recent reforms
intelecommunications have considerably improvedthe outlook inthat sector, though smaller
businesses continue to experience highcosts and limitedfixed lines imply that internet usage
remainsvery limited. O fthese sectors, the PRSC will support policy andinstitutional reforms in
electrical energy and telecommunications, while the transportation sector will continue to receive
investmentproject support.

120.    Nearly 64%of ICA-surveyed manufacturers stated that unreliable electricity is a major
or severe infrastructure problemfor the sector, and the Government is implementing an
energy sector reform program to address theseproblems. Electricity is an important sector for
the country, not only for providing domestic enterprises with their energy needs-including
energy-intensive industries such as Mozal-but    also for potentially lucrative exports into the
southern Africa power pool. The key challenges today are to decrease power losses from the
grid, increase reliability, andreduce connectionand distributioncosts. Almost one infour firms
own generators (which i s less than inthe 1998 survey (34%) and also less than inChina (30%)
andIndia(69%)) andthey generate, on average, about 22% oftheir ownpower needs, thoughthe
median value (8%) indicates that most firms are able to rely on the power grid most o fthe time.
The ICA survey found that the medianfirm inthe sample suffered power interruptions about five
times a month in2002, andthe medianloss to productionfrom power outages was 2% of sales.
Because most firms are operatingwell below full capacity, they can delay production to times
whenpower is available, but as capacity utilization increases andmanufacturingmoves to
processes requiring continuous power, unreliable electricity provision will become an
increasingly severe constraint. The difficulties faced by the firms sampled stem from the
inadequate performance o f the state-owned vertically-integratedpower company Electricidade
de Moqambique (EdM) andthe lack o f periodic tariff adjustments. At present, only about
220,000 (or 6%) o f all households have access to electricity, and the pace o f expansion i s slow:
only 31,000 new customers were added between 1996 and 2000, and less than 50,000 are
targeted for the next four years (compared to the 100,000 new households that will be
established). Moreover, even where customers have access, supply reliability is very low.
EdM's energy losses exceed 20%; sales per employee are only about 5 MWhper year; the ratio
of payroll to operating expenses has increased from 18% to 24%; andthe level o f receivables has
deteriorated from 123 days to 147 days. While some o fthese problems may be partly
attributable to the floods o f 2000 and 2001, EdMcould do more to improve performance,
including better financial management (e.g., better recurrent expenditure control and capital
expenditureplanning), improved operational management, and more timely tariffadjustments.

121.    To improve efficiency in the energy sector, the Government is implementing an energy
sector reform program that aims to achieve immediate efficiency improvements, unbundle
generation and distribution, restructure all non-essential activities, improvefinancia1viability,
andfinance expansion of access. The PRSC is benchmarkingprogress inthis sector, which (as
the April 2004 Joint Review noted) i s not explicitly benchmarked inthe PAF matrix. In2003,
the Council o f Ministers approved the separation o f EdMaccounts for generation, transmission
and distribution and also issuedTORfor a transaction advisor for bringing private participation
into EdMdistribution business. In2004, it i s expected to initiate the legal operational


                                               53

unbundlingo fthe generation, transmission anddistribution functions into separate entities
(Genco, Transco and Distco); to retain a capacity-building advisor for Transco; and also to retain
the transaction advisor for bringingprivate participationinto Distco. Inaddition, the Council of
Ministersis expected to approve a privatizationoption for Distco. In2005, the Government is
expected to complete the unbundlingand invitebids for private participation inDistco. With
TA, advisory andfinancial support fromthe Bank's Energy Reform and Access Project, an
independent regulator will also be established, and investments will take place to builda short
medium-voltage and low-voltage distribution line to expand the consumer base where the grid-
based and isolated-grid transmission systems are already inplace.

 122.    Telecommunications was reported to be the least signijicant in rastructureproblem in
firms surveyed in the ICA, though the low uptake of internet services`and                the low availability
of any kind of telecommunicationsservice beyond the main urban centers are indications that
further reforms in the sector are needed. Costs inthe sector remainhigh(both for connections
and for continuing service) andreliability limited. Inmost industrial areas, there is reliable
telephone service, due primarily to the introduction o f cellular telephone service in 1998-1 999,
yet poor communications services continue to be a significant constraint for many small
businesses, government agencies, and the general public, especially inthe rural areas. To
address these problems, the Government i s implementinga wide-rangingand ambitious
telecommunicationreform, which i s already helping to improve access as well as the quality of
efficient and affordable communication services. These results are being achieved through
creating a more competitive environment and introducing private-sector participation inboth
fixedandmobile telephone operations. Thus far, the reform has ledto the establishment of an
independent telecommunication and postal services regulator, the Instituto Nacional das
 ComunicaqGes de Moqambique (INCM). A pro-competition telecommunications law conducive
to a multi-operator environment was approved in2004, and key regulatory decrees on
 interconnection, licensing and I N C Morganizationhave been enacted. Inaddition, a strategy to
divest the state-owned fixed-line operator TeZecomunicaq6esde Moqambique (TdM) i s being
prepared: inthis context, the two state-owned phone companies (the fixed-line telecom, TdM,
 andthe mobile phone operator, mCel) are beingphysically and financially separated, which
 should improve accountability and help clarify associated costs and possible cross-subsidies.
 The entry inlate 2003 o f a second mobile phone operator, Vodacom, is already enhancing
 competitiveness and bringingrates down while also improving the quality o f services. The
 PRSC i s benchmarkingthe key milestones inthese reforms, including inparticular the launcho f
 a process to award a thirdmobile phone license. As noted inthe Aide MCmoire o f the April
 2004 Joint Review,this important sector is not benchmarked inthe PAF matrix, though it i s
 stressed inthe PARPA.

 Promoting growth in the agriculture sector:

 123.     With over 70% of thepopulation dependent on agriculture, in the next tenyears
 agricultural growth will be key to continued economic growth withpoverty reduction. Post-
 conflict performance has been strong, principally due to the expansion o f area under cultivation.
 Overall agriculture growth has beenaround 8% per annum. Recent data from the agriculture
 survey show strong growth since 1996 inthe cash crop sector and maize, especially inTete and
 Niassa provinces, based on a strong demand-pull from neighboring countries. Crop income

   More than 80% ofthe sample statedthat they regularly use cell phones. One infive has a website, but only one in
 three uses electronic mail.


                                                      54

contributes substantially to overall household income among the rural poor. Nonetheless, there
are variations by provinces, with households inthe southern provinces attributing about 50% to
off-farm income sources. To improve agriculture performance further, much remains to be done
to increase the use o f yield-improving inputs; encourage the adoption o f improved farming
systems and technologies; set agricultural standards and improve key agribusiness supply chains;
and facilitate trade through rehabilitating essential rural infrastructure.

124.    Governmentpolicy in the agriculture sector isprimarily toprovide an enabling
environmentfor growth in the sector; and the PRSCseries will support thefurther
articulation, development and implementation of thispolicy. Ingeneral, the Government's
agriculture strategy i s oriented around seven elements: (i)   establishing and maintaining policy
and institutional frameworks geared toward market-based agricultural development; (ii)
improving farmers' access to input and output markets through investments inrural
transportation and communications infrastructure; (iii)   improving the effectiveness o f
agricultural support services through decentralization and outsourcing together with the
promotion o f farmers' associations, (iv) establishing a legal and regulatory environment
conducive to the development o f efficient agricultural markets while at the same time ensuring
the rightso f smallholders and communities; (v) ensuring sustainability andsocial equity inthe
exploitation of natural resources; (vi) maintaining a stable macroeconomic environment and
takingmeasuresto institutionalize "good governance" and rationalize public expenditure in
public agricultural programs and institutions; and (vii) establishing the policy framework and
incentives to encourage the private sector activity inrural/micro-finance. The Government has
made substantial progress inproviding an enabling environment for implementation o fthe
strategy. Inthe policy arena, agricultural markets for inputs and outputs have been liberalized
andmost distortionary policies have beenreduced or eliminated, except for tariffs protectingthe
sugar industry and an export surtax to protect local cashew processing. Extension services (both
funds and functions) have beendecentralized to the provincial level, andthe private sector and
NGOs are also providing such services, especially for cash crops and livestock services. The
processing o f landuse requests has also beensubstantially simplified. Interms o f the legal and
regulatory environment, significant steps have beentaken inseveral areas such as land and
natural resource management regulations. There are still prevailing constraints to rural finance,
butthese are currently being addressedthrough several rural finance studies andprojects and
through new legislation to be passed within the context o f overall financial sector reform.

125.    To improve theperformance of the agriculture sector, the Government is taking steps
on a number of fronts. Itis formulating a rural development strategy, which will be supported
through PROAGRI 2. Within PROAGRI, annual work plans are beingdesignedwith specific
actions, outputs and outcomes, as well as financing needs, and these will be approvedby the
Government and the international partners. The Government i s also decentralizing the delivery
o f agriculture services by strengthening provincial governments and district administrations and
fostering the role o f farmer associations inproviding agriculture services. Inaddition, it i s
improving public expenditure management by ensuring that all expenditures under MADERare
withinthe budget (recently 50% were off-budget); restructuringresearch stations to promote
partnerships with farmer groups, NGOs and the private sector; and improving tenure security to
the smallholder by facilitating the provision o ftitles. WhenIDAcloses its active sector
investment project inJune 2005, further support will consist inpolicy dialogue and analytical
work provided to MADERthrough the Bank's PRSC missions, with financing provided through
the PRSC itself, andtherefore through the MPF instead ofthrough a dedicated investment



                                                 55

project controlled by MADER; inthis way, the multi-year transition inthe agriculture sector
from discrete IDA investment projects towards full programmatic support will be completed.

126.    To help MADER to make this transition,the Bank is helping to strengthenthe
managementinformation and evaluationsystems within the ministry as well as to establish a
unified agricultural research institute; these actions are benchmarkedin the PRSC2. A key
activity o f MADER i s to conduct the agriculture surveys, which were completed in 1996,2002,
and 2003. The monitoring ofmany ofthe current PAF indicators is dependent onthese surveys,
which inturndepend on sample surveys. MADER's priorities include establishing an operating
management information system (SIG) at the provincial and national levels. Work on
operationalizing SIG has started and i s expected to be completed by December 2004. At the
same time, MADERi s proceeding with restructuringits agriculture research system. Slow
progress inreforming the research system-a        public good-has    constrained technological
development and adoption within the sector. Nonetheless, informal collaboration involving the
public research system, NGOs, farmers associations, universities, processors and input suppliers
has been successful inpromoting food crops production, and this success has provided an
impetus to professionalizingthe research system. This restructuring, which i s already underway,
will involve: (i) establishing Zonal Research Centers inNampula, Lichinga, Sussundenga and
Chokwk; (ii)  establishing an Agricultural ResearchCouncil composed o f major stakeholders,
includingfarmers andNGO representatives, andresponsible for policy formulation, broad
priority-setting, evaluation and donor coordination; (c) establishing and/or strengthening
institutions and programs organized aroundagro-climatic regions and; (iv) creating a competitive
grant system to foster public-private partnership. These planned reforms inthe research system
have gone through a long process o f preparation and important supporting documentation has
already been prepared. The Council o f Ministers i s expected to approve the proposed reforms in
2004 and both the International Service for National Agriculture Research andthe Agriculture
Brazilian Research Corporation have prepared plans to support that reform.

127.    Finally, as a natural-resource based economy,Mozambique needs to ensure that its
environmentalregulatoryframework is appropriateand adequately enforced, so that its
natural resource base is not exploitedin unsustainableways. Environmental matters were fully
treated inthe 2001 PARPA, but they have not received sustained attention insubsequent
Government planning documents and the PAF matrix includes no explicit environmental
indicators. The April 2004 Joint Review nonetheless found that efforts to ensure the sustainable
management o f natural resources are bearing results. One inthree forestry concessions now has
a management plan (compared to one inseven in2002), though quality and implementation
remain a major concern; various regulations (on sustainable development and medical waste
management) were prepared or revised; a national solid urban waste strategy was prepared;
numerous site-specific urban or land-use plans were prepared; a new Land Planning law is being
prepared; and some training andpublic notificationactivities were completed. The Joint Review
also found that the integration o f territorial planning into the PES and at the district level requires
further work. Against this background, itwas agreedbetween the Government andthe G15 that
the Government over 2004 would complete the following actions: (1) MICOAwould coordinate
annual reports on the integration o f environment issues inseven key economic sectors; (ii)      a
territorial planning law would be adopted; and (iii)   territorial planningwould be integratedinto
decentralized economic district planning (for this purpose it was also agreed that the appropriate
indicator would be the number o f districts per year). It i s also expected that the South East
African tourism investment program will be prepared over the coming period.

128.   I n conclusion, under the componentfocused on improvingthe investmentclimate,
PRSCl expects to achievethefollowing results:

        The TORSandfinancing will have beenarranged for the diagnostic reviews o fBIM, BAu,
        SBM, and BCUMF to define actionplansfor transitioning to IAS, andthe BIMreview
        will have been initiated;
        The highest level o f import duties will have been reduced from 30% to 25%;
        A preliminary assessmentofthe time andcost involvedinclearing customs will have
        been completed to establish baseline indicators;
        A survey ofthe time and cost involvedinregisteringa business will have been completed
        to indicate progress towards achieving international norms (against a 2002 baseline);
        A tripartite body, including representatives o fthe Government, the private sector and
        labor unions, will have discussed proposed revisions to labor market regulations and
        restrictions on hiringexpatriate labor will have beensignificantly reduced;
        TdM and mCe1will havebeenmade into separate corporate entities;
        A new (mobile) telecommunications provider will have entered the market;
        The Council o f Ministers will have approved the separation o f EdM accounts for
        generation, transmissionand distribution and also approved TORfor restructuring EdM;
        MADERwill initiate work to reform its research institutionsand also to establish its
        strategic and operational monitoring systems inall o f its central andprovincial
        institutions.

E. Expanding Service Delivery

129.    Investing in human capital-by      improving health and educationoutcomes and
curtailing thespread of HIV/AIDS and malaria-are critical toMozambique's continued
economicand social development. The PARPA identifies four priority areas for service
delivery: (i) fighting HIV/AIDS; (ii)  expanding basic health care; (iii)expanding education,
especially for girls andwomen; and (iv) improving access to safe water and sanitation services.
The PAFmatrix includes a number of benchmarks ineach o fthese areas. PRSCl does not
provide direct support to any o fthese sectors, but PRSC2 will beginto provide support to
agriculture and the health sector and PRSC3 to the education sector as well as rural water supply.

Expanding health services:

130.    Provision of health services has improved over recent years, with assistancefrom IDA.
Whenthe civil war ended in 1992, Mozambique found itselfwith a weak healthcare
infrastructureand poor human capital. Provisiono f health services was urban-biased, as a result
o f boththe colonial system andwar-related destruction inthe rural areas. The health status o f
the populationwas among the worst inthe world, with an infant mortality rate (IMR) of 162per
1,000 anda maternal mortality rate (MMR)of 1,800 per 100,000 live births in 1995. The spread
o f HIV infection was still limited, but accelerating. Moreover, Government spendingon health
hadreached a low o f 1.5% o f GDP in 1994, although this was complementedby financing from
15 donors that contributed more than 40% o f total public spending on health. At the time, the
sector priorities were clearly to: (i)
                                     increase health spending; (ii) the health network; (iii)
                                                                   expand
strengthen the capacity o f doctors and nurses; and (iv) improve donor coordination so as to
reduce transaction costs for the Ministryo f Health (MoH). Inthis context, the Bank in 1995
approved the Health Sector Recovery Program (HSRP),which supported the rehabilitation o fthe


                                                 57

healthnetwork and helpedimprove the capacity ofproviders so as to increase coverage. The
project was designedto finance a time-slice of the government's program, thus layingthe basis
for developmentof a SWAp. Duringprogram implementation, IMRfell to 126in2000 and
intra-hospital MMRfrom 230 in 1993 to 160in2002. Between 1993 and2000, the overall
output of the governmenthealth systemroseby 59% and disparities betweenthe northern region
andthe rest ofthe country were somewhatreduced. In1999, Mozambique benefitedfrom the
EnhancedHIPC Initiative and social sectors were the major beneficiaries. Inaddition, economic
growth was strong andthis allowed the Governmentto increase the MoH budget from $16
million in 1995to $30 million in2003 (theyear inwhich the Bank also approvedthe HIV/AIDS
project). In2001, the Government finalized the PARPA, and the Bank andother donors began
to consider providingassistance inthe form of budget support. Becausethe health sector is
largely financedthrough the government budget, health is an important component ofthe
PARPA andthus anatural sector to be part of a series of PRSC operations.

131.    Despiteprogress to date, significant challengesremain to improvehealth outcomes and
reach theMDGs. Infant andmaternal mortality have improved, but remain high. Inaddition to
diarrhea and acute respiratory infection, malaria remainsamajor cause of morbidity and
mortality. HIV/AIDS prevalencehas increasedto about 14%, placing Mozambique amongthe
ten most affected countries inthe world. The current situation i s likely to worsen unless efforts
are scaled up and the responseis better coordinated. The main sector issues are as follows:

         Human resources are limited. Mozambique has one doctor per 44,000 inhabitants,
         comparedto one for 22,000 inSub-SaharanAfrica. Physician salaries are low compared
         to Lesotho, Botswana, and Zimbabwe, and incentives to work inthe provinces are
         limited. As aresult, humanresourcesare very unevenly distributed: fully 60% of
         higher-qualified staff are concentratedinMaputo City.
         There is unevengeographic accessto health services, with a strong bias inservice
         delivery infavor ofthe southernprovinces. The northern provinces are significantly
         underservedcomparedto the rest of the country, thus limiting the potential impact on
         health outcomes. Inaddition, services remain very much facilities-based: mobileteams
         and community health services are underdeveloped.
    0    Quality remainspoor. While the volume of drugs and materials andtheir distribution
         has improved, problemspersist. There are inequalities of supply betweenprovinces and
         the 2003 Expenditure Tracking and Service Delivery Survey (ETSDS) found that 58%of
         facilities hadrunout of at least one essential drug during the previous six months.12There
         i s also unevenness inthe quality of diagnosis andtreatment, and the supervision o f
         workers remains weak.
    e    Irregular applicationof user chargesis a disincentivetoseeking care. The user fee
         system is not consistently applied and enforced, making way for negotiations over the
         price or improper charging ofpatients. The ETSDSfound that in2002, although


  The ETSDSaimedto examineandimproveaccountability inthe sector. The survey foundthat delays inbudget
executionandweak control systems providedscope for leakagesandundue discretioninresourceallocation, with a
potentially negative impact on the quality andefficiencyof servicedelivery. Inparticular,the survey foundthat
record-keepingwas very poor, so it was impossibleto track funds betweendifferent levels; that the user charge
system is inequitable, lackstransparency, andprovidesrent-seekingopportunities; that six inten clinics ranout of at
least one essentialdruginthe previoussix months; andthat only eight inten staffwere actually onthejob at any
giventime. Expendituretracking surveysare beingundertakeninother sectors and are expectedto be repeated in
the healthsectorto monitor trends.


                                                       58

        consultations are supposed to be free, 35% o f children were requiredto pay. More
        analysis o fthis issue i s required, but it i s clear that the lack o ftransparency and uneven
        application o f exemptions may negatively affect the use o f services.
        Budget execution is low. For reasonsthat are still not fully understood, the health sector
        is one o f the sectors with the lowest budget execution rates (about 70% in2003). A
        number o f factors appear to contribute: (i) may be periods o f liquidity problems at
                                                          there
        the centrallevel; (ii) provinces receive their budgetary transfer late inthe year,
                               many
        resulting inlow levels o f execution; and (iii)     delays inthe processing o f accounts by
        provinces that have accounting capacity limitations contribute to delays inthe
        replenishment o ftheir accounts by the MoH.

132.    Government action aiming to improve health service delivery willfocus on
strengtheningmanagement and supervision and improving the coverage and skill levels of
paramedical staff. To help improve efficiency inthe use o fresources, MISAUis planningto
complete a constraint-focused health planningand costing exercise-an              action that the PRSC
benchmarks-that      will helpthe Ministryto estimate the marginal costs of overcoming
bottlenecks inexpandingaccess, providing essential health care inputs, andimprovingthe
quality o f coverage inthree types of health sector services (clinical services, outreach services,
and family/community services). This will enable decision-makers to choose between different
combinations o fthese services, which are tailored to different epidemiological problems and
have very different cost structures, to increase coverage and improve the epidemiological impact
o f the overall service provided. Onthe basis o fthis and other work, the national health strategy
(which i s at present more a list o f areas o f strategic focus than an outcome-oriented strategy for
the areas listed) will berevised, anda budgetingand cash flow program which attempts to link
inputs with activities, outputs, and outcomes, will be prepared every year indicating quarterly
financial needs that will fundedby the MPF. Output andoutcome performance will be
monitoredthrough the quarterly budget reports. Conditionality, including associated
benchmarks, for PRSC3 will be identified duringthe upcoming Joint Reviews (in
August/September 2004 and MarcWApril2005). As a result o f this work, it i s expected that
Mozambique's healthbudget would be more strategically designed so as to utilize funds for
operations and investment inareas where they would have the strongest impact inachieving
better health outcomes. The supply o f good-quality cost-effective services would improve
together with the demand for them, and the MDGhealth indicators (as well as the PAF matrix
indicators) would improve over time.

Achieving universalprimary school completion:

133.     The Government is also committed to achieving universalprimary school completion,
which numerousstudies have shown to be a significantfactor contributing to high growth
rates and substantial reductions in poverty. The ability o f individuals to move into more
remunerative off-farm employment, adopt riskier andmore complex agricultural technology, and
make a successful transition to an urban livingare all closely linked to literacy and levels o f
education. An illiterate individual will find it difficult to learn about and adopt new
technologies. Thus, to prepare Mozambicans for a better future, the Government i s committed to
increasing basic education opportunities for children and adults. To this end, the Government
has raised total education spending substantially, from 3.9% o f GDP to 5.8% between 1997 and
2001 (though Government funding, at 3.1% of GDP, remains below the international benchmark
of 3.5% stipulated inthe Education for All Fast-Track Initiative or the 4.0% average for sub-



                                                      59

SaharanAfrica). As a result, significant gains have beenmade, for example, inraising gross
enrolment andreducing repetitionrates, but challenges remain. Completion rates have risen, but
they are still very low (24% o f girls admitted to grade 1 complete grade 5 and only 10%
complete grade 7), indicating continuing inefficiency inthe system; enrolment inEP2 (higher
primary school, grades 6 and 7) is only about 28% o f the corresponding age group, severely
limitingprospects for reaching the education MDGofuniversalprimary education by 2015; and
the pupil-teacher ratio, at 64:1, is far above the internationalnormof40:1, indicating anacute
shortage o f adequately-qualified teachers.

134.     The Government has been takingaction to expand access and improve quality. To
achieve these dual objectives, the Government i s revisingthe education sector strategic program
(ESSP2) to ensure expansion of access to education andtackle critical issues related to gender,
HIV/AIDS and decentralized (district- and community-based) school constructionprograms. It
is developinga teacher education strategy which will foster a rapid increase inthe number o f
teachers meeting at least minimal qualifications, includingrevising the teacher and trainer
profiles, type o f training, deployment andcompensation guidelines. It i s introducing a new
primary school curriculum that i s relevant to today's circumstances as well as a lower-cost
community-based school-construction model which will enable the country to buildmore
facilities (3,800 additional classrooms are needed each year until2015-compared to 2,000 a
year beingbuilt-to       reach the education MDG, and unit costs inMozambique vary by as much
as 400% for similar buildings and on average are substantially higher thaninneighboring
countries). It i s also decentralizing sector management and financing. To this end, in2003 it
initiated a Direct Supportto Schools (DSS) program, through which all 8,000 primary schools
nationwide receive small cash grants (about $300 per school every six months) that arejointly
administered at the local level by the school headmaster, a local official, and an elected
representative o fthe community, thus enabling schools to finance locally-identified needs, from
a positive list, on a timely basis.13 This program, which i s supported under the PRSC, i s
expected to enable schools to obtainbooks and other teaching materials, thus addressing one of
the issuesthat has been a major source o f dissatisfaction for those attending school. As noted in
the Aide MCmoireofthe April 2004 Joint Review, the key Government actions to be completed
inthe coming 18-24 months include: (i)            improving sector planningand performance
mechanisms through the definition o fthe policy andinvestment framework for the education
system; (ii)   increasing the completion rate inprimaryeducation (EP1and EP2) through, among
other things, introducing the new curriculum and implementing the pre- and in-service teacher
education programs; (iii)      ensuring that funds allocated to the sector are fully disbursed, ina
timely manner, andthat efficiency o fresource utilization is improved through, among other
things, continuing the DSS program and implementing the pilot phase for the low-cost school
constructionprogram; and (iv) improving the efficiency and effectiveness o f post-primary
education through ensuringthat interventions inESSP2 are included and costed.




l3The availability of these resources is publicly advertised (newspaper advertisements indicatehow muchmoney
went to which schools, and when). The DSS follows the Government's operational procedures, which are very
simple and have beencodified. Eachschool has an account at the district level, inthe school's name, and to move
resources signatures are requiredfrom three individuals: the school headmaster, the district education officer, and
the elected representative o fthe community (this can be, for example, the chief or the head o f the local Parents-
Teachers Association). The DSS fits well with the Africa region's increasing focus on community-driven
development as well as the World Development Report on incentives, because ifthe schools manage the resources
well, they get more.

135.     Thisfirst PRSCseries will not explicitly support educationsector reform until PRSC3,
butpreparatory work will be completed in the meantime. Further work needs to be done to
analyze the causes for Mozambique's highdrop-out and low completion rates: the contribution
of demand-side factors (poverty, direct costs, and opportunity costs) or supply-side factors
(incomplete schools, distance to school, language o f instruction, quality o f instruction, teacher
gender, school calendar andhours of instruction) are unknown. Understandingthese causes i s
critically important, as high drop-out and repetition rates make the system exceedingly
inefficient: it takes 18 years o f resource inputs, or $613, to graduate one studentthrough grade 7
(compared to 10 years inZambia, or a planned cost o f $232). A PSIA on the impact o f school
fees, which i s believedto be an important cause, will help to close this gap inunderstanding.
Expenditure trends inthe sector indicate potential, as well as a need, for reallocation. Recurrent
costs inMozambique are highcompared to international standards, especially for the upper
primaryand secondary levels, andthe pay differential between teachers at different education
levels i s excessive, with upper primary and secondary school teacher salaries well above regional
averages: infact, secondary school teacher salaries are double the regional average as a multiple
of GDP per capita, unsustainablyhigh, and a significant impedimentto expanding secondary
education. Moreover, there appear to be unexploited opportunities for cost recovery inhigher
education and for more rational use o f limitedresources at the primary level (e.g. by mergingthe
EP1 and EP2 cycles into a single primary education cycle to permit a substantial rationalization
o fteacher and classroom resources across the two cycles). According to projections made under
the Educationfor All Fast-Track Initiative, achievinguniversal primary school completionwill
require sharp efficiency improvements to reduce unit costs as well as a significant increase in
external assistance-but    even then a financing gap is likely to remain. Inline with the targets
identified duringthe April 2004 Joint Review, triggers for PRSC3 will be identified in
forthcoming Joint Reviews and are expected to focus on the implementation o f ESSP2 as a
whole or o fnationalpriority programs such as the in-service teacher education program
(CRESCER), the DSS, or the pilot program on low-cost school construction.

Improving access to safe water:

136.     The Government recognizes the key importance of the water sector towardsimproving
the health status of the nation and reducingpoverty. Mozambique is on track to achieve its
2005 target o f increasing access to safe water to 45% nationally. Inthe urbanwater sector, the
Government has been implementing a planto bringthe water supply systems inMozambique's
five largest cities underprivate management. Inthis context, the private urbanwater supply
operator, Aguas de Mogambique (AdM), has increased access by 20% inBeira and 40% in
Nampula; inaddition 90% o f water samples now comply with Government requirements while
the tariffhas increased steadily from $0.18 in 1995 to $0.40 in2002, helpingthe operator to
approach financial viability. Inthe meantime, AdM has also accelerated delegated construction
works and visibly improved the conditions o f offices, stores, plant and equipment, while the
water supply regulator (FIPAG) has substantially improved its financial management systems.
Significant progress has also been made inimproving water supply inrural areas over the past
decade. Between 1992 and 2002, rural water supply coverage increased from about 10% to 25%,
andthe Government adopted a sound policy andmore efficient institutional arrangementswhich
enabled it to leverage public expenditures through greater participation o f communities, users
and the private sector inways that will also improve sustainability. Inparticular, the Rural
Water Supply and Sanitation (RWSS) Transition Plan has been piloted successfully ina few
provinces and districts, and the policy on tariffs and management models for small pipedsystems



                                                  61

i s now being formulated, with pilot implementation inseveral communities. The challenge now
i s to nationalize this successful pilot program and build the capacity o f relevant institutions to
manage the different programs, especially at the provincial level. While lack of funding has
beenidentified as a major impedimentto further increases inthe supply o f water, it is likely that
the amount of fundingrequiredcan bereduced with improvedM&Esystems and increased
private-sector and community involvement.

137.     This PRSC series, under PRSC3, will support reforms intended to improve access to
and the sustainability of safe water and sanitation services in rural areas. This will be
achieved through expandingimplementation o fthe RWSSTransition Planto additional
provinces, adopting and implementing the policy for tariffs andmanagement models for small-
pipedsystems, improving M&Esystems, and developing an actionplanto facilitate increased
involvement o fthe private sector inrural water supply and sanitationto improve efficiency and
bringdownboth investment and recurrent costs. Sanitation andhygiene promotion will be
carried out at the community level inconjunction with improving water supply. Inaccordance
withthe findings ofthe April 2004 Joint Review, priority in2004 should be givento the
implementation o f the rural water transition plan, inparticular to the supply chains, the
privatization o f EPARs, the management models for small systems, and experimentationwith
newtechnologies, while in2005 and 2006, the focus should be on continuing to decentralize and
deconcentrate rural water supply and sanitation programs as well as buildingcapacities at the
provincial level and initiating the privatization of the EPARs. As inother sectors to be supported
by the PRSC series, key measureswill be identifiedandbenchmarked duringsubsequent Joint
Reviewsand drawing on their conclusions. This PRSC series will not support urbanwater
supply andsanitation: on the "utility" model adopted inMozambique, recurrent expenditures
and small works, such as extensions to distribution systems, are intendedto be supported by the
utilities' own cash flow and not the Government. Neededlarger infrastructure investments, such
as a $20 million investmentrequiredto expand Maputo's treatment capacity, will instead
continue to be funded by the Bank's sector investment loans,14the IFC (ifcash flow is robust
enough to handle debt service), and perhaps partial risk guarantees.

138.     Government actions to expand service delivery will not be supported until PRSC2 (in
the case of health care) or PRSC3 (in the case of education and rural water supply);
accordingly, PRSCl does not expect to achieve the results under this component.

F. ReformMeasuresandActions TakenPriorto Board

 139.    The listof prior actions that the Governmentcompletedpriorto PRSCl are noted
below:

Public Sector Capacity and Accountability
     0   The Government maintainedanadequate macroeconomic policy framework. Although
         the IMF's previous PRGF arrangement ended inJune 2003, Fundstaff inearly 2003
         reached an understanding with the Government on quarterly indicative targets to monitor
         performance during the remaindero f 2003, and these targets were met.
     0   The Government formulated its 2004 budgetwith agreed allocations to PAWA priority
         sectors and executed its 2003 budget consistent with agreed allocations; inparticular, it



l4 National Water Development 1 and National Water Development 2 (see Table 13).


                                                    62

       spent 64.9% o f its 2003 budget (excluding interest payments andexpenditures related to
       the municipal elections inNovember 2003) on the PARPA priority sectors.
       The Government adopted regulations for implementing SISTAFE.
       To reduce aid dependency, revenue-raising measureswere deployed, including a 60%
       fuel tariff adjustment and application o f a withholding tax on the income o f public sector
       employees.
       Three key measuresincluded inthe public sector reform program were achieved: (i)        the
       landregistrationprocess was reduced to 90 days, once all documentationwas prepared;
       (ii) processofindustrialregistrationwassimplifiedandexpedited;and(iii)
           the                                                                          visitor
       visas are now being issuedat Mozambique's borders.
       The National Assembly passeda new law on decentralization, the Lei dos Org2iosLocais
       do Estado.
       The NationalAssembly passeda new anti-corruption law.

Investment climate
   0   The highest level of import duties was reducedfrom 30% to 25%.

140.    The credit amount of PRSC2, which is expected to be appraised and negotiated in
March-April 2005, will be afunction of the outcomes of thefollowing actions, which the
Governmentexpects to complete by December 31,2004:

Public Sector Capacity and Accountabilitv
        The Government will maintainan adequate macroeconomic policy framework.
        The Government will formulate its 2005 budget with agreed allocations to PARPA
       priority sectors and execute its 2004 budget consistent with agreed allocations; in
        particular, it will spend 65% o f its 2004 budget (excluding interest payments and
        expenditures related to the general elections scheduled for December 2004) on the
        PARPA priority sectors.
   0    The MPF will implement SISTAFEinthe ministryand its provincial directorates.
   0    The Council ofMinisters will approve a newprocurement decree that bringspublic
        procurement processes into line with international practice.

Investmentclimate
   0    The Government will present a new Financial Institutions law to the National Assembly.
   0    Decree 57/03 on hiringforeign labor will be revisedto relax some o f the rigidities inthe
        labor market.
   0    The Government will present a new Commercial Code to the National Assembly.

Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)

141.    The Governmentand its externalflnancingpartners need to make a major effort to
improvethe quality of M&Efor Mozambique's overall developmentprogram. The
informational aims o fthe PARPA have not yet been met. A 2001 review o f the policy process
found that the mechanisms o f data collection and dissemination within Government are
insufficient, and the 2003 PER found that even the sector-wide programs ineducation, health,
roads or agriculture do not automatically provide data linking expenditures, outputs and
outcomes. While most sectors produce a lot o f data, the key elements for public expenditures


                                                 63

and for results-based decision-making are often absent. Specialized efforts are requiredto obtain
basic expenditure data (especially for donor-funded expenditures), data on consigned revenues
(receitasprdprius)-though       as noted above the situation i s improving steadily-or breakdowns
o f spendingby level (e.g. hospitals vs. healthposts), location (capital, town, rural) or vertical
program (e.g. malaria).

142.    Thesecretariat of the Poverty Observatoryis the key agency developing an M&E
systemfor implementation of the PARPA, but no real M&E system exists atpresent. During
2003 the Government initiated a series o f Poverty Observatories at which the key documents-
including the PARPA and the Annual Progress Report on the PARPA-were             discussed with the
sectoral ministries andwith key stakeholders outside the Government; the most recent meeting
took place on May 18,2004 and was attended by the President, the Prime Minister and several
other ministers. Early experience indicates that much work remains to be done to make these
observatories results-oriented. The secretariat o fthe Poverty Observatory is currently
undertaking a diagnostic assessment o f M&Epractices withinall ministries andprovinces, but it
is already clear that M&E focused on the PARPA tends to be ad hoc and unsystematized.
Instead, each spending authority that has responsibility for implementing (some) PARPA and
PES initiatives employs (as an institutional requirement) a simple and compartmentalized
monitoring and reporting system that feeds into the annual PARPNPES reportingcycle. These
systems typically use a traditional input-activities-output format as well as an outdated
descriptive reporting style that does not lenditselfto meaningful utilization for policy
formulation and decision-making. The data collected are not integrated or results-focused and
are rarely usedto inform strategic program or project planningandmanagement. The only
Government attempt to set up a structured and integrated monitoring system is the National
Statistics Institute, which focuses almost exclusively on macroeconomic andhousehold surveys;
while this survey work is useful and starting to yield good longitudinal performance data, it does
not appear to be systematically linked to the PARPA or the PES and little effort appears to be
made to undertake evaluative reviews o fthe monitored data. Infact, the PARPA and PES,
though meant to be strategic performance documents, are not well integrated and do not make
good use o f the data that i s being collected inMozambique.

143.    ThePARPA and PES contain cross-cutting issues, but these are not clearly integrated
across sectors and acrossspending authorities, even though they are being taken into account
individually. There is now growing concern that the PARPA andthe PES need to be streamlined
ifamorecohesive, structured andcost-effective development programisto beimplemented.
The Poverty Observatory i s an important feedback mechanismfor PARPA implementationand
can serve as a powerful consultativebody to orient all key stakeholders towards implementing
the PARPA inamore efficient and effective manner, but it is still relatively untried andits own
efficacy will depend strongly on the effectiveness o f the PARPA M&E system that it creates.
The PARPA, including the biennially agreed PAF matrix, provides a good starting point as it
identifiesthe results that the Government hopes to achieve as well as some o fthe key
performance indicators (KPIs). These are supposed to be translated into the annual planning
document, the PES, but the PES does not yet provide a clear road-map o f the strategies and
actions that are needed to achieve PARPA targets inthe mediumand longterm. As a result,
overall planningremains somewhat superficial, and (by and large) national problems are being
addressedby discrete, poorly linked, non-national programs that, even when successful, produce
limitedandfragmented pockets of success. For example, there are M&Eefforts linkedto
projects and other initiatives inthe ministries o f Agriculture, Health, andEducation as well as in



                                                 64

connectionwith the Public Sector Reform Program and the decentralization work initiated by
UNCDF. But this i s both inadequate and inefficient. The PARPAM&E system shouldtake
these independent efforts into account and draw on them, but it also needs to integrate them into
a single system that focuses on improving results-based management. To this end, there is an
urgent need to provide key stakeholders with adequate exposure to modern planningand
management tools.

144.    ThePRSC will help the Governmentto improve thepolicy process by using thePARPA
toprioritize and expand its leadership and undertake more effective M&E. The Government
has already started this process by initiating work on more precisely defining the targets o fthe
PARPAthrough the PAF matrix andbringingthe "priority ministries" closer to the process of
pursuingthese goals. To support this process, the following will be added:

       An element o fpublic expenditure analysis andreview will progressivelybe integrated
        into the cycle o f financial management, through annualizing the PER exercise. This may
        entail analyzing a handful o f sectors per year, and may incorporatethe hiring-ino f
        required skills. Intime, such a reviewwould become a constitutive element o f the budget
        cycle, although this i s likely to require considerably more capacity than is available at
        present. The 2001review o fthe policy process recommended the creation o f a cadre o f
        public policy analysts. Inthe context o f the 2003 `PER, MPF has been seeking to create
        such in-house capacity, but much remains to be done.
        The action plan o fthe 2001 PER should be completed, creating mechanisms for reporting
        information on donors' contributions.
    0   Civil service reform i s needed, linking compensation to performance, and providing
        appropriate levels o f compensation. The present environment o f inadequate compen-
        sation creates undue incentives at the ministerial and sub-ministerial level for seeking
        donor-funded projects as these usually provide some benefits to the operating units. This
        inturnbecomesthe driver ofproject selection, inplace ofanoverall perspective that
        makes portfolio decisions inlight o f the PARPA's overall goals and outcomes. At the
        same time as civil service reform there should be a general tightening up o fthe
        conditions for ministerial own receipts; for ifthere i s proper compensation there i s no
        need for extra-budgetary transfers to support hiringand staffretention.

145.   An M&E assessment included in the October 2003 CASindicated that there is
substantial Government commitment to monitoringfor results as well as reasonablestatistical
capacity, and the Bank will work with the Government through the PRSC to build adequate
M&E systemsfor thePARPA and thePRSC. Commitment to monitoring PARPA
implementation comes from the highest level o f Government, including the President, the Prime
Minister, and several line ministries. Through the PRSC as well as work on updatingthe PAF
matrix, the Bank will help the Government and its partners to develop an adequate M&E system
for each o fthe indicators linked to the major PARPA outcomes, including the outcomes that are
explicitly identified as conditions for the PRSC. Inessence, this implies that Bank staff will
help: to conceptualize the linkages betweenthe PARPA's long-term objectives andthe medium-
term outcomes that are expected to contribute to achieving those objectives; to identify
appropriate indicators for those outcomes; to identify an appropriate data source (donor, or
survey, or administrative agency) for each indicator and obtain baseline data (or establish a
process to obtain a first measurement to serve as a baseline); and also to determine the quality
and reliability o f the indicator as well as the frequency and costs o f data collection and reporting.


                                                   65

New measurements against these indicators will thenbe obtained during future updates o fthe
PARPA matrix; trends and their causes will be analyzed; and recommendations will be made to
reorient Government action inlight o f these findings.

G. CreditAdministration

146.    The Credit willfollow IDA'Ssimplified disbursementproceduresfor adjustment
operations. Accordingly, Credit proceeds will be disbursed incompliance with the stipulated
release conditions. Disbursement will not be linked to any specific purchases and no procure-
mentrequirementswill beneeded. Once the Credit is approved bythe Board, the Borrower will
open and maintain a dedicated deposit account inUS Dollars for the Borrower's use. As the
singletranche is released on Credit effectiveness, IDA will disbursethe proceeds o fthe Credit
into the deposit account. IDA reserves the right to require an audit o f the deposit account.

H. EnvironmentalAssessment andRating

147.    Theproject has been designated to be a Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC); hence no
formal environment impact assessment (EU) is required. Nonetheless, environmental work is
plannedto take place during the implementation of PRSCl andbefore Boardpresentation o f
PRSC2, as PRSC2 will include support to the agriculture and health sectors and so i s expected to
be designated a Sectoral Adjustment Credit. Inparticular, it i s expected that the Government
will undertake anEIA with the objective o f identifying linkages betweenkey macroeconomic
and structural reforms policies andthe environmentinan effort to mainstreamthe environmental
sustainability dimensioninto the PRSC process. This analysis will develop a set o f measuresat
both the national and local government levels that can be taken to reduce poverty and enhance
environmental sustainability o fpolicy reforms. The underlying premise o f the analysis is that
environment andpoverty are linked inthree major ways: (i) reduction programs should
                                                               poverty
not damage the resource base and the environment on which poor people depend for their
livelihoods; (ii)improving environmental conditions can helpto reduce poverty and promote
sustainable pro-poor growth; and (iii) mitigating measures, as needed, should be identified as
part of policy dialogue. Inworking with the Government and other development partners, this
analysis should help to identify strategic entry points for mainstreamingkey issues o f the
poverty-environment nexus inMozambique into the PRSC process and ongoing policy reforms.
Inthis regard, the PRSC2andPRSC3 reformagendahas specified actions to beimplementedby
the Government. Inaddition, environmental work i s plannedfor each o fthe sectors that will be
supported inPRSC2 (agriculture and health) and PRSC3 (education andrural water supply).


                                  VI. BENEFITSAND RISKS

 148.   Thisfirst PRSCseriesfor Mozambique involves a number of benefits and risks.
Benefits, risks and risk-mitigation measures are detailed inthe following paragraphs.

 149.   The major benefits of the PRSC relate to the change in the instrument of aid delivery.
Inthe short term, the PRSC series is expectedto empower the Government o fMozambiqueinits
relations with the donors, by giving it greater control over externally-funded activities and
resources; strengthening the MPF, Council o f Ministers and National Assembly as drivers o f
public resource allocation; and promoting more coordinated donor behavior around the PARPA



                                                 66

andthe partnership agenda. Itwill also strengthenthe MPF inits relationswith other spending
authorities inMozambique. These objectives are fully consistent with recent international
agreements on aid modalities. Inthe mediumterm, the PRSC series i s expected to transform the
quality o f govemance and enhance the Government's capacity to reduce poverty, by reducing
transaction costs, increasing the allocative efficiency o f public spending, improving the
predictability o f external resource flows, increasing the effectiveness o fpublic administration,
and strengtheningthe structures and processes o f democratic accountability. It will also helpto
reorient financial modalities, promote newforms o f dialogue situated innational institutional
contexts, and refocus TA and capacity-building on mainstream government functions. Inthe
long term, o f course, the PRSCs are expected to help reduce poverty.

150.    One set of risks concerns the capacity of the Government to implement the measures
supported by the PRSC and achievethe gains expected. There may be a gap between the
PARPA, which lacks specificity but (or perhaps therefore) has broad commitment, andthe PRSC
program matrix, which i s specific but may have less broad commitment, with the result that
measures identified inthe PRSC matrix do not have adequate ownership and are not completed.
This risk is beingmitigatedthrough the national institutional process being built around the PAF
matrix, which is seen as updatingand operationalizingthe PARPA while also attractingbroad
commitment; PRSC prior actions and triggers are explicitly a subset o f the actions included in
the PAFmatrix. There is a riskthat the MPFwill notbeable to adhere strictly to the financial
calendar for releasing budgetary allocations to spending agencies-discipline that i s neededto
makethe PRSC work; this riskwill be mitigatedby helpingthe Government to strengthen the
MTFFand maintaina sound financial calendar from the beginning. Another risk involves
weaknesses inpublic financial management, or rivalry betweenthe MPF and one or more
sectoral ministries, which may result instakeholder pressure (notionally or really) to earmark
budget support for specific sectors and/or activities, with the result that the MPF andthe
Government will be effectively disempowered. This risk i s beingmitigated through an upfront
focus on improving the fiduciary framework, including mechanisms usedto control the flow o f
funds. Finally, there is a short-term riskthat transaction costs will increase, withthe resultthat
some Government stakeholders may wish to abandon this approach before a long-term
downward trend has time to establish itself. This risk i s being mitigated by discussing
expectations with all stakeholders and ensuring realism to the greatest extent possible.

151. Another set of risks concerns the ability of Mozambique'sfinancingpartners,
including the Bank, to stay with the PRSChudget supportprocess long enough to realize its
potential. Gains inallocative efficiency, whether inprinciple or inpractice, may be difficult to
demonstrate. Liquidity constraints-partly      due to donors' unpredictable disbursements-may
hamper the timely allocation o f treasury resources. The Bank and other donors are mitigating
this riskthrough institutionalizing processesto makebudget support more predictable, andwill
monitor budget process gains as a reasonable proxy for improving allocative efficiency. There is
also a risk that greater predictability inexternal resource flows will not materialize, as donors
make different assessments o f the situation on the ground, experience constraints on their ability
to make financial commitments, harbor different expectations about what greater predictability
implies, andtake different approaches to usingthe leverage whichhigher levels o f general
budgetsupport makepossible (some donors have indicated reluctance to cede this leverage).
This risk is beingmitigatedthrough anopen and extensive discussion of donor aid modalities,
witha view to understanding eachdonor's systems, expectations, and scope for movement and
confirming them inan agreed MoU. There is also a risk that donors (including at times the



                                                  67

Bank) will want to introduce externally-generated conditionality into the PRSC and PAF
processes: inparticular several (bilateral) donors appear increasingly inclined to introduce
political conditionality into their thinkingand actions. This may cause tension between the
donors andthe Government and, inthe extreme case, an unwillingness (on one side or the other)
to proceed with increased levels o f programmatic lending. This risk i s being mitigated by
helpingall donors representatives to recognize that increasing budgetsupport implies support for
an agenda that they cannot fully specify and by helpingthe Government to recognize that the
donors supporting such an agenda have a reasonable expectation to consultation and influence.

152.     Finally, there are some external risks that may impact the Government's ability to
implement the reform program that the PRSC supports. National elections will take place in
late 2004. Uncertainty over their outcome could leadthe Government to lose focus and fail to
implementneededreforms; contentionabout the reported results may also leadto a period o f
instability, possibly marred by violence. Whatever party wins, the new Government will also
need time to learnto govern, and there i s always the riskthat it will initiate an inappropriate shift
inpolicy direction. The Government's commitment to free and fair elections (achieved inall
previous elections) as well as its efforts to engage society inarticulating a national vision
through the Agenda 2025 exercise and monitoring PARPA implementationthrough the Poverty
Observatory will help to mitigate some o fthese risks. Inaddition, the Bank will try to mitigate
themby actively engaging the key political parties prior to elections onthe maindevelopment
challenges facing Mozambique and by preparinga C E M inFY06 on the challenge o f sustainable
broad-based growth. Another set o f risks involves external factors such as an extended global
slowdown, commodity price fluctuations, international agricultural trade barriers, regional
political and economic developments (particularly inSouth Africa and Zimbabwe), and
exchange rate and foreign capital flow fluctuations, which could each impede growth and make
it difficult for the Government to remainengaged inreform. To help mitigate these risks, the
Bankwill work closely withthe Fundandlike-minded donors to help the Governmentto
maintain macroeconomic stability; it will also address some o fthe larger geopolitical issues
throughout its policy dialogue at senior levels within the institution.

                                        VII.    CONCLUSION

153.     Mozambique is apoor country which has realpotentialfor growth as well as a
Government that has demonstratedcommitment topoverty reduction, manifested by a sound
reform program and its recent PARPA Progress Report. Recent householdsurvey data indicate
that the country's potential, coupled with its commitment and programs, are yielding
encouraging results. Yet there are many challenges that need to be fully and adequately
confronted ifMozambique's full potential i s to be realized. Selecting the right development
constraints to address at the right time, inan environment o f significant commitment but limited
capacity, has been an important contributor to the success o f the Government and of the World
Bank Group inMozambique. This PRSC aims to help the Government to focus its development
efforts on the matters which are country priorities right now. Buildingpublic-sector capacity and
accountability, improving the investment climate, and expanding service delivery are all part of
the long-termdevelopment agendainMozambique andover time they are likely to helpbring
growing prosperity to all o f its citizens, including especially the poor.

                                     PublicFinancialManagement

1.      Over the past few years, the Bank has worked with the Government and other donors to
complete an extensive review o f Mozambique's public financial management accountability
arrangements, covering its public expenditure, procurement and financial management systems.
A Country FinancialAccountability Assessment (CFAA) was completedinDecember 2001;a
Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) inlate 2003; and Public Expenditure Reviews
inDecember 2001 and September 2003. The results ofthiswork, andthe status ofthe action
plans derived from them, i s detailed inthis Annex.

2.      Public Expenditure Review of December 2001: The 2001 PER found serious
deficiencies inthe fiscal management system, particularly inpublic accounting, cash
management and auditing. Inparticular, public accounting covered only a quarter o f
Government spending, ignoring both ministerial own receipts (receitasprdprias) and donor-
fundedexpenditures; cash managementwas inefficient and lacking intransparency becausethere
were large numbers o f Government accounts which were not beingtracked; and internal auditing
was ineffectual due to a lack o f capacity and funding. The Government moved boldly to
modernize the system in2001 by passing a new law, the Lei daAdministraqGoFinanceira do
Estado, which inprinciple modernizes the entire fiscal management system. This step was taken
to correct a set o f difficult legacies from the past: single-entry accounting; a multiplicity o f
government accounts rendering cashmanagement extremely difficult; and limited budget
coverage inthat receitasprdprias (ministerial own receipts) were tolerated and donor-funded
expenditures not recorded. The key reform o f the new law was to provide for an integrated
financial management information system, entitledthe SistemaIntegrado de Administraqfio
Financeira do Estado (SISTAFE). Inorder to prepare the way for the SISTAFE, a three-phase
program o f actions was agreed uponwith the authorities: "pressing actions" (reproduced in
Table 1below) to be done duringthe course o f the preparatory work of the PEMR, "priority
actions" (Table 2) to be done during2002, and mediumterm actions for the period 2003-2005
(Table 3).

3.      Most of the short term `pressing actions" have been executed (Table 1). A new, more
detailed functional classifier was introducedinto the budget, consistent with UnitedNations
(U.N.)guidelines, witha view to trackingpoverty-relatedexpenditures more accurately, butits
implementation has been incomplete, as only the broad categories were used. The detailed
classifier, which will permit tracking o fpoverty-related expenditures, will be implementedwith
the introduction of SISTAFEin2004. The budget, which hadpreviously beendone inreal
terms, owing to the highrates o f inflation o f the early 1990s, is now being done innominal
terms. The regulations o fthe newfinancial management law were completed, and restrictions
were introduced on banks accounts heldby public institutions (such accounts have to be
authorized by the Direcqlio Nacional do Tesouro(DNT) as a co-holder and they have to be
closed three months after the budgetyear to which they applied).

4.      Progress with the "priority actions"for 2002 was good but is incomplete. As Table 2
shows, a significant share o f receitasprdprias (off-budget revenues, or "consigned revenues" as
they are now identified by the budget) were included inthe 2003 Government budget. The 2003
budget forecasts a collection of consigned revenues on the amount o f Mt 106 billion--equivalent
to about $4.4 million. The 2003 first semester budget report states that collections o f these



                                                   79

revenuesamounted to about Mt 86.7 billion. Moreover, and as a result o f work done by the
MPF, an additional Mt 4.3 billion were also collectedbut were not included inthe first semester
budgetreport. The total amount o f consigned revenues raised inthe period January-June 2003
add up to Mt 91 billion, or the equivalent o f $3.8 million. It i s likely that the total amount o f
these revenues to be registered along 2003 will exceed $7 million (studies done inthe past had
estimated that these revenues could potentially generate about $7.5 millionper year). These
revenues are expected to grow as the Government implementsreforms such as the introduction
o f SISTAFE andthe revision o fthe planning andbudget systems. Eleven items inhealth and
public works, as well as the education, agriculture and other ministries, are still e~cluded'~.

5.       Budget execution reporting has improved, but most donor-funded expendituresare still
excluded. The quarterly budget execution reports now present all actual expenditures usingthe
newbudgetfunctional classification, but only inbroad categories; the detailed classifier has not
yet beenimplemented, and the revised appropriation o fNovember 2002 was not reported inthe
budget executionreport o fthe first quarter o f 2003. A major step forward was made inthe
budget executionreport o fthe first halfo f2002, when for the first time tables were presented
reporting donor-funded expenditures on the investment account. Yet as o f late 2002 the reported
executed expenditures were only 8% o f the budget plan.

6.       Double-entry accounting needs to be introduced. The so-called "complementary
period" after the end o fthe fiscal year, duringwhich payments may be made for commitments
duringthe financial year, was reduced from three months to two. Some training indouble-entry
accounting was done, but double-entry has not yet been introduced throughout the system. The
proposed shift from the duode`cimo system o freplenishment to modified accrual accounting i s
probably too ambitious for the time being. Untilsuch time as the SISTAFE system is

implemented, it would be more prudentto improve the replenishment system, through
appropriate training, and make it more flexible. A modified cash basis of accountingwill be
appliedwith the implementation o f SISTAFE through the introduction o f a budget credit system
against which commitments will be registeredand accounted for when a transaction i s incurred.
The release o f credits will serve as virtual cashallocations andwill determine and control the
ceiling o f spending per budget line item. Inthe meantime, while the SISTAFE system i s being
implemented, the replenishment ("duodicimo") system needs to be made more flexible and
training should be givento enable the lowest level units to operate within it efficiently.

7.       Much remains to be done in cash management. The multiplicity o f Government
accounts with the central bank and the commercial banks needs to be inventoried. Although
"globalizing accounts" have been created with a view to moving to a single interlinked account
arrangement, this has little meaninguntil such time as all the accounts are interlinked and the
MPF is able to read o f f inreal time the amount o f cash held.

8.       Much remains to be done in internal controland auditing. The internal audit
department (IGF) was to have its own budget line, butthis was not done. It was also to be
strengthened with new hiringbut this is still under consideration. The budgetary allocation for
the Administrative Tribunal was increased by 10%inreal terms between 2001 and 2003. It was
proposed that the Administrative Tribunal set up partnerships with private auditing firms and
twinningarrangements with foreign supreme audit institutions, but as of 2003 such arrangements
as hadbeen made have had only a low level of impact.

9.       Themedium termprogram offiscal managementreform needs to be completed. The
actions included inthe mediumterm reform program of the PER2001, reproducedinTable 2,
remain important and will continue to be addressedwhile SISTAFE is being implemented.
Among the major elements here are: (i)             the enhancement ofthe role o fthe MediumTerm
Financial Framework (MTFF).l6Makingthe MTFF into an operational instrument will aid
budgetingand execution inthe PARPApriority sectors (currently, the lack o f a medium-term
perspective results inpurely incremental budgeting(that is, spending authorities receive a fixed
percentage increase over the previous year's budget) with no real link with activities or outputs
or outcomes); (ii)    the introduction o f double-entry accounting, under the cash basis17;(iii)            cash
planningandbudgeting are among the corner stones o fthe conceptual business model
underlying SISTAFE and an integral part o fthe design o f the system; introducing monthly and
annual cash plans will enable more rational use o f resources, resulting inconsiderable savings
because it will be possible to hold less (non-interest-earning) cash overall and to resort less
frequently to usingtreasury bills; (iv) reports on domestic and external debt, lending, cash flows,
andtax expenditures alongside the Conta Geral do Estado will enable a comprehensive view o f
state finances which i s one o f the ultimate objectives o fthe newFinancial Management Law";

information managementsystem, SISTAFE. A budget of $27 million was developed, and
funding for the bulk of it was secured from donors including the World Bank. The timetable
anticipates procurement (viz. determination of the information technology architecture and
account component package) inthe second half of 2003, roll-out of the system inthe Ministries
of Finance andEducation inthe last quarter of 2003, andextension to the remaining sector
ministriesin2004. The focus will initially be on the introduction of a single treasury accountin
2003 for all line ministriesandthe improvement of accounting. After 2004 the focus will shift to
internal control, auditing, accounting for state property (PatrimGnio) and debt management.

11.      CountryFinancial AccountabilityAssessment (CFAA): The CFAA sought to enhance
knowledge of financial accountability arrangements inthe public sector inMozambique and was
ajoint undertaking of the government, Bank, and other donors. It found that, untilthe public
financial management systemi s strengthened, the risk ofwaste, diversion and misuse of funds in
Mozambique was high. The CFAA also found that material receipts and payments were
excluded from the budget and from Government accounting and reporting systems; accounting
systems and standardswere outdated; internal auditing, external auditing, and parliamentary
oversight remainedweak; and so financial managementcontinued to involve ahigh fiduciary
risk. To strengtheninstitutional capacities andreduce these risks, the Government has been
pursuing apublic sector reformprogram aiming to establisha newpublic financial management

system; improve the legal, judicial and court system; reform the Government pay scale and
reduce the number o f "ghost" workers (estimated at 15% o f all civil servants); gradually
decentralize civil services to more local authorities; and implement a broad training program for
the public sector to enable governance to face futurechallenges. Inaddition, consistent with
PARPApriorities, the Government has undertaken a number of important initiatives to enhance
efficiency, transparency and accountability inthe public sector:

    0   MPF has published quarterly budgetexecution reports since May 2000 and developed
        procedures for obtaining data on donor disbursements, to be annexed to these reports;
    0   A financial management informationsystem (SISTAFE) has beendesigned, together
        with a detailed plan for introducingit into spending authorities, andthe system will also
        introduce detailed functional and program classifiers into the budget;
        Public Expenditure Reviews (PERs) were completed in2001and 2003 jointly by the
        Government and donors, and a series o f annual PERs i s plannedfor the coming years;
    0   A new Public Finance Management Law was approvedinNovember 2001 and
        regulations were passed in2002;
    0   Treasury accounts at the central and commercial banks are being rationalized; and
    0   A Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) has beencompleted.

12.     To improveMozambique'spublicfinancial managementsystem, a number of
prioritized recommendationswere highlightedin the CFR4DevelopmentAction Plan. Table
4 reproduces this action planand summarizes progress to date. The Bank and DfIDare working
with the Government to complete a new fiduciary assessmentto fill inexisting knowledge gaps.

13.     CountryProcurementAssessment Review (CPAR): Completed inFY03, the CPAR
reviewed the Government's procurement system against the generally accepted international
principles o f sound procurement management, i.e. transparency, economy and efficiency
necessary for an optimal use of scarce public funds. The report provided: (i)   an analysis o fthe
country's public sector procurement, including the legislative framework, organizational
responsibilitiesand capabilities, present procedures and practices, and how well these work; (ii)
a general assessment of the institutional and organizationalrisks associated with the procurement
process; and(iii) a detailed action plan for improvements. The CPAR recommendations were
coordinated with other donors that are also engaged inprocurement reform initiatives with the
Government.

framework, modernized procurement procedures, proficient staff, independent control
mechanism, anti-corruption measures) are partially satisfied inMozambique, andthat
improvements are necessary ina number o f areas, either by starting reform initiatives suggested
inthe report or by completingreforms already underway underthe procurementcomponent of

the procurement code, the establishment of an adequateprocurement body andthe training of
staff, are being supported by IDA'SPublic Sector Reformproject. The CPAR recommended
implementation o f a set o f priority actions, including enhancing the capacity o f the Task Force
for procurement reform; preparingcomprehensive procurement legislationbased on the existing
legal framework already present, to meet internationally acceptable standards; preparing standard
and comprehensive biddingdocumentsandproceduresmanuals; strengthening the MPF's
Procurement Department to assume the functions o f a Procurement Policy and Monitoring
Directorate; promoting dissemination and use o f ethics code inthe context o fthe CRSP;
launching a sustained procurement capacity-building program; and involving the private sector
and civil society as a whole inprocurement reform. The risksresulting from resistance to change
that could hamper a successful implementation o fthe proposed reforms are considered to be low
becausethese reforms are fully compatible with the general aim o fthe Government to modernize
procurement regulations and practices andwith the Government's decentralizationpolicy.

15.      As seenabove, the recommendations ofthe CFAA, CPAR and PERs were considered by
the Government and donors andconsolidated into action plans. Among the key outcomes o f
these plans are: improvedpredictability o f resource allocation and resource flows at the central
andprovincial levels; improved quality and transparency o f fiscal data; enhanced integrityo f
public sector institutions andan increased supply o f critical skills. Activities to achieve these
outcomes are being addressed through Government initiatives and programs including the Public
Sector Reform Program. Moreover, there i s significant donor involvement and coordination in
initiatives to strengthen fiduciary management as well as harmonization around assessing and
managing fiduciary risks when providing budget support.

TheProgram

3.        The main objective of the Government's PARPA is a substantial red ction in the levels of
absolutepoverty in Mozambique through the adoption of measures to improve the capacities and the
opportunities available to all Mozambicans, especially the poor. A specific ob ective is to reduce the
incidence of absolute poverty Pom 70percent in 1997 to less than SO perce t by 2010. The last
household expenditure survey, completed in 2002/2003, showsthatpoverty incide ce headcount has been
reducedto 54percent in 2003 @om 69.4percent in 1997). TheGovernment'seo mitment to addressing
the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is strong and is reflected in the PAI PA and the matrix of
actions and indicators included in the Perjormance Assessment Framew rk agreed with the
Government's direct budget support and balance-of-payments supportpartners. heprogram dejneal in
                                                                               Tp
these instruments, and in the PRSC matrix, will be implementedthrough Govern+ent systems controlled
by the Government'sannual Economic andSocialPlan (PES) and the annual Budget (OE).

4.        The overall aim of the economic program for 2004-06 is to                reduce poverty by
consolidating macroeconomic stability, address remaining structural
creation and ensure that budgetaiy allocationsare compatiblewith the

5.              TheGovemnrentprogramincludes tlrree main components that are an integralpart ofthe wider
PARPA and PAF: Theseare:

               Buildiiigpublic-sector capacity and accountability: Under this component, the Govemment is
               committed to maintaining macroeconomic stability, improving public financial management,
               and enhancing governance. The Government will maintain macroeconomic stability through
                adhering to an appropriate macroeconomic pamework with consistent fiscal and monetary
               policies.      It will improve public financial management through:      monitoring closely and
                allocating 65% of its resources or more to pro-poor spending: increasing budgetary eflciencj,
                transparency and accountability by expanding coverage and implementing SISTAFE; and
                improving the timeliness and quality of the national accounts, auditing and budgetary reporting.
               In addition, it will reduce aid dependency through mobilizing further domestic resources;
               deepen its understanding of the incidence and causes of poverty through completing and
                analyzing the results of the second household income survey; and update the PARPA to reflect
                the country's changedcircumstancesas well asprogress in implementing reforms. Finally, the
                Government aims to improve governance by bringing public procurement into line with
                internationalpractice; restructuring its key sectoral ministries to be moreiresponsive to citizeu
               needs; decentralizing the delivery of specifiedservices to local authorities to expandcommunity
               participation andgovernmentaccountability; andjghtingcorruption.

               Iniproving the investntent climate: Governmentaction in this area is intended to: strengthen
               the Jinancial sector, particularly by enhancing the independence of the centraI bank and
                completing the divestiture of Government ownership in the banking sector; improve the
                regulatory framework by reducing impedimentsto enby and exit and increasing theflexibility qf
                the labor law; and expand infrastructure services by reducing communication costs and making
                electricity less expensive and more reliable-all with a view to making domestic productioii
                more competitive.

               Exparision of service delivery: Government action in this area under PRSCl is limited to
                enablingprimary schools tofinance locally-identified needsfor basic supplies on a timely bash:,
                throughproviding all schools with small grants throughthe Direct Support to Schoolsprogram.
                In addition, public expenditure reviews and environmental work will be completed in the
                agriculture and health sectors in preparation for bringing these two sactors into the PRSC
                series in PRSC2.

Overview andActions in 2003

7.        Over the past years, Mozambique has succeeded in creating a macroeconomic environment
supportive of economic growth. PARPA implementation in 2003 was broadly positive, as concluded in
the April 2004 Joint Review (involving the Government, most major donors and the World Bank). In
particular, the Joint Review found that the Government actions included in the 2003 Performance
Assessment Framework (PAg matrix, which updates the PARPA'Soperational matrix, were largely met,
including in the PARPA priority sectors (education, health, agriculture and rural development, and
infrastructure). In terms of cross-cutting reforms, notable achievements in 2003 were the revision of
some labor market rigidities through a new decree, the Jinancial audit of the country's largest
commercial bank, the rise in tax revenues, the integration of the PARPA implementationreporting into
theBalanco do PES, and the approval of the legal andjustice sector strategicplan.

8.         Theprior actionsfor PRSCl were also met. Inparticular, there wasprogress in implementing
SISTAFE, withpublication of the SISTAFE regulations in Decree I7/2002. The Technical Unitfor the
Public Financial Management Reform Program (UTRAFE) has been established, the Data Processing
Center has beensubstantially strengthened, andphase I of the eCUT-fisica system is now operational.

9.        In addition, in 2003 the Government allocated 64.9%of its total budget expenditures (excluding
interest payments and spending on the November 2004 municipal elections) on the priority sectors
referred to in the PARPA (see Table 1attached).

10.       Domestic tax revenue mobilization increasedfiom 12.5% in 2002 to 13.3% in 2003 mainly
through adiusting thefuel tari$f(in accordancewith Decrees 19/2003 and 56/2003) and implementing a
withholding tax on the income of public sector employees (in accordance with Decree 20/2002 and
Ministerial Diploma 22912002).        These two measures increased Government revenues in 2003 by
approximately 0.7% of GDP.

II.       Inpublic sector reform, thefollowing Government actions werecompleted:

           The land registration process was reducedfrom over 120days to a maximum of 90 days, once
          all necessary documentation is presented, in accordance with Circular OOl/GDN/2002, issued
           by the Ministry of Agriculture and the National Directory of Geography and Cadastre; with the
          result that the number of registrations completed rosefrom 1,301in 2002 to 2,462 in 2003.

          A new regulatoryframework has been adopted, in accordance with Decree 39/2003, to simplify
          and expeditetheprocess of industrial registration.

           Visitor visas are now being issued at Mozambique's borders, in accordance with Decree
           38/2000 as well as a Ministerial Decree issued by the Ministry of the Interior on October 17,
          2000 (which activated it).

12.       In addition, the Parliament passed a new law on decentralization, tlie Local State Organs Law
8/2003. This law provides for increased autonomy of district authorities as well as the legal basisfor
treating a district authority as a budget entity, thereby strengthening the territorial dimension of public
sector management.

13.       Finally, the Parliament alsopassed an anti-corruption (Law Numberpending;). This law will be
signed by the President of the Republic before June 7, 2004 and will be imme
in tlie Boletim da Repriblica.


                                                  90
                                                                                                          3

14.       Notwithstanding thispe@ormance, the economy remainsfragile, and there were some shortfalls
in fully meeting the PAF outcome targets for 2003. Primary education (EPl) completion rates fell
slightly short of the target and continue to be off-track for meeting the MDG goal. Progress in roads
rehabilitation andperiodic maintenance was slow due inpart to the appreciation of the Rand against the
Metical and existing concerns within the VAT system. In addition, the reform of the legal andjudicial
sector is showing slowprogress.

Mncroecononiic nianngement

15.        The Government in 2003 implemented appropriate macroeconomic management, as most of its
quantitative targets were met (e.g. revenue, real GDP growth, international reserves) or missed by a
small margin (domestic primary deficit), and important structural benchmarks were also met (the Xzx
Tribunals Law was approved by the Parliament). Thus, real GDP grew by 7.1 percent in 2003, which
was in line with the average of about 6per cent annually between 1996and 2002.

16.       Annual injation, which rose to 13.8% at year-end against a 10.8% target, constituted an
important exception. The 2003 inflation was due to 0) the impact on food prices from the regional
drought earlier in the year, (ii) the appreciation of the rand against the metical, and (iii) signifcant
monetary expansion associated with the concentration of Governmentspending in late 2003, financed.
with delayeddisbursements of external aid that was not sterilized by sellingforeign exchange.

Goventmice

17.        The Governmentmadeprogress in implementingits medium-termpublic sector reform program
in 2003. Efforts have been made to create supportfor the reforms both within the government and in the
general public. All ministries are undertakingfunctional analyses to determine how to optimize thcir
functions, Five ministries are at an advanced stage in their work (MADER, MSAU, MINED, MAE and
MPF), and one (`MIC) is nearing completion. In addition, the Parliament has pawed an anti-corruption
bill, and a corruption survey is underway to evaluate the experiences of entrepreneurs,private citizens
and civil servants with poor governance, which will enable the Government to establish a governance
baseline, The Government has also signed the Affican Union Convention on anti-corruption, which
needs to be ratified, and the SADCprotocol on anti-corruption.

 18.          Progress hm also been made in the area of deconcentrating state administration through
passing /he Local State Organs law, but further work is required to (i) create siifjlcient financial and
administrative capacity at district (and provincial) levels; (ii) involve all stakeholders in the planning
process; (iii) strengthen the ability of districts to collect their own revenues; and (iv) institutionalize
consultativemechanisms at the local level.

Public Finance Managentent

 19.       In thefield of publicfinancial management, ongoing reforms are being implementedto improve
 effectiveness and transparency in usingpublic resources, and to build capacity in public administration
 in order to increaseeficiency.

20,        Taw reform made signifcant progress during 2003, with the introduction of new income taxes
 (individual and corporate income), a motor vehicle tax, and a large increase in the fire1 tax to offet
accumulatederosion through inflation. Totalrevenues roseffom 13.3%to 14.3% of GDP in 2003, with a
strong performance on income tax (increasingpom 18%to 22% of total tax receipts). Aiming at@rther
 increases in tax mobilization, the Governmentis in theprocess of creating a Central Revenue Authority:
 the actionplanfor its establishment by 2006 was approved by the Ministry of Planning and Finance and


                                                 91

theprocess has started through restructuring the Directoratefor Taxes andAudit (DNIA), which will be
integrated with the Customs Directorate (DGA) under the new revenue authority. Improvements were
also observed in customs clearance procedures, with new legislation simpli&ing customs control.
Additionally, pursuant to Decree 36/2002, the top import duties on consumption goods were reduced
from 3Oper cent to 25per cent beginning in January 2003.

Privatesector mid business environment

21.        Recognizing the important role of the private sector in promoting economic growth and
employment, Government policies and reforms will improve the business environment for the
development of private sector activities, and reinforce the role of the market in the economy. In this
regard, the Government will continue to gradually reduce its direct interests in commercial bank at the
same time that it will revise the legal framework and Central Bank capacities to strengthen bank:
supervision.

22.        The most important actions completed in 2003 in the reform of thefinancial sector include: (0 u
comprehensive review of BIM (Banco Intemacional de MoCambique), which found the bank to be
adequately capitalized under international accounting standards (US), (ii) restructuring, including
downsizing and strengthening of internal control measures, within both BIM and BAu (Banco Austral),
which improved their financial results, (iig submitting to parliament a new Financial Institutions law
enhancing the central bank's author@ and establishing theframework for micro-financial institutions,
and (iv) some training at the central bank to enable greater oversight offinancial institutions, including
during andfollowing the transition to US. In addition, the Governmenthas initiated aforensic audit ojf
BAu commissioned through the OfJice of theAttorney General,which will take legal action as needed.

23.        Agricultural growth in 2003 surpassed the PARPA targets of 8percent, with strong growth in
cashcrops,primarily in tobacco (73 percent),sugar cane (22percent), cashew (17percent)and livestock
 (18percent), and a slight increase infood crops, hampered by unfavorable rains during the 2002/2003
growing season. All of these crops, with the exceptionof sugar cane, areproduced and marketed by the
small family) sector where most of thepoor are. Concernremains over the limited coverage of extension
services; coverage is improving but has reached so far only 18 percent of farming households.
 Vaccination of poultry and cattle has improvedconsiderably,withpositive effects on diseasecontrol. The
enabling environmentfor the availability of credit in rural areasfor farmers and small and medium-
sized enterprises (SMEs) also continues to need improvements. Processing of land titling improved
considerably in 2003, with registration now taking a maximum of 90 days against more than 120 days in
2002. In addition, new legislation now enforces managementplanningfor forestry concessions, although
 the approval process has to befurther accelerated.

24.        There has been progress in protecting the environment. Esforts to ensure the sustainable
management of natural resourcesare bearingresults: for example, one in threeforestry concessions now
has a managementplan comparedto one in seven in 2002.

25.        The main actions completed in the infrastructure sector, in 2003, include: (i)issuance of a
second mobile telephone operator, to Vodacom; (io granting a 15-year concessionin the Maputoport to
aprivate operator, resulting in improved clearance times; (iii) revocation of a decree that had granted

26.        Road rehabilitation andperiodic maintenance proceeded at a slower pace than expected. The
sharp rise of the South A>ican rand and concerns with the VAT system createdfinancing dipculties.

maintenance contracts rosefrom 25 percent to SO percent; and the provincial road inspectorates were
privatized. In the energy sector, the PARPA goal of electrifying all 128 district capitals was brought
within reach (only 8 remain without electricity). In addition, to improve EdM's performance,i its
operations were separated into new business centers; the Government is exploring options
introducing private-sector participation in distribution; and it has also decided to permit

Service delivery

27.       In the area of HIVAIDS, the national response is being implemented under institutional and
strategic di@culties and the Governmentrecognizes that revision of the strategic plan was slow in 2003.
The human and institutional capacity of the National AIDS Council needs to be strengthened to lead the
national response effectively.

28.       Outcomes in the health sector over 1997 to 2003 were good, with strong improvements in'the
outpatient utilization rate, child vaccination, the infant mortality rate(Im),the  under-five mortality rate
(USMR), and the contraceptiverate. Particular concern continues tofocus on thedoctorlpopulation rate,
which is already among the worst in the world andstill trending downwards.

2003 and targetsfor the repetition rate and gender equity were also met, while the completion rate fell
short ofthe target (40%). In this context, the sector strategy is being revised; the new primary education
curriculum was piloted; a strategyfor community school constructionprogram wasfinalized; and the
Direcl Support to Schools (DSS) program was launched, enabling all 8,000primary schools nationwide
to receive small cash grants that local oflcials could use tofinance locally-identified needs on a tirqely
basis.

30.       In the water sector, the key PAF/PES indicator, viz. access to safe water, reached 38%,
exceeding the annual target of 36%. There was also goodprogress in water resource management, as
stakehoIder meetings were held with a view to developinga new strategy, negotiating international river
issues and creating international basin commissions.

Actionsfor 2004-2005

31.       The Government recognizes that maintaining macroeconomic stability is key to sustai ing
growth.    The Government will continue to pursue fiscal and monetary policies that are targetel to
bringingthe injlation rate into single digits, while at the same time developingpolices towards helpin to

economicgrowth, low inflation, and high employment.

32.       Transparency and accountability in the use of public resources is a key citizen right and
government responsibility as well as a key contributor to ensuring the eficiency and efjcacy of public
administration. To meet its responsibilities in this area, the Government of Mozambique has bken
modernizing its public financial management system (SISTAFE) to improve controls, decentralize
planning and execution,and increase transparency and accountability. I n this respect, and to ensure the
beginningof the roll-out of SISTAFE among the diyerent governmentagencies in 200.5, the SISTAFEwill
be implemented in the Ministry of Planning and Finance and itsprovincial directorates during 2004. To
sustain high growth rates and reduce poverty, the Government is committed to spending at least 65per

encourages theprivate sector to drive economic growth in the countty, the Government will revise th     b
regulations regardingforeign hires to enable companies to hire the workers they want and need and it

                                  Republicof Mozambique

1.      On December, 10,2003, the Executive Board o f the InternationalMonetary Fund
(IMF) concludedthe Article lV consultationwith the Republic of Mozambique.'

Background

2.      Mozambique's performanceunder the authorities' program duringthe first three
quarters o f 2003 continued to be satisfactory. Manufacturing output, construction, and
services performed strongly duringthe first halfo f 2003, and the target o f real GDP
growth o f 7 percent for the year as a whole appears achievable. After peaking inMay
2003 owing to the impact o f drought on food prices andthe appreciationo f the South
African rand against the metical, the 12-monthrate o f inflation declined to 13.6 percent
inNovember(underthe program, end-year inflation was targeted at 10.8 percent).
Average commercial bank lending rates have declined from 37 percent to 30 percent
since end-2002, with interest rate spreads remaining highat 19 percent.

3.      The government's fiscal program for 2003 seeks to contain the domestic primary
deficit at 3.7 percent o f GDP, with tax revenue strengthening as a result o f the
implementation of the new code for the personal and corporate income taxes approved in
2002, the full-year effect o f a new andmore transparent fiscal incentives code, and a
significant increase inthe specific taxes on domestic petroleum products implementedin
May 2003. Available information for the periodthrough September 2003 indicates that
the government's deficit was lower than programmed, reflecting a lower level o f locally
financed capital outlays owing to delays inproject execution associated inpart with
shortfalls in external assistance.

4.      External developments duringthe first half o f 2003 continued to be influencedby
exogenous shocks and large scale foreign investmentprojects. For the year as a whole,
the external current account deficit after grants i s expected to widen to 15 percent o f GDP
(12 percent in2002), reflecting an increase ininvestment inthe mega projects duringthe
second half o f the year.

5.      The consultationdiscussions focused on the macroeconomic policies for 2004-06
andthe government's plans to address pendingstructural reforms to broaden and sustain
growth and further reduce poverty. Real GDP growth i s projectedto increase to over


                                             102

8 percent in2004 largely because o f the coming on stream o f MOZAL I1(the expansion
o f the aluminum smelter) andthe gas pipeline, and end-year inflation is targeted to fall to
9 percent. The government's domestic primary deficit i s projected to decline to 3.4
percent o f GDP in2004, owing to a hrther strengthening o f revenue and steps to start
addressing the significant increase inthe government's wage bill that has taken place in
recent years. The overall deficit after grants, however, would be somewhat higher than in
2003.

6.      Discussions on structural issues concentrated on the authorities' plans to remove a
numbero fobstacles to private sector development. Particular attentionwas paidto (i)
reducingred tape and simplifyingthe regulatory framework; (ii)     addressing labor
rigiditiesthat hinder competitiveness; (iii) improving basic infrastructure; (iv) reforming
thejudicial system; and (v) moving aheadwith reforms to increase efficiency inthe
public sector. Inaddition, the staff discussed with the authorities several
recommendations to address remainingvulnerabilities inthe financial system made by a
joint team from the Fundandthe World Bank inthe context o f the Financial Sector
Assessment program (FSAP).

Executive BoardAssessment

7.       Executive Directors welcomed the opportunity to review, under the new
guidelines on assessments o f countries with a longer-term program engagement, the
experience with the four Fund-supported programs since 1987.Directors commended the
Mozambican authorities for their pursuit o f sound macroeconomic policies and wide-
ranging structural reforms over the past fifteen years. The authorities' efforts have ledto
the strong growth ofthe economy, a strengtheningo fthe international reserves position,
substantial debt relief, and a steady decline inpoverty rates ina context o fpolitical
stability. Notwithstanding the considerable progress that has been made, Mozambique
remains a very poor country with significant weaknesses and vulnerabilities, including
institutional capacity constraints and the negative impact o f HIV/AIDS. Directors
therefore urged the authorities to persevere intheir efforts to consolidate macroeconomic
stability and accelerate and deepen structural reforms with a view to sustaining economic
growth, encouraging employment creation, and further reducing poverty.

 8.      Directors commendedthe authorities for the satisfactory implementationo f their
 economic program, which was manifestedinMozambique's continued favorable
 economic performance during2002 and 2003. Output growth has remainedstrong, the
 international reserves position has beenstrengthened, andsignificant progress has been
made inimplementing structural reforms, including by taking important steps to mobilize
 additional revenue. Directors also noted the advances made toward achieving
 Mozambique's poverty reduction strategy (PARPA) objectives, especially inthe areas o f
health and education. Inparticular, they were encouraged bythe preliminary information
 from the recent National HouseholdSurvey that the proportion o f the population living
below the poverty line in2002 fell below the PARPA's 2005 target o f 60 percent.

9.     Directors welcomed the government's economic program for 2004, which seeks to
maintain macroeconomic stability and addresses an important agenda o f unfinished
reforms. They emphasized that achieving the program's fiscal targets will require a
further strengtheningo f government revenue anda close monitoring o f current
expenditure. Crucial specific steps inthis regardwill be improvements intax
administration, early introduction o f an automatic mechanism of adjustment for the
specific fuel taxes, andprompt implementation o f the withholding o f the income tax on
the salaries o f government employees. Directors also underscored the importance o f
limitingthe wage increase for government employees to projected inflation and
exercising strict control over the payroll inorder to contain the recent sizable increases in
the wage bill. Key priorities going forward will be to evaluate and address the challenges
posedby HIV/AIDS while making progress toward the achievement of the Millennium
Development Goals. Directors welcomed the authorities' intention to integrate the
monitoring o f the PARPA and the budget execution into a single document, which could
be the basis for the next review of the PRSP inearly 2004.

10.     Directors urgedthe authorities to press aheadwith ongoing efforts to improve
public expenditure management and fiscal transparency by adheringto the revised
timetable for introducing the new financial management system (SISTAFE) and by
bringingall extrabudgetary activities within the budget framework, especially inview of
the likely expenditure pressures associated with next year's elections. They encouraged
the authorities to move forward vigorously on public sector reform, with the support o f
the World Bank, including byreducing employment redundancies in some sectors.

11.     Directors called on the authorities to closely monitor monetary developments,
particularly inlight o f the resurgence of inflation in2003 and the volatility of broad
money growth. The authorities should tighten liquidityconditions as needed, and limit
interventions inthe foreign exchange market to cushioning the impact o f temporary
shocks and achieving the program's reserves targets.

12.     Directors called on the authorities to implement promptly the recommendations
resulting from the FSAP exercise. Strengthened monetary and exchange rate management
will be essential inMozambique, particularly inview of the highdegree of dollarization.
This will include steps to enhance the consistency between the centralbank's sales o f
foreign exchange andthe pace of expenditure financed with external support, to improve
the use o findirect monetary instruments, to better coordinate the actions of the central
bankandthe Ministryo f Finance, andto strengthenthe balance sheet o fthe centralbank.
Directors welcomed the comprehensive program o f technical assistance being developed
byFundandWorld Bank staff, inclose coordinationwith the authorities, to support the
implementation o f the FSAPrecommendations.

13.     Directors emphasized that the authorities should give priority to addressing the
remainingvulnerabilities inthe financial sector. They urgedthe authorities to monitor
developments inthe financial system very closely and to strengthen bank supervision in
line with internationally-accepted practices. Inaddition, the diagnostic reviews o f the
main banks will help identify appropriate remedial actions and enable a gradual move



                                              104

toward international accounting standards (IAS). It will be important to lower the wide
bank spreads and expand access to credit by fostering competition inthe financial system,
improving loan recovery procedures, and reviewing land tenure regulations to facilitate
the use o f land as collateral. Inaddition, the regulatory framework for microfinance
activities should be reviewed to facilitate access to financial services by the poor.

14.     Directors stressedthe need to broaden growth and stimulate employment inthe
manufacturing, services, andrural family sectors by enhancing human capital and
removing obstacles to private sector development. They encouraged the authorities to
reduce redtape; improve basic infrastructure; reduce labor rigiditiesby simplifying
procedures for hiringexpatriates and lowering retrenchment costs; and press ahead with
the reformo fthejudicial system to speedupthe administration o fjustice and strengthen
the enforcement o fcontracts. Directors called for the prompt approval o fthe regulations
for the anti-money laundering law passed in2002, and for the development o f legislation
on the combating o f the financing o f terrorism. Several Directors underscored the
importance o f improving market access for Mozambique's exports.

15.     Directors encouraged the authorities to redouble their efforts to complete the
bilateral agreements with remaining Paris Club creditors, and they urged the non-Paris
club creditors who have not yet done so to provide debt reliefon HIPC Initiative-
comparable terms.

16.      Directors welcomed Mozambique's participation inthe Fund's General Data
Dissemination System. They underscored the needfor a determined effort to address
remaining weaknesses inthe statistical system, based on the recommendations made in
the context ofthe recent data Reports on the Observance of Standards and Codes
exercise.

17.      Looking forward, most Directors expressed readiness to consider a successor low-
access PRGF arrangement based on a strong program, which would help the authorities
address the remaining challenges. A few other Directors encouraged consideration o f
other possible forms o f engagement outside o f a formal Fundarrangement.
