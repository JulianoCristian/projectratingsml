3. Program Description

3.a. Description of the Overall Program

1.       The first PRSC series was designed as an integral part of the Bank's strategy to support
the implementation of Mozambique's first Action Plan for the Reduction of Absolute Poverty
(PARPA, in Portuguese, or PRSP, in English). While recognizing the importance of each of the
fundamental areas of the PARPA, the PRSC series were designed to focus on cross-cutting and
institutional issues which will deepen Bank support to the Government's reform agenda by: (i)
building public sector capacity and accountability through strengthening public financial
management, decreasing aid dependency, improving monitoring and evaluation (M&E), and
accelerating public sector reform; (ii) improving the investment climate through strengthening the
financial sector, easing constrains in the regulatory environment, and expanding infrastructure
services; and (iii) enhancing service delivery in health, education, and water and sanitation.

3.b. Description of the Operation

2.       The PRSC1 is a single-tranche credit of SDR40.9 million (US$60 million equivalent), the
first of a series of three operations to be delivered over FY2004-06, each justified by reforms
already completed by the Government (prior actions) in implementation of the PARPA. In line
with the program envisioned in the three year PRSC framework, the PRSC1 was designed to
focus mainly on the first component of the PRSC series, that is, building public sector capacity
and accountability by supporting cross-sectoral actions to strengthen public sector reform and
enhance efficiency and effectiveness in the use of public resources. The following key areas of
reforms support those objectives: implementing a new integrated electronic financial management
system (SISTAFE); allocating near 65 percent of Government budget on PARPA priority sectors;
implementing revenue-raising measures; and taking steps to enhance the quality of governance
(passing legislation to promote decentralization and fight corruption). To a lesser extent, the
PRSC1 also focused on the second component, improving the investment climate, through
improvements in the business regulatory framework, in particular, by reducing the import duties
from 30 to 25 percent.

4. Achievement of Objectives and Outputs

3.       PRSC1 prior actions were completed by the Government before Board presentation on
July 6, 2004. The Government maintained a sound macroeconomic policy framework during
2003 and 2004, which was conducive to the success of policy measures and other reforms. GDP
grew 12.8 percent in 2003 and 7.2 percent in 2004. Despite some relaxation in the fiscal stance in
the period leading to elections in December 2004, 12 month inflation had declined by one
percentage point by end June 2004 to 13.3 percent and to 9.1 percent by end December 2004.
Although the currency appreciated by 7 percent between June 2003 and June 2004, and further by
December 2004, the external current account deficit had narrowed by one third, to 13.8 percent of
GDP by end 2004. Interest rates also continued to decline during this period. Prior actions aimed
at improving public finance management were also achieved: the Government executed the 2003
budget consistent with the agreed allocation of spending 64.9 percent of the budget on PARPA
direct poverty reducing priority sectors, although the target of 65 percent was not quite achieved
in 2004 (ratio was 63.3 percent), but is estimated at above 65 percent for the first half of 2005;
SISTAFE regulations were adopted; and revenue-raising measures continued to be deployed,
such as the automatic fuel tariff adjustments and the withholding of tax to Government employees
(these two measures increased Government revenues in 2003 by about 0.7 percent of GDP).
Although the agreed prior actions increased revenues in 2003, estimates of overall revenues for
2004 show a slight decline, by half percentage point of GDP, to 12.3 percent, but estimates for

                                                 - 3 -


2005 show that they will recuperate to 13.2 percent of GDP enabling further fiscal adjustment and
lowering aid dependency. Prior actions focused on improving governance, including approval of
the decentralization and the anti-corruption law, achieving land registration in 90 days, expediting
industrial registration (decree 39/2003) and issuing visas at the border, as well as prior actions
aimed at improving the investment climate, that is, reducing the import duty from 30 to 25 percent
were all completed. Most stated outcomes linked to the governance and investment climate are
difficult to evaluate now and should be evaluated at the end of this PRSC series given the lag
between the actions and the expected results.

4.       Measures to be implemented under PRSC1 included those that would trigger PRSC2.
Among those triggers were the approval of the new commercial code and the new procurement
decree. These were not implemented on schedule, but are now expected to be fully implemented
by end 2005. The same applies to the full launching of SISTAFE in the Ministry of Finance.
Treasury operations have been conducted through SISTAFE since November 2004. The budget
was inputted in the system, and accounting started to be undertaken through it in August, 2005,
although the old system still works in parallel. It is expected that direct budget execution will be
undertaken in the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Plan and Development and the Ministry of
Education and Culture at the end of 2005. Otherwise, all other triggers were achieved. The
Government continues to maintain a sound macroeconomic framework. GDP grew at 7.7 percent
in the first half of 2005, the appreciation of the metical of last year was reversed during the first
half of this year, interest rates continue to decline and inflation was 6.1 percent at the end of July
despite higher oil prices. Measures aimed at improving the investment climate, that is, the
approval of the financial law and decree 57/03 on hiring foreign labor were achieved, although it
is too early to assess the stated outcomes, such as having more efficient banks and allowing
Mozambican firms to become more competitive. Many of the outcomes will need to be evaluated
at the end of this PRSC series. Table 1 shows detailed prior actions taken under PRSC1 and the
achievements of triggers for PRSC-2, both linked to stated outcome.

5.       On September 13, 2005, the second PRSC was approved by the Bank Board as a two
tranche operation to harmonize with other budget-support donors and with Mozambique's budget
cycle. The focus of the PRSC2 is to continue supporting the reform agenda supported under
PRSC1, i.e. cross cutting institutional reforms to improve public finance management, including
public procurement, and begin a second generation of reforms. A key element of PRSC2 is to
roll out SISTAFE fully in the Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Education and Culture
including provincial directorates, extend coverage of the budget to include significantly more
health expenditures (currently at 30 percent off-budget), and introduce a new procurement code
based on international standards, together with a new financial institutions law, a new commercial
code, a decree to ease restrictions on hiring foreign labor, and a new law to simplify red tape and
strengthen anti-corruption measures. Since PRSC2 is a two tranche operation, it will conclude
the first cycle of PRSCs that provided budget support during three years. A PRCS3 will start a
new cycle and it is envisioned for 2006.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

6.      Four factors affected the implementation and outcome of this operation. The first is the
design which appropriately focused on cross-sectoral actions (see Section 3). Second was the
successful coordination effort among donors - formalized in a Memorandum of Understanding
signed in April 2004 - which made it possible for budget support to be more effective. The
budget support process became even deeper with the G-15 group acquiring two new members
(now G-17) and the African Development Bank expected to join soon. Third, the PRSC as well
as the G-17 use the same government planning and reporting documents that are submitted to
Parliament to make the assessments on performance and budget support. This enhances domestic
accountability and puts pressure in GoM to improve the quality of such documents. One factor
affected implementation and outcome of PRSC1 negatively. This had to do with delays in the
approval of the labor law and procurement law caused by the preparation and holding of
presidential and parliamentary elections in December 2004. Further, after the elections, it took
time for the new Government to be formed, and Parliament passed the budget for 2005 only in
May 2005. Nevertheless, most PAF targets (rolling three year matrix of priority actions and
indicators agreed between the Government and external partners) were met and the new
Government has reaffirmed its commitment to continue and even accelerate economic and
governance reforms.

6. Bank and Borrower Performance

7.      Bank performance was satisfactory from design to implementation. There are several
observations that support this judgment: (i) The PRSC was based on extensive analytical work
completed over the past few years, including two PERs (FY01 and FY03), a Poverty Assessment
(FY04), A CEM( FY01), a CFFA (FY02) a CPAR (FY03) , a ICA (FY03) and a FSA (FY03); (ii)
the PRSC is consistent with the FY 04-07 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) (Report No.
26747-Moz). The base case scenario of the CAS envisages four consecutive PRSCs to support
Mozambique's efforts in building public sector capacity and accountability, improving the
investment climate, and expanding service delivery;          (iii) for the first time a complete
harmonization arrangement with a large number of donors (G-15) was attempted and it was
successful.  The PAF matrix agreed between the donors and the Government supports the
Government's primary objective of reducing absolute poverty and achieving the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) through the implementation of the Government's PARPA; and (iv)
the operation was supervised in a continuous and detailed manner by Bank staff.

8.      Borrower performance was satisfactory from design to implementation. The Government
was in the driver's seat during the design: it determined the core reform and guided the definition
of the main indicators, actions and outcomes to be achieved. This was possible because the
Government had prepared the PARPA and then the PAF, which updated the PARPA and the core
of the country's reform program. The Government stressed the need for all partners to harmonize
with the PARPA and PAF, and the need for substantial, coordinated budget support, as this would
increase ownership, which will also increase sustainability of actions in the future and would
avoid creating parallel systems where accountability is primarily with the donors.             The
Government was also at the center of the implementation process.             The monitoring was
undertaken through regular monitoring, such as the quarterly budget execution reports and semi-
annual PES (Economic and Social Plan) and PAF matrices reviews. The Ministry of Planning
and Finance (now two separate ministries, Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Plan and
Development) monitored the PES and PAF matrices which fed into the PRSP1 matrix. There was

                                                  - 7 -


continual reporting to the Parliament, which strengthened the accountability foundation of the
reform. Despite the slippages due to the electoral cycle, the Government remarked committed to
the program stated in the Letter of Development Policy and actually saw the measures through to
conclusion. The new government continues to implement and even accelerate the reform agenda.

9.       Both Bank and Borrower performance enabled this operation to have a substantial impact
on institutional development through the following: first, the creation of national technical teams
focused on translating poverty reduction strategies into results is a gain that will endure; second,
the approach of using pooled funds freely available to the budget to finance development
activities starts a new and more efficient approach to managing them by strengthening local
planning and budget execution systems and accountability rather than creating parallel structures:
this is a gain that will also endure; and third, the introduction of particular management tools, i.e.
SISTAFE makes a permanent change in managing public resources.

7. Findings and Implications for Subsequent Operation(s) in Series

10.      Three findings may be identified, that have implications for subsequent operations. First,
it became very clear during implementation that it is important to adhere closely to the prior
actions and triggers in the PAF matrix as agreed with the Government and donors. Small
deviations from the actions intended in the agreed PAF can cause unnecessary disagreements.
Subsequent operations should even use the same wording in the chosen prior actions and triggers
as in the agreed PAF matrix. Second, it became evident that budgetary support is more effective
if provided in coordination with other donors' assistance and in synchrony with the Government's
budget process. Already PRSC2 has been aligned with the budget process and subsequent PRSCs
will follow the same pattern. And, third, experience with PRSC1 showed that timing of reform
implementation should be more realistic by taking electoral cycles into consideration, i.e. the
labor law and procurement law were designed to be approved during an election year, and
therefore were delayed. Subsequent operations should take into consideration electoral cycles to
avoid unnecessary delays in agreed measures.
