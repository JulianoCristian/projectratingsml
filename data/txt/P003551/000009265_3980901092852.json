Some lessons learned included: although\n            procurement procedures followed bank group guidelines, there\n            were some serious deficiencies in the prequalification of\n            pump and motor suppliers. IDA should have insisted on much\n            more stringent prequalification criteria. Also, procurement\n            of major civil works for the Luohe Flume should have been\n            tendered following International Competitive Bidding (ICB)\n            procedures because national contractors were unable to\n            execute this complex structure according to the original\n            designs. To accommodate the local contractors required\n            drastic scaling-down of designs and work standards. More\n            prompt attention should have been paid by IDA to ensure\n            timely allocation of counterpart funding. Aside from\n            obtaining an assurance during negotiations from provincial\n            and local governments about funding local costs, the\n            estimated counterpart funds necessary each year and their\n            sources should have been identified and discussed at\n            appraisal with the Borrower, in order to ensure that proper\n            attention was paid to the financing of the project."}, "docdt": "1998-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
