The project\n            will develop freshwater fish culture in low lying areas\n            along the Yellow and Wei Rivers. Also introduced will be\n            large scale poultry farming and a genetic improvement\n            program for swine and rabbits. Small agro-processing\n            facilities will be established to demonstrate the proper\n            methods to organize, manage and finance upgraded processing,\n            handling and storage facilities.
