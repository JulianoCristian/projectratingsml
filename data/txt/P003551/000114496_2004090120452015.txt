Re:
Credit No. 1997-CHA
(Shaanxi Agricultural Development Project)
Amendment of Development Credit and Project Agreements
Dear Minister Wang and the Governor:
1.
We refer to the Development Credit Agreement (Shaanxi Agricultural Development 
Project) between the People's Republic of China (the Borrower) and the International 
Development Association (the Association), dated September 14, 1989, as amended (the 
Development Credit Agreement) and to the Project Agreement (Shaanxi Agricultural 
Development Project) between the Association and Shaanxi Province (Shaanxi), of the 
same date (the Project Agreement).   We also refer to the letter from Mr. Luo Qing,
Director, World Bank Department, Ministry of Finance, dated January 4, 1992, 
requesting a change in the procurement and disbursement procedures for certain 
earthworks and inclusion of financing of local training costs.
2.
We are pleased to concur with these requests. Consequently,  the Association 
hereby agrees to amend the Development Credit Agreement and the Project Agreement as 
set out below.
3.
The Development Credit Agreement shall be amended:
 
(a)
in the table set out in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1:
 
(i)
by revising Category 1 to read "Civil works and Earthworks (other 
than in Category 
(2) below)";
 
(ii)
by revising Category (2) to read "Earthworks for lateral drains 
and on-farm works 
for Parts A and B of the Project"; and
 
(iii)
by revising Category (6) to read "Consultants' services and 
overseas and local 
training and study tours"; and
 
(b)
in Schedule 2, by adding a new Part G, to read:
 
Part G:  Technical Assistance
Provision of overseas and local training and study tours in water 
resources management and 
systems operation, irrigated agriculture extension and 
research,  breeding and disease control, 
seed technology and seed processing and 
agroprocessing technology."
4.
The Project Agreement shall be amended:
 
(a)
by revising Part C.2 of Section I of Schedule 1 to read:
 
"2.
Earthworks for pond, lateral canals and lateral drains and on farm 
works for 
irrigation shall be carried out by force account procedures 
Page  2
satisfactory to the Association."; 
and
 
(b)
by revising Part C.4 of Section I of Schedule 1 to read:
 
4.
Contracts for earthworks for main, branch and other canals and 
drains up to the 
lateral canals and drains and civil works for structures and 
building construction shall be 
awarded  in accordance with local competitive 
bidding procedures acceptable to the Association."
5.
We also concur with the request for a reallocation of credit proceeds to 
correspond with the changes made in paragraphs 3 and 4 above. Consequently, SDR 
10,610,000 is hereby reallocated from Category (2) to Category (1) of the table set 
out in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the Development Credit Agreement.  A revised table 
reflecting all amendments and reallocations to date, is attached for your reference.
6.
Please confirm the agreement on behalf of the Borrower and Shaanxi to the 
amendments in paragraphs 3 and 4 above, respectively, by signing and dating the 
enclosed confirmation copy of this letter and returning it to us for our files.  One 
original each should be retained by the Borrower and Shaanxi.
