Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The project is finalizing the last works contract (Abdullah Gharib Road Section) which faced some delays in delivery of heavy road construction/
 maintenance machinery, and the project is expected to close as planned, on December 31, 2014. The Government-requested reallocation of loan
 proceeds between categories has been approved by the Bank on November 25, 2014 to allow the project to utilize the unused funds from civil works
 (over US$3.8 million) to pay for the increased costs in procurement of goods, services, and project management. For the remaining, unallocated funds
 of about US$2.6 million, the mission agreed with MoPIC that the Government will submit to IDA a respective cancellation request and to recoup the
 funds for the Yemen IDA pool.

 Overall Comments
 There are several inconsistencies (i) within the May 2013 Level 1 Restructuring paper, and (ii) between the May 2013 Level
 1 Restructuring paper and the Results Framework, leaving no indicator and thus no evidence to measure the achievement
 of the PDO objective "(c) strengthening the capacity of local governments and support decentralization".
 Specifically, the May 2013 Level 1 Restructuring paper has inconsistencies regarding (a) indicator data for '2013 progress
 to date'/ '2014 targets' and (b) the paper's stated completion of the same indicators in 2010. This led the project to report
 these indicators as completed in 2010 without further measurement, e.g. Improved accessibility of local council services
 from one central location; Citizens services provided by Taiz local administration at the local council buildings, as well as
 Direct beneficiaries, Area protected from flooding in Taiz, among others.
 Secondly, the restructuring paper changes have not been fully reflected in the results framework. This led to project to not
 measure newly added indicators and to discontinue measurement of revised or continued indicators which appear to have
 been incorrectly omitted from the results framework, e.g. new indicators not added include People in urban areas provided
 with access to regular solid waste collection under the project, New roads constructed (non-rural), while existing indicators
 were not continued, e.g. Households with secure property tenure, implementation of disaster preparedness plans in
