AND CAPACITY\n            BUILDING OF EARTH-QUAKE AFFECTED MICRO A", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Access to Finance and\n            Capacity Building for Earthquake-Affected Micro and Small\n            Enterprises Project for Indonesia were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory; risk to development outcome\n            was low; Bank performance was satisfactory; and borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            includes: ensure government involvement throughout the\n            entire project life-cycle: (i) define clear parameters for\n            government involvement and coordination, which should\n            encompass frequent progress reviews, joint site visits and\n            government capacity-building activities; (ii) engage all\n            levels of governments, from national and provincial levels\n            to district, sub district and village levels; (iii) involve\n            sector departments with expertise that meets the needs of\n            the target groups. Early involvement of these departments is\n            a prerequisite for responsibilities to be transferable at\n            project closing; (iv) conduct needs-assessments jointly with\n            the government to establish priority needs, sectors and\n            assistance strategies; and (v) ensure that sufficient\n            internal staffing and funding resources are allocated to\n            government engagement activities, which at a minimum should\n            include one senior staff member assigned to government\n            engagement. Establish a robust information management,\n            monitoring, evaluation and reporting system: (i) ensure\n            high-quality and timely report submission in the local\n            language, targeting all relevant government institutions at\n            national, provincial and local levels; (ii) make provisions\n            for brief monthly reports in addition to in-depth quarterly\n            reports. Accessibility and readability of such reports were\n            viewed as critical by the recipient institutions; (iii)\n            establish a dedicated information management and Monitoring\n            and Evaluation (M and E) team within the project with\n            adequate expertise in data analysis, mapping software and\n            monitoring and evaluation tools; and (iv) give the\n            government a role in progress monitoring through reporting,\n            implementation reviews and joint site visits. Build in\n            flexibility in project design/components: (i) ensure\n            flexible definition of project components and budgeting for\n            a demand- and needs-oriented project implementation that\n            enables the team to quickly respond to diverse and specific\n            needs of the target groups and unexpected challenges; and\n            (ii) allow for timely adjustment of project design when\n            needed, in close consultation with the donors, government\n            and other stakeholders. Effective implementing agency: a\n            well-functioning implementation agency, staffed with\n            competent and committed people who should be fairly\n            remunerated is essential for a successful implementation of\n            a multi-component and complex project."}, "docdt": "2012-03-22T00:00:00Z"}
