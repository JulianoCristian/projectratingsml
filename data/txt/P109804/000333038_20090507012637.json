Building for Earthquake-Affected Micro\n            and Small Enterprises Project is to contribute to the\n            Government's of Indonesia's initiatives to support\n            the recovery of Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) in\n            Yogyakarta and Central Java and enable them to reach at\n            least pre-earthquake capacity through enhanced access to\n            finance and targeted technical assistance. There are six\n            components to the project. The first component of the\n            project is assessment for identification of\n            interventions/targeting beneficiaries. Under this component\n            the International Organization for Migration (IOM) will\n            conduct livelihood, market and environmental surveys in\n            order to fine-tune the implementation strategy for\n            assistance to Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs). The second\n            component of the project is asset replacement. Under this\n            component, IOM will purchase goods and provide them as in\n            kind support to restore infrastructure and physical assets\n            that are essential for operations of MSEs, such as\n            production facilities, livelihood tools, irrigation systems,\n            small roads, warehouses, sheds, pens, and other essential\n            small-scale infrastructure. The third component of the\n            project is access to finance. Under this component, small\n            loans will be provided to MSEs, including community\n            enterprises, associations, cooperatives, etc. The fourth\n            component of the project is assistance for market access.\n            Under this component the project will finance Technical\n            Assistance (TA) to help MSEs recover former buyers and\n            customers or to identify new ones. The fifth component of\n            the project is capacity building technical assistance. Under\n            this component, the project will invest in TA and training\n            for skills development and capacity building for the MSEs.\n            Training envisaged under this component includes\n            entrepreneurial skills such as financial management and\n            marketing and business plan development. The six component\n            of the project is project management and monitoring and\n            evaluation. Under this component the project will finance\n            all costs associated with management, implementation, and\n            supervision of the project incurred by the IOM."}, "docdt": "2008-09-10T00:00:00Z"}
