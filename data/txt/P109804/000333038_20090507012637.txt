                 Access to Finance and CapacityBuilding of Earth-QuakeAffected
                                          Micro and Small Enterprises




 1.      On 27 May 2006, a massive earthquake (registering 6.3 on the Richter scale) struck the
populous south-central coast of Java, killing 5,744 people and severely damaging infiastructure,
housing, schools and clinics. In districts across Yogyakarta and neighboring Central Java, 350,000
houses were damaged beyond repair and 278,000 suffered lesser damage. Beyond housing,
damage and losses to businesses in the productive sector were considerable, impacting about
 116,000 livelihoods.

2.       The reconstruction efforts of the Government of Indonesia (GoI) have been impressively
effective and as of June 2007, more than 80 percent of affected houses were repaired or repla~ed,~
and good progress had been achieved in repairing the infrastructure. Despite this success, however,
according to a recent report for the Java Reconstruction Fund (JRF), the region has not yet
recovered fiom the profound economic impact of disaster.'

3.       An April 2007 business survey conducted by the UNDP concluded that productive sectors
in both provinces had made substantial progress in recovery, with 95 percent of the affected
entrepreneurs having resumed activity and 47 percent having reached pre-earthquake ~apacities.~
Effective community self-help strategieshave been a major factor behind this recovery. The report,
however, indicated that about 53 percent of the affected enterprises were still struggling to recover
fiom the earthquake damage and were not in a position to do so without external support.

4.       The main constraints for full recovery are:
         Access to finance for both fixed and working capital investment^;^
         Loss of buyerslmarkets; and,
         Inadequatebasic business skills including in financial administration, product development;
         and marketing.

5.       In light of the strong emphasis by the Go1 and international donors on emergency and
housing needs, livelihood recovery programs have so far received less attention and have been
consistently under funded.            The United Nations (UN) Livelihood Cluster has implemented
livelihood programs of about US$4.7 million, representing only 4 percent of total cluster

   RehabilitatingLivelihoods in Post-EarthquakeYogyakarta and Central Java Provinces: A Report Prepared for the
Java Reconstruction Fund, May 2007. The JRF, a multi donor find of about US$80 million, was put in place following
the Java Earthquake to assist the Indonesian authorities with their earthquakerecovery efforts. Of this amount, about
US$60 million has been used for housing reconstruction. The balance of about US$20 million is to be used for
livelihood recovery.

   Businesseshave depletedtheir own resources. Access to additional finance for fkther repairing of the fixed assets,
tools, and working capital is proving to be a serious barrier.

contribution to earthquake re~overy.~ Furthermore, many international and local Non
 Governmental Organizations(NGOs) are closing down their pr~grarns.~

6.        The proposed project aims to assist the restoration of Micro and Small Enterprises (MSE)
by addressing the main barriers to their recovery through a comprehensive package of targeted
assistance in coordination with and complementing the efforts of the Go1 and the donor
community8. The design of the project has taken into account lessons learned from implementing
previous recovery activities undertaken in Central Java and DYI. These lessons include the
importance of: (i) community and government ownership and involvements at all stages of
preparation and implementation; (ii) transparent targeting of beneficiaries; (iii) providing a
comprehensive package of technical as well as financial assistance to MSEs; (iv) an effective
outreach program; and (v) robust monitoring arrangements to enswe targeted beneficiaries are
reached and that funds are used for their intended purpose.




7.        The GoI's National Action Plan for Reconstruction and Rehabilitation9is firmly based on
principles of sustainable development. The Plan clearly divides reconstruction and rehabilitation
activities into housing recovery, infrastructure restoration and economic revitalization. In line with
the Plan, one year after the earthquake the main focus of activities was expected to shift to the
revitalization of the regional economy and livelihood.               Specific intervention in sectors and
variations in districts that have not received support until now or have recovered to a lesser degree
have been identified by the national and local authorities. The priorities include: (a) recovery of
industry and service sectors with a focus on small-scale industry, agriculture and tourism; (b)
recovery of the financial service delivery to improve access to finance for Small and Medium
Enterprises (SMEs); (c) recovery of market access for earthquake-affected SMEs; and, (d)
sustainable natural resource management in anticipation of increased environmental exploitation.
The proposed project is fully in line with the above priorities.

8.       The regional action plans for Central Java and DIY had a strong emphasis on housing and
public infiastructwe during 2006-2007, in terms of financial allocation. The detailed allocation of
Go1 funds" for various livelihood activities during 2007-2008 is still being discussed by the
regional governments but it is anticipated that the majority of funding will be directed toward
physical infrastructure restoration (such as traditional markets) and less toward specific MSE
assistance. International Organization for Migration (IOM) is coordinating closely with the local
and national authorities in order to fill the gaps and avoid duplicationof efforts.

9.    The overall objective of the project is to contribute to the GoI's initiatives to support the
recovery of MSEs in Yogyakarta and Central Java and enable them to reach at least their pre-
earthquake capacity through enhanced accessto finance and targeted technical assistance.

10.   The project will aim to:

      Kick-start earthquake-affectedMSEs by restoring basic production facilities, replacing
      livelihood equipment and purchasingproduction inputs;
      Assist MSEs in accessing financeto resume their business activity;
      Strengthen financial management and entrepreneurshipskillsof affected MSEs in order to
      facilitatea durable long-term recovery that takes into account pre-earthquake capacity
      deficitsof enterprises;
      Assist MSEs to recover lost buyers and restore markets through a seriesof market
      promotion initiatives;
      Generate employmentopportunities within the MSE sector by stimulating the growth of
      existing enterprises;
      Promote long-term business strategies and sustainability of income generating activities
      while taking into account environmentaland social implications;
      Promote the inclusion of women and vulnerable groups.


IV.   PROJECTDESCRIPTION(COMPONENTS)

11.   The project consists of six components (see Detailed Project Description, Annex VI):

      (a) ComponentI. Assessmentfor Identification of Interventionsmargeting
          Beneficiaries(US$0.4 million). Under this component the recipient (IOM) will conduct
          livelihood, market and environmental surveys in order to fine-tune the implementation
          strategy for assistance to MSEs. Livelihood surveys will include focus group
          discussions,stakeholder interviews and quantitativeasset and income surveys using
          IOM Community Assessment Teams which have been trained in livelihood assessment
         through the ongoing livelihood projects. The assessment approach is detailed in Section
          VII (Targeting Beneficiaries) below.

      (b) Component11. Asset Replacement (US$0.9million). Under this component, IOM
         will purchase goods and provide them as in kind support to restore infrastructure and
         physical assets that are essential for operationsof MSEs, such as production facilities,
          livelihood tools, irrigation systems, small roads, warehouses, sheds, pens and other
         essential small-scale infrastructure. Based on the needs articulated by the MSEs and
         after review and analysis of the assessment studies, IOM will procure the materials and
         deliver them to the communities for hand-over. The intervention will be provided for
         highly vulnerable but viable enterprises that are unable to resume operationsbecause of
         loss or damage to essential equipment, production facilitiesor supporting infrastructure
         and who are unable to secure loans since business revenue is small or non-existing and

              loan provision would likely lead to defaulting loans, an additionalobstacleto recovery."
              The selection criteria for the final beneficiaries of this component are detailed in Annex
              VI.

         (c) Component 111. Access to Finance (US$l.O million). Under this component,small
              loans will be provided to MSEs, including communityenterprises,associations,
              cooperatives, etc. Small loanswill be disbursed based on business concepts submitted
              by members. Funds under this componentwill be channeledthrough Permodalan
              Nasional Madani (PNM -as the Apex institution)through participatingMicro Finance
              Institutions (MFIs) which will be selected based on predefined criteria. IOM will sign a
              Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with PNM, on terms and conditionsacceptable
              to the Bank, in orderto transfer funds to PNM on a non-reimbursable basis to finance
              subprojects for the benefit of eligible MSEs, and in accordance with the guidelines,
              procedures and criteriaset forth in the Project ManagementManual. PNM will assist
              the IOM in selection and monitoring of the financial intermediaries and will help
              provide technical assistance to these intermediaries in their lending activitiesas
              necessary. In addition,IOM will ensure financial expertise will be provided, as
              necessary to ensureproper and transparent management of loan funds. PNM will
              onlend proceeds to selected MFIs at an interest rate of not more than 7 percent annually,
              with a repayment period of not more than 5 years., in coordination with the GTZ to
              ensure consistency of approach between the two projects.I2MFIs will onlend the project
              funds at market rates and will assume the credit risk of their final transactionswith
              eligibleMSEs on their balance sheet. The MFIs will have to repay interest and principle
              of the funds received to PNM. PNM will recycle the fundsthrough MFIs to continue to
              assist eligibleMSEs in the region in line with the overall project objectives. It was
              expected that the reflow of funds by PNM would be as close as possible to the 10-year
              period.

         (d) Component IV. Assistancefor Market Access (US$0.3). Under this component the
              project will finance TA to help MSEs recover former buyers and customersor to
              identify new ones. Activities will include facilitatingexhibitions,organizingcross-
              visits of successful operating MSEs in the same sector and marketing events, conducting
              market studies, and improving accessto information. KADIN will act as implementing
              and advisory partner through its various business associations, utilizing its knowledge of
              and accessto local business as well as its broad networks in governmentand private
              sector. IOM has a working relationship with KADIN since earlier livelihood projects.
              For the purpose of this component, IOM and KADIN have concluded a Letter of Intent
              that is officially supported by the Chairman of the Provincial Planning Development
              Board (BAPEDA)of Yogyakarta

This assistance will be directedto whole communitiesor clusters in heavily damaged areas. In contrast, GTZ under a
parallel project will provide loans to medium-sized enterprisesfor facilities improvement.
"Thisiscurrentlybeingdiscussedbetween IOMaridPNM. Aspartofthesediscussions,theyshouldalsodecide
whether these funds will be given to the MFIs as loans or deposits. This funding,as agreed with all parties, will be pre-
financed by PNM or IOM to ensure compliance with Bank disbursementguidelines.

        (e) ComponentV. Capacity BuildingTechnical Assistance (US$0.7 million). Under
           this component, the project will invest in TA and training for skills development and
           capacity building for the MSEs. Training envisaged under this component includes
            entrepreneurial skills such as financial management and marketing and business plan
           development. Where assessments show that benefits may be yielded from an intensified
            level of cooperationbetween producers, TA will facilitateformation of groups and the
           establishment of related management systems. Groupswill also be provided with the
           necessary skillsto assess market developmentsby themselves, so that they are enabled
           to adjust their business activitiesin the future and after the end of this project.

        (f) Component VI. Project Management and Monitoring and Evaluation (US$l.I
            million). Under this component the project will finance all costs associated with
            management,implementation,and supervisionof the project incurred by the IOM. Of
           this amount about US$0.3 million will be for monitoring and evaluation. In addition,
           this amount includes IOM's organization overhead fee of US$0.2 million (5 percent of
           the total estimated costs).




12.     The Grant recipient and organization responsible for implementation and management of
the Project will be the International Organization for Migration (the "Implementing ~ ~ e n c ~ " ) . ' ~
The Implementing Agency will be responsible for day-to-day management, procurement, logistics,
and all operational details of the Project in accordance with IBRD policies and procedures.
Duration of Project implementation is expected to be 2 years (April 2008               -  March 2010) with an
additional two (2) months allowed, at the end, to conclude the project management activities by
end-May 2010 and close the project.'4

13.     Utilizing its pool of experienced staff and existing office structure in Yogyakarta, IOM can
immediately mobilize a team of skilled and well trained international and national staff which
allows for a project start without delay. The project managementteam, already in place because of
IOM's existingrecovery activities, consistsof: (i) the Head of Office in Yogyakarta (International)
who will be responsible for the overall implementation of the program, as well as for the
coordination between its various components, under the guidance and supervision of the Chief of
Mission in Jakarta; (ii) the Project Manager (International)who has extensive relevant experience
in implementing similar projects for IOM in Aceh and Central Java. He will be responsible for
setting up and running the day-to day operation of the project; (iii) the Monitoring and Evaluation
Manager (International) who will oversee the monitoring and evaluation component; (iv) Finance
Officer (National) will ensure the correct disbursement of funds, compliance with the IBRD
disbursementand financial management guidelines, maintenance of an effective'accounting system
for transactions and transmittal of all necessary documentation to the Jakarta Office to enable the
preparation of financial reports; and (v) the Procurement Officer (International) who will oversee
tendering processes (as necessary for the relevant components), the replacement of assets and the
overall compliance of project activities with IBRD procurement policies and procedures. An



l3See Annex IX. IOM was selected followinga competitive process to be a recipient of the grant.
l4Implementationbegan after appraisal with provision of retroactivefinancing.

operations manual providing details on project implementation procedures is being prepared by
IOM and will be finalized prior to Grant effectiveness.

14.     The team will be supported by the relevant IOM Support Units in Geneva, Manila and
Jakarta. The project team will have access to IOM's support units responsible for Administration
and Finance, Legal, Procurement and Logistics, Construction, Security, IT, etc. The organizational
structure is presented in Annex IX.

15.     Finally, the team will be supported, as necessary, by local NGOs as well as local business
and livelihood experts who are currently working with the IOM on the ongoing livelihood projects.
This will allow drawing, on an as needs basis, on the in-depth knowledge of local market
conditions, on the ground business models and access to the local private and public sector for the
successful implementationof the project.

16.     A midterm review of project will be carried out not later than twelve months from the date
of effectiveness or promptly after an amount of US$2,242,000 shall have been disbursed from the
Grant Account, whichever occurs earlier in conjunction with the Central Java and Yogyakarta
governments, to review the implementation progress. Following the mid-term review, the team
will take any corrective action deemed necessary to remedy any shortcomingnoted. At the Project
level, throughout project implementation, the Implementing Agency will conduct meetings and
follow up with the beneficiariesto evaluatetheir satisfaction with the assistanceprovided.

17.     Independent audits of the Implementing Agency's activities will be carried out in
cooperation with relevant levels of government and in accordance with Section XI1 on Auditing.


Implementing Partners (and Service Providers)

18.     The Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KADIN) is an existing partner of
IOM in current livelihood projects. It has signed a Letter of Intent, setting forth the terms of a
collaborative framework with the IOM for implementation of components IV and V of the project.
KADIN and the sector associations organized under KADIN will undertake several activities to
support the project, including for example: (i) linking micro- and small producers supported in the
project with local SMEs and exporters for better market access; (ii) functioning as event manager
for marketing events and product exhibitions in Yogyakarta, Jakarta and elsewhere; (iii) reviewing
viability of Business Plans prepared by IOM and supported clusters; (iv) implementing vocational
skills trainings for MSEs; (v) as a member of the proposed project advisory body, providing
strategic guidance and inputs on a regular basis to IOM regarding sector and geographicalpriorities
as well as implementation methodologies; (vi) assisting in coordination by providing information
on other livelihoods interventions through its links to various government agencies, especially
BAPPEDA and the Department of Industry and Cooperatives (DEPERINDAGKOP); (vii)
mobilizing support and endorsement for this project through its close relationship with key
stakeholders in the Government, especially the Governor/Sultan of DIY; and (ix) providing
accurate data to IOM on clusters of MSEs in need of assistance.

19.     A vibrant local NGO movement in the region is viewed as a great opportunity to improve
the quality of outputs by utilizing local specialist knowledge and resources while at the same time

 achieving better ownership and sustainability. IOM will seek to include local and national civil-
 society organizations as much as possible while maintaining control of key program functionssuch
 as targeting, beneficiary verification and registration, M&E and larger procurement components.
 Activities that will be implemented by partners include: (i) technical assistance and capacity
 building activities; (ii) micro-finance; (iii) market access initiatives, exhibitions and marketing
 events; (iv) environmentalimpact assessments; and (v) market feasibility studies.

 20.      Potential partners, including local NGOs, will compete for IOM contracts under the JRF
 Project through calls for proposals for specific services. IOM will evaluate proposals taking into
 consideration various aspects, including quality and feasibility of proposal and track record of the
NGO, and for larger contracts, financial strength. Implementingpartners will thus have the status
 of "service providers."

21.      Selection of partner MFIs will be carried out by IOM in close cooperation with PNM. In
this regard, PNM will (together with IOM) conduct financial and technical appraisals of the MFIs
and will hction as a clearing house. Only accredited MFIs will be permitted to participate in the
project.     Throughout implementation of the Project the MFIs are required to maintain: (i) a
satisfactory financial position and track record; (ii) minimum requirements relating to standard
operational procedures and external audits; (iii) compliance with robust financial reporting and
monitoring requirements.


Coordinationwith the Government and Donors


22.      IOM's concept is in line with the Go1 priorities and has been designed in consultationwith
the local communities, regional governments, and TTN. It takes into account the necessity to
carefully coordinate planned activitieswith relevant Governmentauthoritiesas well as other donors
and NGOs to avoid overlap and seek complementarities.

23.      IOM is in constant contact with all relevant Go1 authorities at the district and provincial
levels and can build on its well established relationshipswith these interlocutors. IOM's livelihood
concept has been coordinated with the DIY and the Central Java Governments and TTN, and has
received their collective support. As IOM is currently implementing similar livelihood pilot
projects in Klaten and Bantul, and participates in the relevant coordination meetings, both District
Governments are aware of IOM's ongoing and planned interventions. All intended interventions
and locations for project activities will be coordinatedwith the relevant Go1authoritiesprior to the
start of activities.15

24.      In the field, the project will maintain contact with the regional level authorities in order to
keep them up to date on the progress in implementation of activities and to seek assistance, as
necessary, in resolving the impediments. To date, TTN has been an important partner in facilitating
these activities. However, its mandate expired on July 3, 2008. This will clearly create a void
which needs to be addressed. The RoI authorities (Ministry of Coordination), TTN management,


l5This is standard practice for all ongoing IOM livelihood projects. In addition, IOM's Letter of Intent with the
Indonesian Chamber of Commercehas been signed off by the head ofthe provincial Bappeda, who expressedhis
support for the concept and cooperation.

and government authorities in Central Java and Yogyakarata are hlly aware of this issue and are
committed      to   proposing       and     implementing         an    appropriate      alternative      coordination
mechanisdvenue since overall coordination of donor activities is the res onsibility of the       P6
Indonesian authoritiesand in this case particularly of the provincial governments .

25.     In addition to this Project, the JRF has awarded fundingto GTZ for a parallel project.

26.     While the two projects generallyhave the same objectives,care has been taken in the design
and implementation arrangements to minimize overlap. This has been achieved by ensuring that
on-lending to MSEs under the two projects will be carried out in different locations. Given that
PNM will be the apex for both operations, including monitoring, this should not be difficult to
ensure. Furthermore, while both project provided TA, their approach is different. The GTZ project
focuses its TA on building up the capacity of the MFIs. Under this Project the IOM directs most of
the TA to MSEs. Hence, the two projects are complementary in their impact on long-term capacity
building.

27.     IOM and GTZ will closely coordinate their activities and exchange information during
project implementation to gain synergies and to avoid overlap, particularly in the on-lending
activities supported under their respective projects." In addition, they will maintain coordination
with the respective government stakeholderswith regard to implementationprogress, and reporting.


VI.     PROJECT-LEVELVISIBILITY

28.     To improve project outreach, JRF will provide support developing the public awareness
activities and visibility of the JRF Livelihood projects with regard to launch, collateral and
merchandisedevelopment,progress reporting and general information forum."

29.     IOM and GTZ will have the responsibility to provide for visibility of their respective
projects, clearly identifying the operations as part of the GoIYsand Central Java and DYI
governments' programs supported by JRF; further socializethe JRF livelihoods project and involve
communities in direct communication.


Materials

          Notice boards -contain general informationon the livelihood projects in the offices of the
          implementation agency, the MFIs appointed, and partner agencies. The objectiveto use
          the notice boards is dual show transparency of the project and give background
                                       -
          informationon the access to finance (who, what, where, when) as well as other assistance
          availableunder the livelihood project(s).

          regular socializationmeetings for micro and small businesses in targeted location^.'^
          Where and when appropriate these meetings will be conductedjointly.


ComplaintsHandling


30.     GTZ and IOM will manage separate (but similar) complaint handling mechanisms that
would include SMS hotlines. Since project locations and themes are different between the two
agencies, they will administer the complaints separately and use different hotlines. This will make
the system more flexible and quick in responding to complaints coming from communities since
complaintsare channeled directly to the relevant agency.

31.     On all posters a JRF logo will be included nexthear to the agency (GTZ or IOM) logo. The
two agencies are exploring the possibility of linking this information to the Rekompak website
(http://www.rekompakirf.org). The mechanism should also be promoted/posted in the notice
boards.

32.     The tracking sheet would include the following:

        (a) Date
        (b) Personal information:

VII.    TARGETINGBENEFICIARIES
                       OF

34.     The project targets 3,000 MSEs within a 24 month project period. IOM assumes that
assistanceto one MSE will benefit at least one family, which would mean a total of about 12,60OZ0
beneficiaries supported by the project. The project's assistance to existing MSEs will support
economic growth and employment opportunities, thereby indirectly benefiting a much larger
population. The project does not aim to assist all MSEs in affected areas as this would exceed the
funding available under the JRF Project. Eligibility/selection of MSEs for participating in the
project will be based on an overalljudgment and assessment balancing vulnerability with viability,
taking into account the following:

        Focus on the 26 percent most affected of the 100,000MSEs that were impacted by the
        earthquake:'    directly or indirectly, through loss of production facilities,equipment or
        supportinginfrastructure and reduced market accessor supply chain disruption;
        Sales or production capacity was adversely affectedby the earthquake and the MSE
        operates in an earthquake affected area;
        MSE is currently not receiving and has not previously received similar assistance from other
        sources;
        MSE is a previously viable enterprise based on market study and track record;
        The project will prioritize MSEs that have potential for generating more employment
        opportunities;
        Priority to businesses that support disadvantagedand low income groups (women, single-
        headed household, income below US$2 a day, physical disability,etc.);
        Eligible MSEs are selected through a community-based approach based on a vulnerability
        assessmentusing the above criteria.


35.     IOM assessescommunities based on the various assets and strategiesthat are used to sustain
livelihoods and the specific vulnerabilitiesthat livelihoods are subject to. Vulnerable livelihoods
that face decline resulting from a disaster or from long-term economic and environmental
downslides are the focus of assistance. Interventions strive to build on existing livelihood assets
through skill-building initiatives, training and technical assistance with the goal of reinforcing
depleted livelihood assets and enabling the most vulnerable men and women to solve their own
problems.


20Based on an average family size of 4.2 people.
"UNDPBusinessSurvey2007.

36.    IOM adopts a demand-driven approach when designing and implementing livelihood
interventions. It focuses on the priorities of the community rather than on pre-conceptions
regarding needs of different sectors. To achieve long-lasting outcomes, it is critical that ownership
of interventions is created in the community. Beneficiaries, with particular emphasis on women,
are required to actively participate in all aspects of the program cycle: from assessment and
beneficiary selection to planning, implementation and evaluation. Community in-kind contribution
in the form of labour or material is encouraged which reinforces buy-in and sustainability.
Sustainability outcomes are added to IOM projects by actively seeking government and civil
society participation in coordination and implementation. This ensures that local capacity is
strengthened and can continue to benefit communities after IOM departs. Prioritizing the most
vulnerable means that women, children,widows and other disadvantaged groups are identified.

37.    To practice a demand-driven and community-oriented approach, thorough assessments of
pre-selected clusters/MSEs will be undertaken. The assessment stage will in all cases involve the
following:

       Livelihood assessment: Vulnerability and livelihood analysis will be conducted together
       with communitiesthrough direct discussions and observations. The livelihood analysis will
       include mapping out available assets and required assets replacement, deficits, current and
       previous income levels, mapping out current livelihood strategies, productionprocess and
       input requirements, cash flow and needs, socio-economicbackground of the cluster,way
       and level of cooperation of the cluster/group. In addition, current, former and potential new
       members of the MSEs will be identified at this stage, taking into account gender aspects and
       vulnerabilities. IOM will see opportunitiesfor these groups to participate in the MSEs
       where this is not yet the case and where feasible. MSEs specificallytargeting these groups
       will be prioritized in the project.
       Market study: Market potentials and constraintsare surveyed in and beyond the community
       to measure viability of enterprisesas well as to identify opportunities to strengthen market
       access. Relevant findingsare communicated back to the community. This will include
       assessment of the current demand of the product, market price, existing supply and mid- and
       long-term market analysisfor the product.
       Environmental impact assessments: The project will only promote businesses that do not
       undermine the natural resource base on which the long-term viability of livelihood
       strategies is dependent. No major adverse environmental impacts are expected since the
       scale of most MSEs are expected to be small and local.


38.    To ensure an effective and transparent beneficiary selection process, communities will be
actively involved in beneficiary selection. Concrete action taken under the project to ensure that
women benefit from the project include:

       Requirement of at least 30 percent participation of women in focus group discussionsin the
       initial assessment and MSE identificationstage;
       A significant share of women facilitatorsin the IOM field assessment teams so that the
       specialneeds and aspirationsof women are heard and considered when formulatingthe
       assistance;

        Requirement of at least 30 percent women beneficiaries in the project;

        Promotion of women leaders in cooperativesand business groups supported by the project;
        Endeavorsto help women gain a stronger voice through the project by guaranteeing their
        participation in training and cross-visits and ensuring that women beneficiaries are given
        equal opportunity to speak and present results in group activities;

        Schedulingof meetings and training in a way that is compatible with household obligations
        of women at certain times of the day;

        Promoting of women's participation in micro-financeschemes since this has the potential of
        empowering women economicallyas well as improving sustainability of micro-finance.

        Where appropriate and feasible, challengingof gender stereotypes related to certain sectors
        and businesses;

        Inclusion in the Project of partners that support and promote women's entrepreneurshipand
        empowerment.


VIII. PROJECTTIMELINE

39.     Duration of Project implementation is expected to be 27 months (March 2008 - May 2010)
with an additional two (2) months allowed, at.the end, to conclude the project management
activities by end-May 2010 and close the project. The detailed timeline for implementation of
project components and activities are presented in Annex X.


IX. FINANCIAL DISBURSEMENTMECHANISMS
                    AND



40.     In order to facilitate disbursements under the project the Implementing Agency has agreed
to utilize their own funds to pre-finance activities and to seek re-imbursement from the Bank upon
submission of documentation verifying the actual expenditures. To facilitate start-up of the project,
it has been agreed that retroactive financing of up to US$280,000 will be used to cover project
expenditures incurred during the 6-month period beginning on March 1,2008.

41.     Disbursement Arrangement.            Disbursement method applicable for the project is
"Reimbursement."      IOM will submit withdrawal applications for reimbursement to the Bank
quarterly or when an application has reached the minimum value of US$100,000 equivalent,
supported by: (i) list of payments and records against prior-review contracts; (ii) statement of
expenditures (SOEs) for other expenses.         Expenditures under category 6 (overhead) may be
claimed in proportion to the total disbursement being made. Eligible expenditures under category 1
(Credits) may be reimbursed from the Bank when the sub-loans have been provided to the
respective MSEs.

42.     All documentation evidencing expenditures will be retained by IOM and shall be made
available to the auditors for audit and to the Bank and its representatives if requested

Financial Management


44.     IOM was the recipient of a US$4.26 million grant under the JRF for Yogyakarta and
Central Java Earthquake Roof Structure Project. This project has been closed and the performance
of the IOM has been assessed as satisfactory, including for the financial management of the project.

45.     Financial management risks are rated as "SUBSTANTIAL" and could arise because of the
following: (a) the project might be influenced by the weak overall fiduciary environment in the
country. In such an environment, a set of fiduciary policies and procedures are needed to ensure
that proceeds of the Grant are used only for the purposes intended, with due regard to economy and
eficiency; (b) internal control review was not done to the previous Bank project by HQ internal
audit department of IOM, since IOM Jakarta does not have internal audit staff; (c) IOM's legal
status in Indonesia is governed by and MOU with the Go1with a current expiration date of Dec 31,
2008. This will be extended during project implementation; and (d) risk may arise from financial
assistance to MSEs, since it will be channeled through PNM to MFIs. IOM will request for
reimbursement from the Bank based on disbursementby MFIs to MSEs.

46.     Some measures have been proposed to mitigate the risks arising from these factors. In
addition to existing financial management procedures, IOM will continue to apply strengthened
payment validation procedures as implemented in the previous Bank project and special purpose

financial reports will be requested for this operation on a quarterly basis to facilitate monitoring.
Individual payments above Rp. 100 million in Yogyakarta office will need to be countersigned by
the Jakarta office. PNM has agreed with the Bank that PNM will become the Trustee of the fund
after completion of the project. The fund will be treated as endowment funds and shall continue to
be used to support MSEs in Yogyakarta and Central Java areas. Since the fund will be granted to
PNM, therefore the micro credit fund under this project will be included on its books of account
and subject to checks and balances applicable to PNM funds.

47.     MOU between IOM and PNM, complete with detailed arrangement of flow of funds,
accounting treatment and fiduciary control, would be reviewed and agreed by the Bank before
disbursementsare made under component I11 of the project. This FM assessment will be updated
once the MOU is signed in order to evaluate the arrangements related to the disbursements to the
MSEs. An independent financial audit will be requested on a yearly basis, together with a review
of internal controls over project implementation, Prior to disbursement, IOM has to provide
extension of their Arrangement Cooperation with GOI.                  If at any time during project
implementation, IOM Arrangement Cooperation with Go1 lapses, disbursementsunder the project
will be suspended.

48.     Overall, the project financial management risk is assessed as substantial. This assessment
has concluded that with the implementation of the action plan, the proposed financial management
arrangementswill satisfy the Bank's minimum requirements under OP/BP10.02 and are adequate to
provide, with reasonable assurance, accurate and timely information on the status of the grant
required by the Bank. More detailsof the financial management assessment are given in Annex 111.

49.     A Financial Report (IFR) will be requested for this operation on a quarterly basis to
facilitatemonitoring. The format of the report has been provided to IOM.

50.     Failure on the part of IOM to satisfy the Bank with the progress of the project or with
prospects for its continued implementation, having regard to projected demand, will be treated as
an additional event of suspensionand may also result in the suspension of the balance of the grant.

51.     A midterm review of project will be carried out after the earlier of twelve months from the
date of effectivenessor after 50 percent of the funds under the Grant will have been disbursed, in
cooperation with the Central Java and Yogyakarta governments, to review the implementation
pr~gress.~~


Procurement Assessment

52.     The Bank has carried out an assessment of IOM's procurement capacity for the Project as
part of the project preparation. The assessments reviewed the organizational structure for project
implementation. Based on the assessment, and taking into account the risk mitigation measures
(detailed in Annex IVYProcurement), the overall project risk for procurement is rated as
"AVERAGE."




22The exact date and the TORwill be agreed in consultation with IOM.

53.     Procurement will consist of the purchase of goods, civil works, and services. For shopping-
                                                                                                - -
of goods and civil works by comparing at least three quotations, the Implementing Agency has
adequate internal procurement and purchasing systems and procedures in place that can be followed
for contract packages below US$100,000, subject to clarifications as stated in Annex IV,
Procurement. For contracts above US$100,000, ICB procedures will be followed. Procurementfor
goods under Component I11of the project (Access to Finance) will be the responsibility of the final
beneficiariesNSEs for which local shopping will be used. The project will recruit an external
auditing firm (estimated less than US$20,000) following CQS procedures. Several individual
consultantswith the total estimated contract value of US$1.68 millions will be hired for the project
implementation. The selection process will be on the basis of the "Guidelines: Selection And
Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May 2004. To expedite the Project
implementation, IOM has carried out advance selection of some of the individual consultant
contracts and procurement of goods, and may award contract based on provisions for retroactive
financing proposed under the Project. Please refer to further detail of procurement under the
Project in Annex IV,Procurement


XI. SOCIALANDENVIRONMENTALASPECTS

54.     The project has been classified Environment Safeguards "Category B" since it is unlikely to
lead to significant adverse social and environmental impacts. Safeguard policies triggered by the
project is shown in the followingtable:

55.    Social aspects. The social impact is expected to be positive, as the project will assist micro,
small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) affected by the earthquake to revitalize their businesses
and to re-integrate affected low income communities back into economic life. The project focuses
particularly on remote communities which have received little assistance so far. There will be no
land acquisition and resettlement expected within the project as the MSMEs affected are not new
enterprises and hence will not require any new land.

56.    Environmental aspects. The project will only promote businesses that do not undermine the
natural resource base which the long-term viability of livelihood strategies is dependent on. No
major adverse environmental impacts are expected since the scale of most MSEs are expected to be
small and local.      Environmental issues that may emerge in the project are: (i) potential
contamination of surface and or ground water quality from improper effluent disposal or
leakageispillage of wastewater; and, (ii) poor solid waste management and housekeeping.

57.      The proposed MSEs will be screened via a negative list approach and environmental
screening and assessment will be conducted as a separate activity by experts and partners for those
sectors supported in the project that potentially create harmful impacts on the environment (Further
detailed in Annex V). The study will examine the raw materials used, methods of excavation
(where applicable), emissions from the production processes and help to identify alternative
methods of production and use of technology where necessary and feasible. The study will also
examine public health effects of clusters and identify possible health hazards for producers,
communitiesand buyers.

58.      Indonesia's environmental review procedures are generally consistent with Bank
requirements. The potential scale of environmental impacts can be localized, and measures to
mitigate impacts are manageable. Annex 5 outlines the environmental screening procedures and
guidelinesto identify, review, "red-flag," and correct problems.

59.      For this matter IOM will explore utilizing the services of ProLH, which is jointly
implemented by the Ministry of Environment and the regional environmental institutions
(Bapedalda) of Central Java and DI Y~gyakarta,~~which focuses on reducing environmental
pollution and health risks of the population by improvingthe industrial environmental management
in small and medium scale industries. Within ProLH pilot projects have been established to
demonstrate the instruments, policy and benefits associated,with cleaner production. Intermediary
level organizations like the Indonesian Cleaner Production Centre and other networks are used to
the effective capacity development of the government and private sectors in addressing industrial
environmental management. Within the proposed project IOM will address these issues by
integrating environmental aspects into:

        Design of project concept and activities;
        Implementationof activities - such as selection of supported SMEs, and training;
         Capacity building for NGOs and Co-operativessuch as the design of financial assistance;
        and,
        Monitoringand evaluation activities.


XII.    AUDITING

60.     Special purpose project financial statement for expenditure under this grant would be
prepared by the IOM Jakarta office, based on summary of financial transactions received from the
IOM Yogyakarta office. Upon the Bank's request, IOM will have the financial statements for the
project audited and furnished to the Bank not later than three months after the end of the audited
period, along with a report on the audit of the special purpose financial statements.

61.     The draft Terms of Reference (TOR)for the (external) Project audit will be provided to the
Bank before contracting the auditors for Bank approval. The audit report will include an opinion
on the reliability of the Project financial statements. The cost of the audits will be financed under
the Project.

 62.    The Bank will have the right to suspend disbursement of the funds if significant terms of the
 Grant Agreement, includingreporting requirements, are not complied with.




63.     See Annex 11: Results Framework.


XIV. MONITOIUNG REPORTING
                      AND



64.     IOM will provide IBRD with quarterly narrative and financial reports on implementation
progress not later than 45 days after the end of the period covered by such report. In addition, the
Implementing Agency must submit a Completion Report not later than four months after the
Closing Date, summarizingthe findings of the follow-up surveys of the beneficiaries, and details of
the procurement, distribution, and technical assistance stages of the project. For M e r details see
Annex 11: Results Framework.

65.     A robust M&E strategy is essential to ensure the project objectives are met, program quality
is maintained and lessons learned are taken into account both during implementation and for future
assistanceprograms. To this end, about US$275,000 is provided under the project for this purpose.
The project will be monitored by the Project Manager based on field visits to enable corrective
action and project adjustment. An M&E Manager reporting directly to the Head of Sub-Office
provides an additional layer of monitoring and accountability. The M&E officer will focus
especially on beneficiary eligibility, partner accountability and quality of trainings.

66.     IOM already has an established Livelihood Database for beneficiary performance tracking
with a comprehensive livelihood asset and income profile of each beneficiary. The database will be
expanded and used as a key management tool for the proposed Project. IOM will closely follow
the development of the supported MSEs throughout the life-cycle of the Project through field visits
by trained IOM field staff. Success criteria for each supported business and benchmarks, as
determined in the relevant business plan agreed with the beneficiaries, will be assessed by IOM
teams. The results will help IOM decide on additional or corrective measures and trouble shooting
if business development is unsatisfactory or stagnant.

67.    IOM will use their existing accounting system, which is documented in the manual for the
Implementing Agency field office and has been assessed as acceptable to the IBRD. All project
transactions will be recorded in the financial statements under separate account codes, to ensure
that expenditures are tracked correctly for different field offices and donors and minimize the risk
of double counting with other donors' funds.

XV.     SUSTAINABILITY

68.     IOM seeks to ensure that project outcomes continue to yield benefits in communities
beyond the project life. The overall goal is to create self-sufficient businesses and producerswhich
are able to sustain their income generating activities independently. At the institutional level,
sustainability will be promoted by working closely with actors in communities, government and
civil society and to link these actors to make the best use of local knowledge and at the same time
develop local organizational and human resources capacity.             Promoting enhanced ways of
cooperation between producers in one cluster - where feasible and appreciated by the cluster
members - is regarded as a key element in strengtheningthe businesses and hence for sustainable
business development.

69.     Community volunteerism or "gotongroyong" will be a key implementation mechanism in
IOM's concept. IOM's experience shows that the gotong royong approach not only makes project
implementation cheaper and more effective, but strengthens existing social capital and social
cohesion which will benefit the community in the long-term

70.     Institutional development is Wher promoted by engaging government agencies where
possible. Participation of the government in project implementation encourages accountability,
builds capacity, and makes possible continued government assistance to target groups. Relevant
government bodies at the provincial and district levels will be engaged in the project and invited to
provide beneficiary MSEs with advice, input and possibly additional training. Linking MSEs with
these government bodies will create a long lasting relationship and benefit the clusters after the end
of this project. In addition, the local MFIs and PNM will benefit both financially and institutionally
from participation the project. The funds repaid from the on-lending activities under Component
111will continue to be used by PNM to provide support to the MSEs through qualified MFIs. To
this end, PNM will enter into an agreement with the governments of Central Java and Yogyakarta
for utilization of these funds in the two provinces beyond the life of the project.

71.     As described above, beneficiaries will be asked to "buy-in" and contribute in-kind support
to the provided assistance, where feasible. Experience shows that even with small contributions
fiom the beneficiaries themselves, the perspective shifts considerably as the received support is no
longer regarded as free or as a "gift." By that, beneficiaries recognize fiom the outset that they are
sharing the responsibility of success (or failure) which increases their willingness and readiness to
actively participate in the formulation of the assistance.

72.     The training curriculum will include an assessment of market developments and business
strategy development, such as improving production processes, maximizing profit share and
product design. These training components will allow beneficiaries to independently adjust their
businesses in the future to support their long-term success.

Summary

1.      The overall objective of this project is to contributeto Government of Indonesia's initiatives
to support the recovery of micro and small enterprises (MSE) in Yogyakarta and Central Java and
enable them to reach at least pre-earthquake capacity through enhanced access to finance and
targeted technical assistance. Total budget estimate is USD 4.48 million and will be implemented
in 24 months. This grant will be funded by several donors, under the Java ReconstructionFund.

2.      The purpose of the project's financial management assessment is to determine whether the
implementing agency, IOM, has acceptable financial management systems, including accounting
system, reporting, auditing and internal controls.          IOM is a non-UN inter-governmental
organization with headquarters in Geneva. The Financial management system in the headquarters
has not been assessed for the purposes of this Grant.

3.      Financial management risks are rated as SUBSTANTIAL and could arise because of the
following: (a) the project might be influenced by the weak overall fiduciary environment in the
country. In such an environment, a set of fiduciary policies and procedures are needed to ensure
that proceeds of the Grant are used only for the purposes intended, with due regard to economy and
efficiency; (b) internal control review was not done to the previous Bank project by HQ internal
audit department of JOM, since IOM Jakarta does not have internal audit staff; (c) uncertainty of
IOM's legal status in Indonesia, as the MOU extension only covered period up t to June 15, 2008;
and (d) risk may arise from financial assistance to MSEs, since it will be channeled through PNM
to MFIs. IOM will request for reimbursement from the Bank based on disbursement by MFIs to
MSEs . PNM agreed with the Bank that PNM will become the Trustee of the fund after completion
of the project. The fund will be treated as endowment funds and shall continue to be used to support
MSEs in Yogyakarta and Central Java areas. Since the fund will be granted to PNM, therefore the
micro credit fund under this project will be included on its books of account and subject to checks
and balances applicable to PNM funds.

4.      Some measures have been proposed to mitigate the risks arising from these factors. In
addition to existing financial management procedures, IOM will continue to apply strengthened
payment validation procedures as implemented in the previous Bank project and special purpose
financial reports will be requested for this operation on a quarterly basis to facilitate monitoring.
Individual payments above RplOO million in Yogyakarta office will need to be countersigned by
the Jakarta office. MOU between IOM and PNM, complete with detailed arrangement of flow of
funds, accounting treatment and fiduciary control, would be reviewed and agreed by the Bank
before disbursements are made under component 111 of the project. This FM assessment will be
updated once the MOU is signed in order to evaluatethe arrangementsrelated to the disbursements
to the MSEs. An independent financial audit will be requested on a yearly basis, together with a
review of internal controls over project implementation. Prior to disbursement,IOM has to provide
extension of their Arrangement Cooperation with GOI.               If at any time during project
implementation, IOM Arrangement Cooperation with Go1 lapses, disbursements under the project
will be suspended.

      5.       Overall, the project financial management risk is assessed as being SUBSTANTIAL. This
      assessment has concluded that with the implementation of the action                 - the proposed financial
      management arrangements will satisfy the Bank's minimum requirements under 0 ~ 1 ~ ~ 1 0and 2           . 0
      are adequate to provide, with reasonable assurance, accurate and timely information on the status of
      the grant required by the Bank. More details of the financial management assessment are given
      below.


      Summaryof Risks and Proposed Mitigating Arrangements


      6.       The project's overall risk assessment and summary of mitigating measures is as follows:

                                   managed by a team of professional staff, including 56
                                   qualified expatriate staff. IOM has experience in

 1. Budgeting         Moderate     Budget for the project has been prepared. Indirect cost N
                                   budgeted is 5 percent of total budget.

2. Internal    Substantial FM procedures and policies are well documented.          Y    Moderate
Controls                   Transactionsin Indonesia are subject to internal audit
                           of IOM from HQ. Previous project was not audited
                           during their visit to Indonesia.The Yogyakarta office
                           has strengthened payment validation process during
                           previous Bank project implementation,i.e. payment
                           above Rp. 100million will need approval from Jakarta
                           office.

                           Same arrangementofpayment validationwill be
                           appliedfor thisproject. Review of Internal controls
                           over Grantoperations will be requested,and a copy of
                           the report will be made available to the Bank.
3. Accounting  Substantial Accounting staff capacity in Jakarta is adequate.The     Y    Moderate
                           Yogyakartaoffice accounting staff already has
                           experience in implementingWorld Bank project.
                           Transactions for proposed Grant operation will be
                           included in their entity accountingsystemto reduce
                           risk of double counting.

                           Risk will be adjustedupon receivingdocumentation
                           from PNM.
4. Flow of     Substantial For asset replacement, IOM will procure goods and        Y    Moderate
Funds                      deliver them directly to beneficiaries. Risk may arise
                           from financial assistance to SMEs, since it will be
                           channeled through PNM to MFIs. PNM is a state
                           owned enterprise,established for the specificpurpose
                           of development and empoweringMSME in Indonesia.
                            PNM agreed with the Bank that PNM will become the
                           Trustee of the fund after completion of the project. The
                           fund will be treated as endowment funds and shall
                           continueto be used to support MSEs in Yogyakarta
                           and Central Java areas. Sincethe fund will be granted
                           to PNM, therefore the micro credit fundunder this
                           project will be included on its books of account and
                           subjectto checks and balances applicableto PNM
                           funds.


                           ContractbetweenIOM and PNM should clearly
                           defineflow offunds and terms and conditionsto be
                           applied to ensurefiduciary control by PNM. Contract
                           should be approvedby the Bank before dkbursements
                           under ComponentIII of the Project.




                           in Indonesia under this Grant.

Project Financial Managementand Disbursement Arrangements


7.       Based on the project design features and the risk analysis summarized above, the following
arrangements are proposed for financial management and disbursements. These include measures
to mitigate risks identified above.


Institutional and staffing arrangements


8.       10M is an organization headquartered in Geneva, with extensive operations (220 offices)
around the world. It has been in operation in Indonesia since 1999. It has a Memorandum of
Understanding with the Ministry of Foreign Affair authorizing it to operate as a non UN
Intergovernmental Organization for relief work. Its operations in Indonesia are subject to its own
internal governance and accountability arrangements. Extension of the MOU provided to us was
the latest for three months period and will be ending on December 31,2008. The Arrangement of
cooperation between Government of Indonesia and IOM should be extended prior to effectiveness
and remain in place during the implementationperiod, otherwise, disbursements will be suspended.

9.       Existing staff of the entity located in Yogyakarta will do accounting, reporting and
monitoring. Activities will be supervised by Jakarta ofice of IOM. Resource department has
responsibility on financial management and human resources. Right now there are four staffs
working under financial management unit. Yogyakarta office has experience in implementing the
Bank project previously, i.e. JRF grant for T-Shelter. This staff arrangement considered adequate
for the time being.      There is no significant financial management issue noted during the
implementation of that project.


Accounting & Reporting


10.     The financial package used by IOM is a SAP product called The Process and Resources
Integrated Systems Management (PRISM), which records expenditures at IOM missions worldwide
and provides comprehensive accounting and financial reporting functionality. The PRISM system
is accessible at the IOM ofice in Yogyakarta.

11.     The project will use their existing accounting system which is documented in the manual for
IOM field office. The accounting manual is acceptable. All project transactions are included in its
financial statement, so that risk of double counting with other donors can be reduced.

12.     A Financial Report (IFR) will be requested for this operation on a quarterly basis to
facilitate monitoring. The format of the report will be provided to IOM during negotiations.

Internal Controls


13.     IOM has adequate internal controls in place concerning the preparation and approval of
transactions and segregation of duties. FM procedures and policies are well documented. The Bank
requested IOM in the previous financial management assessment to strengthen their payment
validation for the Yogyakarta office. This has been followed during implementation of previous
Bank project. Same arrangementof payment validation will be applied for this project.

The IOM has provided the Bank with a summary of the results from the Internal Audit conducted at
the IOM sub-office in Yogyakarta at the end of August 2008, which included the current Project.
In addition, IOM has fbrnished the Bank with a certificate from IOM's Office of Inspector General
(OIG) certifying that the Internal Audit was conducted and that it included a revision of the
documents and administrative structure of the IOM office located in Yogyakarta. It is stated in the
certificate that in the opinion of the OIG, the office of IOM in Yogyakarta has the adequate
structure in the areas of Procurement, Logistics, Administration and Finance, is adequately staffed
and the activities are abiding to the rules and procedures of the Organization. The Bank has
indicated its satisfaction with the execution of the IOM's Internal Audit for the purposes of the
present Project.

The office in Yogyakarta has implemented the necessary actions to address the issues raised by the
internal auditors. All the necessary internal controls are currently in place to ensure that fiduciary
objectives are met. Although IOM Yogyakarta cannot dictatethe audit locations of the OIG, IOM
has, in November 2008, forwarded a request from the Bank to include the present Project into the
2011internal audit program shouldthe project still be running.



Audit Arrangement


14.     Special purposes project financial statement for expenditure under this grant would be
prepared by the Jakarta office, based on summary of financial transaction received from the
Yogyakarta office. The financial report will be subject to a financial audit by qualified auditor
acceptable to the Bank. A copy of the project audited financial statements, along with the
management letters issued by the auditors, if any, will be submitted to the Bank not later than 3
months after 12and 24 months of project implementation.

15.     The Terms of Reference (TOR) for the project audit will be agreed between the Bank and
the Recipient prior to tendering for these services. The audit report will include an.opinionon the
reliability of the project financial statements.


Disbursement Arrangement


16.     Disbursement method applicable for the project is reimbursement.^            IOM will submit
withdrawal applications for reimbursement to the Bank quarterly or when an application has

reached the minimum size of US$100,000 equivalent, supportedby: (i) list of payments and records
against prior-review contracts; (ii) statement of expenditures (SOEs) for other expenses.
Expenditures under category 6 (overhead) may be claimed in proportion to the total disbursement
being made. Eligible expenditures under category 1 (Credits) may be reimbursed from the Bank
when the sub-loanshave been provided to the respective MSEs.

17.    All documentation evidencing expenditures will be retained by IOM and shall be made
available to the auditors for audit and to the Bank and its representatives if requested

18.    Allocations of grants proceeds are as follows:


                                          Amount of the Grant        Percentageof

                                      ANNEXIV: PROCUREMENT



A.      General


1.      Procurement for the proposed project would be carried out in accordance with the World
Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004; and
"Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May
2004, and the provisions stipulated in the Grant Agreement. The general description of various
items under differentexpenditure category is described below.

2.      Procurement of Works. Civil works procured under this project would include restoration
of infrastructure that are essential for operations of MSEs, such as production facilities, livelihood
tools, irrigation systems, small roads, warehouses, sheds, pens, and other small-scale infrastructure.
For contracts below US$100,000, the procurement will be done following Shopping procedures
acceptable to IBRD, by comparing at least three quotations, using the Recipient's standard
documents satisfactory to the Bank. Although it is not anticipated yet, however, if necessary,
procurement above US$100,000 will follow ICB procedures, using the Bank's standard ICB
documents.

3.      Procurement of Goods. Goods procured under this project would include the purchase of
physical assets. IOM has a network of established vendors and has advertised public tenders in
local newspapers. Many of the existing vendors have the opportunity to supply the goods. Physical
assets will be purchased on packages, with an estimate of not more than US$ 100,000per package.
For contracts below US$ 100,000, the procurement will be done following Shopping procedures
acceptable to the Bank, by comparing at least three quotations, using the Recipient's standard
documents satisfactory to the Bank. Although it is not anticipated yet, however, if necessary,
procurement above US$100,000 will follow ICB procedures, using the Bank's standard ICB
documents.

4.      Selection of Consultants.        An external auditor will be hired (estimated less than
US$20,000) following CQS procedures. The auditor will conduct an audit of special purpose
project financial statement. The overall objective of this assignment is to enable the auditor to
express a professional opinion on the project financial statement, the operation of the overall
financial management system including internal controls, and compliance with the financing
agreements. This package is subject to the Bank's prior review. In addition, Selection of
Individual Consultants required for the project implementation, will be on the basis of the
"Guidelines: Selection And Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May
2004. All selection of consultantson a sole-source basis, if any, will be subject to prior review by
the Bank.

5 .     To expedite Project implementation, IOM may carry out advance selection of several key
individual consultants and procurement of goods. The Agreement will include provisions on
retroactive financing in case the above contracts are awarded prior to Grant's effectiveness. Such

advance selection and procurement shall be done according to provisions in the Guidelines, and
will be subject to prior review as specified in the Procurement Plan.


B.     Assessment of the Agency's Capacity to Implement Procurement


6.     Procurement activities will be carried out by the International Organization for Migration.
For this purpose IOM employs dedicated Administration and Finance staff as well as
Procurement/Logisticsexperts, including one international Procurement Officer.

7.      The assessment of IOM's capacity concluded that IOM has the capacity to carry out
procurement, with existing internal procurement procedures as follows:

        (a) Below US$500 -need not be supported by quotations fiom 3 vendors. The
            Procurement Officer authorizes.
        (b) Below US$2,000-Head of Sub-ofice authorizes after obtaining 3 quotations.
       (c) Below ~S$20,000-Chief of Mission, or his designated staff, authorizes after obtaining
           three (3) quotations.
        (d) Below US$50,000 -Chief of Mission, or his designated staff, authorizes after obtaining
           three (3) quotations using competitive bidding.
        (e) Between US$50,000 and US$100,000-in addition to (d), missions are required to
            coordinate with Field Coordination Unit (FPU).
        (f) Over US$100,000 - in addition to (e), procurement shall be done using International
            Competitive Bidding (ICB).

8.     There is also a provision in IOM's internal procedures that requiring IOM to hlly comply
with the donor's procurement procedures and requirements for projects financed by donors.

9.     The IOM's shopping procedures may be followed subject to the following clarifications:

        Shoppingis made by comparing at least three quotations fiom reputable suppliers. The term
       "reputable suppliers" shall not be limited to ones currently listed in IOM's vendor system.
       IOM should expand the list of firms invited to submit quotations in order to expand the pool
       of invited suppliers and find other qualified potential suppliers
       Award of contract shall be made to the lowest-priced, substantially technically responsive
       quotation, and the merit point system is not applicable.
       Quotation is obtained using a one envelop system.
       No negotiation of contracts is allowed.

10.    As the anti corruption action plan on procurement, IOM will disclose the information on the
complaint database along with the report on the complaint resolution;

11.    The overall project risk for procurement is "AVERAGE."

C.      Review by the Bank


12.     All ICBs if any, the first three contracts using shopping for goods, and works regardless of
the value; the first three contracts for selection of consultant firms regardless of value; selection of
any consultant (firm) with contract value estimated to be more than US$100,000; sole-source
selection of consultants; and selection of individual consultants with estimated contract value of
more that US$100,000 will be subject to prior review by IBRD. All other contracts will be subject
to post review.


D.      ProcurementPlan


13.     A Procurement Plan for Individual Consultants, external Auditors and any other consulting
assignment will be sent to the Bank prior to the grant negotiation. Once finalized, the Procurement
Plan will be available in the Project's database and in the Bank's external website. IOM will
update the Procurement Plan in agreement with the Project Team annually or as required to reflect
the actual project implementationneeds.


E.      Frequency of ProcurementSupervision


14.     The Bank will conduct at least once a year supervisionmissions to visit the field to carry out
post review of procurement actions.

Introduction


1.      The overall objective of the project is to contribute to the Government's of Indonesia's
initiatives to support the recovery of micro and small enterprises (MSE) in Yogyakarta and Central
Java and enable them to reach at least pre-earthquake capacity through enhanced access to finance
and targeted technical assistance.


Objectivesof the Safeguard Framework


2.      The social and environmental management framework provides general policies and
guidelines to serve the following objectives:

    Protect human health;
    Prevent or compensateany loss of livelihood;
    Prevent environmental degradationas a result of either individual investmentsor their
    cumulative effects;
    Enhancepositive environmentaloutcomes;
    Avoid or minimize adverse environmental,economic and social impacts.

3.      The project has been classified Environment SafeguardsCategory B given that it is unlikely
to lead to significant adverse social and environmental impacts.


Environmental Screening


4.      Subprojects or MSEs will be checked against Government of Indonesia (GOI) screening
criteria to ensure that no project would necessitate a full environmental assessment. In an initial
screening, the project type, scale, location, sensitivity, and the nature and magnitude of potential
impacts, will be identified to classify the proposal in one of 4 categories:

    Any potential MSEs which fall into the World Bank's Category A and thus require preparation
    of a full EIA (ANDAL) for which the Ministry of Environmenthas set criteriawill be excluded
    from project funding. ANDALs (environmental impact assessments) are required for large sub-
    projects in the following areas: marinelfreshwater conservation areas, peat areas, water
    catchment areas surroundinglakes and reservoirs, areas surrounding springs, scientific areas,
    areas susceptibleto natural hazards, coastal mangrove areas,coastal edges, forest protected
    areas, and cultural reserves. No MSEs are expected and will be allowed in national parks,
    forest parks, or nature tourism parks.
    Those which fall into the World Bank's Category B but under the current 1ndonesibEIA
    System would require the preparation of site-specific EnvironmentalManagement(UKL) and

    Monitoring Plans (UPL) are also subject to BAPEDALDAreviews and approvals, with copies
    furnishedto the Bank. It is expected that some small or medium industriesmay fall under this
    category in particular the medium industries.
    Those for which standard operating procedures (SOP) suffice,where generic good practice
    would protect the environment adequately. The Minister of Environmentthrough ProLH
    program has developed activities on eco efficiencyin small and medium sized enterprises and
    disseminated eco efficiencytools (good housekeeping,chemical management, environmental
    oriented cost management,environmental management accounting). It is expected that some
    MSEs may fall under this category.
    Those that require no environmental study,where no disturbance of land or water or discharge
    of pollutants is involved. It is expectedthat most of the MAEs may fall under this category.

5.      Special screening will be applied on the following cases:

    Pesticide, ozone-depletingsubstances, tobacco or tobacco products: No subprojectsusing or
    producing these materialswill be financed.
    Asbestos. No asbestos-containingmaterialswill be financed. Special mitigation measures to
    address any issues with existing asbestos in any proposed sub-project (e.g. renovation of school
    buildings that may have used asbestos) will be applied.
    Sub-projectsthat produce liquid or gaseous effluentsor emissions. No manufacturing or
    processing operations will be financed that would produce pollutant-bearing effluents or
    emissions unless: (a) the operations are small-scale; and (b) the cognizant Bapedalda reviews
    the design and certifiesthat it meets applicable water and air pollution control standards.
    Hazardous materials and wastes. No MSE will be financedthat uses, produces, stores or
    transportshazardous materials (toxic, corrosive or explosive) or generates "B3" (hazardous)
    wastes.
    Logging. MSEs involving logging operationsor procurement of logging equipment will not be
    financed.
    MSEs or activities with the potential for significant conversion or degradation of critical forest
    areas or related criticalnatural habitats (as defined in OP 4.36 on Forests)
    Mining or excavationof live coral.

6.      The implementing agency will be responsible for ensuring that the negative list approach is
applied,and that revisions are made to the list, as necessary.


Training


7.      The Ministry of Environment with the support of GTZ through the joint project ProLH
(Indonesian-German Environmental Program) developed activities on eco efficiency in small and
medium-sized enterprises. In addition, this program initiated the establishment of the Indonesian
Cleaner Production Center (ICPC) in 2004 in order to stimulate the development of the Cleaner
Production (CP) and Eco Efficiency (EE) market. The ICPC is stimulating, facilitating and
catalyzing Eco Efficiency implementation by supporting service providers in Indonesia. The ICPC
is acting as a platform for Eco Efficiency, providing training, awareness-raising events, knowledge
management, and demonstration projects targeting local service providers. Currently it cooperates

with three regional CP centers, namely P3BD (regional cleaner Production Development Center in
Semarang Jawa Tengah), Forum Eko Efisiensi D.I. Yogjakarta (Ecoforum Yogyakarta), and CPCU
(Cleaner Production Clinic UnMul, East Kalimantan).

8.     Trainingmeasures are offered in the following fields:

   Good Housekeeping
   Chemical Management
   Occupational health and Safety
   Environmental Management (Accounting and Environmentalperformance
   Assessment/Indicators)
   Cleaner Production (CP) General & Communication
   CP Marketing strategy
   CP and Banking


Reporting

9.     The implementing agency will aggregateand review environmental reports and flag them as
part of the regular project bi-annual reports. The implementing agency will develop a matrix of
likely environmental impacts, and how they would be addressed. The matrix will be included in
the Project Management Manual. An experienced environmental consultant will be hired to
summarize progress, monitor and measure the impact of the project on the environment as part of
the performance evaluation of the project. The Implementing Agency as part of their regular bi-
annual project reports will summarizethe environmental issues to include:

   A summaryof significantmitigation measures, if any, undertake during the previous six-
   months;
   A description of any significantproblems or successes in environmental mitigationduring the
   period; and
   Anticipated notable environmentalor social eventsanticipated during the coming six months.

                             ANNEXVI: DETAILEDPROJECTDESCRIPTION


1.      The project componentsand implementation arrangementsare as follows:

2.      Component I Assessment for Identification of InterventionslTargeting Beneficiaries
                         -
(US$0.4 million). Under this component the recipient (IOM) will conduct thorough assessmentsof
clusters/MSEs as a result of their discussions with the local communities to identify the proposed
3,000 highly vulnerable MSE beneficiaries that will be eligible to be supported under all
components of project. The assessments would include livelihood, market and environmental
impact surveysin order to fine-tunethe implementation strategy for assistanceto MSEs.

        Livelihood assessment: The livelihoodanalysis will includemapping out availableassets
        and required assets replacement, deficits, current and previous income levels, mapping out
        current livelihood strategies,production process and input requirements, cash flow and
        needs, socio-economicbackground of the cluster, way and level of cooperationof the
        cluster/group. In addition, current, former and potential new members of the MSEs will be
        identified at this stage, taking into account gender aspects and vulnerabilities.


        Market study: This will includeassessment of the current demand of the product, market
        price, existing supply and mid- and long-term market analysis for the product.


        Environmentalimpact assessments: The project will only promote businessesthat do not
        underminethe natural resource base on which the long-term viability of livelihood
        strategies is dependent. Environmental assessmentswill be conducted as a separateactivity
        by expertsand partners for those sectors supportedunder the project that could potentially
        have hannfbl impacts on the environment. The study will also examinepublic health
        effects of clusters and identifypossible health hazards for producers, communities,and
        buyers.


3.      The process will include group discussions, stakeholder interviews and quantitative asset
and income surveys using IOM Community Assessment Teams which have been trained in
livelihood assessmentsthrough the ongoing livelihood projects. Detailed market feasibility surveys
will be conducted through cooperationwith the FT Link consultant group.

4.      Component I1 - Asset Replacement (USS0.9 million). Under this component, IOM will
purchase goods and provide them as in kind support to restore infrastructure and physical assets
that are essential for operations of MSEs, such as production facilities, livelihood tools, irrigation
systems, small roads, warehouses, sheds, pens and other essential small-scale infrastructure. Under
this component, based on the needs articulated by the MSEs and after review and analysis of the
assessment studies, IOM will procure the materials and deliver them to the communities for hand-
over. The intervention will be provided for highly vulnerable but viable enterprises that are unable
to resume operations because of loss or damage to essential equipment, production facilities or
supportinginfrastructure and who are unable to secure loans since business revenue is small or non-
existing and loan provision would likely lead to defaulting loans, an additional obstacleto recovery.

5 .     Loan assistance will be unsuitable at this stage since business revenue is small or non-
existingand loan provision would likely lead to defaulting loans, an additionalobstacle to recovery.
Quick replacementof physical assets is needed in order tojump-start economic activity and recover
a minimum revenue stream. The approach will not only allow for recovery of the affected business
but also provides for physical collateral which will help the business to access formal loans from
financial institutions. Once the basic business infrastructure has been restored, the enterprise may
become eligible for a loan as part of the finance component in the project to use as working capital
to purchase inputs and expand production further.

6.      Situations where asset replacement is required before other assistance are not uncommon,
despite it having been more than a year since the earthquake, as revealed from IOM's own
observations. For example,in the village of Wukisari in Bantu1 district, only 25 out of a total of 100
traditional roof tile producers have resumed activity 15 months after the disaster since kilns have yet
to be replaced or repaired."      For these home-industries to survive, kilns are needed, not loans.
Replacement of damaged fish nets of aquaculture farmers, replacement of weaving tools for women
rope weavers and repair of irrigation canals are fbrther examples of where asset replacement must
come before loan assistance.

7.      Rationale for asset replacement:

            Asset replacementinterventionwill target those enterprisesthat are assessed as highly
            vulnerable (e.g. stalled production, indebted) and whose survival is dependent upon
            direct provision of a physical asset (tool or facility) that was damaged/destroyedby the
            earthquake and which income-generationis dependent on. These enterprises will not be
            suitable for loan assistance at this stage since they have limited or no production
            capacity and therefore are not financially viable;

            Enterprises that have been assisted through restoration of the basic business
            infrastructurewill be better positioned to access the financialassistance component of
            the project since production is up and mining and there is physical collateral.

            Certain infrastructurethat supports the operation of MSEs is in need of rehabilitation
            across DIY and Klaten, such as irrigation systems,public warehousing facilities,
            markets and roads. Where government or community is anticipated to be slow or
            incapableof replacinglrepairingsuch public goods, asset replacement funds of an MSE
            cluster can be pooled and the work implementedunder the Project.

            In many instances it is logisticallycumbersome for clusters to acquire a large amount of
            material quickly and at the right price. Furthermore, larger-scaleprocurement activities
            at the community-levelcreate considerable accountabilityrisks. IOM has a proven
            procurement system in place that was established in conjunction with the transitional
            shelter projects (financed under the JRF) and has the capacity to procure and deliver



''IOMFOCUSGroup    Discussion with producers in Bendo, Wukirsari, 23 August, 2007.


                                                      38

             material quickly and cost-effectivelyto beneficiariesin a transparent way while
             ensuring quality control.

8.      ~ s s ereplacement interventions will be guided by the following principles:
                 t

             Assessingasset replacement needs will be a demand-drivenand participatoryprocess.
             Only assets requested by the enterpriseand supportedwith viable business plans will be
             provided to ensureproper utilization,ownership and sustainability;asset requests will
             be reviewedby IOM and only replaced if deemed necessary for business restoration.

             To mitigate risks associated with ownershipand maintenance responsibilities, hand-over
             of assets will be accompaniedwith ownership certificatesand sustainabilityplans
             (linked to the business plans).

             Over-emphasis on asset replacement can cause dependenceand disrupt local markets.
             Therefore,the intervention will only be provided to select clusters where IOM's
             assessment suggests a need for such support.

             In order to avoid socialjealousy, asset replacementwill follow IOM's established
             community engagement process. IOM will ensure that the type of assistance and the
             individualssupported is clearly communicated to the community. IOM's community
             engagement strategy also includesan institutionalizedcomplaint system which can be
             used by cluster members or community members in case they object the type of
             assistanceprovided or the selected beneficiaries and after having been granted enough
             time to expresspotential concernsor complaints. Distributionof assetswill only start
             after finalizationof the community engagement process.

             Even where assets will be provided for individualMSEs, IOM's strategy foresees
             supportingan entirecluster with the same kind of support,rather than picking seiected
             members of one cluster which will receive assets, whereas others will not."

             A need for raw material inputs suggeststhat production is up and running. Such
             working capital needs should be met through the provision of micro-loans rather than
             direct material provision.

9.      Component 111 Access to Finance (US$1.0 million). Under this component, small loans
                           -
will be provided to MSEs, including community enterprises, associations, cooperatives, etc. Small
loans will be disbursed based on business concepts submitted by members. Funds under this
component will be channeled through PNM as the Apex institution through participating MFIs
which will be selected based on predefined criteria.                   IOM will sign a Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) with PNM, on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank, in order to
transfer funds to PNM on a non-reimbursablebasis to finance subprojects for the benefit of eligible

  A cluster of fisherman that have been operating fish pens which were destroyed by the earthquake have been
assessed by IOM as being in need for immediate support through asset replacement. Although not all pens have been
damaged to the same extent, the project would provide all fishermen with the same amount of bamboo and fishnets to
avoid socialjealousy.

MSEs, and in accordance with the guidelines, procedures and criteria set forth in the Project
Management Manual. In addition, IOM will ensure financial expertise will be provided, as
necessary to ensure proper and transparentmanagement of loan funds. PNM will assist the IOM in
selection and monitoring of the financial intermediaries and will help provide technical assistance
to these intermediaries in their lending activities as necessary. PNM will on-lend proceeds to
selected MFIs at an interest rate of not more than 7 percent annually, with a repayment period of
not more than 5 years., in coordination with the GTZ to ensure consistency of approach between
the two projects. MFIs will onlend the project funds at market rates and will assume the credit risk
of their final transactions with eligible MSEs on their balance sheet. The MFIs will have to repay
interest and principle of the funds received to PNM. PNM will recycle the hnds through MFIs to
continue to assist eligible MSEs in the region in line with the overall project objectives. It was
expected that the reflow of funds by PNM would be as close as possible to the 10-yearperiod.

10.     Appraisal of beneficiaries' loan applications will be conducted by the MFI using existing
assessment instruments that have been put in place by the MFI.              These tools require that
beneficiaries prepare a loan application where the business concept is elaborated in detail. The
application will explainhow the loan will be used to support the business expansion.

11.     Assessments of these applications will typically include a field visit by an officer of the MFI
to inspect and assess the business potential first hand. It is common that neighbors are interviewed
by the officer to asses the "character" and track record of the potential client. IOM beneficiaries
will compete to access the loan funds and not all will be found suitablefor a loan.

12.     To ensure that only the most capable and professional institutions are engaged in the
project, PNM and IOM will invite MFIs to submit proposals to be selected as financial
intermediaries under the project and if necessary to receive capacity building assistance under the
project. The proposals will be appraised by PNM and IOM. The appraisal will measure critical
aspects, including: governance, capacity, outreach, and financial performance.

13.     Component IV Assistance for Market Access (US$0.3 million). Under this component
                         -
the project will finance TA to help MSEs recover former buyers and customers or to identify new
ones. Activities will include facilitating exhibitions, organizing cross-visits of successful operating
MSEs in the same sector and marketingevents, conducting market studies, and improving access to
information. KADIN will act as implementingand advisory partner, utilizing its knowledge of and
access to local business as well as its broad networks in government and private sector. IOM has a
working relationship with KADIN since earlier livelihood projects. For the purpose of this
component, IOM and KADIN have concluded a Letter of Intent that is officially supported by the
Chairmanof the Provincial Planning Development Board (BAPEDA)of Yogyakarta.

14.    Component V       -Capacity Building Technical Assistance (USS0.7 million). Under this
component, the project will invest in TA and training for skills development and capacity building
for the MSEs. Training envisaged under this component includes entrepreneurial skills such as
financial management, marketing, business strategy development, improving production processes,
and project design. Where assessments show that benefits may be yielded from an intensified level
of cooperation between producers, TA will facilitate formation of groups and the establishment of
related management systems. Groups will also be provided with the necessary skills to assess

market developments by themselves, so that they are enabled to adjust their business activities in
the future and after the end of this project. IOM's partner FT Link and KADM, as well as other
service providers, will work with IOM to provide the expertise required to assist MSEs under this
component.

15.     Component VI - Project Management and Monitoring and Evaluation (USS1.1
million). Under this component the project will finance all costs associated with management,
implementation, and supervision of the project incurred by the IOM. This covers the costs of
fiduciary and other office staff, travel costs, ofice rent, communications,etc. Of this amount about
USfi0.3 million will be for monitoring and evaluation. This includes IOM's organizationoverhead
charge of US$0.2 million (5 percent of the total estimated costs).

16.     A robust M&E strategy will ensure program quality and learning. The project will be
monitored internally by the Project Manager using a Results Framework and through the
deployment of field-based monitoring assistants to enable corrective action, project adjustment and
to be able to present detailed reports on progress to program stakeholderson a regular basis. Two
Quality Control (QC) officers will provide an additional layer of monitoring and accountability.
The QC officers will focus particularly on beneficiary eligibility, quality of the training outputs of
partners and technical quality and safety in construction projects.

17.    IOM already has an established Livelihood Database for beneficiary performance tracking
with a comprehensivelivelihoodasset and income profile of each beneficiary. The databasewill be
expanded and used as a key management tool for the proposed Project. IOM will closely follow
the development of the supported MSEs throughout the life-cycle of the Project through field visits
by trained IOM field staff. Success criteria for each supported business and benchmarks, as
determined in the relevant business plan agreed with the beneficiaries, will be assessed by IOM
teams. The results will help IOM decide on additional or corrective measures and trouble shooting

1.      International Organization for Migration (IOM) is the leading organization working with
migrants and governments to provide responses to migration challenges. IOM's global program
budget for 2005 exceeded US$952 million, fimding over 1,600 active programs. IOM has been
engaged in assisting people in emergency situations around the world in both natural and man-
made disasters and is operationallycapable of deliveringboth immediate and sustainable assistance
to affected people. IOM operations in Indonesia started in 1979 and have expanded significantly
since then. In 2006, IOM Indonesia's operational budget amounted to US$85 million. The
Mission employs over 30 international and 550 national staff and is now IOM's biggest mission in
the world. The organization's global expertise in disaster assistance and early recovery enabled it
to respond immediately and provide life-saving emergency assistance and shelter to the victims of
the Tsunami-affectedpopulation in Aceh and the earthquake in Central Java (includingthrough the
JRF financed Yogyakarta and CentralJava EarthquakeRoof Structure Project). Today, IOM's core
sector activities in Aceh and Central Java are shelter provision, health services and livelihood
recovery for natural disaster and conflict-affectedcommunities.

2.      In Aceh, IOM has to date assisted more than 8,000 households in disaster and conflict
affected communities, through rehabilitation of income-generating infrastructure, replacement of
productive assets, provision of training and establishment of saving and loans cooperatives. IOM
employs an integrated, demand-driven approach, working with beneficiaries to enable them to
develop and manage their own micro and small enterprises. Fifteen female-led cooperatives
(Kopwans) have so far been established in 13 districts, with a further four new cooperatives and a
province-wide umbrella cooperative currently being developed. In doing so, IOM adapted the
model developed by the East Java Women's Central Cooperative (Pusat Koperasi Wanita Jawa
Timur-Puskowanjati) which has successfully supported the establishment and maintenance of 45
primary cooperatives with over 45,000 members in East Java. This approach is centered on the
empowerment of women and creating an enabling an environment for women to manage and
directly benefit from the establishment of cooperatives. Recognizing that fixed assets have been
lost or destroyed due to the displacement, conflict and natural disaster, IOM has replaced assets, or
provided necessary basic tools to enable households to re-start or start new livelihoods. In order to
benefit, communitiesmust participate in market surveys, identify livelihoods and undertake training
in relevant technical skills as well as basic micro-enterprise development and management. Where
lacking physical infrastructure was identified as hampering the development of livelihoods, IOM
has also rehabilitated a range of small scale infrastructure, including bridges, irrigation canals,
communal storage facilities and reservoirs. To date over 6,000 households in 44 villages across 12
districts have benefited from these initiatives.

3.      The strategy employed and tested in Aceh was later on adapted for IOM's livelihood
projects in Central Java. This approach has been proven to be effective in re-establishing the
livelihoods of both displaced populations and host communities, drawing on the skills, energy and
aspirations ofindividuals, and enabling them to address their most immediate needs, as well as
providing longer term opportunities.

4.     As one of the first agencies involved in the emergency response in Central Java, IOM
successfully shifted its focus from shelter provision to livelihood recovery and is currently
implementing three livelihood projects targeting 1,400 beneficiaries funded by the Queensland
Government and AusAid through its implementing partner RI-IK.IOM's proven track record and
experience in assisting affected populations in recovering their livelihoods, both in Yogyakarta,
Aceh and elsewhere, its managerial and operational capacity, the extensive knowledge gained in
directly working with the earthquake affected communities in Central Java and its understanding
and knowledge of the livelihood situation as well as the core players involved, provides IOM with
the necessary set of skills and knowledge as well as-the required capacity to further assist the
livelihoodrecovery of earthquakeaffected communitiesin CentralJava.

5.     IOM carried out a Lessons Learned Workshop with beneficiaries and Government
stakeholders to assess impact and relevance of the assistance provided through the Queensland
project. Some lessons coming out of the workshop are summarized:

       a. The business cluster approachwas effective in enabling IOM to utilize economiesof
           scale in distributionand in the design of trainings. In addition, supportinga cluster of
           producers reduced the risk associated with socialjealousies since it became feasible to
          justify why certain sectionsof the communitywhere excluded from assistance. The
           approach also led to beneficiaries taking initiativeto from producer groups in several
           cases;

       b. The traditional communitygotong royong structurewas an important asset since support
           and leadershipof community leaders facilitated smooth implementation.Gotongroyong
           initiatives assisted in materials distribution reducing costs to the project. Importantly,
          the community contributionshelped to share risk between IOM and the community,
           leading to communityownershipand sustainability;

       c. The project had an emphasis on capacity building so not to create dependence,market
          distortion or undermine local community initiatives. Some groups in the project
          participated exclusively in trainings only and did not receive any assets. The positive
          response fromthese beneficiariesdemonstratesthe feasibility and need of a capacity
          buildingapproach in communities,rather than an overemphasison assets and
          distributionwhich may only create adverse effects for the longer-term reconstruction
          process;

       d. The market access initiativesunder the project were effective in exposing producers to
          markets and competitors,creating an understandingof current prices and trends, quality
          expectationsand ultimately influencing the "mindset" of producers and businesses to
          become more competitiveand flexiblein meeting market requirements;

       e. The project assisted beneficiariesto add value to their products in order to developa
          higher priced product range. Product diversification effortsneed to be accompanied
          with technical assistanceto market the product and identify buyers. In the short-term,
          beneficiaries under the project are able to produce new products but had difficulties in
          immediately penetratingmarkets.

f. Quick restoration of basic livelihood infrastructurethrough provision of assets (such as
  the fish ponds) has the potential of creating extremelypositive psychological impacts on
   communitiespreparing them to transition into longer-term livelihood rehabilitation. The
   same can be said about communities' overall ability to cope with the aftermath of the
  disaster and their readiness to actively contributeto the recovery process as such.
   Beneficiaries explained to IOM that this type of assistance helped to build up the self-
   confidence and optimism needed for them to make further investments into their
   livelihood activity and take the risks associated with restarting income-generationand
  organizing into producer groups. Nevertheless, quickly shifting from asset interventions
  towards long-term livelihood developmentwill help to avoid dependence and the
  emergence of a 'hand-out mentality' in the community;

g. Beneficiaries need assistance in establishing links with local Government which was
   viewed by the beneficiaries as passive in certain locations. IOM facilitated interaction
   between communities and the local Government for certain issues; in the future more
   attention may be given to this priority for example by guaranteeing some form of
   Government engagement in every sub-project implemented;

h. Targeting and selection of beneficiaries should be a community-basedprocess through
  proposals or community selection. IOM field tested various strategies and found that
   selection processes driven by village level oficials were prone to bias and favoritism.
   The three day complaints mechanism managed mitigate this risk.

i. Promotion of sustainable agriculture techniques needs a longer-term perspective in order
  for progress to be measurable and to be able         an assessment whether the
  approaches applied are suitable in the local context.

1.      PT. Permodalan Nasional Madani (Persero)or PNM is a state-ownedenterprisewith BI and
Ministry of Finance as shareholders. It was established in 1999through Presidential Decree No. 38
for the specific purpose of developmentand empowering MSME in Indonesia. PNM servesas a
wholesaler and alternative financialinstitution, so it can be more nimble and flexible in developing
Indonesia's MSME. It comprisesthe following main business units:

        Micro-Financeand Syariah Financial Institutions;
        "Kredit Program" or Programmed Credits, taking over BI's twelve direct lending schemes;
        PNM Venture Capital,
        PNM Investment Management, establishedto build up products that can channel funds to
        local developmentprojects such as for instancethe probable establishment of Aceh Fund.

2.      As a strategy for the development of MSME, PNM pursues the strategy of MFI
development (MFIs such as (i) BPRs, which are "Rural Banks" (Bank Perkreditan Rakyat, BPR) or
(ii) formal or informal cooperatives)based on the followingreasons:

        Local MSME cannot develop in a sustainableway without the existence of local MFI in
        which to channel local savings into local economicdevelopment;
        With local MFI various local customs and traditions can be utilized to safeguard the
        creditworthinessof any credit extension;

3.      In many cases in Indonesia, MFI are a local initiative, and as such, it involves a lot of local
community participation in the attendant business activities.
