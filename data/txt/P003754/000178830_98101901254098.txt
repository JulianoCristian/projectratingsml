INDONESIA
FERTILIZER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Indonesia with a population of about 130 million growing at 2.4%
per year, has one of the lowest fertilizer application rates in Southeast
Asia, and its food gap in 1974 was estimated at about 2 million tons of rice.
Thus there is an urgent need for increased use of fertilizer. The discovery
of abundant natural gas reserves has put Indonesia in a position to produce
nitrogen fetilizer economically from its own feedstocks while imports of
phosphate and potash fertilizers will still be required. In this connect-
ion a second fertilizer expansion project comprising the addition of a
570,000 ton per year urea production unit to the existing capacity of 480,000
tons was recently approved by the Bank for P.T. Pupuk Sriwidjaja (PUSRI), a
state owned fertilizer company (Loan No. 1089-IND). Demand for nitrogen
phosphate and potash is projected to increase more than twofold from about
800,000 product tons in 1972 to some 1.9 million product tons in 1978. As
it proved difficult and costs to move the fertilizer in recent years, due to
the underdeveloped and deteriorated transport system, it would be impossible
to distribute and store the anticipated larger volumes of fertilizers without
a significant upgrading of the present system.
ii.       A fertilizer distribution system has therefore been planned with
a total capacity of about 1.4 million tons of fertilizer annually of which
some 830,000 tons will be bulk and 130,000 tons bagged urea from PUSRI's
Palembang plants; 370,000 tons of imported TSP and NPK; and 100,000 tons of
imported urea. The system includes intermodal transport comprising (a) three
self-unloading ships; (b) expansion of existing, and construction of additional,
water-side bulk fertilizer terminals and bagging plants; (c) construction
of 59 inland bagged fertilizer storage depots on Java, Sumatera, and on
other islands, to be served by rail and road, or road only; (d) procurement
of 175 railway wagons, four mainline and three shunting locomotives and
construction of railway spurs at 27 inland storage depots (ISDs) in Java;
(e) construction and procurement of office space and procurement of vehicles;
(f) provision of consultant services and technical assistance related to
construction and operation of the distribution system; and (g) a study de-
signed to develop a National Fertilizer Distribution System using the project
as a basis.
iii.      The above system would cost US$130 million.  The proposed Bank
loan of US$68 million would provide about 48.6% of the total estimated
financing requirements ($140 million including interest during construction)
or 75% of the estimated foreign exchange requirements of US$90.4 million.
The balance of the total financing, would be provided by the Government as
equity, except for US$2 million, as a loan. The project would be executed
by PUSRI with the assistance of consultants. PUSRI is the largest and most
efficient distributor of locally produced and imported fertilizer in Indonesia;
its shares are wholly owned by the Government.



- ii -
iv.       Initially, bulk shipments of urea will be made by the three
special self-unloading ships from Palembang to Tanjung Priok, Surabaya and
Cilacap in Java, and to Belawan and subsequently Padang in Sumatera. The
product will be bagged at the port bulk terminals for shipment in railway
cars by block trains, or by highway trucks to the ISDs. Onward distribu-
tion from these depots to the villages will be undertaken by PUJSRI'e dis-
tributors. Shipment of bagged TSP, NPK and urea fertilizer to smaller
markets will continue with the present system of using small cargo ships
and the inland distribution will be done via the new ISDs.
v.        The project is closely related to the Second Fertilizer Expansion
Project-PUSRI III, (Loan 1089-IND) which will be completed in 1977 when the
new fertilizer distribution system is also planned to commence operations.
The project will distribute PUSRI's output of urea and the other fertilizers
handled by the company. The project has also been designed so that it could
serve as a basis for a national fertilizer distribution system which is to
be studied. Assurances have been given by the Government that pending the
findings of the study any major distribution facilities proposed during the
interim period will not contribute to underutilization of the proposed land
facilities, so that regardless of the source of supply and possible changes
in marketing areas, the system will not become redundant. It will be
utilized to full capacity by PUSRI or other distributors. Thisi is important
in view of Government's plans to build a urea fertilizer plant in West Java
in addition to a urea plant presently under construction in East Kalimantan.
However since construction of both these plants is delayed and under review
the Government plans a further extension of Palembang similar to PUSRI III.
Further capacity may be added during 1980's by building another plant in
East Kalimantan and one in Northern Sumatera.
vi.       Procurement of all equipment originating outside Indonesia will
be made in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement". All
contracts involving such procurement of over US$100,000 equivalent will be
submitted to the Bank for its approval prior to award. A 15% local preference
or the import duty whichever is less, will be allowed for qualified Indo-
nesian manufacturers who provide at least 20% value added. All civil works
will be undertaken by PUSRI's engineering department which will employ
qualified local contractors under procedures satisfactory to the Bank. Civil
engineering and marine consultants have been appointed.
vii.      The project is economically justified.  The new transport and
distribution system would enable PUSRI to handle Indonesia's rapidly in-
creasing fertilizer demand and it would generate benefits from a reduction
in transport operating costs and fertilizer losses. The economic rate of
return for the project is about 20%. It reflects the inefficiencies of the
present distribution system and the urgent need to improve it in view of
the much higher tonnage to be moved. Moreover, farmers would aLso benefit
from the increased reliability and quality of fertilizer supplites. Sensi-
tivity analysis shows that under various conceivable pessimistic assumptions
such as project capital cost increases, benefit decreases and underutiliza-
tion of capacity the project would still yield a satisfactory economic
return of at least 13%.



- iii -
viii.     The Government is arranging for PUSRI to stockpile imported fer-
tilizer in view of the current world supply situation. It has agreed that
it will meet all costs connected with such operations. PUSRI's accounts and
balance sheets will record separately the transactions involved in stock-
piling, which are therefore excluded from the financial projections and
which are based on PUSRI's normal operations.
ix.       Currently the existing marketing price margin is insufficient to
cover distribution costs, including interest on short-term borrowings re-
quired to finance the large working capital required for PUSRI's normal
marketing operations even with the cost of short-term borrowing to finance
and handle the stockpile assumed by the Government. However, despite a
projected increase in price levels due to inflation, with the reduced unit
costs arising from the project, and a rapid run down of short-term borrowings
for PUSRI's normal operations, with the help of surplus cash generated by
PUSRI's production unit, the present margin will be sufficient to enable
PUSRI to earn an adequate return on its assets and to achieve acceptable
current, liquid and debt/equity ratios.
x.        The project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$68
million to the Government of Indonesia for a term of 15-1/2 years, including
3-1/2 years of grace. The proposed loan would be relent to PUSRI by the
Government for the same term but at 12% interest per annum.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Indonesia has requested the Bank to assist in
financing the foreign exchange cost of a new fertilizer distribution system
for the Government-owned fertilizer company, P.T. Pupuk Sriwidjaja (PUSRI).
The project is designed to distribute the total output of PUSRI's plants at
Palembang, Sumatera, throughout Indonesia, including that of the PUSRI III
plant presently under construction and financed by a Bank loan (1089-IND
signed February 28, 1975). The project will also handle imported and locally
produced TSP and NPK fertilizers which are or will be distributed in Indonesia
by PUSRI.
1.02      The estimated total cost of the project would be US$130 million
and the foreign exchange content US$84 million; the proposed loan would pro-
vide US$68 million or 81% of the estimated foreign exchange cost, the bal-
ance and all local currency would be provided by the Government of Indonesia.
The Bank loan will be to the Government of Indonesia for 15-1/2 years with
3-1/2 years grace. All but US$2.5 million equivalent of the loan will be
relent to PUSRI for the same term at 12% p.a. interest, with the balance
made available to the Indonesian State Railways (PJKA) as equity for the
purchase of locomotives.
1.03      In the transport field, there have been one previous credit to
Indonesia for an Inter-Island Fleet Rehabilitation Project, 318-IND, three
for highways, 154-IND, 260-IND, and 388-IND, as well as a loan for railways,
1005-IND. Further projects for highways and shipping have been appraised.
While cost increases have reduced the number of ships it has been possible
to rehabilitate under the shipping project and progress on all projects has
been slow, no major difficulties have arisen in project execution.
1.04      This report is based on a number of marketing studies commissioned
by PUSRI and in particular that of consultants, Agrar-und Hydrotechnik
(Federal Republic of Germany) and the findings of an appraisal mission
in November/December 1974 composed of Messrs. G. Bain (shipping specialist),
F. Chapman (financial analyst), D. Havlicek (economist) and F. Higginbottom
(engineer) with assistance from Research Planning Consultants (UK).
II. BACKGROUND
A.   The Transport Sector
General
2.01      The Indonesian transport system depends chiefly upon inter-island
marine services as well as upon highways and railways. The marine services
comprise Regular Liner Services (RLS) between specified ports as well as un-
scheduled (tramping) services and ocean going shipping. Land transport is
well developed in Java with an extensive railway and highway network, where-
as in Sumatera railways have only been developed in some parts, and the road
network only provides the basic links between principal cities. On



the other islands, except for a small railway on Madura, facilities are
limited to a few roads in areas around ports and towns. Air transport
volume is still small but has increased rapidly in the last few years.
2.02      The Government's strategy as set forth in the Second Five Year
Plan (Repelita II) is to continue the rehabilitation program for infra-
structure including the gradual upgrading of the country's existing transport
facilities. This will be supplemented by the provision of nelw infrastructure
for (i) exploitation of newly discovered resources, (ii) support of the
Government's regional policies and (iii) improvement of rural transport
infrastructure.
2.03      It is estimated that about Rp 1,806 billion (US$4.4 billion), in
1973 constant prices, will be spent by the public and private sector for
investments in transport infrastructure and equipment during the period
1974-1979. Of this total about 44% (Rp 801 billion) would be spent by the
private sector, primarily for transport equipment. The Government transport
developmental budget and project aid comprise about 43% (Rp 781 billion)
of the total estimated transport investment expenditure, of which the largest
single expenditure would be for highways. The balance of 13% (Rp 224 bil-
lion) would be spent by provincial or local governments and public sector
enterprises for transport infrastructure and equipment. It seems unlikely
that all of these plans can be achieved in the period, though substantial
progress will be made. A re-assessment of Repelita II targets is currently
underway by the Government, and a transport sector brief is under prepara-
tion within the Bank.
Transport Planning
2.04      Although only two ministries, Works and Power in the case of high-
ways and the Ministry of Communications for other modes, are responsible
for transport investment proposals, which are then reviewed by the National
Planning Council (BAPPENAS), selection of projects in recent years has been
made in a rather haphazard manner. This is partly because of a lack of
qualified technical staff, particularly at the operating level, to prepare.
evaluate and rank investment priorities. The Government retained a group
of consultants between 1969 and 1973 to assist BAPPENAS and the Ministry
of Communications in transport planning. These consultants have contributed
in collecting and analyzing transport data and setting up procedures for
investment project review. However, it will be some years before the
Government has sufficient local staff and therefore some outside expert
assistance continues to be necessary. The Government has retained five
advisors for the Ministry of Communications, initially with two year con-
tracts covering transport coordination, investment programming, pricing
and accounting, financed by the Bank's Fourth Technical Assistiance credit
(451-IND).
Road Transport
2.05      The highway network consists of about 82,000 km of all standards;
only about 15,000 are paved. Village access roads and agricultural feeder



-3-
roads are generally inadequate. In 1974 the road transport fleet totaled
some 500,000 vehicles of which about 150,000 were trucks. The truck fleet
is expected to double during the period 1974-78.
2.06      Road transport is most intensively developed in Java, where a
number of roads carry in excess of 2,000 vehicles per day. Sumatera has
about the same total length of roads, but fewer vehicles. The two islands
together account for about 60% of the highway network and 80% of the
vehicles in the country. After years of neglect, the present Government
has emphasized rehabilitation of the road network; this work was supported
under the first IDA credit for highways (154-IND). The Government is now
planning improvement and betterment of almost 12,000 km of roads with
primary emphasis on pavement strengthening; the proposed fourth highway
project recently appraised is based on this program.
Railways
2Q07      Railways are confined (with one minor exception in Madura) to
two islands, about 4,700 km on Java and 2,000 km on Sumatera.  The system
was developed to its present size during the 70 years prior to World War II,
at which time there were six separate systems and 40% of the network was
owned privately; nationalization took place in the 1940's and 1950's. The
railways which were built to move primary products to foreign markets,
suffered with declining exports in the 1950's and 1960's and, as with most
public infrastructure in Indonesia, they were allowed to deteriorate. The
Bank has helped finance a comprehensive program of rehabilitation and tech-
nical assistance for the Indonesian State Railways (Loan 1005-IND) which is
at present being initiated.
Ports and Shipping
2.08      The country has about 300 ports spread over the archipelago, but
the large traffic volumes are concentrated in 10 ports in Java, Sumatera,
Sulawesi and Kalimantan. Port procedures present probably the most serious
impediment to transport flows in Indonesia and improvements thereto could
result in significant increases in port throughput and reduction in shipping
costs. However, major changes will take a long time. Studies of short-
term port requirements have been completed with assistance from consultants,
NEDECO (Netherlands), and main ports are being improved with assistance
from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), UIDP, the Netherlands and Japan.
Master plans for three ports in Java and Sumatera are being financed by
UNDP with the ADB as executing agency. A master plan study of Tanjung Priok
(Jakarta), the largest general cargo port (about 30% of total traffic),
is being carried out by consultants, Swan Wooster & Co. (Canada), financed
under IDA Technical Assistance Credits (216-IND and 275-IND); this is expected
to result in the pre-appraisal of a port project later this year.
2.09      The inter-island shipping fleet, both RLS and tramping, suffered
from the same neglect as other modes of transport and an IDA Credit (318-IND)
in 1972 of US$8.5 million equivalent was designed to assist in the rehabili-
tation of the RLS fleet; this credit is expected to be fully committed



-4 -
by the end of 1975, at which time 59 ships (79,000 dwt), representing about
one half of the project tonnage, will have been upgraded. Large cost
increases, further neglect and poor enforcement of safety rules are respon-
sible for the short fall. A major study of inter-island shipping has also
been undertaken by consultaLts, Maritime Research Centre (Netherlands), finan-
ced under bilateral aid. Based in part upon this, a proposed second project
was appraised by the Bank in November 1974 to continue the rehabilitation
and to assist in the replacement of the existing fleet.
River Transrt
2.10      Commercial river transport extends to 10,000 km of navigable
waterway in Kalimantan, Sumatera and West Irian and the Citandui River in
Java. Fourteen rivers totalling 4,000 km in Kalimantan and Sumatera were
recently studied by consultants, Research and Development (Belgium), and
the Government is considering possible navigational improvements. The
most important river transport traffic is logs.
Pipelines
2.11      Pipelines are under the control of the state-owned oLl company,
PERTAMINA. There is presently only one oil pipeline in operation, a 27 km
12" products line. Another 420 km in Java are under construction or planned
and are expected to divert some traffic from road and rail (some 380,000
tons of oil from rail by 1976). A gas gathering pipeline system was finan-
ced by the Association in 1972 in Sumatera to supply gas for the PUSRI II
fertilizer plant and will be extended to supply PUSRI III. Another gas
line is under construction in Java to supply gas for the proposed West Java
fertilizer plant at Jatibarang and a steel plant near Merak (Map 11422).
Aviation
2.12      There are 47 airports (seven for international traffic) and
facilities vary widely. Major deficiencies, as identified in a recent
study by consultants, Aviation Planning Services (Canada), are weak runways,
insufficient runway length and inadequacy of navigational equipment. The
greatest needs are for equipment, and bilateral finance is likely to
be available to support these purchases. A study to prepare a master plan
for Jakarta International Airport is underway.
B.   The Fertilizer Market
Present
2.13      The present fertilizer market in Indonesia is characterized by
(a) a deficit of local fertilizer production and consequent heavy reliance
on imports, (b) rationing and distribution control of fertilizer by Govern-
ment, (c) a Government controlled pricing and subsidy system to stabilize
prices and promote usage, (d) heavy reliance on nitrogen fertilizers,
(e) predominance of the rice crop in fertilizer consumption (70% of all



- 5 -
nitrogen and 60% of all phosphate consumption), and (g) low overall use of
fertilizer. Only 30% of total harvested land in Indonesia (44% of total
harvested land in Java) is fertilized.
2.14      Those aspects of the fertilizer market which are pertinent to
the appraisal of the proposed distribution project are summarized below.
A more detailed market analysis is given in the Bank's appraisal of the
Second Fertilizer Expansion Project-PUSRI III (Report No. 624-IND) and
Annex 1 of this Report, which is the source for the subsequent data.
Future Trends
2.15      Indonesia is engaged in an intensive import substitution program
for fertilizer and is accelerating this program on account of the scarcity
of fertilizer on world markets and consequent high prices. The Government
has also created a national fertilizer stock pile held by PUSRI. The
discovery in recent years of abundant natural gas reserves, which are an
economic feedstock for nitrogen fertilizers provides the basis for the
expansion of fertilizer production. Thus the annual production of nitrogen
fertilizer is projected to increase about fourfold to some 2.0 million tons
by 1983 when three additional plants will be in commercial production:
(a) PIJSRI III, now being financed by the Bank, (b) East Kalimantan I, and
(c) West Java. However, the latter two projects are presently being reviewed
and are not expected to be in operation before 1980. The Government there-
fore plans to proceed immediately with a further expansion of PUSRI by
duplicating PUSRI III, as the fastest and most economic way to close the
gap in nitrogen fertilizer supply in 1979. At that time it should be pos-
sible for the Government to relax or abolish the rationing system now in
force for fertilizer. The Government plans to build a 300,000 TPY, TSP plant
at Gresik and is considering another TSP plant at Cilacap, both on Java.
The balance of phosphate requirements and potash fertilizers will continue
to be imported.
2.16      Consumption of nitrogen fertilizers in Indonesia increased by
15.5% p.a. from 108,200 nutrient tons 1/ in 1964 to 443,000 in 1974 and
is forecast by the Bank to grow at 11.6% p.a. up to 1978 and by 7% p.a.
thereafter to a level of about 826,000 nutrient tons (1.8 million product
tons) in 1983. Phosphate and potash fertilizer consumption grew at 15.8%
and 11.9% p.a. during the period 1964 to 1974 to a level of 114,600 nutrient
tons and 17,200 nutrient tons, respectively; consumption of these fertilizers
is expected to grow more rapidly than nitrogen fertilizers (expected rates
of increase being 18.3% and 26.0% p.a. in 1974-78, and 18.6% and 18.4% p.a.
in 1978-83) because the consumption per ha is projected to increase about
tenfold from the present level (which is the lowest of all Southeast Asian
countries), whereas nitrogen consumption will increase only twofold. Thus
the ratio of nitrogen, phosphate and potash consumption will improve from
the 1974 level of 3.9:1:0.15 to a more balanced nutrient level of 2.4:1:0.84
in 1983.
1/   Nutrient tons:  Calculated on the basis of nutrient content in fert-
tilizer materials.



-6-
2.17      Consumption projections presented in this report are most likely
on the conservative side. The present rationing system understates actual
demand, which could develop much faster, if the Government, as a result of
increased local production and of considerably lower import prices, expected
to prevail by the end of the decade, should abandon rationing. Whether and
to what extent nitrogen fertilizer would become available for export,
depends on the timing and performance of the new plants referred to above.
However, production costs are relatively low and Indonesia enjoys a compara-
tive transport cost advantage; it could be in a favorable position to meet
the expected nitrogen fertilizer deficits of such countries as Mlalaysia,
Thailand, Philippines, Vietnam and India.
C.   The Distribution of Fertilizer
2.18      Fertilizer distribution is carried out by Government approved
importers/distributors including local fertilizer producers like PUSRI and
PETROKIMIA; until 1970, the Government owned company P.N. Pertani was the
leading distributor of both local and imported fertilizers (para. 3.05).
However, in recent years, the Government has been encouraging domestic pro-
ducers to market their own products as well as imported fertilizers while
allowing P.N. Pertani, and until recently, PERTANINA, and other established
importers/distributors to continue their operations. As the local produc-
tion of fertilizers has so far been low (about 240,000 product tons in
1974), the marketing network in Indonesia has depended heavily on imports.
The following table shows the distribution of fertilizer by types and main
marketing organizations in 1972:
Distribution of Fertilizer. 1972

PERTAMINA                              85         11.0    81         39.9

/1   Urea and nitrogen content of fertilizers.
2.19      PUSRI's market share in nitrogen, phosphate and potash fertilizers
was 48% (592,000 product tons) of the total fertilizer consumption of 1.2
million product tons in 1974 and it expects to distribute about 1.4 million
product tons (about 600,000 nutrient tons) of fertilizer annually from 1978
to 1982 (para 3.08), partly from its own production, partly purchased from



-7-
other domestic producers or imported (para. 4.01). This compares with a
total prospective demand for fertilizers in 1978 of some 1.9 million product
tons (about 858,000 nutrient tons), increasing to 2.8 million product tons
(1e3 million nutrient tons) in 1982 and it suggests a gradual decrease of
PUSRI's share in the fertilizer market from the 1978 peak of some 70%
to about 50% in 1982 as domestic production of nitrogen fertilizer by
other producers increases and consumption of fertilizer expands from the
present low levels. However this will depend upon the times at which in-
creased production becomes available. It is expected that Government will
gradually cease to intervene in fertilizer distribution and once the present
shortages are overcome market shares will eventually be determined by market
forces. The implications of shifting markets for PUSRI and the proposed
project, and safeguards against possible adverse effects are discussed
(paras. 3.08, 3.09 and 4.06).
Pricing Policy
2.20      The Government controls not only fertilizer distribution but also
fertilizer prices both for production and distribution. The main purpose
of price control is to subsidize fertilizer sales to farmers and keep food
grain prices low, in an effort to check inflation which has been a serious
problem in Indonesia. However, since the production price is fixed on the
basis of delivery, c.i.f. in Java and the distribution margin is insufficient
to cover costs and financing of working capital involved, these arrangements
cause difficulties because under the rationing system previously mentioned
independent wholesalers to whom PUSRI used to sell its urea against cash
have now become agents whom PUSRI has to pay for their services. PUSRI has
to pre-finance the distribution of fertilizer from the port to the sub-
distributor, and is only credited for its sales after the farmer's payment
(in cash or through credit vouchers) is received by Bank Rakayat Indonesia
(BRI). This system applies not only to PUSRI's own fertilizer but also to
fertilizer imported by it on behalf of the Government (in 1974 about three
times PUSRI's sold output) and has led to excessive receivables and invent-
ories, part of which represent the Government's stockpiling program. This
is discussed further in Chapter 6 and Annex 1. However the availability of
cash generated by PUSRI as a whole, after PUSRI III comes on stream, will
enable the short-term debts currently resulting from distribution costs to
be eliminated about 1978, excluding those due to stockpiling.
III. THE COMPANY AND ITS MARKETING ORGANIZATION
A.   Organization, Management, and Personnel
3.01      PUSRI is one of Indonesia's best-managed large industrial enter-
prises. Its management structure, in keeping with Indonesia's Company Law,
is patterned after the European two-tier model, and has a supervising board



-8-
called the Board of Commissioners 1/ (Dewan Komisaris) and a Management
Board (Direksi). Managerial responsibility for PUSRI's day-to--day opera-
tions rests in the four-man management board, consisting of a President-
Director and three Directors, technical and production, finances, and com-
mercial. They and the Board of Commissioners are appointed by the Government.
3.02      Management and operation of the distribution network are the re-
sponsibility of the PUSRI marketing department, under the marketing manager,
which is operated as a separate cost center and reports to the commercial
director; planning, coordination and supervision will be handled by a supply/
distribution manager reporting to the marketing manager and responsible for
bulk terminals, inland depots, shipping and scheduling and the overall oper-
ation of the system to be established by the project. Charts 9344 and 9345
show the organization and responsibilities of PUSRI's marketing department
and its supply and distribution division.
3.03      PUSRI formed a marine operations section in the marketing department
in 1974 with the assistance of a consultant, Mollers Ltd. (Hong Kong), under
the PUSRI II project. PUSRI has five time-chartered, crane-eqtipped ships
which will be scheduled and administered during the next two years to move
about 350,000 tons per year of bulk urea from Palembang to Jakarta, Surabaya
and Cilacap. This should provide adequate experience to enable! PUSRI to
operate the three proposed new ships (para. 4.02), replacing the five pres-
ent ships.
3.04      PUSRI's marketing and distribution personnel are competent and
the company is known as one of the most efficient distributors of fertilizer
in the country. In 1974 about 290 people worked in the marketing and dis-
tribution department. The increase in marketing of fertilizers by 1978
will require an increase of marketing and distribution personnel to about
450 people.
B.  PUSRI Marketing and Distribution
3.05      From inception of production in 1964 up to 1967, PUSRI marketed
its product through P.N. Pertani whose service proved unsatisfactory. In
1968 PUSRI established its own distribution network and since 1971 has
become the most important distributor of fertilizer. However, due to
inadequate shipping, port handling and inland storage facilities, fre-
quent interruptions in the movement of fertilizer were experienced. In
1971 PUSRI appointed marketing consultants, Agrar-und Hydrotechnik (Federal
Republic of Germany), to help develop a marketing and distribution plan in
preparation for the marketing of its output 480,000 tons of urea from PUSRI I
and II plants and for the sales of other fertilizers imported by the company.
3.06      Based on the consultants' recommendation, the company began to
expand its marketing network and established 26 distributors, including
1/   The members of the Board of Commissioners are the Directors-General of:
(i) Monetary Affairs (Ministry of Finance), Chairman; Chemical Indus-
tries (Ministry of Industries); and (iii) Agricultural (Ministry of
Agriculture and Forestry).



P.N. Pertani, serving some 2,000 retail outlets throughout Indonesia.
Urea from the PUSRI I plant is bagged in Palembang and shipped in Regular
Liner Service (RLS) vessels operating between islands, and that from PUSRI
II is shipped in bulk, to achieve economy in transportation costs, in con-
verted coal carriers equipped for unloading fertilizer at the tWo existing
bulk reception stations where the urea is bagged, stored and dispatched
for inland distribution. However, these ships equipped with low performn-
ance grab-cranes, no longer represent an economic solution for fertilizer
bulk shipments; also product losses, estimated at 3%, 2ue both to unloading
methods and inclement weather are comparatively high.  Charter contracts for
these vessels were thus only made for 27 months, or the estimated time re-
quired to implement the proposed project (para. 4.10).
3.07       The network was further expanded in 1973 by using village co-
operatives as retail outlets for the farmers.  With the decision to add
a third fertilizer plant with an additional 570,000 ton capacity to the
existing facilities in Palembang, modification and expansion of existing
marketing and distribution facilities became necessary. The project is
designed to help finance the required transport and storage facilities for
the new system, which is described in Chapter IV and Annex 2.
3.08       Currently, with PUSRI II in production PUSRI's marketing of
imported fertilizers is about equal to its own production; but was four
times greater than its own production in 1974. About 86% of PUSRI's fertil-
izer sales are made in Java; this percentage is expected to decline as PUSRI
increases its sales in other islands of Indonesia, especially Sumatera and
Sulawesi. The following tables show PUSRI's present (1974) and prospective
distribution patterns of urea, TSP and NPK.

department.
The regional distribution of PUSRI's prospective domestic market is based on
its assumption that it will distribute its production entirely domestically
and that any surplus production would be exported by other plants. However,
it is not possible to determine at this stage the prospective market shares
of competing fertilizer producers both with regard to domestic and export
markets, particularly since future marketing and pricing policies for pro-
duction by other plants have not been established. Therefore, it is con-
ceivable that PUSRI may have to export a part of its urea production and
develop new domestic markets. At the request of the Government a study to
consider the establishment of a National Fertilizer Distribution System,
based upon this project, has been included as part of the project; thLs is
expected to resolve these issues. Pending the outcome of the study, the
terms of reference for which will be agreed with the Bank, assurances have
been received from the Government regarding the facilities being provided
under the project (para. 4.06).
3.09      Consideration was also given to the concept of a distribution
company separated legally and organizationally from the PUSRI fertilizer
company. Such a company could have operated on a national scale dis-
tributing fertilizer for PUSRI and other producers. As another option the
possible organization of a Government fertilizer marketing board under
government management was investigated. These options, while theoretically
feasible, are not practical at this stage because PUSRI is the only fertil-
izer distributor in Indonesia with a competent and experienced fertil:izer
marketing organization; further, this organization is so closely integrated
with and supported by PUSRI's commercial and other departments that its
establishment as a separate unit would have severely hampered the implement-
ation of the distribution project. However the proposed study may result
in the adoption of one of these alternatives.



3.10      The basic marketing concept is to improve the service to existing
markets and develop potential markets as efficiently and economically as
possible. To this end PUSRI's consultants designed a marketing strategy
which will complement the agricultural extension services of the Government
such as BIMAS and INMAS programs and which offers the farmer throughout the
year a diversified product line at the local level. Apart from PUSRI's own
urea production it plans to market TSP and NPK fertilizers, pesticides,
fungicides, insecticides, certified seeds and related application equipment.
This strategy will give PUSRI a unique role in the Indonesian agricultural
sector and implementation of the strategy will involve provision of warehouses,
transport (water-rail-road), retail outlets, credit facilities, sales promo-
tion and advertising, agricultural and fertilizer demonstrations and other
marketing activities. Since PUSRI's urea plants at Palembang work on a
continuous basis it is important that the marketing network guarantee an
uninterrupted flow of fertlizer from the production point to the farmer, but
considerable inventory build up in the system is inevitable due to the sea-
sonal nature of demand. Therefore, the PUSRI marketing and distribution de-
partment will organize and supervise the movement by sea from Palembang and
appropriate inland distribution and storage, the physical requirements for
which will be provided under the project (Chapter IV). The storage capa-
city of the distribution system has been designed to provide buffer storage
space for seasonal variations in consumption and as a safeguard against
possible interruption in the transport chain. PUSRI appointed sub-distri-
butors will be responsible for the final movement of the fertilizer to the
village retail level.
3.11      The proposed marketing and distribution system constitutes a sig-
nificant improvement over that existing. However, storage facilities at
the village level need to be improved. Movement of fertilizer during the
wet season is difficult because the rural road network is very poor. Thus,
local retailers and cooperatives must store significant amounts of fertilizer
to ensure adequate availability during the wet season. The Government
realizes the need for more and improved storage capacity in the villages
and is presently sponsoring a pilot project to determine the most suitable
locally produced building materials for storage units under various climatic
and local conditions. This development underlines the Government's concern
to see that a complete distribution and farmers' advisory service is devel-
oped and centered at the village cooperative or BUUD. It is presently
estimated that the provision of local storage units would cost about US$30
million equivalent in local currency. In order to ensure that fertilizer
is available to the farmer in good condition and in sufficient quantities,
the Government confirmed during negotiations that it will continue its
program to extend and improve storage facilities at the village level and
these requirements will be reviewed as part of the National Distribution
System study.
3.12      PUSRI will establish for each of its distributors annual and
monthly sales targets and it will develop an active promotional program
to help achieve these sales objectives. It will assist its distributors,
sub-distributors and retailers in conducting fertilizer demonstrations, field



- 12 -
days on farms and farmer meetings and it will organize advertising campaigns.
These promotional activities will be coordinated with agencies and orga-
nizations dealing with the promotion and development of agricultural pro-
duction. PUSRI and its consultants will organize and conduct periodic
training programs for its own marketing personnel to keep them up-to-date
on marketing and distributior, techniques. It will also provide training
programs for its distributors, sub-distributors and retailers, to help them
develop their markets and achieve their sales objectives.
3.13      Expertise in managing and coordinating the new distribution system
is not yet, however, available within the company and therefore provision
has been made in the proposed loan for the employment of consultants spe-
cializing in management of transportation systems (para. 4.14) until
Indonesian staff can take over.
IV. THE PROJECT
A.   Project Description
4.01      The fertilizer distribution system is designed to handle about
1.4 million product tons annually of which 830,000 tons will be bulk and
130,000 bagged urea ex Palembang, 100,000 tons imported or locally purchased
urea and 370,000 tons of TSP and NPK. It is estimated that by 1978, 70%
of the fertilizer (one million tons) will be distributed in Java, 19%
(270,000 tons) in Sumatera and the balance in other islands (para. 3.08).
After consideration of various transport/distribution cost alternatives,
a combination of ship transport serving five bulk terminals in Java and
Sumatera, and land transport serving the ISDs was determined as the least
cost technically feasible solution. About 90% of the annual volume of urea
from Palembang will be hauled to the bulk terminals in PUSRI's bulk ships;
TSP and NPK will be imported through the Tanjung Priok bulk termLinal; the
bagged fertilizer would continue to be transported by RLS or other inter-island
ships to main ports and thence move to the inland consumption centers via
the new distribution system.
4.02      Based on these considerations PUSRI has planned and the Bank
concurs with a new distribution system which comprises the following items
and forms the project:
(a)  acquisition of three shallow-draft self-unloading
ships, each of about 7,000 deadweight tons (dwt);
(b)  expansion of existing, and construction of additional,
water-side bulk fertilizer terminals and bagging
plants at four major ports in Java and Sumatera by
mid-1977 and at a fifth, also in Sumatera, by mid-1979,
with road and rail access.



- 13 -
(c)  construction of 59 inland bagged fertilizer storage
and distribution depots of from 3,000 tons to 10,000 tons
capacity to be served by rail and road or by road only;
(d) PUSRI will lease an additional 22 existing inland bagged
fertilizer storage depots, each under 2,000 tons capacity,
located in Sumatera, Kalimantan, Sulawesi and other islands;
(e) procurement of 175 railway wagons and four main line
and three shunting locomotives and construction of
railway spurs at 27 inland storage depots in Java;
(f) construction and procurement of office space and
vehicles;
(g) consultant services and technical assistance related to
construction and operation of the distribution system; and
(h)  a study for the development of a National Fertilizer Distri-
bution System based upon this project.
Further details of the project are given in Annex 2 and shown on Maps
IBRD 11220(R) and 11422.
4.03      The distribution system has the capability of moving about one
million tons of urea fertilizer by sea from the PUSRI plants at Palembang,
in South Sumatera, to Java, North and West Sumatera, and to other islands.
Initially, bulk shipments of some 830,000 tons will be made by the self-
unloading ships to Tanjung Priok, Surabaya, and Cilacap in Java (740,000
tons) and Belawan and subsequently Padang in Sumatera (90,000 tons). The
product, which can be unloaded in wet weather with practically no loss,
will be bagged at the port bulk terminals for shipment in railway cars by
block trains, or by highway trucks, to inland storage depots (ISDs).
Onward distribution from these depots will be undertaken by PUSRI
distributors who will move the urea to forward storage kiosks owned
by cooperatives and retailers at the villages.
4.04      The bulk ships will also have a capacity for back hauling bulk,
TSP and NPK urea produced at other Indonesian plants. It is anticipated
that such movements are likely to commence about 1980 following completion
of the proposed study and other plants coming into production. Export
from Indonesia using these ships will also be possible if and when markets
develop and the scheduling of voyages permits. Shipments in bags from
Palembang to small markets and ports where larger ships cannot enter, will
continue using small cargo ships.
4.05      In order to ensure a well coordinated and smoothly working dis-
tribution system all the assets except locomotives will be owned by PUSRI.
The Indonesian State Railways (PJKA) will own the locomotives and use them
in their pool but will operate PUSRI owned wagons solely in the fertilizer
traffic, under an operating and maintenance contract with PUSRI. During



- 14 -
negotiations, the Government agreed to pass on the cost of the locomotives
to PJKA as equity because financial problems do not permit it to assulme this
as debt; PUSRI also agreed to conclude an operating and maintenance contract
with PJKA for PUSRI's rolling stock. Road transport will be handled by
private operators who are now satisfactorily handling the bulk of PUSRI's
inland transport requirements. The existing private truck fleet is suffi-
cient to haul the volume of fertilizer projected for road transport. PUSRI
will consider leasing or selling the ISDs to its distributors as soon as
they are in a financial position to do this.
4.06      Additional fertilizer plants are expected to be on stream about
1980 (para. 2.15) and the National Fertilizer Distribution System study
will be completed by 1976 so that, depending upon the dates production is
available from the new plants, PUSRI's Java market may be reduced. Hlowever,
no matter what may be the source, urea will still have to be distribulted
down to the village level, and the distribution system being provided by
the proposed project will serve this purpose and the proposed study will
be based thereon. Assurances have been given by Government, and were con-
firmed during negotiations that pending the results of the study any major
distribution facilities proposed during the interim period will not con-
tribute to underutilization of the proposed land facilities.
4.07      The existing bulk fertilizer handling facility in Tanjung Priok
harbor will be improved and used by PUSRI as its bulk port depot. Arrange-
ments have been made with P.T. Pertamina Gulf (PGIP), the owner of exiisting
bulk unloading facilities within the harbor, for PUSRI to erect speciial
reception conveyors in the existing buildings of PGIP and for PGIP to
operate and maintain them and bag and ship-out fertilizers on PUSRI's be-
half.  This facility would be used to receive and bag phosphate fertilizer to
be imported. Assurances have been obtained during negotiations that con-
tracts covering the matters described above will be signed and that 1the
Government will cause PGIP to permit PUSRI to erect facilities designed by
PUSRI and to conclude a cost-based operating and maintenance contract: with
PUSRI covering the facilities at Jakarta. The Port Authority has agreed
that PUSRI's ships will have priority for berthing.
B.   Cost Estimate and Financing Plan
4.08      Total estimated project cost is US$130 million equivalent
(Rp 54,000 million) including US$84 million foreign exchange (64%). The
proposed loan of US$68 million equivalent (Rp 28,000 million) would be
made to the Government, which would bear the foreign exchange risk. The
Government will provide the balance of the project cost and will also
finance interest during construction of about US$10 million equivalent
including US$6.4 million payable in foreign exchange. Total financing
requirements would thus be US$140 million of which the proposed loan would
contribute 48.5%. About US$2.5 million of the proposed loan would be made
available to Indonesia State Railway (PJKA) as equity for purchase of loco-
motives and the balance relent to PUSRI on 15-1/2 years repayment terms
including 3-1/2 years of grace with an annual interest rate of 12%. Govern-
ment's contribution would be passed on as equity so that the financing of



- 15 -
PUSRI's project would be about half debt and half equity. No working capital
is provided as PUSRI is expected either to use its own cash generation or
to obtain short-term credits. These arrangements have been confirmed during
negotiations and will be incorporated into a subsidiary financing agreement
between the Government and PUSRI. The cost estimates have been revised to
include the contract price for ship acquisition. Details of capital costs
are given in Table 1, and are summarized below:

4.09      Ship costs are from contracts awarded by PUSRI (para. 4.10) at
fixed prices in Yen (US$1.00 = 287.36 Y). Price contingencies were taken
at 18% p.a. for rail equipment, with deliveries stretching out for 1-1/2
years. For the foreign component of land based equipment a price allowance
was made at 14, 12, 10 and 8% p.a. while locally secured equipment and civil
works were increased at 20% p.a. The price contingency is 18% of the base
cost estimate plus physical contingencies of 6%, or 25% if the base cost
estimate excludes the cost of the ships; physical contingencies comprise 15%
on the bulk receiving terminal construction and 10% on the ISDs, rolling
stock and offices and equipment. The estimated schedule of expenditures



- 16 -
for the project is shown in Table 2 and a detailed description cf calcula-
tions is given in Annex 2. The Bank loan will cover foreign exchange cost
(excluding those paid prior to signing) of equipment, for the fetrtilizer
depots, railway rolling stock, ships and consulting services.
C.   Project Execution
4.10      PUSRI will carry out the project with the assistance of its en-
gineering and marine consultants (para. 4.13). Detailed ship specifica-
tions were sent to 14 prequalified shipbuilders and bids were received from
four for delivery of ships between November 1976 and April 1977, when the
PUSRI III plant comes on stream and the time charters on the existing ships
expire. The prequalification, assessment, bidding, evaluation and awards
were made under procedures established in the Bank's "Guidelines" for Pro-
curement and are acceptable to the Bank. In order to meet the tight sche-
dule for construction and delivery PUSRI awarded the contract for ship
construction to Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the lowest bidder, on May 15,
1975. Prequalification of bidders for certain other long lead items e.g.,
conveyors, steel sections, is underway (para. 4.15).
4.11      The ships will be owned by PUSRI and built as ocean-going ships
to the classification rules of Germanischer Lloyd. The ships will incor-
porate the latest requirements of the draft Safety of Life at Sea Convention
(SOLAS 1974) and, because Indonesian regulations are not up-to-date, will
conform to the regulations in force at the time of contracting of the Minis-
try of Transport of the United Kingdom, supplemented by the latest appli-
cable International Labour Organization standards. As the Indonesian
national ship classification society, Biro Klassifikasi Indonesia (BKI), is
not yet sufficiently experienced in new ship construction and supervision
or in quadriennal surveys, the three ships will be classed with both BKI
and Germanischer Lloyd (GL), until such time as BKI's standards improve.
Dual classification is required by the Association under Credit 318-IND and
will be continued in this case. The Government agreed to this procedure
during negotiations. Internationally acceptable classification of the
vessels may materially assist in enabling lower insurance premiums to be
obtained.
4.12      Crewing of the PUSRI ships will be done under contract with an
Indonesian ocean-going shipping company. Senior operating personnel, who
may be expatriate and who will be employed directly by PUSRI if sufficiently
qualified staff are unavailable on contract from Indonesian shipping com-
panies, will be trained at the shipyard during construction. The suppliers
of the special self-unloading equipment will train operating staff on the
Job. As the procedures involve the same basic methods of operation as
cargo-handling winches, with which most trained seamen are familiar, this
is considered to be adequate. Maintenance of the ships' mechanical equip-
ment9 which is similar to that operated by PUSRI at various locations,
will be undertaken by a special maintenance crew of PUSRI employees who will
travel with the ships. These ships will operate for up to 320 days per
year, with a rapid turn-around, and scheduled sailings between Palembang



- 17 
and the various terminals. A total of 135 days of emergency capacity is
available among the ships and this is sufficient for most repairs. In
dire emergency chartered ships for moving both bulk and bags could be
utilized, though at substantially higher costs.
D.   Consulting Services
4.13      Marine Consultants and Designers, Inc. (USA) has been appointed
by PUSRI for design, preparation of contract documents and supervision of
construction of the special bulk ships, as have Swan Wooster & Co. (Canada)
for the bulk port terminals and the ISDs. They were recruited under pro-
cedures acceptable to the Bank and their contracts are acceptable to the
Bank.
4.14      The contract of PUSRI's marketing consultants, Agrar und Hydro-
technik, GMBH, including the services of specialist shipping consultants,
Mollers Ltd. (Hong Kong) has been extended for two years at PUSRI's ex-
pense. The consultants are competent and acceptable to the Bank. PUSRI
will have operated its bulk depots at Surabaya and Cilacap for two years
when the project commences and will not require consultants assistance for
these operations. However, specialists are needed for about 48 man-months
to assist PUSRI in the overall scheduling and movement control, required
in operating the proposed distribution system, and in training PUSRI staff
therein. This has been included in the project and was agreed during nego-
tiations.
E.   Procurement and Disbursement
4.15      Loan funds will be used to procure all or part of ships, urea
handling equipment, port and inland storage structures, rails, railway
wagons and locomotives and consultant service. Procurement of all equipment
originating outside Indonesia will be undertaken in accordance with the
Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement!". All contracts likely to be financed
by the Bank of over US$100,000 equivalent will be submitted to the Bank for
its approval prior to award; contracts between US$50,000-100,000 will be
awarded by PUSRI and the details provided to the Bank. Consultant services
for technical assistance would be retained after agreement with the Bank.
Contracts for services and equipment and civil works procured domestically
will be-financed by PUSRI and awarded on the basis of competitive bidding
advertised locally and in accordance with normal commercial procedures.
Civil works contractors must be experienced and qualified and shall be
required to carry out the civil works in accordance with appropriate
practice. Locomotives will be procured by PJKA in conjunction with bidding
being carried out for a railway loan (Loan 1005-IND). Except for land
costs of US$14.0 million equivalent no more than about US$20.0 million
equivalent will be procured by local bidding. It is anticipated that all
works will be completed by mid-1977 and land is already available at port
depot sites.
4.16      The contracts for ships and for certain other long-lead items, and
for consultants were awarded prior to presentation of the project to the



- 18 -
Board and commitments on such contracts could reach US$35 million equivalent,
all made in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines. Down payments
and progress payments on such contracts are unlikely to exceed about US$5.0
million equivalent prior to the proposed loan being signed. All such pay-
ments will be made by PUSRI under a letter of credit already opened and
financed by the Government. No retroactive financing by the Bank is con-
templated. Purchase of land for ISDs involving only local currency iLs
proceeding. It is unlikely that Indonesian industry will be able to supply
any of the mechanical equipment required, though some steel fabricated
items could be made in Indonesia.  However, provision will be made for a
15% preference, or the customs duty, whichever is the lower, to qualified
manufacturers of, for example, pre-fabricated steel structures, provLding
the value added exceeds 20% of the sales price of the goods.
4.17      Disbursement will be made by the Bank under normal Bank procedures
to PUSRI and PJKA for ships, locomotives, equipment and services. PJKA's and
PUSRI's procurement department and its consultants will provide the Govern-
ment and the Bank with appropriate documentation. For the equipment built
into civil works it is anticipated that most disbursement will be for foreign
supplied equipment and steel; actual construction and civil works will be
carried out under supervision of PUSRI consultants and PUSRI's engineering
department which is experienced in this type of construction. A disbursement
schedule is shown in Table 3.
F.   Environmental Considerations
4.18      No environmental hazards are foreseen at the production plant or
at the bulk storage sheds, where existing pollution control systems, installed
under previous Bank loans and satisfactory to the Bank, are in use or will
be extended or duplicated. Bagged storage of urea presents no environmental
hazards. Pollution controls to international standards, acceptable to the
Bank and based on those proposed by the Intergovernmental Maritime Consult-
ative Organization (IMCO), are included in the ship specifications. These
will control oily water, garbage and sewage discharge.
V. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.  Background
5.01      Indonesia with a population of about 130 million growing at 2.4%
per year has one of the lowest fertilizer application rates in Southeast
Asia, and a food gap in 1974 estimated at about 2 million tons of rice.
Thus, there is an urgent need for increased use of fertilizer. The dis-
covery of abundant natural gas reserves has put Indonesia in a position
of producing nitrogen fertilizer from its own feedstocks economically. 1/
However, due to an underdeveloped and deteriorated transport and distribution
system it would be increasingly difficult to move, store and distribute the
1/   PUSRI III Appraisal Report (Report No. 624-IND of February 4, 1975).



- 19 -
increased volumes of fertilizers, without a significant upgrading of the
present transport and distribution system.
B.   Economic Rate of Return
5.02      Detailed assumptions and results of the economic evaluation are
presented in Annex 4. The distribution system is the least cost solution of
all alternatives considered; it would generate benefits from a reduction in
transport costs and fertilizer losses, due to inadequate existing transport
and storage facilities. It is estimated that about 75% of the total quan-
tifiable benefits would be generated by reductions in transport and distri-
bution cost and 25% through reduced fertilizer losses compared to transport
in bags. Further benefits would accrue through the avoidance of congestion
in ports and land transport; but since these benefits are not quantifiable
they are not included in the economic rate of return (IER). The IER for
the project is about 20%. The economic return reflects the inefficiencies
of the present distribution system and the urgent need to improve it in
view of the much higher tonnage to be moved. The IER is sensitive to
increases in capital cost, decreases in benefits and underutilization of
capacity. However, even under various conceivable pessimistic assumptions
such as project capital cost increases of up to 20% and benefit decreases
or underutilization of capacity of up to 20%, the project would still yield
an IER of about 16%. A simultaneous 20% (10%) increase in capital cost
and a 20% (10%) decrease in benefits only reduces the IER to 13% (17%);
if the cost increased by 20% while the benefit decreased by 10%, the IER
would be 15%. Thus the project would yield satisfactory economic returns
even under these adverse assumptions.
5.03      As Government presently heavily subsidizes consumer prices for
fertilizer, the benefits of reduced transport and distribution costs and
reduced fertilizer losses could be used to offset part of these subsidies,
or if the Government chooses to lower the end product price of fertilizer,
the farmer would be the beneficiary. Farmers would also benefit from the
increased reliability and quality of fertilizer supplies which would enable
them to increase their annual yields from the same area significantly.
C.   Project Risks
5.04      The planned operation of two additional 570,000 ton urea plants in
West Java and East Kalimantan by about 1980, may reduce PUSRI's market in
Java and other Indonesian islands. While the ISDs would continue to be
fully utilized because the project has been planned with a National Fertilizer
Distribution System in mind as well as for a single company, PUSRI's bulk
terminals in Java might be underutilized in such a situation. In order to
minimize such risk the bulk terminals' capacity in Java has been designed to
accommodate the likely long-term throughput which is estimated in 1982 at
some 75% of the 1978 peak volume of 740,000 tons and slowly declining there-
after. Slight increases in ship waiting time may therefore occur in the
1978-1982 period. However, the possible benefits from reducing the ship
waiting time do not justify the additional cost of increasing bulk terminal



- 20 -
sizes. As regards ship utilization, analysis shows that the 7,000 dwt self-
unloaders from Palembang would be competitive with 25,000 dwt bulk carriers
from other major exporters in Balikpapan (East Kalimantan), Kuwait or Alaska
which might distribute to the principal Southeast-Asian and Indian ports
and thus could be utilized to export urea (Annex 4). Under the pessimistic
assumption that only 50% of the urea handled by the inland distribution
system would be transported in the special ships from Palembang and 50% from
West Java and East Kalimantan, and that no project benefits would accrue
from the export of urea ex Palembang, the project's economic rate of return
would be 16%, which is satisfactory.
VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.   Current Financial Position
6.01      While the selling margin for the present distribution system based
on Palembang is sufficient to earn an operating profit for that system, it
is insufficient to cover interest on short-term borrowings necessary to
finance its large working capital requirements for importation and inventory
requirements as discussed in Chapter II, Section C, of the PUSRI III Appraisal
Report.
6.02      Summary income accounts for 1974 (tentative) and 1975 (estimated)
are given below:
1974       1975
(Rp Billion)
Sales                                          24.3        44.0
Cost of Sales                                  19.1        38.8
Gross profit                                    5.2         5.2
Marketing cost (including proportion of
administrative and overhead costs)            4.0         6.8
Net profit (loss) before interest                1.2       (1.6)
Financial costs                                 2.2         4.9
Net marketing loss                              (1.0)      (6.5
The increases in marketing, and particularly in financial, costs expected
in 1975 are due to the Government's policy of requiring PUSRI to hold, in
addition to its normal inventories, a national fertilizer stockpile, as
discussed in para. 2.15. The resulting rise in current assets and current
liabilities is shown in the table given in paragraph 6.03. Government
assistance in making up the annual losses was agreed under Loan No. 1089-IND.
The Rp. 1.0 billion loss for 1974 has already been made up.
6.03      Summary balance sheets for PUSRI, as a whole, as of December 31,
1973 and 1974, together with estimated figures for 1975, are given in
billions of Rupiah below:

Current assets for 1974 include letters of credit for purchase of imported
fertilizers (Rp 33.2 billion) receivables of Rp 21.5 billion and inventories
of Rp 31.7 billion; a total of Rp 86.4 billion (US$208 million equivalent);
the remainder is cash. Current liabilities include Rp 46.3 billion in
short-term debt and about Rp 20 billion owing to Government for the increase
in delivery price of fertilizer stock on hand when the price was raised,
in late 1974, from Rp 22,850 to Rp 40,500 per ton. The estimated increases
in current assets and current liabilities, and the reimbursing of the costs
of financing such increases by the Government, are discussed above (para.
6.02). In view of uncertainty regarding stockpile figures, and the cost of
financing thereof, after 1975, no estimated figures are quoted for 1976.
B.   Financial Projections for the Project
6.04      Projected income accounts, cash flows and balance sheets for the
years 1977 (May-December) 1/, 1978-1982, for the project are given in Tables
4, 5 and 6. Assumptions used, detailed in Annex 5 together with basic
calculations of the various cost elements, are summarized below:
(a) cost and price levels will rise at an annual rate of 18%
between 1974 and the commencement of full operations in
May 1977 (45% total increase);
(b) PUSRI will produce at least 90% of its rated output from
PUSRI II and III plants (with PUSRI I plant being closed
down before 1977);
1/   It is assumed that the project will commence operations on May 1,
1977 the same date the PUSRI III plant is scheduled to commence.



- 22 -
(c)  output from PUSRI plus urea purchased from other producers
totalling about 960,000 tons annually will be distributed
through the system;
(d)  in addition TSP and NPK will be imported and distributed
until 1979; commencing about 1980 TSP and NPK will either
be received in bulk as back-haul by PUSRI ships, or received
bagged using RLS or tramp shipping and in any event using
PUSRI port and inland storage depots; and
(e)  the average interest payable on short term borrowing to
finance working capital requirements would be no more than
1.2% per month.
6.05      Critical factors are:  (a) the margin PUSRI will receive from the
Government per ton of fertilizer ex the inland storage depots, and hence
the margin over production costs for the distribution unit; (b) the inven-
tories of fertilizer as a whole both those regarded as normal for the scope
of business done by PUSRI and those carried over and above such normal
level as required for the Government's stockpiling program; (c) the amount
and cost of short term financing of working capital; and (d) the proportion
of long term debt to equity, and therefore the cost of long term borrowing.
6.06      The total price currently being paid by the Government to PUSRI
for bagged urea comprises (i) Rp 63,900 (US$153.97 equivalent) per ton c.i.f.
ports in Java, plus (ii) a distribution margin of Rp 13,150 (US$31.60) per
ton from the ports to retail outlets; the c.i.f. port price includes; cost
of shipping Rp 7,956 (US$19.07); bags Rp 4,150 (US$10.00), and stevetdoring,
Rp 1,850 (US$4.45) per ton. Currently the inland distribution costs excluding
shipping, bagging, stevedoring and financing costs, amount to about Rp 9,000
(US$21.70) per ton; this leaves about Rp 4,150 (US$10.00) per ton which is
presently insufficient to cover the financing costs, (item 6.05 above),
consequently a supplemental letter to the Loan Agreement of the PUSEI III
Project requires the Government to compensate PUSRI in respect of any shortfall
in earnings by the distribution unit. The greater efficiency of the project
will result in much reduced unit operating costs, therefore despite the
projected increases in costs due to inflation trends, the financial projections
assume no increase in the present production and distribution margins. But
the cost of distribution by the project is ex Palembang, so that al]L shipping,
bagging (including cost of bags) and stevedoring costs are incorporated in
the distribution costs, and the combined margin available to the distribution
unit becomes about Rp 27,000 (about US$65.0) per ton.
6.07      PUSRI, in accordance with the Government's fertilizer stockpiling
program, expects to continue building up a considerable inventory oic fer-
tilizers, over the current year.  The cost o2 purchasing, handling and
storing such inventories will be financed by short-term borrowing, as at
present. To the extent that such costs contribute to any shortfall in
earnings incurred on its distribution operations, PUSRI will be reimbursed
by the Government under the present arrangement, as explained in para. 6.06.



- 23 -
This arrangement, which will remain in force while the present temporary
system of controls remains in effect, is satisfactory while no PUSRI assets
are employed in fertilizer distribution. However, when the project comes
into operation in 1977 PUSRI is required to earn a reasonable return on the
assets employed for distribution, and the Government has agreed to reimburse
PUSRI for all costs involved, including financing costs, in holding and
moving fertilizer stocks in excess of PUSRI's "normal" inventories.  The
method of accounting for these costs and determining what are "stockpile"
as opposed to "normal" fertilizer inventories will be studied by the Govern-
ment and PUSRI, and the Bank will be informed of the procedures to be adopted
no later than October 1, 1976.
6.08      Given this commitment, by the time the distribution system to be
financed by the project becomes operational in 1977, with more efficient
processing of receivables by the Bank Rakyat Indonesia, and a reduction in
letters of credit due to smaller imports of fertilizer, PUSRI's normal
working capital requirements would be less than at present, and consequently
short-term borrowing will be reduced.
6.09      The projected revenues of the distribution unit will be sufficient
to cover not only cash operating costs plus long-term debt service, but
also interest on the short-term borrowing, and leave a margin for reducing
such borrowing. In addition, the production side of PUSRI will be accumu-
lating cash, surplus to its operating requirements, ranging from Rp 4.2 bil-
lion in 1975 to Rp 10.7 billion in 1982, with a total accumulation of Rp 84.7
billion by 1982. Assuming that at least 15% of these surpluses is retained
for emergencies, then by 1977 Rp 15.7 billion could be made available from
this source to finance distribution unit working capital, with a further
Rp 10.9 billion becoming available in 1978, of which only about Rp 1.7 bil-
lion would be needed.  Availability of these sums plus the surplus funds
generated by the distribution unit, would enable PUSRI to eliminate the need
for short-term financing by 1978.
6.10      PUSRI's marketing department should earn a reasonable return on
its assets in operation, with a cash generation sufficient to cover, not
only the operating costs of the system plus amortization of long-term debt
and interest on short-term borrowing, but also elimination of the short-term
borrowings, thus leading to an adequate current ratio. It is assumed that
operating cost increases after 1977 due to inflation will be covered by
increases in fertilizer selling prices.
6.11      The projections (Tables 4, 5 and 6) are summarized below for the
years 1977, 1980 and 1982. Such projections and the following paragraphs
should be read in the light of the discussions in paragraph 6.07. No
account is taken of the increased current assets and liabilities arising
from the stockpiling program, nor of the additional costs involved in hand-
ling the stockpile, which will be reimbursed to PUSRI by the Government.

6.12      Assuming continuance of the present margin of about Rp 27,000 per
ton, the project should earn rates of return on its assets in use of about
11% in 1977, rising to about 13%1 over the years 1978-1981; the return will
decline to about 8% after 1981, at the end of the five year tax holiday
applicable to new investments. The internal financial rate of return would
be about 14%. These returns are satisfactory.
6.13      By 1977, due to the increased scale of operations, the working
capital requirements are expected to increase from the Rp 25.6 billion
(US$61.7 million), forecast for 1975 (para. 6.03) to about Rp 29.5 billion
(US$71 million) as detailed in Annex 5. It is also assumed that part of
these requirements would continue to be financed by short-term borrowing
until 1978.
6.14      The project cash flows and balance sheets show that while working
capital requirements would continue to rise, in line with the increasing
tonnages handled by the distribution system, the short term borrowing should
be eliminated by the end of 1978. If the surplus funds received from the
production unit (para 6.09) are ignored the current ratio would rise from
14/10 in 1977 to 81/10 in 1982 with a liquid ratio of 6/10 in 1979 rising
to 31/10. In addition surplus cash would rise to about Rp 30.4 billion.
The debt/equity ratio would improve from 50/50 at commencement of full
operations to 18/82 at the end of 1982.
6.15      During negotiations, covenants similar to those in the PUSRI III
agreements were obtained for PUSRI as a whole in respect of: (i) creation
of subsidiaries, (ii) investment policy, (iii) depreciation policy, (iv)
incurring of additional long term debt, (v) the earning of a reasonable
return on assets in service, (vi) debt service coverage, (vii) maintenance
of a current ratio of at least 1.4, (viii) dividend policy and (ix) annual
audit. In addition agreement was reached that (a) the Government will
subscribe Rupiah 25.7 billion (US$62.0 million equivalent) in foreign ex-
change and local currency as required to meet the project's requirements
plus about Rp 4.2 billion (US$10.0 million equivalent) to finance interest
during construction; and (b) as long as the temporary system of fertilizer
pricing and distribution controls remain in effect the requirement to earn
a reasonable return on assets in service will be applicable separately and
jointly to the production and distribution units of PUSRI, on the basis of
separate.income and expense accounts and separate proforma balance sheets
identifying the assets and liabilities applicable to each such unit.
C.   Consolidated Financial Projections for PUSRI
6.16      Consolidated summarized projections, (combining production and dis-
tribution accounts) for the years 1977-82 are given in Tables 7, 8 and 9.  1/
1/   As noted in para. 6.11 current assets and liabilities and expenses
associated with Lhe fertilizer stockpiling program are excluded from
all projections.



- 26 -
They show total revenues of Rp 47.8 billion in 1977, rising to Rp 71.8 billion
in 1982; total annual costs, including financial charges, of Rp 36.1 billion,
rising to Rp 48.8 billion by 1982. Net profit after tax, rising from Rp 11.7
billion in 1977 to Rp 20.4 billion in 1980, will decline somewhat after the
tax holiday, to Rp 12.7 billion in 1982. The overall rate of return on assets
in use is forecast to be about 11% in 1977, rising to 18% by 1980, and
declining to about 14% in 1982.
6.17      The consolidated balance sheets show achievement of a current
ratio of 24 to 10 by 1977, improving to about 35 to 10 in 1978 and thLereafter;
in addition, surplus cash rises to about Rp 97 billion by 1982. Such surplus
could be used to pay di-vidends to the Government, to finance further develop-
ment in fertilizer production or for other purposes. The debt equity ratio
could reach a satisfactory 46/54 in 1978, improving to about 33/67 by 1980.
D.   Accounts and Audit
6.18      PUSRI has been installing a modern, cost center accounting system
with the aid of a consultant. Training of personnel and refining of account-
ing information needs to be continued and the consultant is being retained
for this purpose.  PUSRI's accounts are audited by a professional firm of
auditors approved by the Bank. At negotiations, it was agreed that PUSRI
would produce periodic accounts in sufficient detail to enable the monitoring
of the financial situation of its marketing department; it was also re-
affirmed that audited statements of account will be submitted to the Bank
within 4 months of the end of PUSRI's fiscal year.
VII.  RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations, the following major matters were agreed
with the Government and PUSRI:
(a)  employment of specialist consultants to assist in scheduling
the distribution system and training of staff therein (parats.
3.13 and 4.14);
(b)  cost of locomotives included in the proposed loan to be
passed on to PJKA as equity (para 4.05);
(c)  that pending the outcome of the National Fertilizer
Distribution System study any major distribution
facilities proposed will not contribute to the under-
utilization of the facilities included in the project
(para. 4.06);
(d) terms on which the proposed loan is to be made available
to PUSRI by the Government (para. 4.08);



- 27 -
(e) the reimbursement by government of all costs incurred
by PUSRI in the holding of a national stockpile of
fertilizer in excess of normal stockholdings (para. 6.07);
(f) the overall sales margin of PUSRI's marketing department
should be sufficient to cover all costs for delivery of
urea from Palembang to retailers, including adequate depre-
ciation and to earn a reasonable return on the assets in
use (para. 6.15);
(g)  periodic accounts will be produced by PUSRI in sufficient
detail to permit monitoring of the finances of its marketing
department and the annual audited version will be submitted
to the Bank within 4 months at the end of PUSRI's fiscal
year (para. 6.18).
7.02     'Vhe project forms a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$68 million
to the Government of Indonesia to be repaid over a period of 15-1/2 years
including 3-1/2 years grace period.

INDONESIA
FERTILIZER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
The Indonesian Fertilizer Market 1/
Background
1.        Indonesia is the world's largest archipelago with more than 13,000
islands of which about 3,000 are inhabited. It has an area bigger than the
whole of Europe and has a population of about 127 million, making it the
fifth most populous nation in the world. The population is growing at a
fast rate of 2.4% a year. Tne population growth rate is expected to decline
slightly to 2.34% during 1976-81 and to-2.29% during 1981-86, with the
population reaching about 147 million in 1980 and 161 million in 1983.
2.        According to the 1971 Census, of the total population of about
119 million people, nearly 64% lived in Java and Madura; 17.5% in Sumatera;
7.2% in Sulawesi; 4.3% in Kalimantan; and 7.0% in the other islands. Further,
the 1971 Census showed that of the total number of people employed (39.2
million), about 63% were engaged in agriculture, forestry and fishing
compared to 7.5% in manufacturing. Agriculture accounts for about 50% of
Gross National Product and almost all non-petroleum exports.
3.        During the First Five-Year Plan (Repelita I) which ended March 31,
1974, Indonesia's real annual economic growth averaged about 7%. During
Repelita II (1974-79), the rate is expected to be 7.5%. This growth rate is
projected to be maintained beyond 1979 as well.
4.        Indonesia is rich in oil and natural gas resources.  Its growth
prospects have improved significantly with the rise in oil prices from
US$2.93 a barrel in April 1973 to US$12.60 a barrel since July 1974. The
country currently produces about 1.45 million barrels of oil a day, ranking
the 10th largest crude oil producer in the world. By 1980, its crude oil
production is expected to rise to 2 million barrels a day.
Agricultural Situation
5.        Agricultural production has grown at the rate of 4% a year during
Repelita I. Rice is the most important foodcrop which accounts for about one-
third of the food production by value and over 10% of GNP. Other major
1/   This analysis of the Indonesian fertilizer market was adapted from
a Bank report "Appraisal of a Second Fertilizer Expansion Project
PUSRI III"; Report No. 624-IND of February 4, 1975.



ANNEX 1
Page 2
foodcrops are:  corn, cassava, sweet potatoes, soybeans and peanuts.  Among
the estate crops grown are rubber, oilpalm, sugarcane, tea, cofEee, tobacco,
cloves, coconuts and pepper.  Production of foodcrops other than rice in-
creased marginally or even decreased over the period 1969-73. However,
during the same period, rice production rose significantly from 10.8 million
tons to 13.4 million tons. Despite this increase in rice production, Indo-
nesia has been importing 0.5 million to 1.5 million tons of rice in recent
years.
Harvested Area
6.        In 1972, the harvested area under all crops was about 16.5 million
ha of which 11.5 million ha (nearly 70%) was under foodcrops and the rest
under estate crops. Rice alone, with approximately 8 million ha of harvested
area, accounted for about 48% of the total harvested area in the country.
7.        Java accounts for the largest harvested area among al:L islands
in Indonesia, with Sumatera coming next. For example, in 1972, Java
accounted for 8.14 million ha of harvested area or about 49.3% of the
total, while Sumatera accounted for 28% with 4.6 million ha. Thus, Java
and Sumatera accounted for slightly more than 77% of the total harvested
area that year.
8.        The total fertilized area in Indonesia was about 4.8 million ha in
1972, of which 3.85 million ha (80%) were under foodcrops and the rest under
estate crops. Rice alone accounted for about 63.4% of the total fertilized
area, with about 3 million ha. This shows that use of fertilizers is
concentrated on foodcrops, especially rice. This situation is expected to
continue in the future as well.
9.        Of the total fertilizer area in 1972, Java accounted for 3;6
million ha (75%) and Sumatera for 0.92 million ha (19%). Thus, Java and
Sumatera accounted for about 94% of the total fertilizer area in 1972, with
the rest of the islands having a very limited fertilizer area.
Per Hectare Fertilizer Consumption
10.       The following table shows the trend of per hectare fertilizer
consumption:
Fertilizer Consumption per Hectare of Arable Land
(kg)
N    P205      K2
1959/60                 2.57   0.49       0.35

Page 3
11.       The per hectare consumption of N and P205 has increased signifi-
cantly since 1959/60. However, K 0 consumption per hectare has remained
more or less stationary at a low Level. However, in the future, the need
for K 20 is also likely to increase to provide balanced fertilization.
Field trials have shown that the need for K 20 is greater for estate crops
than for foodcrops. Despite this increased consumption, application of
fertilizer per ha is still only about 50% of the average consumption per
ha in Asia at 26.9 kg.
Fertilizer Consumption
12.       During 1964-68, N consumption in Indonesia declined from 108,200
tons to 101,200 tons mainly because of the constraint of foreign exchange
to import fertilizers.  However, starting from a low base, P 05 and K 0
consumption increased during that period. The following tabie shows {he
trend of fertilizer consumption during 1964-74:

13.       Of the total N consumption in 1972, the consumption by the food-
crop sector was nearly 83%, with the estate sector using the rest. In the
case of P 205 and K 20 consumption, about 67% and 2% respectively were in
the foodcrop sector.
Fertilizer Consumption by Crops
14.       Of the total N consumption of 0.31 million in 1972, nearly 0.21
million tons or 67% was used on rice. Further, rice accounted for about
58.4% of the total P 20  consumption, but there was no use of K by that crop.
Excluding rice, the major N consumers by order of importance were vegetables,

corn, rubber and sugarcane, and the major P 205 consumers by order of im-
portance were rubber, vegetables, sugarcane and oilpalm. In the case of
K 0, apart from rice, the non-users were corn, peanuts, soybean and cloves.
Tie major K 0 users by order of importance were oilpalm, rubber, sugarcane,
tea and cofiee.
Fertilizer Consumption by Region
15.       In 1972, about 242,120 tons or 79.3% of the total N consumption
were used in Java.  That year, Java used 38,257 tons of P205 (72% of
total consumption) and 3,958 tons of K20 (31.5% of total consumption).
Apart from Java, the major fertilizer consuming regions are Sumatera and

16.       The above table shows that while Java is by far the leading user
of N and P20 fertilizers, Sumatera is the most prominent user of K 0 ferti-
lizer.  Sumatera being the leading producer of rubber and oilpalm, it needs
larger quantities of K 20 for use on them, especially in the northern part
of that island.
Imports of Fertilizer
17.       In terms of nutrients, N imports increased eightfold to 289,300
tons during 1964-72.  During the same period, P20  imports rose nearly
fourfold to 93,300 tons and K 20 imports increase §-1/2 times to 35,800 tons.
The following table shows the trend of imports during 1964-78:

18.       Among fertilizer materials imported, urea is the most important
followed by triple superphosphate (TSP), ammonium sulfate and diammonium
phosphate (DAP) as shown in the following table:

Production
19.       Indonesia had no local facility for fertilizer production until
1964, when PUSRI I went into commercial production with an annual production
capacity of 100,000 tons of urea. In the first year of operation itself,
PUSRI I achieved more than 100% capacity utilization. From 1964-71,
PUSRI I was the only domestic fertilizer production facility in the country.
In August, 1972, Indonesia's second fertilizer facility - P. N. PETROKIMIA
Fertilizer Plant at Gresik, East Java-- went on stream. PETROKIMIA has a
58,000 TPY-capacity ammonia unit feeding two downstream units- a 45,000 TPY
urea unit and a 150,000 TPY ammonium sulfate unit. The PETROKIMIA plant has
the flexibility to change the quantity of its main products--urea and ammonium
sulfate--according to the fertilizer market situation. However, it has
been facing problems in achieving high capacity utilization. Indonesia's
third fertilizer plant, PUSRI II, went into production in September 1974
with an annual capacity to produce 380,000 TPY of urea. The country has
negligible production capacity for P 0 fertilizers. As for K 0 fertilizer,
the country has no local production tac  ity as there are no known local
reserves of potash.

Production Plans
20.       Indonesia has firm plans to establish three N fertilizer p:Lants:
PUSRI III, the East Kalimantan Plant I, near Balikpapan, and the West Java
Plant at Jatibarang. Further, under preliminary stages of consideration are
three more plants: the North Sumatera Plant at Aceh, the East Kalimantan
Plant II and a third expansion of PUSRI. The following table shows the
main units, capacities and the likely dates for full commercial production
of the plants to be built before 1983:

East Kalimantan I            1,500             1,725          January 1, 1978
West Java                    1,000             1,725          January 1, 1979
21.       All the above plants are expected to produce urea and have identical
urea capacity. However, the ammonia unit of the East Kalimantan I would be
larger than the comparable units of the other two plants. The surplus ammonia
capacity in the East Kalimantan I would be used to provide industrial ammonia
for a proposed petrochemical plant in Surabaya. However both the East
Kalimantan and West Java plants are delayed and not expected to be ill
commercial operation before 1980. Productive capacity shown in the iFollowing
tables may thus be overstated but, in the absence of more precise data, has
been retained.
22.       As for the local production of P 0  fertilizers, Indonesia has
plans to build a TSP plant as part of the hE@ROKIMIA complex. This plant
is expected to go into production on January 1, 1977 with an annual capacity
of about 300,000 tons of TSP. With respect to K 0 and compound fertilizers,
the country has no plans for their local productdon.
23.       Assuming that all the new plants would be commissioned according
to schedule, the local production of fertilizers would increase as follows:

Forecast of Demand
24.       Forecasts of fertilizer demand for Indonesia have been made in
several studies: (1) the National Fertilizer Study (NSF) by Agrar-und
l-ydrotechnik GmbH, of the Federal Republic of Germany, published in 1972;
(2) the Feasibility Study for the West Java Fertilizer Plant by the Bureau
d'Etudes Industrielles et de Cooperation de l'Institut Francais du Petrole
(BEICIP), published in 1973/74; the draft reports, "The Likely Impact of
Middle East Oil Policies on the Development of the Nitrogen Industry of
East and Southeast Asia," January 1974, and "The Proposal for the Develop-
ment of the Nitrogen Production Capacity in Indonesia," July 1974--both
prepared by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) for the U.S. Agency for
International Development (AID); and the Bank Group Report (No. 446),
"The Fertilizer Requirements of Developing Countries," May 1974 and the
Bank draft report "The Irrigation Survey Program for Indonesia," August
1974. Further, the Second Five-Year Plan (Repelita II, 1974-79) has forecast
the demand for N fertilizers. However, since these projections are only
straight line trend extrapolations and not based on agricultural surveys
they only can provide a generalized picture of prospective fertilizer con-
sumption.
25.       Based on the above consultants' and Bank studies, the total
fertilizer requirements in nutrient tons during 1972-1983 are projected
as follows:

Trade in Fertilizers
26.       As already noted, Indonesia has no known reserves of K20.  There-
fore, it is assumed that the country would meet all its requiremients of K20
from imports. In the case of phosphates, Indonesia has plans as mentioned
earlier to establish only one plant with a production capacity of 300,000 TPY
of TSP (138,000 TPY of P205). Therefore, the country would largely depend
on imports to meet its phosphate needs. In the case of N fertilizers,
however, Indonesia is projected to emerge as an exporter from 1978 onwards
as shown below:
Comparison of Production and Requirements of N

1983                     858.7          825.5          +  33.2 /1
/1   The surplus would reach about 557,600 tons of N by 1983 if.
Indonesia builds by the end of this decade two more urea
plants each of 570,000 TPY of urea capacity (262,200 T'PY of
N) in addition to the three new urea plants assumed iTI the
projections.
27.       In studying the export possibilities for N fertilizers, it is
assumed,that Indonesia has a relative advantage compared to Japan and the
Republic of Korea - its major Asian competitors for N fertilizer exports - in
meeting the import needs of neighboring countries such as Malaysia, the
Philippines, Thailand and the Republic of Vietnam because of Indonesia's
large resources of low-cost feedstocks for N production combined with modern
production facilities and freight advantage. As for potential competition
especially from the Persian Gulf countries, it is assumed that those countries
would be better off by concentrating on meeting the import needs of countries
other than Indonesia's neighbors mentioned above.



ANN1 EX 1
Page 9
28.       Based on TVA projections of production and demand of N fertilizers
in Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, the Republic of Vietnam, Japan and
the Republic of Korea, it is forecast that the surplus/deficit of N in those
countries would be as follows:
N Fertilizer Deficit (-) and Surplus (+)
in Selected Countries
(In '000 nutrient tons)
1974   1977   1978   1980   1983
Malaysia                   -54    -96   -109   -187    +31
Thailand                   -58    -97   -109   -149   -232
Philippines               -140   -195   -234   -312   -217
Vietnam                   -103   -134   -148   -178   -116
Total Deficit        -355   -522   -600   -776   -534
Indonesia                 -285   -196      -    +170   +33
Korea                       +3   +226   +200   +270/1
Japan                     +990   +569   +394   +100       -
Total Surplus        +708   +599   +594   +540   +33
/1   Two fertilizer plants are expected to be closed at the
end of 1980.
29.       The above forecasts of surplus/deficit in the selected countries
are based on the assumption that before 1983: (1) Korea and Japan - which
for N production have to depend heavily on imported feedstocks the price
for which has risen steeply - would not build new plants except those already
under construction; (2) Malaysia and the Philippines would build one ammonia/
urea plant each with a capacity of 570,000 TPY of urea (262,200 TPY of N);
and (3) Vietnam would build an ammonia/urea plant with a capacity of 330,000
TPY of urea (151,800 TPY of N). The above table shows the surplus available
from Japan, Korea and Indonesia would fall short of the import requirements
of Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam from 1980 onwards. How-
ever, an approximate balance would be achieved by 1983 in case Indonesia
builds two more plants in addition to the three new plants assumed.
Fertilizer Marketing
30.       Fertilizer marketing in Indonesia is carried out by Government
approved importers/distributors including local fertilizer producers like
PIJSRI and PETROKIMIA. Until 1970, P.N. Pertani was the leading distributor
of both local and imported fertilizers. However, in recent years, the
Government has been encouraging local producers to market their own products
as well as imported fertilizers while allowing P.N. Pertani and other
established importer/distributors to continue their operation. As the
local production of fertilizers is low (about 318,000 product tons in 1974),
the marketing network in Indonesia depends heavily on imports.



ANNEX 1
Page 10
Pricoing Policy
31.       The Government controls not only fertilizer distribution but also
fertilizer   prices.  The main purpose of price control is to subsidize
fertilizer sales to farmers and keep foodgrain prices low in a bid to check
inflation which has been a serious problem in Indonesia. The retail price
of urea - both local and imported - is fixed at Rp 60,000 (US$144.6) per
product ton while the current import price of urea - the most popular
fertilizer used in the country - is about Rp 176,000 per ton. Of the retail
fertilizer price of Rp 60,000 per product ton, Rp 5,000 (8%) is the margin
for sub-distributors and retailers and Rp 13,100 (22%) is the margin for
importers/distributors.  The Government purchases all the local production
of urea at a fixed price before allocating it for distribution. This price
was very low in the past, making it difficult for local producers to earn a
reasonable return on investment. However, the Government has increased its
purchased price by stages from Rp 28,220 (US$68.0) per product ton in 1972
to Rp 63,900 (US$154) in 1974. The purchase price is fixed on the basis of
c.i.f. Java. Therefore, the producers have to bear the cost of transporting
their product to port godowns in Java, the leading fertilizer consuming area.
Credit
32.       Over 60% of the fertilizer is consumed in Indonesia in aretas
covered by two programs for promoting intensive cultivation, especially
of rice: the BIMAS (Mass Guidance) program and the INMAS (Mass Intensifica-
tion) program. Under the BIMAS program, farmers having less than 5 ha of
land are provided with short-term credits at 1% interest per month in the
form of a package of subsidized inputs supplemented with extension services
to promote the proper use of these inputs. The INMAS program in practice
represents the ordinary agricultural extension program for the distribution
of subsidized inputs to farmers who are either ineligible for the BIMAS
program (either because they have progressed sufficiently as BIMAS farmers
or because they have more than 5 ha of land) or who do not want to umake use
of the BIMAS credit because of the associated red-tape and control. The
INMAS participants, unlike the BIMAS farmers, have freedom of choice regard-
ing the types and quantities of inputs. However, the INMAS farmers are
charged a higher rate of interest--currently 1.5% per month--than the
BIMAS farmers.
33.       The Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI) is now the sole credit agency for
these programs and is attempting to set up offices to process loan applica-
tions in each village unit (unit desa). Village units without a BR] office
are covered by mobile units. Farmers participating in BIMAS and INMAS
programs have to receive vouchers for inputs from BRI offices or mobile
units and draw supplies against them in village "kiosks" operated by approved
private retailers or from village unit cooperatives (BUUD's). It is the
Government policy to promote the BUUD's as the main sources of supply of
inputs for BIMAS and INMAS farmers. But there is a lack of trained person-
nel to organize and operate them. Therefore, BUIWD's require considerable
strengthening before they could become efficient suppliers.

FERTILIZER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
Project Description
The Palenbang Facilities
1.        PUSRI currently distributes something less than half of the total
fertilizer tonnage consumed in Indonesia, and is expected to continue to be
the leading fertilizer marketer. Present distribution facilities are in-
adequate and cause substantial losses of product. With the expansion of
fertilizer output by PUSRI, an improved distribution system was designed
and the land based elements were related to the market demand and, more
specifically, to the road and railway network in Java and to the road system
in other islands.
2.        The distribution project is geared to handle both the TSP and NPK
fertilizers distributed by PUSRI and the total output of the PUSRI fertilizer
complex at Palembang. This complex is in the process of being expanded by
the addition of a third unit (PUSRI III) which will more than double current
urea output of 1,450 tons per day by 1977 to be financed partly by the Bank's
loan. At that date, the three units will be capable of an output of about
3,175 tons per day or about 1.1 million tons per year. This will be reduced
to 2,875 tons per day, when the original plant built in 1964 goes out of
service.
3.        Ammonia from PUSRI I may be sold or utilized in other processes
to make phosphatic fertilizers. PUSRI III facilities include, in addition
to ammonia and urea units, an expansion and modification of bulk and
bagged storage, and the replacement of an existing ship-loader. These
facilities are schematically depicted on the flow sheet (Attachment I).
4.        Taking an overall berth occupancy at Palembang of 50% and about
60% of rated capacities for loading fertilizers, the proposed bulk shipping
system could adequately load the entire output of PUSRI in 1977. The ex-
isting bag loading berth and the facilities being provided under the PUSRI
III loan can handle smaller outer island consumption, spot export and emer-
gency loading, about 300,000 tons per year, in addition to the miscellaneous
products likely to be produced when PUSRI I urea production, but not the
amonia production, ceases, and necessary imports. This provides against a
major breakdown of one of the special bulk ships.
5.        Shed storage capacity at Palembang in 1977 will consist of 26,000
tons of bagged urea and 55,000 tons of bulk urea. The maximum shed storage
of 81,000 tons amounts to 28 days production. With outside storage of



ANiEX 2
Page 2
bagged urea under tarpaulins in an emergency, storage capacity can be
greatly expanded.
6.        The existing bulk loading pier is adequately designed for berthing
the proposed bulk ships. It has 8 m depth alongside at low water and this
is more than sufficient. Dredging is unlikely to be needed due to the ex-
posed location and the swift current. The existing fixed shiploader of
600 tons per hour capacity is to be replaced by a quadrant type loader, in
order that loading of both bulk and bagged products can proceed at ad-
joining piers without substantial delays as the bulk ship will not have to
be moved.
The Ships
7.        Annex 3 fully describes the considerations underlying the design
of the ships and provides information on their costs. The three ships
would have the capability of moving the total output of the PUSRI complex
to the main bulk depots in 320 days operation each. As about 130,000 tons
of urea are expected to be shipped in bags, substantial spare capacity is
available to backhaul fertilizers produced elsewhere in Indonesia or to
serve other bulk depots in Indonesia or in nearby countries, such backhauling
or other movements are not expected to develop before 1980 when the proposed
National Fertilizer Distribution System study's proposals will likely be in
effect.
Bulk Terminals
8.        PUSRI has completed two bulk terminals at Cilacap and Surabaya
for reception of urea. These were constructed as part of the first
expansion at Palembang and could handle only a small part of the output
now proposed. Expansion of these facilities and improvement of ship
unloading facilities is included in the project. In addition, new terminals
will be built at Belawan, in Northern Sumatera, and at Padang on the western
coast of Sumatera, and the existing PGIP terminal in Tanjung Priok will be
improved; all of these will have some capacity for storing bagged urea and
other fertilizers. The terminal at Padang may be completed somewhat later
than the other due to the need for site preparation. The existing and pro-
posed bulk and bagged storage at the port terminals are shown below:

9.        Calculations show that when over about 50,000 tons per year of
urea are received in bags at any port, the building of a bulk terminal is
economically attractive. On this basis, PUSRI may construct additional
terminals at Telukbitung, in South Sumatera; and at Ujung Pandang, in
South Sulawesi, as its market develops, or as may be indicated by the National
Fertilizer Distribution System study.
10.       The terminals proposed are similar to those currently in use.
A breasting dolphin and two mooring dolphins will be constructed, or an
existing berth improved; bulk urea will be received on a covered conveyor
belt mounted on the breasting dolphin, elevated into a concrete and wood
construction storage shed, and stored in a free-standing pile formed by
an overhead conveyor. Separation of various types of fertilizer will be
possible within the sheds. Bagging machines of a capacity and number
sufficient to serve the estimated throughput will be served by front-end
loaders. The bagging plant will operate on up to three shifts. The
ships can be unloaded night and day, regardless of weather. Only one
man is required to operate the system.
11.       Land for the terminals where necessary will be leased in each
port. As the ports are normally maintained at a minimum of 8 m water depth,
no difficulties are foreseen in using the proposed ships, and maintenance
dredging will be undertaken by the port as necessary.
12.       While the depots would normally be served only by the special ships,
it would be possible to accommodate and unload normal crane-equipped bulk
carriers.
13.       Consultant studies for new depots were carried out in the field
and preliminary drawings and cost estimates made. PUSRI's engineering
department was responsible for the successful construction of the two
existing bulk depots.
Inland Storage Depots
14.       Fifty-nine inland storage depots (ISDs) of from 3,000 to 10,000 tons
capacity are included in the project for reception, storage, and onward
distribution of fertilizer as proposed by PUSRI's marketing and engineering
consultants and agreed to by the Bank. These ISDs are served by the bulk
terminals as follows:

TOTAL                              59
All the ISDs will be owned by PUSRI. Details of the location of the ISDs,
their sizes, throughput planned, and distance from the port depots are in
Attachment II. In addition, 22 smaller ISDs of from 2,000 tons or less
capacity will be leased, mainly in the outer islands.
15.       Of the 44 depots in Java, 27 will be served by both road and
rail; 17 will be served only by road and those will be within about 100 km
of the main bulk terminals.
Transport to ISDs
16.       Rail movement of bagged fertilizer from the bulk terminals in
Java will be by block trains. These will carry at least 480 tons of urea
and/or other bagged fertilizers. It is estimated that the fertilizer re-
quirements can be transported by 175 railway cars of 30 tons capacity each.
These wagons will be owned by PUSRI. In order to provide an adequate in-
crement to the pool of motive power of the Indonesian State Railways (PJKA),
four main-line and three shunting locomotives, of 1700/2000 HP and 350 HP
respectively will be procured by the railway company from the loan proceeds.
17.       Construction of railway spurs will be required at the 27 ISDs to
be served by rail and an allowance has been made to cover the cost of these
works.
Offices and Equipment
18.       Each ISD and bulk terminal and each of PUSRI's six regional offices
require office equipment and automobiles and, in some cases, expansion and
relocation. Provision has been made for such expenditures in the cost
estimate.

Capital Costs
19.       Detailed capital cost estimates for the project, including bulk
terminals, ISDs, and all necessary equipment are given in Table 2.
Contingencies
20.  (a)  Physical
No physical contingencies are included in the case of ships
as a firm bid has been accepted. Physical contingencies on
port bulk terminals are taken at 15%, and 10% on ISDs,
railway construction, and equipment, and offices and
equipment.
(b) Price
(i) Ship
A fixed price contract for delivery of the ships has
been signed and no price contingencies are necessary.
(ii) Railway Equipment
Price contingency was based on the equipment value plus
physical contingencies, the order date was assumed to be
late in 1975 with a 10% down payment. Deliveries were
assumed to take place in late 1976 to early 1977 in a
70:30 ratio. Against this estimated disbursement
schedule of 1-1/2 years, escalation was taken at 18% p.a.
(iii) Land Based Facilities
Costs of bulk and ISD facilities were divided into foreign
and domestic components, excluding land. The base cost
estimate was made in late 1974 and construction was
assumed to be completed by mid-1977.
Local costs were assumed to be 80% labor and 20%
equipment. Labor, and equipment were both escalated
at 20% p.a. Foreign costs, 100% equipment, were
escalated according to a declining rate of inflation
proposed by Bank staff, i.e., 14% p.a. in 1974; 12% p.a.
in 1975; 10% p.a. in 1976; and 8% in 1977.
Total price contingency thus computed amounted to 18%
of the base cost estimate plus physical contingencies.

Ship Design Considerations and Costs
A.   Factors Considered in Design Selection
The following ten factors underlay the ship design and had the
implications shown:

3.   Corrosion
Except when dry, urea is                 -  special grades of steel
corrosive to steel, copper and aluminum           and aluminum at wear
points (slope plates) and

rosion
- painting interior of
cargo hold withL special
paints reduces corrosion
of interior
- stainless steel used in
scraper fittings
- special precautions are
taken with electrical
wiring and switches
- air filters are used for
engine room air intake
to protect electrical
equipment

Economic and Operating Factors
5.   High Value
Urea replacement cost per ton,            -  care taken to avoid
currently about US$250, is expected               product losses at trans-
to decline to about US$176 by 1977.               fer to shore by using
enclosed, weather-proof
system

- anticipated losses reduced
to 1-1/2% from 3% for
current crane/clamshell
bucket transfer
- small hatches on ship
reduce dust pollution on
loading and can be
weather protected during
rain storms
6.   Plant Output 2,875 tons/day
PUSRI complex will produce at             - system sized as to ship
this daily rate in 1977                               speed, number, unloading
rate so that 1.1 million
tons can be transported
by three ships. Ini-
tially, the system will
operate at about 80% of
rated capacity due to
continued shipment of
bagged production in
early years of the project.
7.   River Draft Limited
Consultantst studies indicate             - maximum tropical fresh
that 6.5 m below low water spring                water draft of the ship
tides may be the maximum water depth             was chosen at 6 m so that
at which the river can be stabilized.            there is a 90% probability
90% of all highwaters exceed 6.15 m.             that it will suffer no
delays on outbound loaded
trips
- ship will reach its design
draft with about 7,000
tons of cargo
8.  Round-The-Clock, All Weather Operation
PUSRI will have its own reception         - only one man ashore re-
installations in the ports, operating            quired for receiving-shed
on a three-shift basis if required.              conveyor start-up
Delivery of product must be evenly spread
out over the year including the rainy          - ships operate at all hours

- ships do not need tugs
for docking or harbor
operations because a bow
thruster is fitted
- small hatches designed for
the ship can readily be
tented during loading and
all are closed during
unloading
- covered conveyor discharge
protects cargo from
weather
- use of PUSRI berths at
ports means ships will
not be delayed.
9.   Easy Maintenance
Ship and unloading design should          - specifications conform so
be simple and rugged in order that               far as is lpossible, to
maintenance in Indonesia can be properly         those to be used for the
undertaken and so that operations in             Indonesian inter-island
tropical waters with a corrosive cargo           fleet
can proceed regularly.
- much equipment aboard
ship is similar to that
used by PUSRI
- scraper system is a simple
wire and slheave block
system akin to standard
cargo winch

shore hoppers for loading
into trucks is possible
at any port not equipped
for conveyor belt
reception
B.   Description of Ship Selected
1.        PUSRI appointed Marine Consultants and Designers (USA) to prepare
design studies and to design and supervise construction. This firm is ex-
perienced in the design of self-unloading ships for bulk materials and is
acceptable to the Bank. The consultant's terms of reference and the contract
was also acceptable to the Bank. A number of system studies were made in
order to select a design. The various systems studied were:
(a) new self-unloading, self propelled vessel, 7,000 m cargo
tons capacity;
(b) new self-unloading, integrated tug-barge units 8,500 m
cargo tons capacity;



ANNEX 3
Page 6
(c) new self-unloading, self propelled vessels, 5,000 m cargo
tons capacity;
(d) new, self-propelled vessels using gantry-type unloading
cranes, 5,000 m cargo tons capacity;
Ce)  conversion of existing 7,000 m cargo tons capacity vessels
to self-unloaders;
(f) conversion of existing vessels using unloading cranes,
7,000 m cargo tons capacity;
(g) self propelled ships of the type currently on charter with
cranes and 3,000 m tons capacity;
(h) self-unloading tug and barge systems as proposed by Mitsui &
Co., 6,000 m tons cargo capacity of barges to be used with
two alternate tugs (3,200 H.P. and 5,200 H.P.);
(i)  alternate tug proposals of item (h) having one tug and one
barge as a unit and with speeds of 9 knots and 10 knots
respectively; and
(j) a fleet of 1,000 m tons capacity barges with tugs.
2.        A final selection was made based on capital and operating costs
of the various systems. Three close contenders, alternatives (a), (b),
and (e) were studied in greater detail. The selection of a ship in
preference to an integrated tug and barge system was made mainly on the
basis of relative ease of maintenance. The possibility that the trans-
portation system might be used in ocean-going service also favored a ship,
as sufficient experience with integrated units in the typhoon and monsoon
areas of the South China Sea and the Bay of Bengal does not exist. Con-
versions would lead to higher costs per ton due to the loss of cargo hold
volume, and therefore cargo tonnage, when unloading equipment was installed.
Older ships would have higher maintenance costs and may suffer delays due to
lack of spare parts. They would have higher financial costs per toin. As new
ships could be constructed in the time available and would give lowest
cost per ton, conversions were eliminated.
3.        The ship finally selected and designed took into account the
various factors noted in Section A. It is a single deck, transversely and
longitudinally framed, bulk carrier having no cargo-hold bulkheads and
with side ballast tanks as well as a double bottom. The ship will be
propelled by two, unidirectorial, medium-speed diesel engines each driving
a propeller via a reverse reduction gear.       Twin rudders and a bow
thruster will provide precise maneuvering capability both ahead and astern.



ANNEX 3
Page 7
4.        The self-unloading machinery will consist of two wire-rope operated
drag-scrapers in the hold which discharge into hoppers. Two bucket elevators,
fed by conveyors from the hoppers, elevate the cargo above the deck and
discharge it onto a transverse, weather-tight, shuttle-boom conveyor which
discharges onto the shore reception facilities. All of this machinery as
well as the accommodation, propulsion and auxiliary equipment space is
located aft.
5.        Scale model tests for propulsion and propellers have been carried
out at a testing facility in order to determine the best machinery specifi-
cations. Detailed design has been completed for the mid-ship section and
approval has been received from the Germanischer Lloyd (GL). The ship will
be built to the rules of GL and will eventually be transferred to a joint
classification with the Indonesian classification society, Biro Klasifikasi
Indonesia (BKI). It will be maintained in dual class during the period of
the proposed loan.
5.        Principal particulars of the ships are:
Length, overall                           114.5 meters
Length, load waterline                    112.5 meters
Beam, moulded                              20.0 meters
Depth, moulded                             10.0 meters
Draft, design, summer, tropical
fresh water                               6.0 meters
Horsepower, continuous service
rating                                4,000   B.H.P.
Accommodation                              30
C.   Capital Costs
After following procedures described in the Bank's "Guidelines
for Procurement" a contract has been awarded by PUSRI for construction of
three self-unloading ships for a fixed price in yen of ? 9,470,000,000
equivalent to about US$33.0 million. The price includes complete outfit
and about US$600,000 equivalent of extra spares.
D.   Operating and Other Costs
1.        Based on current Indonesian costs outlined by PUSRI's marine
consultants (Mollers, Hong Kong) and checked by Bank staff, the following
annual operating costs have been estimated. These costs include an al-
lowance during the first four operating years for expatriate senior
officers if it is necessary to train Indonesian officers.

2.        Financial costs per year will average about US$4.8 million based
on a capital recovery factor of 12% over 16 years. Total operating and
financial costs would then be about US$8.2 million equivalent :Ln 1977. If
operating costs were to increase to US$4.0 million by 1985 total cost at
that date would be US$8.8 million for urea shipped and unloaded. Even if
the ships were operated at 75% of capacity, the cost per ton would then be
no greater than PUSRI currently pays per ton for shipping and stevedoring
in crane equipped ships (Annex 4, page 4) after including the increase in
operating costs due to estimated inflation.

FERTILIZER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
Economic Evaluation
Principal Assumptions and Results
A.   Optimization of the Distribution System
1.        The distribution system  is designed to handle about 1.4 million
tons of fertilizer annually (960,000 tons urea ex Palembang, 100,000 tons
urea to be bo'ight by PUSRI and about 370,000 tons imported TSP and NPK
of which about 70% (one million tons) are estimated to be distributed in Java
in 1978; the bulk of the land based investments in marine terminals and
internal storage depots will consequently be in Java.
2.        The system represents the least cost combination of a number of
options which were considered, as follows:
(a) Sea Transport
Various vessel sizes and types ranging from 1,000 dwt
barges to 8,500 dwt ships were tested and the 7,000 dwt
self-unloading ship was established as the technical
and economic optimum, given the draft restrictions in
the channel of the Musi River near Palembang;
(b) Combination Sea/Land Transport
(i) All rail transport from Palembang via ferryboat
to Java and from Palembang to Sumatera, ship
transport (RLS) 1/ to the outer islands.
(ii) Ship transport to three bulk terminals in Java,
and two in Sumatera with RLS shipping to the
outer islands, land transport from the marine
terminals or ports 70-75% by road, the balance
by rail;
(iii) Ship transport as in option (ii), but land
transport about 55% rail, 45% road depending
on availability of rail service and the
competitive situation.
1/   Regular Liner Service



ANNEX 4
Page 2
Option (iii) was determined as the least cost
technically feasible solution and was therefore
used to form the project.
(c) Size of Bulk Terminals and Inland Storage Depots (ISDs)
(i) Bulk Terminals
The size of each bulk terminal was established as
a function of the long-term fertilizer demand of
the region it serves, the number of ship unloadings
and the rate of distribution of fertilizer to the
ISDs. A reserve factor was then added to account
for the possibility of some failures in the system.
The bulk terminals were located on the basis of
availability of an existing port and the economic
comparison of the sea/land distribution costs. It
was found that three bulk terminals in Java and
two bulk terminals in Sumatera were the economic
optimum.
(ii) ISDs
The size and spacing of the ISDs was established as
a function of transport cost, cost of the ISD and
density of consumption of the areas served. Thus
it was found that 59 ISDs ranging in size from 3,000
to 10,000 tons were needed to distribute the fertilizer
efficiently throughout Indonesia.
(iii)  Seasonal fluctuations in consumption and the constantl
rate of output of the Palembang plants were factors
in determining the capacity of both the bulk termina:Ls
and the ISDs. Thus storage capacity for about 500,000
tons or 35% of annual sales will be available to meet
demand during the wet season (December-March).
B.   Projection of System Throughput
3.        The projected system throughput is based on (i) demand projections
for urea, TSP and NPK fertilizers in Indonesia for the period 1977-1985,
as shown in Annex 1, and (ii) PUSRIts prospective share of the fertilizer
market. PUSRI's marketing consultants (Agrar-und Hydrotechnik, GMBH)
estimated the following annual throughput 1/ which the Bank considers
realistic:
1/   Throughput of bulk TSP and NPK is Bank estimate.

ANNEX 4

8.         Operating Cost Savings for Bulk Urea Procured Locally or Imported
In order to meet the expected demand for urea fertilizer distributed
by PUSRI the company would have to import about 100,000 tons of urea annually
or buy it from other domestic producers. The urea is expected to be shipped
in bulk to PUSRI's bulk terminals either in PUSRI's bulk ships if the urea
can be procured locally or in other ships if it is imported. The urea will
be bagged in PIJSRI's bulk terminals and shipped to its ISDs via the PUSRI
distribution system. Since it is not yet known whether the urea will be
procured locally or imported, it has been assumed that benefits will only
accrue from the land based facilities of the distribution system. Hence net
savings are: land based operating cost of old system (Rp 6,015) less land
based operating cost of new system (Rp 2,004) = Rp 4,011 (US$9.67).
9.        Operating Cost Savings for Bagged Urea and Bagged TSP/NPK
Bagged fertilizer will be delivered by RLS ships throughout
Indonesia and then transported inland to the ISDs. Savings which could be
attributed to the new distribution system would accrue from more efficient
storage and handling at the ISD level. Hence net savings are: storage and
handling at distributors' warehouses (present system) Rp 558, less storage
and handling at ISDs (new system) Rp 290 = Rp 268 (US$0.65).
10.       Operating Cost of Back-haul of TSP and NPK Fertilizers
The ships have the capacity to enable back-haul of fertilizers to
be undertaken. Additional TSP or NPK in bulk could be imported to PUSRI's
bulk terminals. Estimates of the ship operating cost for back-haul presented
in Annex 5 show an overall cost for back-haul of Rp 1,017 (US$2.45). On
this basis total transport operating cost savings for bulk TSP moving through
the new transport/distribution system amount to Rp 6,394 (US$15.41) per ton.
(Rp 9,415 less Rp 3,021) This category of benefits is assumed to ma-
terialize starting 1980 following provision of the facilities recommended
by the National Fertilizer Distribution System study.
11.       Benefits from Reduction in Fertilizer Losses
It is estimated that product losses during transportation, storage
and dis'tribution can be reduced by about one half to 1.5%, by using self
unloading ships and to 3.5% (from the present estimated 5%) by the improve-
ments in the inland fertilizer movements up to the distributor/retailer
level. Thus, about 3% of total fertilizer tonnage moved (42,000 tons)
could be saved. Assuming a long-term average fertilizer price of US$150
per ton total benefits would amount to US$6.3 million per year.
12.       Benefits from Additional Rice Production
Plant nutrients (in terms of nitrogen) would amount to 46% (19,000
tons) of the weight of urea saved. It is estimated that 1 ton of plant



ANNEX 4
Page 6
nutrients helps produce about 8 - 10 tons of rice (see PUSRI III Appraisal
Report, No. 624-IND, 1975). On this basis the marginal increase in rice
production attributable to reduced fertilizer losses would amount to about
170,000 tons.
D.   Proiect Risks
(a) Shifting of Markets
13.       There are plans to build two additional urea production plants of
570,000 tons annual capacity each. One plant near Jatibarang in West Java
the other plant will be in East Kalimantan, with production expected by
about 1980. The most likely and most economical market for the two plants
would be Java. Part of the East Kalimantan production can be exported and
part marketed on other Indonesian islands. Using the projection for ferti-
lizer production and demand of this report as basis (Annex 1), it seems
likely that PUSRI fertilizer ex Palembang may lose a part of its market to
the West Java plant and possibly East Kalimantan.  PUSRI's marketing con-
sultants estimated that its share in the Java market would decline from
about 77% in 1975 to 54% in 1985; this means that by early 1980 about 400,000
tons per year of PUSRI's urea would have to be chanelled into new maLrkets,
although the location and production of new factories is not yet certain.
Unless the domestic market expands sharply, the most likely markets are in
neighboring southeast-Asian countries. Analysis shows that the 7,000 dwt
self-unloaders originating from Palembang would be competitive with 25,000
dwt urea bulk carriers equipped with grab crane unloading which originate
from Balikpapan (East Kalimantan), Kuwait or Alaska for the following princi-
pal ports:
Cost in US$ per ton assuming no return cargo would be available

(7,000 dwt
To                   Self Unloaders)         (24,000 dwt Bulk Carriers)
Madras                  18.26             22.83        20.12   23.69
Haldia (Calcutta)       19.07             23.79         n.a.   23.72
Bangkok                 12.99             17.00        25.24    n.a.
Port Klang (Malaysia)   9.41              13.60         n.a.    n.a.
Singapore                7.93             12.11        22.89   21.29
Saigon                  11.74             15.09         n.a.   20.62
Furthermore, the self-unloaders are more flexible to operate since they
have a shallow draft (6m with a full load) and thus can serve more ports
than the larger bulk carriers.



ANNEX 4
Page 7
Utilization of Land Facilities
14.       As regards the land distribution system, no change would be
required because the system is planned as a national distribution system
and will always be fully utilized irrespective of the source of fertilizer.
The marine terminals have been dimensioned to accommodate the likely
long-term throughput rather than the peak throughput likely to occur about
1980, and thus slight increases in ship waiting time may occur at that time
However, the possible benefits from reducing the waiting time are insuf-
ficient to justify the additional cost of increasing the size of the marine
termainals.
Rate of Return
15.       Assuming that only 50% of the-urea handled by the inland distribu-
tion system would come from Palembang and 50% from West Java and East
Kalimantan, and that no project benefits would accrue from the export of
urea ex Palembang the economic rate of return would be about 16%. Even
under this unfavorable assumption implementation of the project would still
be justified.

There will be additional charges for stevedoring, either at Palembang or
other sources.  The estimated cost is Rp 1,900 (US$4.58) per ton (current),
or escalated Rp 2,755 (US$6.64) per ton. Annual costs are:

F.   Inland Freight Costs (Port Terminals to ISDs)
Calculations indicate that for hauls up to 100 km highway
transport is the most economic mode. Therefore, in Java it is assumed
that all transport to ISDs within a radius of about 100 km from the
port terminals would be by highway trucks; outside this radius it is
assumed that 75% would be by rail (in block trains) and 25% by road.
For all other islands it is assumed that highway trucks would carry the
traffic. The transport unit costs are:
Present              Escalated
Highway trucks       Rp 25 (USd6.02)    Rp 36.25 (USd8.74) per ton/km
Rail - fixed         Rp 250 (USW60.24)  Rp 362.5 (USi87.35) per ton
- variable      Rp 6  (USd1.45)    Rp  8.7  (USd2.10) per ton/km

G.   ISDs Costs
The projected annual costs given by the consultants have been
(a) split into fixed and variable costs, (b) escalated by 45% to re-
present 1977 costs, and (c) then used to calculate the annual costs
of handling the bagged fertilizers, as detailed in the Attachment IV
to this Annex.  The estimated annual costs are:
1977   1978   1979   1980   1981   1982
Annual Costs (Rp million)        1,173  1,779  1,780  1,785  1,788  1,791
H.   Cost of Transportation to Retailers and Unloading
An average of 50 km has been assumed for the distance between
ISDs and retailers' storage. The present trucking cost is Rp 25 per
ton/im; this has been escalated, by 45%, to Rp 36.25 (USU8.74) per ton/km,
to represent estimated 1977 costs. This gives an average cost per ton
of Rp 1,812.5 (US$4.36). For unloading at retailers storage the present
cost of Rp 125 per ton has been similarly escalated to Rp 181.2 (US443.6)
- making an overall cost per ton of Rp 1,993.7 (US$4.80). Estimated
annual costs are:
1977   1978   1979   1980   1981   1982
Annual tonnages (7000)            827  1,287  1,293  1,300  1,308  1,317

J.   Working Capital and Short-Term Debt
Assumptions are:
(i) Cash - require one month's cash operating costs



ANNEX 5
Page 6
(ii) Receivables - Assumed two months sales outstanding; the con-
sultants estimated a maximum of 410,000 tons and a minimum of
100,000 tons for any two consecutive months. An average of
255,000 tons has been taken.
(iii) Inventories
(a)  Stored at Palembap; - one month's bulk output has
been included in PUSRI III production accounts and
is therefore disregarded. For imported purchased
bagged product one month's sales taken - say
25,000 tons.
(b) In Ships - three ships working - assume half are
returning empty at any moment, therefore take
50% (3 x 7,000 tons) = 10,500 tons plus allowance
for some being backhauled - say 12,000 tons.
(c) In Port Terminals - assumed at any one time there
would be 50% of capacity of 60,000 tons, i.e.,
30,000 tons.
(d) In Transit to ISDs - one day's output - say 4,000 tons.
(e) In ISDs - assumed 50% of capacity - say 173,000 tons.
(f) In Retailers stores and Village stores - assumed 105,000
tons.
(iv) Current Liabilities
(a) Payables for purchased fertilizer - one month's purchases
- say 25,000 tons.
(b) Cash operating costs - one month.
Details of prices at each stage, and totals of current assets
and liabilities are given in Attachment V to this Annex.
The estimated net working capital required in 1977 is Rp 29.5 billion.
(v) Financing of Working Capital
The forecasts for PUSRI III indicate a build up of cash surplus
to operating requirements (see Annex 6-8, Page 2 of Report No. 624-IND).
The cumulative figures are: 1975, Rp 4.2 billion; 1976, Rp 7.9 billion;
1977, Rp 18.5 billion; 1978, Rp 31.3 billion; and increasing up to
Rp 84.6 billion by 1982. It is assumed that these funds, excluding a
reserve for emergencies, can be used, as required to finance the working

is Rp 3,050 million (US$7,400); for 1977 it is Rp 2,050 million (US$?4,900).
L.   Interest During Construction
Interest during construction has been calculated on the estimated
annual construction costs to mid-May 1977, the expected date of commencement
of full operation of the project. It assumes on-lending of debt incurred
for the project, (50% of total cost) at an annual interest rate of 12%.

M.  Long-term Debt
Attachment VII to this Annex gives details of amortization
and interest on long-term debt. It assumes repayment over 15-1/2 years,
including 3-1/2 years grace. It also assumes that PUSRI will not have
to serve that portion of debt applicable to the diesel locomotives being
provided for the Railway. Thus the table refers to a debt of US$68 million
(Rp 28,428 million).

Inland Transportation Costs
Assuming that for all average hauls of up to 100 km (actually 103 km taken for calculations), all transport
will be by truck. Of the remainder, and where suitable rail transport exists, assume 75% by rail and 25% by
truck.
