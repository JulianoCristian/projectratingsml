The project comprises the construction of a 500 MW\n            (4 x 125 MW) hydro-power station including all equipment,\n            civil works and a transmission line to the Western Regional\n            grid. Main works include a 90 m high, 1650 m long combined\n            gravity and rock-fill dam, about 4500 m of tunnels and\n            shafts, a powerhouse, and 5 km of discharge channels. The\n            project also includes a pilot thermal plant rehabilitation\n            program designed to provide for more efficient use of\n            MPEB's thermal stations, which will serve as a basis\n            for eventual development of an India-wide rehabilitation\n            program, and improvement and expansion of MPEB's data\n            processing unit and services."}, "docdt": "1984-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
