Some lessons learned\n            included: the original objectives of the project were very\n            narrow. They reflected the Bank's approach to power\n            sector lending in India at the time. The loan performance of\n            the subject project and other State Electricity Board (SEB)\n            projects has had the Bank to shift its strategy to advocate\n            radical restructuring of the state power sector in India.\n            Careful project preparation is important to the ultimate\n            success or failure of the Project. The design of the dam was\n            performed by Central Water Commission (CWC), but the\n            technical parameters and construction methodology were not\n            reviewed by an independent panel of experts. This review was\n            undertaken after project appraisal that resulted in the\n            recommendation by the committee to change the basic design\n            of the dam from rock-fill to concrete structure. This was\n            contested by CWC with resulting uncertainties and long\n            delays. Roles and responsibilities of stakeholders should be\n            fully defined at the project preparation stage. Overlapping\n            responsibilities created major confusion in the\n            implementation of the project. The responsibilities of CWC\n            and Central Electricity Authority (CEA) should have been\n            defined and their respective roles as central organizations\n            overseeing project implementation should have been fully\n            delineated to avoid the conflicting positions taken by these agencies."}, "docdt": "1995-07-24T00:00:00Z"}
