KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
HEALTH DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Loan and Proiect Summary
Borrower                             The Kingdom uf Morocco
Beneficiary                          The Ministry of Public Health (MOPH)
Amount                               US$28.4 million equivalent
Terms                                Payable in 20 years, including five
years of grace at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate. The Borrower
would bear the foreign exchange and
interest rate risks. The loan would
include the refinancing of the PPF
of about US$.08 million equivalent.
Project Description                  The project would assist the Ministry
of Public Health in strengthening
and accelerating the ongoing shift
from an urban-based hospital-oriented
health system to a more cost-effective
system of lrimary care including
family planning. The project would
include: (a) the strengthening of
primary care in three provinces by
upgrading and expanding the physical
infrastructure, provision of equipment,
training of health staff and improving
logistics; (b) the improvement of
MOPE management; (c) the strengthening
of training and IEC programs, and
(d) the improvement of the supply
of basic drugs. The main benefits
of this first project in the health
sector are to provide the Government
with a cost-effective model for primary
care including family planning, while
raising the capacity of the central
MOPE to improve the logistics and
yet control the costs of the health
care delivery system. The main risk
of the project relates to the stringency
of MOPH recurrent budget. This risk
is being addressed by minimizing
incremental operating costs while
reducing unit costs of the services.

I. THE SECTOR
Background
1.01      Morocco is situated in the northwestern corner of Africa.
Forty-five percent of the population is concentrated in the coastal
plains of the north and northwest which occupy only 15% of the total
country area. This region, with its fertile soil, good rainfall and
natural resources, contains most of Morocco's modern agriculture and
industry, and consequently enjoys a higher standard of living than the
rest of the country.
1.02      Morocco is going through a period of economic and financial
difficulties. The growth of real GDP has remained constant since 1979
except for a slight increase in 1980. The budgetary deficit has increased
sharply, reaching 14% of GDP in 1983. The current account deficit has
increased from US$124 million in 1970 to US$1.9 billion or 13% of GDP
in 1983. The debt service ratio increased from 21% in 1979 and 27%
in 1980 to 37% of the value of exports of goods and services in 1983.
Efforts to improve the economic situation have been hampered by:
a) the rise in oil prices from the mid-70s to 1980; b) the severe drought
of 1980-81; c) the increase in the debt service burden due to the appreci-
ation of the US dollar and the rise in international interest rates;
and d) a further decline in 1982 in the world market price of phosphate,
Morocco's chief export.
1.03      Hence, in the years to come, the Government vill face two
major challenges: a) the need to accelerate economic growth; b) the
need to improve the effectiveness of its social policies in reaching
the disadvantaged groups as well as the need to reduce unit costs of
.public services provided to the population. The present project will
help the Government achieve this second objective in the health sector.
A. Population
Population Profile
1.04      Morocco had a population of 21.4 million in 1984.  The crude
birth rate remains high at 46 per 1,000, although the 1980 Fertility
Survey indicates a decline of the crude birth rate, at 41 per 1,000.
The crude death rate has reached 13 per 1,000 in 1980, and the return
of migrants offsets the diminishing emigration. Preliminary results
of the 1982 census reported a total population of 20.3 million, which
indicates a rate of natural increase of 2.9% over the last decade.
The total fertility rate (TmR) is still high at 5.8. Morocco has a
young population as a result of high fertility and a reductio  ='- infant
and child mortality. The proportion below 15 years of age rose steadily
to 42% in 1982, but is expected to decrease slightly in the next few
years. The number of vomen of reproductive age rose from 4.4 million
in 1980 to 5.3 million in mid-1984. Since the number of women of repro-
ductive age is bound to increase, even if fertility declines, the crude
birth rate is likely to remain high until the year 2000.

1.05      Rapid population growth imposes a considerable burden on the
economically active population. The dependency ratio has stabilized
at the very high figure of 96, as the slight decline in the lover age
groups is offset by the increase in the age group 65 and over. In
addition to creating a need for more schools and houses, and ezerting
pressure on food supplies, population growth is responsible for the
increasing drift of population from the countr3 to the towns, now
running at the rate of 300,000 a year.
1.06      In Morocco, fertility is highest among illiterate rural women.
In 1982 the fertility rates for educated and illiterate women were 4.1
and 6.4 respectively. In the same year, the fertility rates for urban
and rural women were 6.3 and 7.4 respectively. If present fertility
continues, the total population could reach 34.4 million by the year
2000; a moderate decline in TFl - to 4.8 in the next five years -
would still result in a population of 32 million. Only a rapid and
sustained decline in TFR from present 5.8 to 2.6 could keep the popu-
lation in the year 2000 below 30 million.
Ponulation Policy
1.07       As early as 1966, the GO  showed its awareness of the
implications of rapid population growth by including a family planning
program in the 1968-72 Development Plan. However, only in 1979 did
MNOPH launch a large-scale family planning program. Although King
Hassan II has reaffirmed the high priority of the population problem,
the Government has not adopted explicit demographic objectives. The
1981-85 Development Plan does not set population targets for any specific
year; it does, however, call for a slower demographic growth and sets
a target of 24% of contraceptive prevalence for 1985 - which would
have resulted in a 23.5 million population in 1985 and eventually 36.9
million in the year 2000. Contraceptive prevalence, however, increased
rapidly and by mid-1983 it surpassed the target 'And reached 25.5%
(Annex A.1). Encouraged by this progress the Government envisages setting
a 33% contraceptive prevalence target for 1990 in the next plan. Assuming
that subsequent five-year plans vould continue to raise contraceptive
targets, the country"s population could be limited to 30 million by
the year 2000. Within the Government, MOPH has full responsibility
for expanding family planning activities, vhile the Ministry of Planning
is responsible for the coordination of policies. Some sectors have,
so far, provided lukewarm support to population activities: population
education in primary and secondary schools or in the Ministry of Youth
and Sports programs has remained insufficient; low coverage of social
security programs, particularly health and retirement insurance, still
acts as an incentive for large families; the legal status of women,
especially the customary legislation on the age of marriage, polygamy
and repudiation, remains a drawback for family planning. The 1986-88
Development Plan should strengthen other sectors' support to population
and should introduce some of the desirable changes in social policies
and legislation.



-3-
Family Plannins Program
1.08      The Government has maintained a policy of integrating family
planning and health programs. IOPH has placed its Population and NCI
Divisions under a single Directorate of Technical Affairs (DAT). DAT
executive.i have been the pioneers and are the most active promoters
of family planning in the country; they have successfully mobilized
resources and staff into an integrated MCR/FP program.
1.09      MOPE has clear family planning objectives:  birth spacing
through .reast-feeding and contraception by modern methods - especially
condoms, pills, IUDs and tubal ligations. Priority target groups are
multiparous w.,men, teenagers, and women over 35 years. MOPE distributes
contraceptives through all its 1,426 outpatient facilities. Family
planning clinics are held in all dispensaries, health centers and outpatient
departments of hospitals. In addition to external funding, government
expenditures on family planning in 1983 reached US$6.9 million - US$1.5
per woman of reproductive age. In spite of these efforts, the national
program does not reach the entire population, many of whom live in inaccessible
areas. With a view to increasing coverage, in 1979 NOPE initiated,
with support from USAID and UNFPA, a pilot outreach project known as
Visites a Domicile de Motivation Systemtique (VDNS). Under this program,
paramedical personnel make five annual visits to every household with
a woman of reproductive age to give family planning information or advice
and to supply contraceptives, or direct women to Reference Centers or
Mobile Units for I1ID insertion or tubal ligation. After a successful
test in the Province of Marrakech, the VDNS system was extended to three
more provinces and expanded to include health education, the distribution
of oral rehydration salts, iron tablets and nutrition supplements and
referral for immunization, which proved effective and well-accepted.
A 1983 USAID evaluation of the program showed that contraceptive prevalence
had risen from 24% to 41% in Meknes and 52Z in Marrakech, compared with
the national average of 25.5%. According to the USAID report, the experience
has demonstrated that: a) family planning, hone visits and contraceptive
distribution by male and female health workers are well-accepted in
Morocco; b) the provision of family services through the existing health
services is the best vay of ensuring long-term-availability and coverage;
and c) an efficient family planning program can be conducted in the
absence of high visibility policy statements. MOPE will extend the
program to the rest of the country. Over the next five years, the five
largest urban areas and 16 provinces will be given priority, 13 provinces
would be financed by USAID and three by the Health Development Project.
1.10      Family planning progra  are supported by Information/Education/
Coimunication (IEC) activities. The Health Education Unit in MOPH's
Population Division is responsible for the production of IEC materials
for FP and PEC, but because it is also expected to meet the printing
needs of the whole MOPH, it is overtaxed and finds it difficult to perform



- I4-
its primary function adequately. As a result, manuals and handouts
on family planning and NCR are insufficient and unattractive; IEC messages
for family planning - posters, pamphlets, audiotapes, TV and radio
spots - are often too theoretical. MOPH has 22 large IEC tractor-trailers,
fully equipped for exhibits and projections of 16 and 32    films, but
they are restricted to the main roads. They have proved useful for
urban and suburban populations but bad only a limited impact in rural
areas.
1.11      Other Ministries and government agencies, such as Education,
Social Affairs, Agriculture, Youth and Sports, are increasingly supporting
the population program, and the Ministry of Planning is coordinating
their activities. A private body, the Association Marocaine de Plani-
fication Familiale (AMPF), supported by the International Planned Parenthood
Federation (IPPF), operates family planning centers and programs for
the distribution of contraceptives, trains private physicians in contraceptive
methods, produces and disseminates IEC materials. USAID, the main foreign
contributor to family planning, provides US$3.6 million per year on
average. UNFPA has provided a total of US$8.7 million over the last
ten years. These funds have been used to provide technical assistance,
infrastructure, equipment and vehicles, training, demographic studies
and a National Household Survey. In addition to UNFPA, UNDP, UNICEF,
WHO and USAID-supported Johns Hopkins Programs of International Education
in gynecology and obstetrics (JHPIEGO) have provided technical assistance
and training, as well as support for MOPH's Center for Human Reproduction
in Rabat, which conducts national and international training programs
in tubal ligation for physicians.
B.  Nutrition
Nutritional Status
1.12      The Moroccan rural population in general is poorly nourished.
The last nutrition survey, conducted in 1971, revealed that 42% of children
under four years of age suff'-!..d from moderate protein-calorie malnutrition,
5% from severe malnutrition and 23% suffered from rickets. Forty-five
percent of rural children under four years of age suffered from moderate
and 6X from severe malnutrition. Although the average birth weight and
height of Moroccan newborn children exceed normal standards, a serious
deterioration takes place between 10 and 48 months. For example, at 24
months of age, the average height and weight of children are 7.3 cm and
2 kg respectively below normal. This deterioration is due to abrupt
weaning, undernutrition and unsanitary conditions. Among the adult
population, pregnant and lactating women on the average have a calorie
intake 12% below the desirable minimum, and suffer from iron deficiency
anemia, which is aggravated by successive pregnancies and short intervals
between births.



-5-
1.13      The nutritional status markedly improved in the aid-seventies
when food production was abundant. At the same time rickets was virtually
eradicated througn a large-scale NCR program and administration of long-acting
injectable Vitamin D. There is reason to believe that the nutritional
status has deteriorated since 1980; the analysis of the 1983 National
Survey on Housebold Expenditure data and a survey of the nutrition of
children under four years of age planned to begin early in 1985 will
provide up-to-date information on the nutritional status of the population.
Causes of Malnutrition
1.14      The most important causes of malnutrition are inadequate food
production and consumption, bad infant feeding practices and poor environ-
mental hygiene:
(a)  Food Production Patterns.  The decline in agricultural production
since the 1970s caused by variations in rainfall and the recent
drought has contributed to the poor nutritional status of
the population. Before 1970, Morocco produced enough cereals
to meet its domestic needs. However, the rate of growth of
agricultural outrut had fallen drastically from 4.7% in the
1960s to -0.3% by 1979. This failure of food production to
keep pace with population has created food shortages and increased
dependence on imports. In the high Atlas mountain ranges
and semi-desert areas of the South, protein-calorie malnutrition
as well as vitamin deficiencies are due to seasonal food shortages.
(b) Food Consumption Patterns. The 1971 Nutrition Survey showed
that the average calorie and protein intake of Moroccans is
good. However, the typical diet is unbalanced and low in
animal protein and fats. The intake of nutrients varies considerably
from one income group and from one geographical region to
another. In urban areas, the calorie intake of affluent groups
averages 110% of requirements, compared with 75Z in shanty
towns. In "he rural areas of the South, the average calorie
intake is 81% of requirements. Protein-calorie malnutrition
is severe among low-income groups (DE 466 and below), farm
workers, self-employed, artisans, and unemployed. The calorie
intake of this group ranges from 61S to 66% of requirements.
(c) Infant Feeding Practices.  The decline in breast-feeding in
recent years may endanger the nutrition and health of young
children. During weaning, breast milk or infant formulas
are supplemented by vheat or barley only, causing protein
deficiency around 14 months WQen weaning is completed.-
(d) Environmental Sanitation. The nutritional value of food is
often reduced by improper preparation. Contaminated food
and water are prime causes of infant diarrhea, in turn an
important contributing factor to malnutrition.



Government Nutrition Policies and Programs
1.15      In spite of the GOM's recognition of the critical need to
improve nutrition, Morocco has no intersectoral food and nutrition policy.
MOPH is responsible for crinical services and nutrition education while
an interministerial committee under the Ministry of Planning was expected
to coordinate food and nutrition policies, but has remained inactive.
To follow up on a food strategy study, carried out by the Government
with CIDA assistance, an intersectoral task force, under the Ministry
of Agriculture, has completed by June 1984, a first phase of analysis
and is presently developing alternatives for a food strategy.
1.16      Within its limited responsibilities MOPH has addressed the
problem of malnutrition in the following ways:
(a) Nutrition education and IEC tbrough mass media, mobile units,
VDHS and clinics.  The effect_veness of such interventions
bas not been evaluated.
(b) Nutrition surveillance through clinical screening of infants,
pregnant and lactating vomen. However, in 1979 the program
reached only IOZ of children in the 0 to 2 age group.
(c) Nutrition rehabilitation through distribution of Actamin,
a protein-rich weaning flour, in MCR clinics. Actamin is
also-sold at a subsidized price in pharmacies. The production
and distribution of Actamin have proved costly, and MOPE is
seeking suitable alternatives.
1.17      MOPH programs for combating malnutrition are well-conceived
but require better definition and targeting. Active rather than passive
detection would increase coverage. Coordination with immunizations
and oral rehydration techniques would increase the efficiency of the
program.
1.18      The Ministry of Social Affairs also conducts nutrition education
and food distribution programs, the Ministry of Education provides nutrition
education in schools, and the Ministry of Agriculture promotes food
crop and home gardening. Hovever, there is little effective coordination
of the efforts of these other ministries with those of MOPE.
C. Health
Health Status
1.19      In spite of its low per capita income, Morocco, like its neighbors,
Algeria and Tunisia, exhibits a steady decline of infectious and parasitic
diseases. The deatb rate, which fell from 17.5 per 1,000 in 1970 to



13.5 in 1980, is estimated at 12 per 1,000 in 1984. Life ezpectancy
rose steadily from 50 years in 1970 to 56 in 1980. The high infant
mortality, more than 100 per 1,000, and the prevalence of malnutrition
and tuberculosis indicate, hovever, that these favorable trends may
have slowed dow.
1.20      Moroccan health statistics are incomplete, and the basic
health data necessary for planning are insufficient. Births are grossly
underreported or reported late, and death certificates do not require
recording the cause of death. To supplement the inadequate data base,
MOPE has relied on specific studies; however, the more comprebensive
and therefore more useful indicators, such as age-specific mortality,
infant, child and maternal mortality, and causes of morbidity, are not
available. Statistics on mortality by causes and age groups are based
on deaths in hospitals - only 13% of total deaths -- and satisfactory
death certificates, which account for only 1.5% of total deaths, are
thus not representative of the entire population.
1.21      Mortality. MOPE officially reported the Infant Mortality
Rate (IMR) at 91 per 1,000 live births in 1981. However, realistic
estimates put it at 120 per 1,000. Deaths in the first year of life
account for 43Z of total mortality. Studies on infant mortality reveal
a disparity between income groups; in the modern urban sectors, infant
mortality is estimated at 60 per 1,000, but it reaches 170 per 1,000
in the periurban shanty towns. Infant mortality in rural areas ranges
from 110 in the plains to 150 in the mountains. Such distressingly
high death rates compare poorly with countries with similar GDP and
geographic settings, and raise questions about the coverage of MCH/FP
services, and about the effectiveness and coverage of health services
in general. The chief causes of infant mortality are diarrheal
syndromes, acute respiratory infections, communicabLe diseases and
tuberculosis, all of which account for 61% of all diagnosed motives
of consultation for children under one-year and are the consequences
of poverty, malnutrition and poor environment (Annex A.4).
1.22      Maternal mortality is high.  Statistics for 1972 show an
excess of deaths among women aged 15-49, compared with men in the same
age group, attributable mainly to maternal mortality, which peaks between
the ages of 35 and 40 years. This suggests that maternal mortality
was of the order of 530 per 100,000 births in 1972, as in other countries
at a similar stage of development (compared with 9.9 for the United
States in 1978). Since 1972 better access to care has reduced maternal
mortality drastically in urban areas. In rural areas, however, access
to MCE and family planning services and health and nutrition education
have not improved significantly. The number of obstetrical emergency
admissions as well as the number of deaths associated with hospital
deliveries indicates that maternal mortality is still high in rural
areas.



-8-
1.23      Morbidity.  Morocco has been able to relieve itself from the
burden of tropical diseases since most of them were controlled in the
1970s, and the climate and terrain do not favor their rapid spread.
Malaria, once endemic in the coastal plains, has been virtually eradicated,
although a costly surveillance program is still necessary to prevent
reinfestation from outside Morocco. Scattered small foci of urinary
schistosomiasis, of which there were 7,400 cases in 1983, are under
control. In 1983 a Bank-financed assessment of the risk of malaria
and schistosomiasis in areas of irrigation development, indicated a
moderate potential for increase in some areas.
1.24      Morocco is going through a period of epidemiological transition
in which, while infectious diseases are still prevalent, chronic and
degenerative diseases are becoming increasingly important. Infectious
diseases, favored by poor housing and sanitation and malnutrition, are
diminishing but still prevalent among the poor and in rural areas.
Chief among them are diarrhea, measles, acute respiratory infections,
typhoid, hepatitis Type A, rheumatic fever, skin and eye infections,
and tuberculosis. Morocco, however, has already reacbed the stage of
"intermediate pathology", characteristic of urban populations: accidents,
gastrointestinal dysfunctions, neuro-psychiatric disorders and addictions
and the need for dental, surgical, gynecological and obstetrical treatment
requiring considerable radiological and laboratory support. The increasing
demand for secondary care is due partly to the rising expectations of
some groups, but also partly to limited access to care on the part of
others, which means that ailments easy to cure in their early stages
are often not treated until complications arise. Finally, the incidence
of chronic and degenerative diseases characteristic of industrial countries,
such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, chronic lung conditions,
cancer and occupational diseases, is rising as life expectancy increases.
In Morocco, the overlapping in recent years of all three phases of this
epidemiological transition has imposed heavy burdens on the staff and
facilities of the health services and on national finances.
Environment
1.25      Limited access to potable water, particularly in periurban
slums and rural areas, lack of sewerage and inadequate housing contribute
to the high incidence of infectious diseases in Morocco.
1.26      Water SuDDly. The Office National de l'Eau Potable (ONEP)
under the Ministry of Equipment is responsible for supplying urban centers
with potable water. Distribution within the larger towns is managed
by municipal enterprises ("regies") and in the smaller towns, by ONEP
itself. In 1981, 72% of the urban population vas served by public water
systems - 35% by house connections and 37% by public standpipes. Only
half of the latter vere within reasonable walking distance and served
fever than 500 persons. In rural areas only 7% of the population have
access to piped water, and the remaining 93% rely on unregulated vater
sources - wells, cisterns, rainfall collectors, streams and ponds --



-9-
often contaminated by humn ezcreta. Waterborse diseases, in particular
typhoid and dysentery, are still prime causes of desth and disease.
NOPE, through its Service de l'Hygiine du Milieu, is responsible for
the control of water quality and the disinfection of some 100,000 water
points in the country. The Service conducted 124,000 disinfections
in 1982, which represents little uore than 10Z of total needs, since
the average water point should be treated ten tims a year. It is unrealistic
to expect NOPE to do all this work, and the solution seems to be in
delegating some of the responsibilities - particularly the enforcement
of regulations - to municipalities, and eliciting comunity involvement.
The Ministry of Agriculture and the Genie Rural made several attempts
to improve rural water supply by providing handpumps, motor pumps, reservoirs
and water towers, to be operated and maintained by local communities;
one year later, most of the facilities provided were underutilized or
abandoned. This experience showed clearly that such interventions should
be tailored to local cultures if they are to produce health benefits.
1.27     Seweraoe.  Urban sewerage systems have not been expanded to
keep pace with population, particularly in periurban slums. Medium-size
tonns often discharge untreated sewage into rivers.  In rural areas,
only 14Z of households have latrines and there is no provision for solid
waste disposal. A 1981 sanitation survey of 18,552 rural households
in the Province of Settat revealed the deplorable state of the water
supply and sewerage systems.
1.28      Housint. Overcrowded and crude housing helps to spread disease.
Over the last decade, private and public housing construction has not
kept pace witb urban population. It is estimated that 252 of the population
live in squatter settlements and another lOZ in housing dilapidated
beyond repair. The 1982 Population and lousing Survey showed an average
of 2 nuclear families per household in urban localities, and 2.6 in
rural areas.
1.29      In 1984 under the preparation of the proposed project, MOPH
carried out, with the support of UNICEF and the collaboration of the
Institut Agronomique Hassan It, a study of the socio-cultural determinants
of hygiene and sanitation in periurban and rural areas. The study identified
suitable interventions based on comunity commitment which would be
implemented under the proposed Health Development Project.
Health Services and Proiraus
1.30      Health Providers- There are four health providers in Morocco:
the HOPE, the Caisse Nationale de la Securite Sociale (CNSS), the Armed
Forces, and the private sector.
1.31      NOPE is the largest provider of health care; in 1982 it delivered
6.4 million aedical consultations, 31.6 million units of nursing and
preventive care, and 5.8 million hospital days. The number of average
bealth contacts per person/year (1.8) and hospital days per 1,000 population



- 10 -
(276) would suffice to ensure acceptable bealth and medical care if
the quality and efficiency could be enhanced. Under the present conditions
and limited resources, however, MOPE can meet only part of the demand.
MOPE is too often the provider of last resort that assumes expensive
care such am long-term treatment for chronic and psychiatric diseases,
cancer and terminal illnesses. Other providers rely heavily on the
public service to provide unprofitable treatment and technology. MOPH
is the only provider of preventive care and public health programs.
1.32      The Caisse Nationale de la Securite Sociale (CNSS) was, until
recently, a health insurance scheme that financed medical care provided
mainly by the private sector and, to a lesser extent, by MOPH. In 1982
the Caisse opened its own hospitals and clinics, and became a provider
offering medical care on a fee-for-service basis. In 1982 the CNSS
provided 500,000 medical consultations and 250,000 hospital days -
about 71 of total medical care in the country. The CNSS offers the
kind of service that attracts middle-income members, and competes aggres-
sively with private physicians, but poorer people find it too expensive
and continue to seek care in MOPH facilities.
1.33      The Realth Service of the Armed Forces serves uniformed personnel
and their families, who form 5Z of the population.
1.34      Private physicians and dentists and private hospitals primarily
serve the higher-income groups. Because private physicians are often
underequipped and poorly monitored, they do not in general offer significantly
better care than MOPH. While the rapid expansion of private practice,
which took place in the 1970s, was welcomed as relieving the strain
on the overburdened public services, the competition of the CNSS has
almost brought this expansion to a stop.
1.35      Urban and rural populations often resort to other providers
for advice or treatment. In 1981 pharmacists and herbalist. provided
7.5Z of primary care contacts. Although traditional healers are not
legally recognized and their activities are not recorded, they still
play an important part in health care. Modern dental care is only available
in urban areas; the rest of the population resort to traditional healers
for extraction. MOPH operates a small preventive program in dental
health.
Government Health Policy
1.36      Although the GOM assigns high priority to health, its allocation
of funds to the sector remains very low, both in relative terms at 1.2S
of GDP, and absolute terms at US$8.35 per capita in 1982, compared with
Algeria vith US$22.0, and Tunisia vith US$31.21. The Government's declared
priority on health should be viewed in the light of this fundamental
limitation. The Government is aware of the pressing needs in health,
population and nutrition; it is also aware of the modest but nevertheless
rising demands of urban populations for care, and would like to come



- 11 -
up with a cost-effective organization of health services. The last
two Plans reflect a change of health service pattern from the one based
on private practice and large hospitals, to one more appropriate to
Morocco's present needs and financial situation.
1.37      The ambitious program of investment in large hospitals proposed
in the 1977-80 Development Plau - 78% to hospitals and 16Z to basic
care -- was curtailed in the course of the ezecution of the Plan in
favor of health centers and dispensaries. Nevertheless, operating budgets
for basic health services remained insufficient. As a result, the primary
care system had a slow start.
1.38      The 1981-85 Develo2ment Plan marked a sharp departure from
the previous policy, giving priority to basic health services and allocating
55Z of the investment budget to basic health care and 45Z to hospitals
over the five-year period. This policy change was reflected in subsequent
annual investment budgets: the 1983-84-85 investment budgets allocated
a total of DR 314 million to basic health care and DE 199 million to
hospitals. The Plan had set precise MCR, family planning, iiuunizations,
health education and basic sanitation objectives for basic health.
It also gave priority to improving the management of basic health services
by decentralized programming, improved rinagement information systems,
and upgraded training of personnel. Most important, the Plan recommended
the exploration of alternatives to the present health care delivery
system. To this effect, the Plan outlined the present Health Development
Project in the provinces of Agadir and Settat, it set up a separate
allotment of DR 60 million (US$6 million) in the investment budget,
and requested Bank assistance for this purpose.
Public Realth Services
1.39      Since 1981, budgetary limitations, particularly those imposed
on the operating budget, have hampered the implementation of the Plan.
MOPE services are presently ill-prepared to meet the increasing demand.
1.40      Overall, the health delivery system is still centered on urban
facilities. Hospitals, urban health centers and urban dispensaries
still retain most of the resources and prestige and continue to attract
rural populations seeking care. As a consequence, the outpatient services
of the urban facilities are overburdened - in spite of generous staffing
- and the resulting quality of care is inadequate. In rural areas,
rural health centers and dispensaries provide primary care without adequate
back-up by urban services - i.e. laboratory and X-ray services - and
without effective supervision and logistical support. The shortage
of drugs, which will be discussed in paras. 1.3 to 1.67, drastically
limits the efficiency of the services. Outreach activities are coordinated
by the "Service de l'Infrastructure d'Actions Ambulatoires Provinciales"
(SIAhP): male itinerant nurses, based in each dispensary, are expected-
to make monthly visits to every household in the cosmunity to provide
first aid, health education, sanitation advice and to take blood samples



- 12 -
for malaria control. However, the monthly visit *chedule proved
unrealistic. As the itinerant nurse lackc the most basic drugs and
only collects blood samples, his credibility is low - in sao areas
he is openly rejected by the population.
1.41      Because of these weaknesses, the actual coverage of public
health programs is low. MCR and PP reach only 301 of their target popu-
lations; prenatal care covers only 5.4Z of all pregnancies; only 112
of deliveries take place in maternities; less than 201 of infants from
O to 2 years of age are monitored by child health clinics, nutrition
programs reacb only a small percentage of the population at risk; visits
per person/year declined from 2.45 in 1976 to 1.8 in 1982; and
immunization programs bad reached only 451 of the target group by 1983.

1.42      Morocco's hospital network is on a small scale for a middle-
income country, but is generally sufficient. It includes 80 institutions:
2 university hospitals for specialized care, 44 general hospitals and
34 bospitals for long-term care. There are 24,913 hospital beds, or
1.2 beds per 1,000 population, a minimum by international standards.
Making better use of existing beds is a higher priority than providing
additional beds. The network, as it is, could provide acceptable coverage
if managment and performance were improved; bed turnover is slow, and
average occupancy low at 63.51 (Annex A.8). The radiological, diagnostic
and laboratory equipment is generally appropriate, but lack of maintenance
results in costly repairs and replacements. There is no technical unit
in charge of hospitals -- neither hospital technology nor hospital manage-
ment -- in MOPH. The Ministry, however, sees an urgent need for studies
on hospital organization and management with a view to improving efficiency,
cost effectiveness, and uaintenance. The Bealtb Development Project
will finance such studies.
1.43      The outpatient services consist of 840 dispensaries and 297
health centers. Most of the existing dispensaries are rudimentary,
and poorly equipped. Facilities are spread too tbinly and coverage
is inadequate. According to MOPE's standards, there should be one health
center for every 45,000 people and one dispensary for every 15,000 people.
The actual ratios are one center for every 84,000 people and one dispensary
for every 25,000. To meet the standards countrywide, some 90 additional
centers and 460 additional dispensaries would be needed. The detailed
planning exercise carried out for the preparation of the project confirmed
that a 55.T expansion of the physical facilities was necessary to reach
801 of the population.
1.44      Outpatient and outreach services rely beavily on transport,
vhich accounts for 321 of their recurrent costs. The average itinerant



- 13 -
nurse travels 19.3 km per working day. The average four-wheel vehicle
travels 30.000 km per year, often in rugged terrain, and lasts two and
a half years. The choice of vehicles is still sn unresolved problem.
HOPE plans to test alternstives to the current bicycles, mopeds and
landrovers, such as 125-cc motorcycles sad light pick-ups. It is also
exploring incentives for the proper operation and maintenance of vehicles,
such as bonuses, transfer of the vehicle to the user after three years,
leasing and concessionary loans for the acquisition of vehicles.
Hunan Resources
1.45      Medical Personnel.  The training of physicians is the responsi-
bility of the universities under the supervision of the Ministry of
Education and MOPE. There are at present 4,000 physicians in the country.
evenly distributed between public and private practice. The physician/
population ratio reached 2 per 10,000 by mid-1984, and is increasing
rapidly as 700 new physicians graduate annually. Even if this ratio
is still low, compared vith other middle-income countries, it is not
possible to determine how many physicians will be required or what form
their training should be until MOPH defines the long-run structure of
the bealtb sector through the present project. In 1978, the two medical
schools agreed to reduce their total output to 400 per annu and to
strengthen training in public health and preventive medicine. Two small
dental schools opened in 1981 and will progressively expand their student
intake. A school of Pharmacy is scheduled to open in 1985. In the
meantime, the majority of dentists and pharmacists are still trained
abroad.
1.46      Administrative Personnel.  Over 170 graduates wf the Ecole
Nationale d'Administration Publique (ERAP) are now employed in MOPE,
chiefly as managers of the big bospitals and provincial services. In
1983 the ENAP, in collaboration with MOPH, created a s*pcialized section
in Public Reath Administration. The new curriculum comprises public
aduinistration, health administration and economics and hospital management.
This section vill provide MOPE with young and qualified managers who
will be instrumental in improving the management of the services.
1.47      Paramedical Personnel.  The training of paramedical personnel,
conducted at the College of Public Health and 48 schools for nurses
and technicians, is the responsibility of MOPH. Paramedical personnel
consist of three levels of nurses and technicians: a) 16,000 basic
nurses, wbo provide the rank and file staffing of the services;
b) 6,000 certified nurses and technicians, who provide the intermediate
staffiug; and c) 400 specialized nurses or "cadristes", who fill key
positions in management, supervision, training and research. By and
large, paramedical personnel are well-qualified and well-distributed.
Details of categories of personnel are given in Annexes A.5 and A.6.
1.48      MOPH has a total payroll of 29,000 persons, including 1,100
physicians, 18,000 paramedicals and 6,000 support personnel. Unlike
many developing countries, the pyramid of personnel is well-balanced



- 14 -
and there are no serious shortages. Liberal estimates of future manpover
requirements, made in the prosperous oid-1970c encouraged a substantial
ezpansion of training capacity and of the staff of the public health
service. In 1982 severe budgetary restrictions necessitated the curtailment
of hiring. MOPH will reassess its manpower requirements in the light
of the present financial situation and of the cbanging pattern of the
healtb services. In particular, it will have to take account of the
Solloving factors: a) the basic health services will require auxiliary
personnel for rural work, with a shorter training period and lower salaries
(one year of training after two or three years of secondary education
is envisaged); b) in isolated areas, utilization of comunity health
workers, community uidwives, and traditional birth attendants is bei'g
explored; c) the need for fully qualified nurses, technicians (ASDES)
and cadristes will increase; their training should be intensified.
1.49      More generally, NOPE considers the desirability of training
technicians with possibilities of self-employment, such as opticians,
herbalists, dental hygienists, dental assistants, physiotherapists,
and prostbetic technicians, who could serve in the private sector, and
thus impose no burden on the national budget.
1.30      NOPE, therefore, sees the need for a comprehensive review
of healtb mAnpower requirements covering the public, parastatal and
private sectors. However, NOPH does not envisage unilateral changes
until the Government defines the role of specific training progrms,
such as those carried out by NOPH within the context of its new Vocational
Training Strategy, presently under preparation with lank assistance.
1.51      The quality of nursing education is generally adequate.  However,
the training of certified nurses has been impaired in recent years because
of inadequate facilities. The health component of the Bank's Third
Education Project, appraised in 1976, provided for the construction
and equipment of a College of Public health in Rabat, but it was only
partially implemented because of MOPE inexperience of lank projects,
and due to time-consuming administrative procedures. Eventually, the
College was constructed under the project, but not provided with a library,
textbooks, laboratory, demonstration equipment and vehicles. The Health
Development Project will finance the completion of this component.
Financial Resources
1.52      Total public health expenditure amounts to about 1.22 of GDP,
i.e. much less than in other middle-income countries, such as the
Philippines and Syria (2.4S), Zambia (3.4Z) or Jordan (5.2S). They
represent only 32 of total goverment outlays, a proportion which has
declined from 7.8Z in 1965 to 3.01 in 1983 and a budgeted 3.51 for 1984,
as shown in Annex A.9. As the COM fionaces 90S of public health expenditure
(81 are covered by the national social security system, and the remaining
2S by individual households), this decline has serious implications
for national health.



- 15 -
1.53      Annual cgaital expenditure on health has fluctuated from
DR 244 million in 1983, compared with DR 300 million in 1982 and a projected
figure of DH 139 million (US$15 million) for 1984, and has fallen steadily
as a proportion of total public investment, from 3.2Z in 1965, to 1.3X
in 1983 (see Annex A.9). Until the late 1970's about 70S of this capital
expenditure was on hospitals, but under the 1981-85 Development Plan,
the share of hospitals is expected to decrease to 60Z.
1.54      Oneratinf expenditures also have declined as a proportion
of total public recurrent expenditure, from 9.7Z between 1965 to 4.5Z
in 1983; no change is expected in 1984 as these are budgeted at DE 918
million, or 4.8% of Government's total operating budget. Salaries absorb
an increasing share of the sector's current resources and their proportion
increased from 56.4% in 1965, to 70.52 in 1983 and 74.3Z in 1984. This
trend has had a serious negative impact on the sector, especially at
the outreach level, as less and less resources are left to cover other
operating expenditure, such as drugs, maintenance and transport, resulting
in the perceptible deterioration of the quality and coverage of services.
1.55      As a step towards improving the finances of the public health
service, MOPE explores possibilities of cost recovery. Recent surveys
have shown unexpectedly high household expenditure on health care and
drugs, thus demonstrating people's willingness to pay for health care.
Hovever, it would be unrealistic to expect people to pay for services
of the present quality until the reputation of the system has been restored.
To determine the feasibility and range of cost recovery for preventive
and curative care for ambulatory and hospital servicos, MOPE gives high
priority to the analysis of current costs and future sector financing
for vhich studies are included in the Health Development Project.
E. Sectoral Issues
Health Care Delivery System
1.56      Since the late 70s, MOPH has given priority to continue deploying
the primary care system progressively over the entire country. However,
MOPE underestimated the technical, financial and managerial problems
of the task. As a result, the system remains incomplete and has never
been in full operation, with all necessary inputs in any area. As MOPH
lacked capacity to monitor the system, early signs that it vas not functioning
according to expectations were misinterpreted. In 1977 operating budgets
declined in real terms. The scarce supplies were concentrated in hospitals.
Implementation of the PHC system slowed down considerably. -Outreach
activities, in particular, were soon crippled by a variety of shortages
and came to a minimum when the drug supply dropped in 1980. As a result,
Norocco is presently maintaining an ineffective PBC system at high cost.



- 16 -
1.57      NOPE nov appreciates the technical difficulties and, with
the help of field staff, bas improved the design of the PlC system. The
technical difficulties relate to the targeting of activities, utilization
of appropriate technology, supervision, delegation of responsibilities,
referral and back-up by rural bospitals. MOPH has clearly identified
these problems in the 1981-85 Development Plan and is ready to deploy
the new PHC scheme in three provinces under the Health Development Project.
Nanaaement
1.58      NOPE is responsible for the policy making of the public sector
only. The parastatal and private subsectors have developed without
coordination, resulting in duplications and social inequities. The
capacity of MOPE to plan its own operations and control resource allocation
and costs is limited. Decision-making in WMQO is still highly centralized
in the office of the Minister and the Secretary General. The Directorate
of Technical Affairs (DAT) is responsible for health programs and the
Directorate of Administrative Affairs (DAA) is responsible for the day-to-day
management of the Ministry (Annex 1.1).
1.59      MOPE has had in the past a limited planning responsibility
for coord4uating all agencies - public and private - in the sector.
The Ministry has also demonstrated a limited capacity to program its
internal operations. Since 1980, however, following a WHO recoumendation
supported by successive Bank miscions, the 'Division de l'lnfrastructure
Charg&e de la Planification (DICP) has been strengthened. In 1983 and
1984, project preparation helped tu further improve the DICP by attracting
additional qualified staff and opening vider sectoral issues to discussion.
1.60      Since 1981, USAID-financed technical assistance, aimed at
improving the management of MOPE, has achieved results in several areas,
particularly in computerizing DICP's operations - inventories, record
systems, processing of statistical, research and personnel data. Broader
managerial or organizational issues have been addressed. MOPH is presently
conmitted to improving day-to-day management before any major structural
reform could be envisaged. The Ministry has identified key areas in
management to be strengthened under the project.
Supply of Basic Drums
1.61      Morocco consumed DE 800 million (US$95 million) vorth of drugs
in 1983, i.e. DE 40 (US$4.76) per capita. Of this total, MOPE distributed
DR 47 million (US$5.6 million) worth or less than 6Z, and of this amount
only US$0.5 million vorth, i.e. 0.5Z of national consumption, went to
primary care, the rest going to hospitals. Primary care services are
presently supplied with an average of US$0.15 worth of drugs per person/year;
MDPE estimates instead that a minimum of US$0.40 per capita is necessary
to support primary care.



- 17 -
1.62      Between 1982 and 1984, MOPE, vith the assistance of USAID,
UNICEF and WHO, oade several studies which identified the technical
and managerial deficiencies of the present Drug Supply system:
(i)  Technical deficiencies:  There is no standard list of drugs,
and the hea'th services. and hospitals base their requisitions
on individual preference or on what they used in the previous
year. A survey of the demand for primary care (Annez A.4)
coupleted in 1984, led to a standardization of treatments
and a standard list of basic drugs that vill be tested in
1985. The most common errors of prescription have been
identified, - errors of indication, dosage and duration of
treatment as vell as utilization of antibiotics as placebos.
Finally, most drugs are supplied in bulk to dispensaries and
health centers which, lacking suitable packaging material,
dispense them in paper cones without labels and instructions.
Patients' compliance with treatment instructions is poor.
5ii)   M_nexerial deficiencies:  Responsibilities for the supply
of drugs are scattered in different services of the Ministry:
the allocation and control of drug supplies rest with the
authority of the Service de l'Equipement; procurement of drugs
is under the Service du Budget, both under the DAA; reception,
storage and control of stocks are the responsibilities of
the Central Pharmacy (CP) under the DAT, while standardization
rests with the DICP. Little coordination ezists between these
services, clearances require moving papers back and forth.
Procurement is not carried out efficiently. There are usually
delays through the several services involved in specifying
items to be procured and in evaluating tenders. In addition,
manufacturers do not submit tenders for all items and frequently
fail to deliver on schedule. and finally, pjyments to providers
are made with considerable delay. Druge are stored together
with medical equipments and furniture, as well as chemicals
and flammables. The CP"s dilapidateed wareh,%use makes storage
unsafe and the handling of drugs and chemicals hazardous.
Inventory control procedures are obsolete.
1.63      Taking into account all negative factors -  inefficient
selection and procurement, losses, thefts, misprescription and poor
compliance -- less than one-third of the PHC drug allocation actually
produces health benefits. A drastic improvement of the public sector
drug supply system is essential.
1.64      For its own use, MOPE prepares some forty basic drugs in the
CP's formulation unit. The formulation laboratory operates in unsuitable
and dilapidated premises, processing does not comply with safety regulations,
packaging is unsafe and unattractive. In order to simplify, reduce
or even discontinue the formulation of basic drugs, NOPE has explored
several alternatives such as procurement of brand-name or generic drugs



- 18 -
on the international and national markets, contracting with the local
industry and, finally, 'Toll Formulation" by which MOPE would buy inter-
mediate ingredients on the open international market and contract vith
local industry for their final formulation. Local industry has indicated
interest in toll processing the most complex and expensive of the basic
drugs, an alternative which will greatly simplify NOPE formulation.
The various alternatives considered by the Appraisal Mission are described
in Annex G.
1.65      The 1981-85 Health Development Plan provided for the reorganization
of HOPH's drug system and improvement of the supply of basic drugs. To
this effect, the Plan earmarked DR 12 million (US$2.3 million equivalent
in 1981). This amount is allocated in the 1984-85 Loi des Finances
as counterpart funds for a drug component of the Health Development
Project.
F. Summary Assessment of the Sector
1.66      Since 1980 MOPE has recognized the need to give priority to
primary health care, but budgetary limitations have left the reorganization
of HOPH incomplete and health programs -- family planning, i munizations,
MCH, nutrition - unconsolidated. Over a period of economic stagnation
and diminishing family incomes, high fertility, rapid demographic growth,
unresolved health problems, malnutrition and poor sanitation may inflict
irreparable biological damage to tbe poprlation with severe long-term
consequences for the economic and social development of the country.
1.67      The sector faces several issues:  the ineffective system of
health care delivery, presently biased towards urban care; the absence
of policymaking in HOPE and consequently the lack of coordination between
different health care providers; the weakness of HOPH's internal planning
and management; inefficient use of resources by the hospital subsector;
insufficient overall financing of the sector; MOPE's disorganized and
complex pharmaceutical supply, resulting in a severe shortage of basic
drugs which threatens the credibility of the entire system.
1.68      The sector has, however, valuable assets as compared to many
countries at the same stage of development: first, its well-qualified
and well-balanced health manpower, with neither overproduction of doctors
nor shortages of technicians.  Second, its unsophisticated hospital
network which, once made more efficient, would not impose the customary
overwhelaing burden on the sector finances. Third, the realistic but
positive attitude of key executives in NOPH towards priority interventions
- family planning, primary care and managerial improvement. NOPH is
keenly aware of its own limitations. It recognizes that at present
it is impossible to expand its facilities or assume new responsibilities,
and that a period of consolidation and reorganization is necessary before



- 19 -
expansion can be resumed.  The technical and managerial aspects (f the
new system have been carefully studied and tested on a small scale,
and are now ready for the implementation of the changes outlined in
the Plan.
G. Government's Obiectives and Bank Role
1.69      The Bank's overall strategy in Morocco pursues three major
objectives: a) financing high yielding export-oriented or import-
substitution activities as well as supporting infrastruckure and services;
b) increasing domestic resource mobilization and budget savings by,
among otbers, improved productivity and efficiency; and c) improving
income distribution by, among others, improving basic social services
in rural areas. The Bank's objectives in the social sectors include
the shift from capital and foreign exchange intensive bospitals to expanding
basic bealth services to uaximize affordability and access to low-income
groups.
1.70      Government's long-term objective in population is definitely
to control demographic growth by stepping up population activities progress-
ively, and raising targets for contraceptive prevalence in order to
reach a population of 30 million or less at the year 2000. In health
and nutrition, Government's mid-term objectives are: to minimize the
biological impact of the economic crisis on the population; to improve
M0PE's management and hospital performance; and to identify cost-effective
alternatives to the present health and nutrition programs. The long-term
objectives are to secure a financing scheme for health care, and to
eliminate pockets of malnutrition by raising domestic food production.
1.71      The present Health Development Project stems from Government's
objectives and discussions with the Bank, since 1979, for the preparation
of the 1980-85 Realth Development Plan, which incorporates the development
of cost-effective health care delivery systems with emphasis on primary
care and family planning. The Plan relies cn a Bank-financed project
to test an alternative to the present health system and set the basis
for its countrywide implementation. The Bank financing will complement
other donors' technical assistance and provide the financial stability
to bring about the desired changes.

II. THE PROJECT
A. Proiect Concept and Obiectives
2.01      The project will assist NOPE in strengthening and accelerating
the shift avay from an urban-based hospital-oriented health system benefitting
a limited segment of the population towards a more cost-effective system
of primary care emphasizing outreach activities in the rural areas.
2.02      The project has two interrelated objectives which are stated
in the 1981-85 Development Plan of MOPE:
(a) Strengthening primary health care delivery including family
planning - in three provinces, totalling 1OZ of the country's
population. Project implementation would be closely monitored
and accompanied by operational research, to allow for continuous
adjustments resulting in a viable alternative to the present
health care delivery system.
(b) Strengthening the capacity of MOPH at central and provincial
levels to make plans for the health sector, to train staff,
to conduct research and evaluation, and to administer the
public health service, as a necessary condition for a large-
scale extension of the health care delivery system to the
rest of the country.
B. Proiect Composition
2.03      The project will consist of four components, the first of
which will meet the first of the above objectives, and the others the
second.
(a) Primary Health Services: The primary health care system envisaged
in the 1981-85 Health Development Plan, but not fully implemented
and revised in the light of experience, will be fully deployed
in three provinces - Agadir, Settat and Taroudant - with
a view to future extension of the project to the rest of the
country. The necessary investment in additional buildings,
equipment and vehicles will be made in the t.ree provinces.
(b)           -_na  ement. The project will provide technical assistance,
training and equipment to strengthen the capacity of MOPE
to manage the public health service, to formulate policy and
plans, provide coordination for the health sector as a whole,
and to conduct research and evaluation.
(c)  Trainin- and InformationlEducation and CommuDication (IEC). The
project will strengthen capacity to train paramedical personnel



- 21 -
and produce IEC X. '-rials by providing equipment for a training
center constructed inder the Third Education Project. It
will also provide equipment, vehicles, and technical assistance
for the production and dissemination of IEC materials.
(d)  SuDDly of Basic Drbus.  The project vill help establish a
coordinated system for the procurement, storage, formulation
packaging, distribution and control of drugs for the public
health system by providing construction, equipment, training
and technical assistance.
C. Proiect Description
Primary Health Services Component
2.04      The first component vill support the deployment and operation,
in a limited geographical area, of the primary care and family planning
scheme envisaged for the entire country. Special attention vill be
given to the cost-effectiveness and replicability of six core programs
- Immunization, Family Planning, Maternal and Child Health, Nutrition,
Front-Line Care, and Basic Sanitation. The implementation of this component
vill be carefully monitored and evaluated to obtain guidance for the
future expansion of the primary care system.
2.05      This componynt vill be carried out in three provinces -  Agadir,
Settat and Taroudant   -- with a total population of 1.9 million in
1984 (9.2Z of Morocco's total population). The three provinces were
selected as representative of the entire country in such re3pects as
geographic features, ecological areas, socio-economic strata, ethnic
and linguistic groups, fertility rates and epidemiological profiles,
so that the experience gained in the course of the project vill serve
as a guide for its replication in other provinces. Description of the
three provinces and baseline data are shovn in Annex 3.1 to B.6.
2.06      The primary health care and family planning scheme will comprise
six core programs which vill be implemented as follovs:
(a)  Imunizat-ion:  The project vill support in the three provinces
the nationvide imunization program designed with UNICEF
assistance against diphteria, tetanus, whooping cough, measles,
polio and tuberculosis. The program vill be carried out through
continuous vaccination by the health facilities and mobile
teams.
1In 1983 the Province of Agadir was split in two: Agadir and Taroudant.
Consequently, in April 1984, MOPH established a new Medical Directorate
for the Province of Taroudant vhich is included in the proposed project.



- 22 -
(b)  Famill Plannint:  The project will implement the VDMS approach
(as described in para. 1.09) in the project area in the same
form as in the other provinces where it is in operation with
USAID/UNFPA support. Contraceptive prevalence in the project
area is targeted to rise from present 22% of NKRA to 33% in
1989. The program strategy is three-fold and cowrpises:
a) reaching rural NWRA, b) improving continuation rates, and
c) offering a vider range of modern contraceptive methods.
(c)  HCR Care:  The project will deploy MCH services further to
the periphery. This will greatly improve the monitoring of
pregnancies and under five-year-old children; it will also
improve the conditions of home deliveries and secure hospital-
ization of high-risk deliveries.
(d) Nutrition: The project will improve the nutritional status
of infants, preschool children, pregnant and lactating women
through pre- and post-nsatal care and clinics for children
under five years of age; through active detection of malnutrition
by itinerant agents, mobile teams or family health mobile
units; and through effective approaches to nutrition rehabilitation.
(e) Front-Line Curative Care: The project will expand and improve
curative care by standardizing diagnostic and treatment procedures,
by providing laboratory back-up, and improving referral and
the supply of basic drugs.
(f) Basic Sanitation: The project will iutensify the surveillance
and continuous disinfection of wells and cisterns, and improve
solid waste disposal. It will also enhance the domestic use
of vater through locally-designed house improvements.
The planned interventions were carefully designed on the basis of
experience in Morocco and other countries, witb technical assistance
from WHO, UNICEF and USAID. Technological innovations were reviewed
at all staff levels. Detailed contents and objectives for the six core
programs are given in Annex C.
2.07      Delivery System.  The six core programs will be delivered
by multi-purpose staff sharing the same facilities. The type of staff
and facilities in any given area will be adapted to local conditions
- terrain, population density and socio-economic level. Project preparation
included extensive field surveys of the rural population, and systematic
consultations with field staff, civil authorities and local communities
on the type of bealth service delivery most suitable to the accessibility
and degree of dispersal of population. On this basis, it vas decided
that six types of service, or "stratigies", each employing different
mixes of fixed facilities and outreach techniques, vill meet the needs
of all areas. For each locality, village or hamlet, a formal agreement
was reached vith civil authorities and coaunity leaders on the most
suitable strategy. Unlike theoretical schenes proposed in the past,



- 23 -
these strategies are realistic and tailored to the needs of the population.
Details on the strategies are given in Annex D.
2.08      The project will provide the following elements for the implemen-
tation °f this component: the construction of 10 Basic Rural Dispensaries
of 68 a each; 38 Rural Dispehsaries of 104.6 a ; housing facilities
for 258 staff in distant rural areas; 10 2rural health centers of three
different sizes with an average of 403 m ; 2 urban health centers and
2 smll rural hospitals of 2,200 m . It will also provide for substantial
improvement or extension of existing facilities: 33 basic rural dispensaries,
41 rural dispensaries, 32 rural health centers, 8 urban health centers,
2 urban maternities, and 3 rural hospitals. Architect fees and supervision
costs will be financed under the project. At negotiations, MOPE has
submitted the final architectural designs for dispensaries, and health
centers Type 1, 2, and 3; preliminary dravings for the hospitals of
Taliouine and Ouled Teima, and dravings for upgrading the hospitals
of Taroudant, Benahmed and Ait Baha, as well as the revised corresponding
equipment lists, for Bank approval. The location of the new or upgraded
facilities is shown in maps IBID 18651, 18652, and 18653.
2.09      The project will provide equipment, and furniture and vehicles
for the additional and upgraded facilities as well as the following
vehicles: 21 ambulances, 37 four-wheel arives, 27 light sedans, 2 trucks,
49 uotorcycles and 244 mopeds. It will also provide for the refresher
training carried out locally for medical, paramedical and support personnel
involved in primary health care, followed by continuing education of
all personnel. The project will also provide for the incremental recurrent
costs of expanding health programs in the three provinces - supervision
and coordination, transportation and additional supply of basic drugs.
Management Component
2.10      The component will improve the management capabilities of
MOPE and strengthen its role as policy-maker for the health sector.
This will be achieved by strengthening its planning capacity, by estab-
lishing a capacity to carry out evaluation studies, and by improving
administrstive procedures.
2.11      Planning.  By the end of 1985, MOPE is expected to have finalized
a comprehensive plan for the sector, to be included in the 1986-88
Development Plan. This sectoral plan will be prepared in coordination
with other public and private agencies in the sector. NOPE will then
monitor the implementation of the plan and prepare an eztension of baaic
services to other provinces. During the final stages of project preparation
the DICP has expanded its staff, and at negotiations assurances were
obtained that the Division de l'Infrastructure Chargee de la Planification
(DICP) at all times will continue to carry its operations with full-time
qualified and experienced staff in adequate numbers. The project vill
further strengthen the DICP and develop its capacity in seven areas
- long-term planning, short-term planning, manpower planning, health
programming, physical planning, biomedical and hospital technology,
research and evaluation.



- 24 -
2.12        The project vill provide the DICP vith computer equipment,
furniture, office supplies and vehicles.  It vill also provide 29 months
of fellowship for post-graduate training in health planning and programming,
health economics, manpower planning, and management information systems.
Finally, the project will finance 22 m/i of local consultants to supplement
the technical assistance provided by the two advisers in health planning
assigned by WHO to the DICP.
2.13      MOPH Management.  The project will improve NOPH's overall
administration. The project will follow up on previous studies and
technical assistance financed by USAID and WHO on management informati.on
systems, and will in addition support the improvement of administrative
procedures in four priority areas already identified by the Ministry.
Under the coordination of the Secretary General, NOPE staff assisted
by local and foreign consultants vill carry out a study on four managerial
areas: a) program budgeting and resource allocation; b) procurement
and bidding procedures; c) civil works and maintenance; and d) management
of personnel. On the basis of the study, an action plan vill be developed,
which will address the organization of services, streamlining of procedures,
retraining of staff, and modernization of office technology. At negotiations,
assurances were obtained that the action plan vill be prepared and submitted
to the Bank by December 31, 1986, and that the Borrower will carry out
such action plan as shall have been agreed vith the Bank.
2.14      Studies.  The project vill include a program of studies designed
to support the planning and management process. Agreement was reached
during project appraisal on general terms of reference for the three
proposed studies:
i)  Healtb Services Monitorina.  NOPE will implement a comprehensive
monitoring and evaluating system for the present project,
including family planning programs, as a first step towards
monitoring the progress of the Plan as a whole. Data collected
by health facilities will be processed and complemented by
operational research or evaluative research. Conclusions on
replicability of the project are expected by end of 1987, and
will be included in the mid-term evaluation (para. 4.14).
(ii)  Study on the Financins of the Realth Sector.  The study vill
analyze the availability and allocation of funds, and the
efficiency and equity of the present and alternative financing
schemes. The study is assigned high priority by the GOC and
MOPH. The GON will appoint a Steering Committee with the
participation of the Ministries of Finance, Planning and
Economic Affairs for the coordination of the study vwich will
be conducted in two phases. The first phase, diagnosis, is
already under way and will be completed by mid-1986; the second
phase - exploring alternatives of financing - will be completed
by end of 1988 to provide guidance for the implementation



- 25 -
of the 1986-88 Development Plan. At negotiations, assurances
were obtained that the Borrower will appoint by December 31, 1985,
an interoinisterial steering comittee for the coordination of
the Study. Assurances were also obtained that final results avd
recomendations of the study vill be furnished and discussed with
the Bank by December 31, 1988.
(iii)  Study on Hospital Manazeent.  Since hospitals absorb 72Z
of NOPH's operating budget, the study will focus on hospital
performance, cost containment and possible methods of cost
recovery, in accordance vith the alternatives of the study
on financing. The final report is expected by the end of
1988. At negotiations, assurances were obtained that the
Government will furnish and discuss with the Bank by December 31,
1988, the findings and recommendations of the study and will
implement such recoomendations as shall have been agreed with
the Bank.
All three studies will be managed by the DICP. The detailed description
and timetable of the studies are given in Annex F.
2.15      For the Studies subcomponent, the pro3ect vill provide:
a) technical assistance consisting of 17 m/i of foreign experts and
177 m/m of local experts from consulting firms and universities;
b) training through 72 fellowship/months for training overseas as well
as local seminars; c) computer and office equipment. The project will
also provide for local costs -- transportation, supplies, data
processing -- as well as publication of the results of the studies.
Training and IEC Component
2.16      The component will remove two obstacles standing in the way
of improving the health system: a) the incomplete training that has
been given in recent years to the mid-level cadres - Specialized Nurses,
Technicians and Cadristes vho are presently crucial .for the operation
of the system; and b) the insufficient IEC capacity to support the rising
demand for training of health personnel as vell as priority programs
such as family planning and PHC. This will be achieved by equipping
the College of Public Health and improving the production and utilization
of training and IEC materials.
a) Equipment of the College of Public Health
2.17      The project will provide educational materials and equipment
for the training of paramedicals in Rabat. This component was appraised
in 1976 under the Third Education Project, which vas only partially
implemented, as described in para. 1.51. The College is nov operating
at full capacity, and enrolls annually 720 paramedical trainees on two-year
courses (120 nurses, 80 psychiatric nurses, 40 physiotherapy assistants,
80 pharmaceutical assistants, 40 radiology technicians, 80 laboratory



- 26 -
technicians, 40 anaesthetic. assistants, 80 sanitarians, 40 statisticians
and 120 cadristes). However, only theoretical instruction can be given
at present, and training is severely handicapped by lack of textbooks
and bilingual (French and Arabic) handouts, and equipment for demonstrations
and laboratory work.
2.18      The project will provide computer and other educational and
technical equipment in the form of textbooks, audiovisual and library
equipment, materials for practical training in laboratory, clinical
and surgical nursing, anaesthesiology, physical therapy and sanitation.
The project will also provide vehicles for the transport of students
and instructors for hospital, community and field practices. Printed
materials other than teztbooks will be provided by the training and
IEC subcomponent described in the following paragraphs.
b) Production of Training and Information/Education/Comunication
Materials
2.19      The project will strengthen MOPH's capacity to prepare, produce
and distribute printed materials -- manuals, handouts, instructional
materials, and audiovisuals.
2.20      The Health Education Unit of the Population Division already
acts as MOPH's printing and IEC office, but lacks adequate capacity
to meet its own needs as well as those of other branches of MOPH (see
pars. 1.10). The Health Education Unit is presently underequipped to
produce the quantity and quality of materials required.
(a)  The College of Public Health and the 48 schools of nursing
in the country are the chief users of educational materials
in the sector, and require 70,000 copies of various manuals,
handouts, and other educational materials annually. The
provincial health services require 40,000 copies annually
of operating manuals and continuing education materials.
(b) The supply of pamphlets, leaflets, posters, slides, TV video
cassettes and audiotapes to be used in IEC support progrins
for family planning and primary care (see para. 1.10). is
deficient in quantity and quality. There is also a shortage
of transport and equipment for the dissemination of IEC programs.
2.21      The project will improve the Population Division's capacity
to produce training and IEC materials. It will provide printing, graphic
and audio-video equipment, as well as supplies, to complement the equipment
which has been sporadically provided over the years by different donors
- USAID, UNICEF, RHO, UNFPA. The project will improve the quality
of training and IEC materials by providing 44 fellowship/months for
the training of staff, and by providing for the diversification and
pre-testing of materials.



- 27 -
2.22      Finally, the component vill address the deficient dissemination
of IEC in rural areas - a lingering problem that affects principally
family planning, nutrition and sanitation programs (see paras. 1.10
and 1.16). The project vill improve the delivery of IEC by the healtb
services in rural areas by using lighter and more versatile mobile units,
shorter and simpler video spots, mainly as support for presentati-ons
in Arabic or Berber, followed by debates with the coumunity. The project
will provide 32 light mobile units - 17 four-wheel drives and 15 light
pick-ups vitb audiovisual equipment for use in rural areas. The project
will include the incremental operating costs of the IEC program. USAID,
UNICEF and WHO vill continue to supply technical assistance for the
design, pre-testing, production of IEC materials adapted to rural area4.
The program will be closely monitored for adjustments and evaluated
periodically. At negotiations, assurances were obtained that the Borrower
will prepare and submit to the lank for coaents, by December 31 of
eaeb year, the detailed annual program, including targets and timetables,
for the production and utilization of IEC materials.
Suinly of Basic Druzs
2.23      In view of the paramount importance of a dependable supply
of basic drugs for primary bealth care and the present disorganized
state of drug manufacture and distribution in the public health service,
this component is designed to reorganize the entire d_ug supply system
of the public sector.
2.24      The private sector will continue to distribute about 952 of
the drugs used in Morocco. In addition, it will continue to supply
most of MOPH's drugs, either by cosmercial manufacturing or by toll
manufacturing.  Over the project duration, the Covernuent plans to
maintain, as a minimum alternative, its total allocation for drugs at
present level, in real terms, with only a 3% annual increase to match
demographic growth. Within this allocation, MOPB -- by judicious
selection of drugs, progressive utilization of generic drugs, improved
procurement, cost saving formulations, reduction of thefts and losses,
and improved dispensing - will be able to increase by 60% the avail-
ability of basic drugs for PBC.
2.25      The project will reorganize MOPH's Drug Supply System under
the authority of a newly created Drug Supply Unit (Unite d'Approvisionnement
en MNdicaments - UAN) which will have full responsibility for the several
steps of the drug supply process - budgeting, accounting, procurement,
control of stocks, contracting with the pharmaceutical industry, formulation
and packaging of ba.iic drugs and distribution to the provinces. The
Central Pharmcy vill become a central supply unit dealing exclusively
with furniture and medical equipment. Responsibility for the quality
control of pharmaceuticals will remain under the National Control
Laboratory. The sequence of operations to be performed, as well as
controls and feed-back mechanisms, are shown in the diagram in Annex



- 28 -
G.l. The UAM vill be established within MOPH vitb its ova individualized
budget and will have full authority to carry all operations required
to ensure the supply of drugs which are mhown in Annex G.2. At negotia-
tions, assurances were obtained that the Borrower will establish and
maintain the UAN with terms of reference and staff acceptable to the
Dank, to be responsible for all steps of the drug supply process, and
will ensure it is provided, through individualized annual budgetary
allocations, with sufficient funds for its drug supply operation over
the duration of the project. The establishment of the UAM will be a
condition of disbursement against the drug supply component.
2.26      The project will improve the UAN's management, storage, formu-
lation and packaging capacity:
(a)  Manatement. The management subcomponent will simplify the
submission of orders by the provinces, and base local and
international procurement on an International Pharuaceutical
Market Information System (IPKIS). It will improve budgeting,
disbursement, contracting with the private sector for toll
formulation, control of stocks -- including emergency stocks
- and distribution. To this effect, the project will provide
for construction and equipment of an administrative office,
and for equipment and furniture, computer equipment and telex
equipment, training of staff, contractual services with an
international market information system, and technical assistance
tbrough 10 m=/  of training abroad and 20 m/i of foreign experts.
(b)  Storage and Haodlita of Drugs.  The proj  t will improve the
procedures for customs clearance, transportation, reception,
sampling for quality control, warehousing, internal handling,
storage of finished products, packing, dispatching and distribution
to the provinces. The storage and handling of some 280 pharm-
ceuticals and cbemicals, including flamma le gases and liquids
as vell as toxic material and insecticides, require appropriate
facilities regulated by safety and securi y codes. Thl project
vill provide for construction and equipment of 5,500 m of
storage, packing and shipment space, garage and workshop,
handling and packing equipment, and two five-ton trucks for
distribution. The project will also provide for the local
training of mid-level technicians and 5 a/= of foreign experts.
(c)  Foru  lotion    The formulation of 46 basic drugs will be split
between industry and the UA. Formulation of all antibiotics,
which involves more sophisticated procedures and represents
the major investments, is expected to be done by the private
industry under contracts for toll manufacturing on the basis
of costs plus an agreed-upon profit. Contracting for toll
formulation, however, will not be considered part of the project.
The rest of basic drugs such as tablets, syrups. ointments,



- 29 -
solutions, and suppositories, will be formulated by the
upgraded formulation unit of the UAM. To this effect, the
projeqt vill provide for construction and equipment of a
800 m formulation laboratory, a small galenic control
laboratory, a power plant and initial ingredients and supplies
for the first year of operation of the formulation and packaging
units. The project will provide for machinery, laboratory
equipment, air conditioning and ventilation equipment. The
project will also finance 18 fellowship/months for overseas
training in formulation as well as 6  l/i of foreign experts.
(d)  Packauin.  MOPE uses small quantities of sophisticated drugs
which are imported and distributed to hospitals already packaged.
It uses large quantities of some 120 generic drugs purchased
and distributed under hospital packaging. Finally, the primary
health care services use about 100 drugs which are dispensed
to patients and therefore must be safely and efficiently
packaged. The project will enable HOPE to purchase drugs
in bulk and package them locally; it will also explore new
forms of packaging -- color-coded courses of treatment,
instructions understandable to illiterates, notices in French
and Arabic, coupled with IEC materials. The project will
provide for the construction of a 1,200 i packaging unit,
and packaging and labeling materials and equipment. It will
provide for 6 fellowship/u for three key staff and 5 consultant/
months of foreign experts for the improvement and continuous
adjustment of packaging. At negotiations, MOPH has submitted
the preliminary drawings and engineering studies for the UAN
and the corresponding equipment list, which were approved
by the Bank.
2.27      Summarv of Technical Assistance and Fellow - -s.  The project
will provide for architect fees as vell as a total of 340 man/months
of technical assistance and 248 man/months of fellovships:
(a)  222 consultanttmonths by local experts in the following areas:
health planning; preparation of the extension of basic health
services; management of MOPH, health services monitoring;
health economics; hospital management; pharmaceutical management
and inventories.
(b) 65 consultant/months by foreign experts in management, operational
research, health economics, hospital management, pharmaceutical
management, control of stocks, industrial pharmacy and drug
packaging.
(c) 150 man/months of post-graduate courses abroad in health planning,
health economics, health administration, research management
and methodology, business administration, formulation, industrial
pharmacy and marketing.



- 30 -
NOPE way use WHO's assistance in the implementation of technical assistance
and the fellowship programs. The detail and timetable of the technical
assistance and fellowships are shown in Annex 1.4. All technical assistance
and fellowships financed by the project will be administered by the
PIU.
III. PROJECT COST AND FINANCING
Cost of the Proiect
3.01      The total project cost is estimated at US$47.6 million including
taxes (US$7.1 million). The foreign exchange component of the project
will amount to about US$24.3 million. The breakdown of costs by project
component is shown below:

3.02      The base cost estimates for the project are as of April 15,
1985. The estimates for zivil vorks are based on preliminary drawings
of project-related constructions and on the 1985 unit cost of construction
for similar works using economical construction methods. The cost estimates
for equipment, furniture, and drugs are based on agreed lists of items
to be procured and on the cost of procuring similar items in 1984. The
estimated cost of fellowships, including travel, averages about US$1,780
per man/month. Detailed cost tables are presented in Annex I.



- 31 -
3.03      The total cost estimate includes 102 physical contingencies
for civil works, furniture, equipment, drugs and medical supplies.
Price contingencies are estimated over the project implementation period,
for all expenditure categories, as follows:
1985/86   1986/87   1987/88   1988/89   1989/90
Local costs        .10      .07        .06       .06       .06
Foreign costs      .07      .08        .08       .08       .08
In the absence of a sector profile and because the average disbursement
period for Morocco is 8 and a half years, as a hedge against possible
delays in the proposed five-year implementation, a contingency for
implementation delays for an amount of US$2.1 million has been added
to the project cost. This contingency is derived from a direct estimate
of two additional years for the completion of the project.
3.04      The estimated foreign exchange component of the project is
estimated at US$24.3 million. The breakdown of foreign exchange by
categories of expenditure is as follows: civil works, 40z; furniture,
55z; equipment, 802; vehicles, 70S; drugs, 60X; fuel. 802; foreign expert
services, 902; fellowships, OOZ; and local training, 302.
3.05      The loan will also finance on a declining basis the incremental
operating costs of the health services (excluding hospitals) in the
three provinces over a five-year period in respect to: a) the basic
drugs; b) transport costs and statutory travel allowances for staff
(VDNS, itinerant nurses, mobile teams and supervisors); fuel and vehicle
maintenance.
3.06      Incremental Recurrent Costs.  Incremental recurrent costs
generated by the project are estimated at US$9.9 million including contin-
gencies and US$1.6 million in taxes. This includes net of tax salaries
(US$2.9 million), an improved supply of drugs and medical supplies (US$3.1
million), as well as sanitation supplies (US$0.2 million), office supplies
(US$0.3 million), fuel, travel costs and subsistance (US$1.8 million)
to improve the mobility of outreach personnel. Incremental operating
costs of the project will increase from US$0.9 million during the first
year of the project to US$2.8 million in the fifth year and are expected
to level off thereafter. The increase in incremental operating costs
occurs because in recent years, MOPH's actual resources at the primary
health level declined in real terms, resulting in a decline in coverage
and deterioration in the quality of services. Consequently, outreach
services have to be funded to a minimum level to restore the credibility
of the system, at the same time as the project eztends coverage to larger
segments of rural low-income populations. In the first year, incremental
operating costs will represent 0.9Z of MOPR's 1984 recurrent budget;
this ratio increases to 2.9Z by the fifth year. Such low percentage
of NOPE's operating budget underscores the replicability of the project.
The feasibility of future expansion of the proposed PBC system is further
enhanced by expected savings in the cost of drugs, improved management



- 32 -
of hospitals and cost recovery uechanisms that vill be explored by the
study on financing of the health sector.
Proiect Financing
3.07      The proposed IBRD loan of US$28.4 million vill finance 70X
of total project costs net of taxes, including a PPF of US$75,000 that
will be refinanced under the loan. The GON vill provide the equivalent
of US$12.1 million to finance the local costs, equal to about 302 of
the total project cost net of taxes, plus US$7.1 million in taxes and
duties. The GON has included in the 1984-85 budget a total of DR 72
million for the initiation of the project. The financing plan, broken
down by category of expenditures, is ohown below:

IV. PROJECT ORGANIZATION AND IMPLEMENTATION
Ornanization
4.01      Overall responsibility for the project will rest with NOPE
through its Direction des Affaires Techniques (DAT). As shown in MOPH's
organizational chart in Annex R.1, all units taking part in project
implementation are under this Directorate. The DAT commands tb.I necessary
lines of authority for project implementation. It will: a) supervise
the implementation of the Health Services component, through its norual
technical authority, over the Medical Directorate in each of the three
provinces; b) implement through its DICP the Planning and Studies sub-
components, and in coordination with the DAA, the MDPE Management sub-
component; c) implement, through its Population Division, the Training
and IEC component; d) and implement, through its UAf, the Drug Supply
component. NOPE has designated the Director of Technical Affairs as
the "sous-ordonnateur" giving him full authority to comit all project
resources and authorize payments accordingly.
4.02      Within the DAT and under the direct supervision of the Director
of Technical Affairs, a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) has been created
by ministerial decision No. 2669 DT/206 dated December 4, 1984, establishing
its terms of reference. The PIU has been given overall responsibility
to conduct all project-related procurement, disbursement and accounting
operations. The decree appointed the Project Coordinator, as vell as
five professionals - an administrator, a medical doctor, an economist,
and two bead supervisors of health services. All PI-appointed professional
staff are well-qualified and have actively participated in the preparation
of the project. An experienced architect will be assigned to the PI.
In addition, four secretarial and support staff have been assigned to
the PIU. The Sinister has also designated the interim director of the
UAE to be developed under the project. All MOPE units will report to
the PIU on matters related to the project. At negotiations, assurances
vere obtained that the Borrower will continue to maintain the PTU vith
organization responsibilities, staff, and terms of reference satisfactory
to the Bank over the duration of the project.
4.03      In the three provinces, the project vill be implemented by
the provincial Medical Directorates of Agadir and Settat as implemen-
tation in the recently created Province of Taroudant will be supervised
through the experienced staff of Agadir Medical Directorate. Under
the overall responsibility of the PIU architect, civil works will be
supervised by MOPE's construction units in Rabat, Agadir and Settat;
each one of these units will be reinforced with a civil engineer and
a civil work supervisor who vill work full-time on the project.

4.04        Laws and regulations regarding local procureueut procedures
and practices in Morocco have been revieved in the Bank in order to
reach a judgement as to whether local procedures are acceptable for
Bank-financed contracts. The findings of that review were discussed
with the Moroccan authorities and agreements were obtained during
negotiations regarding any changes needed to make the procedures
acceptable to the Bank.  Procureseut arrangements are sumarized in
the table below.

4.05      Civil Wgrki.  Most of the civil works will be located in remote
areas and will be too samll to attract foreign contractors. Consequently,
the amount of US$12.6 million net of tazes will be avarded on the basis
of competitive bidding advertised locally, in accordance with procedures
acceptable to the Bank. MOPE's central construction unit will prepare
standard bidding documents acceptable to the Bank for each type of
construction. Civil works, up to an aggregate cost of Vs$2.0 million
equivalent, for the remodeling works or the construction of sall health
facilities in remote areas where no contractors could be found, my
be carried out by force account with Bank's prior approval.
4.06      Goods.  The total cost of equipment, furniture, materials,
supplies, vehicles and drugs, is estimated at US$14.9 million net of
tazes, of which US$11.1 million will be procured through international
competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines. Qualifying
domestic manufacturers vill be given a margin of preference of 151 or
the applicable import duty, whichever is lower. To the extent practicable,
contracts will be grouped in bid packages of US$100,000 equivalent or
more, each. Equipment, furniture, materials and supplies for the health
facilities, estimated to cost about US$1.3 million net of taxes, may
be procured through UNICEF. Items which cannot be grouped in packages
of more than US$100,000 but not exceeding in aggregate US$1.5 million
equivalent may be procured through competitive bidding, advertised locally,
in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank. Contracts for
miscellaneous goods amounting to US$15,000 equivalent or less, but not
exceeding US$500,000 equivalent in total, may be procured through prudent
shopping after obtaining at least three price quotations.
4.07      Services.  The selection and appointment of consultants and
technical assistance specialists (including architects) will be in
accordance with Bank guidelines.
4.08      Bank Review Requirements. Construction contracts in excess
of US$200,000 equivalent and contracts for goods in excess of US$100,000
equivalent will be subject to tbe Bank's prior review. Such contracts
will comprise about 80X of the total estimated value of civil works,
furniture, material, equipment and vehicles. Other contracts will be
subject to Bank review after award. Terms of reference and conditions
of employment of consultants and advisers as vell as their qual-'fication
will be satisfactory to the Bank. Assurances were obtained that a list
of courses and candidates for the fellowship program will be submitted
to the Bank for prior review.
Disbursement
4.09      The loan proceeds will be disbursed as follows (Annex J):
(a) civil works: 702;



- 36 -
(b) equipment, furniture, materials, supplies and vehicles: OOZ
of foreign expenditures; 100% of local expenditures (ex-factory);
and 60Z of total expenditures for otber items procured locally;
(c) technical assistance, fellowships and training seminars:
100x.
(d) incremental recurrent costs: 68%. Disbursements vill cover
payments from December 4, 1984, through the first year after
the signature of the Loan Agreement up to a limit of US$0.3
million, US$0.8 million for the second year, US$0.7 for the
third year, US$0.6 for the fourth yeer, and US$0.2 for the
fifth year.
Retroactive financing up to a limit of US$2.0 million for all payments
for expenditures eligible for Bank financing, made on or after December 4,
1984, date of the establishment of the Project Implementation Unit, will
be accepted. Disbursements for packaging materials and ingredients
under the drug supply component vill be limited to a total of US$1.5
million equivalent. The GON will fully document all disbursements from
the loan amount except for: (i) civil works on force account, and (ii)
expenditures for training which vill be made against certificates of
expenditure. The documentation for these expenditures will be retained
by the GO) for audit and inspection by project review missions. The
disbursement schedule is presented in Annex I. The present loan is
expected to be fully disbursed by December 31, 1991.
Accounts and Audits
4.10      During negotiations, assurances were obtained that NOPH will
keep separate accounts for all project-related expenditures, which will
be audited annually in accordance with appropriate auditing principles
by independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank. Copies of the audited
statements will be provided to the Bank for review within six months
of the end of the fiscal year. These reports will include an opinion
(and comments as necessary) on the methods employed in compiling the
statement of expenditures, their accuracy, the relevance of supporting
documents, elegibility for Bank financing, and the standard of record-
keeping and internal controls related to the foregoing.
4.11      It is estimated that the present five-year project will be
completed by 1989, as shown in the implementation timetable in Annex
1.3.  HOPE's central staff in charge of the preparation of the project
will be incorporated in the PIU and DICP's units concerned with the
project; implementation of many project activities will immediately
follow preparation. In order to keep the momentum, during the first
semester of 1985, MOPH will continue or initiate four key project activities:
(a) first phases of the studies on the Financing of the Sector
and Hospital Management;



- 37 -
(b) training of key central and provincial staff;
(c) upgrading of existing facilities in Agadir, Settat and Taroudant
provinces; and
(d) preparation of the 1986-88 Health Development Plan.
To carry out these activities, MOPH will utilize funds allocated to
the project in the 1984-85 budget: DR 60 million for the first component,
and DH 12 million for the fourth component.
Monitorint
4.12      Continuous monitoring and evaluation are essential to the
first component of the project. The DICP will be responsible for monitoring
implementation in the three provinces. Such measurement viII cover:
(a) inputs: civil works and procurement, timeliness of refresher
training, increase of drug supply, improvement of ISC support,
quality of technical support at central and provincial levels.
Monitoring of inputs vill be carried out by the PIU in
collaboration with the three provincial directorates.
(b) outp_uts will be monitored through process indicators - activities
performed, coverage, utilization of services, drug utilization,
referrals, indicators of quality and cost of services. Process
indicators will be measured through health services monitoring
complemented by operational research as described in Annexes
FKl and F.2.
(c) outcomes of the six core programs, detailed in Annex C, will
be periodically assessed through population, health and nutrition
indicators against set targets. Baseline data will be collected
in the project by the end of 1985, mid-term evaluation will
assess early trends by the end of 1988 but health status indicators
are expected to show significant progress at final evaluation,
by mid-1992. Specifically the project will focus on the following
targets:
(1) Knowledge of modern contraceptive methods smong vomen
will increase from the present 632 of MYRA to 90% in
1989.
(2) Contraceptive prevalence will increase to 362 in Agadir,
38.5Z in Settat and 232 in Taroudant by 1989. Intermediate
targets for 1987 are shown in Annex C.
(3) Percentage of children receiving standard isamunizations
-- coverage is expected to raise from present 36% to



- 38 -
60% in 1987 and 80% in 1989. The percentage of vomen
receiving tetanus toxoid during pregnancy vill rise from
the present 5% of pregnancies to 55% by 1989.
(4)  Coverage of prenatal clinics vill rise from present 5.4%
to 35% by 1989. The percentage of supervised deliveries
will increase from the present 11Z to 55% by 1989; 80Z
of high-risk pregnancies vill be delivered in uaternities
by 1989.
(5)  Infant mortality among rural population of the project
area will decrease from 150 per 1,000 at to 80 per 11000
by 1989. Maternal mortality among rural population of
the project area will be reduced to under 250 per 100,000
live births by 1989.
(6)  Five specific causes of deaths, selected as tracers or
indirect indicators of care - deaths under 5 years of
age due to diarrheal syndromes and acute respiratory
infections; death by eclaupsia and rupture of the uterus;
and deaths of tuberculosis for all ages and sexes --
will be measured and monitored for progress.
(7)  The supply of 46 basic drugs vill increase by 50X in
1987, and by 150% in 1989. The utilization of basic
drugs -- prescription, dispensing and patient's
compliance - vill be monitored through operational
research in nine provinces during 1986, 1987 and 1988,
as shown in the timetable in Annex F.2.
ReportinD and Evaluation
4.13      Overall monitoring, reporting and evaluation of the project
will come under the responsibility of the PIU which will insure timely
collection of information needed for the preparation of semi-annual
progress reports and its submission to the Bank.
4.14      As head of the PIU, the Project Coordinator vill conduct a
mid-term evaluation of the project vhich will cover project components
as vell as necessary adjustments of the PHC systems and conditions of
replicability. By December 1987 the GOM expects to receive the mid-term
evaluation report to decide on the extension of the PEC system to other
provinces, possibly with Bank assistance. Assurances were obtained
during negotiations that the Borrower vill prepare and furnish to the
Bank a mid-term evaluation report, including the findings and recomen-
dations of the research mentioned in para. 2.14 (i), by December 31,
1987, and implement such tecommendations as shall have been agreed with
the Bank.

V. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION MAD RISKS
Just if icat ion
5.01      In addition to br'nging direct benefits to 102 of Morocco's
population, the project will help the Government to organize the health
sector and introduce overdue policy changes. It will improve the health
status of a sizeable proportion of Morocco's poorest population, test
an alternative to the present health care delivery system, and assist
institution building in MOPH.
5.02      The deployment and operation of the reinforced and reorganized
bealth services in three provinces (total population 2.1 million) will
yield the following tangible direct benefits:
(i)  Pooulation:  Improved faoily planning services and IEC will
significantly increase contraceptive prevalence in three pre-
domionatly rural provinces which include 10S of the Moroccan
population. Contraceptive prevalence is expected to rise
from present 242 of MMlA to 332 in 1989 and 372 in 1992.
Hovever, the benefits expected in the project area, already
significant by themselves, are only a step in the extension
of the family planning program. The experience gained in
the project area and other provinces covered by the VDHS
program will facilitate the extension of the program to the
rest of the country over the next ten years when the national
contraceptive prevalence will reach 37Z in 1992, 40.52 in
1996 and 432 in the year 2000. These contraceptive prevalence
rates vould result in total fertility rates of 4.8 in 1989,
4.6 in 1992, 4.4 in 1996 and about 4.3 in 2000. The crude
birth rates would accordingly decrease from 40 per 1,000 in
1985 to 28 per 1,000 in 1996, and to approzimately 27 per
1,000 in 2000. Assuming mortality and migration remain
constant, the total population of the country is projected
at just over 30 million by the year 2000.
(ii)  Health:  There will be a substantial improvement in health
conditions in three provinces. Mothers will be protected
by improved MCB services; infants and children will benefit
from extended imiunization and control of diarrhea and acute
respiratory infections. Restored confidence in the health
services will open the possibility of sustained preventive
care in the future, and introduction of cost recovery mechanism
(iii)  Nutrition:  Although only a limited improvement in nutrition
could be expected from tbis project, especially if droughts
persist, the most severe consequences of child malnutrition
will be alleviated and irreversible biological damsge prevented.



- 40 -
5.03      The testing of the new health system in the three provinces
vill pave the way for further expansion of a more cost-effective approach
which will eventually benefit the vbole population of Morocco.
5.04      Institution building in HOPR will lead to tangible results
in terms of: a) better allocation of scarce resources; b) cost-containment
in hospitals; c) more efficient management of drugs; d) better training
of paramedicals; and e) more cost-effective basic services. The project
will equip NOPH to measure its own performance and devise oetter approaches
to healtb problems. Policy vill be based on better planniing, research
and evaluation, and changes of policy vill be more effectively implemented.
Institution building of HOPH will bring about a coherent health plan,
including the coordinated development of public services, Social Security
and the private sector; the gains obtained will greatly surpass the
immediate benefits brought about by the improved internal management
of MOPH.
Risks
5.05      The project is subject to the risks attendant on a first project
in the sector. The technical risks inberent to the deployment and operation
of a new health system have been reduced insofar that the technical
innovations have been well-tested, and central and provincial health
teams have been reinforced with competent staff. Riscs have been further
reduced by early project start-up to be financed retroactively.
5.06      During project preparation, the risk of delays in project
implementation has been reduced in the following ways: a) by strengthening
HOPH coordination with the Ministries of Finance, Planning and Economic
Affairs which led to a consensus on the proposed implementation schedule
and the corresponding annual budget allocations; b) by establishing
a strong PIU and securing support from other MOPP branches; and c) by
seeking at negotiations assurances on deadlines for key operations,
many of which are already being implemented. In addition, the strong
political comituent and support for the project in the three provinces
and the Government's interest for institution-building in MOPE from
the outset of the project are likely to keep implementation on schedule.
5.07      The project vas designed to minimize incremental operating
costs, especially during 1985 and 1986, the first two years of operation.
The project vill be included in the forthcoming Development Plans of
1986-88 and 1989-93, and the corresponding budgetary allocations will
be individualized in the annual operating budget (Programe d'Emploi)
of MOPE.

Condition of Disbursement
6.03      No disbursements will be made against the drug supply component
until the Government has establisbed the UAN.
6.04      The above assurances having been obtained, the project is
suitable for a Bank loan of US$28.4 million equivalent to the Kingdom
of Morocco for a term of 20 years including five years of grace.

1. AMents de Sant6 Bre'vetfis (ASB) or Basic Nurses
After four years of secondary education, applicants are recruited
on the payroll of the civil service for two years of basic training
in hospital nursing and public health nursing. Tventy-eight schools
in as many provinces graduate a total of 2,000 basic nurses annually.
Because of budgetary li-mitations, admissions were drastically reduced
to 900 in 1983. The 16,000 basic nurses active in the country are evenly
distributed between hospitals and peripheral health services; they provide
the basic staffing of the services. Only 10% of the ASBs are female.
While basic nurses are well suited for hospital work, they prove to
be less cost-effective in peripheral services. Because ASBs bave adopted
urban values during their four years of secondary education, they have
difficulties in adapting to isolated rural areas, particularly to the
low-prestige itinerance. All paramedicals must serve in the MOPH for
a number of years before they could go to the private sector. many
ASBs, however, choose to complete secondary education by correspondence
and apply to the School of Certified Nurses or quit the sector after
their service obligations are fulfilled.

2.   Agents de Sant6 Divl1m6s d'Etat (ASDE) or Certified Nurses
Recruited after the completion of secondary education and
a qualifying examination, students undergo two years of training to
become either Certified Nurses or Specialized Nurses (in clinicallsurgical,
psychiatric, pediatric nursing, etc.) or Technicians (in laboratory,
dentistry, X-ray, anaesthetisiology, rehabilitation, sanitation, etc.).
The ASDE level offers different options. Eight schools of nursing and
ten schools of technicians graduate an average of 400 certified nurses
and 500 technicians each year. The 6,000 ASDEs are the backbone of
the services, their qualifications are well-appreciated in the public
and private sector. Only 60% of the posts budgeted for ASDEs in the
NOPH are presently filled with qualified incumbents, a situation that
will be resolved by 1989. The percentage of female ASDEs, badly needed
for MCH and family planning services, increases steadily and reached
33Z in 1983.
3.   Adioints de Sante DiPl6m6s d'Etat SDecialistes (ASDES), better
known as 'Cadristes"
After serving in the health services, the most capable ASDEs
are proposed for two additional years of higher education in management,
.training or research at the Ecole des Cadres in the Rabat College of
Public Health. The cadristes form an elite corps whose quality and
performance are well recognized and are in high demand for key positions
in the services.
4.   Medical doctors are trained according to European standards and
following European curriculae in the two medical schools of Rabat and
Casablanca. After five years of training, the medical student undergoes
one year of internship in hospitals. All graduates in medicine, dentistry
and pharmacy from Morocco or abroad must serve one year of civil services
("Civilistes") in the MOPH.
5.   Specialists after internship and civil service about 35% of physicians
undertake 2 to 5 years of residency to become specialists. All the
major specialties are now taken in Morocco and only few sub-specialties
require training abroad.

DescriDtion and Baseline Datj
Provincec of Azadir Taroudant and Settct
Suarv Descript ion
8gadir, Taroidant together with Ouarzazate are the southern
most densely populated provinces; further south lay the desertic and
sparsely populated SaharaD provinces.
In 1983 the Government divided the large Agadir Province with
1.2 million population in two smller provinces, Agadir and Taroudant.
In addition, the new province of Taroudant now includes large areas
previously belonging to Ouarzaate. Most statistical data available
still lump the two provinces together, and the Government is in the
process of separating the two data bases.
Province of Agadir
The province is now reduced to a coastal strip 200 km long
and 50 km wide. The province is limited by the High Atlas range to
the north and the Anti-Atlas to the south. In between the coastal plain
is crossed by the Oued ouse., the Oued Chtouka, and other minor seasonal
rivers. The province has a population of 624,000 - 3S of the country's
total population - ef which 58S live in rural areas. Over the past
eleven years, the population of Agadir city and its suburbs of Ineagane
increased at a tremendous rate of 7.6Z. The presence of a modern city.
totally reconstructed after the 1966 earthquake, oriented toward tourism
and developing industries, sharply constrasta witb the semi-arid agricultural
back country. Three socio-economic groups coexist without much inter-
penetration: the Berber population of the Atlas and Anti-Atlas live
a subsistence economy in dispersed villages high in the mountain valleys,
the cosmopolitan urban population of professionals, governoent employees
and industrial workers. *and finally the Arab-speaking farmers and migrant
workers of the central agricultural plains.
There Pre three hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds (or a
ratio of 1.9 beds per 1,000 population), 9 health centers and 66 urban
and rural dispensaries. There are 76 physicians - or 1.2 per 10,000
population - evenly distributed between the public and private sector.
As such, the province appears relatively well served, but in fact the
concentration of large hospitals in the city of Agadir masks the shortage
of facilities in rural areas.

Province of Taroudiat
Taroudant is economically and socially the back country of
Agadir. It extends over a vast territory, 200 km from nortb to south
and 250 km east to west. Higb mountain ranges and arid plateaus forecasting
the Saharan rift, occupy most of the land. The Souse Valley narrows
rapidly to the east and fades out in desertic sparsely populated areas.
The sain road links Ouarzazate to Agadir with few transversal dirt roads.
The province had a population of 582,000 in 1983 and the density is
low -  11.6 per km2   Two semll cities, Taroudant (26.000 pop.) and
Ouled Teima (25,000 *pop.) make for most of urban population wbile 9O0
live in rural areas. Arab-speaking population. mostly settled in the
west, represents only 20S of the total while different ethnic groups
of Berber origin occupy the sountsive and Zastern plateaus. Most of
the rural population lives in subsistence economy
Taroudant has only one hospital with 280 beds operating in
precarious conditions, 7 health centers and 49 dispensaries. There
are 23 physicians in the public sector and 9 in private practice. As
sucb, the province is grossly underequipped with 0.48 beds per 1,000
population and 0.5 pbysician per 10,000 population. The bealth status
of the population is poorly documented. Malnutrition is highly prevalent:
a survey of children between 0 to 4 years of age in the Aoulouz district
showed in 1983, 31.91 of children as moderately malnourisbed and 10.81
as severely malnourished.
Province-of Settac
The province of Settat is located in the Central region with
a population of 717,500 in 1983. 791 of which live in rural areas.
Settat province is typically agricultural and is known as the granary
of the country. Flat or gently rolling terrains in the western two-thirds
of the territory change to less fertile plateaus in the eastern third.
The climate is influenced by the Atlantic winds and precipitation allows
for extensive dry-farming of wbeat. During the period 1971-1982, its
general population growth rate has been below the national average at
a rate of 1.8 (as compared to 3.1), urbanisation has been at a rate
of 3.8 (as compared to 4.4 nationally) and rural population growth rate
is 1.3 (as compared to 1.4 nationally). The rural ezodus in Settat
has affected other neighboring provinces ratbhr than its own urban centers
which, in turn, contributed to its low population and urban growth rates.
Settat's population is economically and socially boogeneous. The vast
majority is of Arab origin. About 301 of the agricultural population
are small farmers farming their own plots wbile 701 are tenants or agricultural
workers farming large properties. Insufficient rainfall in the past
few years has adversely affected family income, and in a cereal-ricb
province malnutrition is still prevalent. A nutrition survey of Settat
province in 1982 sbow that, of 2,692 infants in the urban areas, 161
are moderately malnourisbed, 7.51 are severely malnourisbed.

Annex B
Page 3 of 3
There are three hospitals in the province: a 1,900-bed
psychiatric national hospital in Berrechid which serves the entire country,
a 309-bed tuberculosis hospital in Benabmed also serving several provinces,
a 200-bed general hospital in Settat, and finally 56 beds in two Rural
Health Centers. In spite of the apparent infrastructure, the province
is underequipped with only 256 beds to serve a population of 717,500
for a very low ratio of 0.35 bed per 1,000 population. There are 10
health centers and 36 dispensaries with a ratio of one health center
for 71,750 inhabitants and one dispensary per 19,930. The province
of Settat had 53 physicians in 1983, or a ratio of 0.74 per 10,000
population, of which 36Z practice in the private sector and 642 in the
public sector.

'EALTH PROJECT
CONTENT OF PROPOSED PRIMARY CAUE
PRIMARY HEALTH CARE CORE PROGRAMS
The uodel of Ambulatory Care to be implemented in Agadir and
Settat will consist of six core programs in priority areas:
1. Immunizations (PEV)
2.   Family Planning
3.  Maternal and Child Care (PSME)
4.   Nutrition
5.   Front-line Curative Care
6.   Basic Sanitation
For each program, the major operational or technical changes are summarized
belov.
I.     UUZMIN
The iumunization program (PEV) presently reaches 45Z of national
coverage in 1982. Urban areas are covered at 631 vhile rural coverage
stalls at 26Z. The project will support the nationwide immunization
strategy by shifting from vaccination through periodic campaigns by
mobile units to continuing vaccination by fixed posts - Health Centers
and Dispensaries -- supplemented by mobile units in rural areas. The
smaller rural dispensaries (DRB) vill not be included as imunization
outlets, for reasons of cost-effectiveness of vaccine utilization and
technical control. Detailed programming of vaccination against six
diseases -- Diphtheria, Tetanus, Whooping Cough, Measles, Poliomyelitis,
and Tuberculosis - under the nev approach will increase the immunization
coverage in Agadir and Settat from the present 361 to 601 in 1987 and
801 in 1990. In addition, the strategy will allow for the coordination
of immunization activities with prenatal clinics and clinics for children
under five years of age, sore convenient for consumers and providers.
The shift in strstegy requires: a) expansion of the cold chain to 47
nev facilities, b) provision of equipment, c) retraining of personnel,
d) improved IEC support, e) vertical monitoring of operations at provincial
level, and f) operational and evaluative research. The cold chain,
logistics and equipment specific to imsunization will be provided by
UNICEF while general equipment, training, I8C, monitoring and research
vill be provided by the project.

II. FAKIIT PLANIUIh
In the three project provinces, the family planning program
mill mobilize the following combination of resources:
(a) All 48 smaller Basic Rural Dispensaries vill deliver family
planning advice, and contraceptives. All 65 larger Rural
Dispensaries, which will be staffed vith a female nurse as
as vell as all 43 Health Centers, vill carry daily family
planning clinics with capacity for IUD insertions.
(b) At the peripheral level, family planning clinics held in
dispensaries and health centers vill be complemented by the
outreach activities as described in para. 1.09. In the case
of concentrated populations or populations located within
10 kas of a facility, the outreach vill proceed through bome
visits. In the case of distant populations family planning
programs vill be delivered through biweekly clinics at meeting
points, mobile teams or, in the uost remote areas, by comunity
workers and traditional birth attendants.
(c) All Health Centers and Hospitals out-patient services vill
serve as back-up level and will operate FP and gynecology
clinics manned by specialized female nurses and physicians.
Cd) The specialized fa._ily planning centers in Agadir, Settat
and Taroudant provincial hompitals will provide tubal ligations
and specialized back-up to family planning.
(e) IEC services will provide support to all family planning services
and promotion activities in the comunity.
The objectives of the program are:
(i) to provide information on family planning and contraceptives
to jL women in reproductive age. To improve knowledge of
modern contraceptive methods including IUD and tubal ligation,
from present 63Z to 90% of women in reproductive age in 1989;
(ii) to increase total contraceptive prevalence in the project
area from the present 24.7 to 33 in 1989. Contraceptive
prevalence targets by province will be as follows:
1983      1987      1989
Agadir               24.2      30        36.3
Settat              25.7       31.8      38.5
Taroudant            15.2      18.8      23



- 67 -
Amnex C
Page 3 of 6
Increase of total contraceptive prevalence will be obtained
through an improved follow-up of recent acceptors (drop-out
rates are high in all three provinces) and tbrough wider
utilization of IUD -  presently les. than 21 of KWRA -- to
62 by 1989, and tubal ligations - presently 1.7Z of HURL
- to 41 in 1989.
(iii) to avoid teenage pregnancies, lengthen birth interval and
drastically reduce high parity pregnancies as well as pregnancies
in the 35-44 age group.
(iv) to increase and improve IEC support for family planning, by
audiovisual methods and mass media channels in urban areas,
and by IEC mobile units in the distant rural areas.
(v) to carry out operational research on acceptability of ZUD
and implants, continuity rates by methods and impact of IEC.
III r NIERAL AMB CZ=LD CARE
Expansion and improvement of NCR -- particularly maternal
care and family planning - depend to a large extent on the staffing
of peripheral facilities vith a female nurse in charge. Maternal and
child care will be delivered in close coordination with im-unizations,
family planning and nutrition through two activities:
(a) Prenatal and Obstetrical Care. The activities will be
reoriented according to three operational objectives:
(i)   to expand the coverage of prenatal clinics to 35Z of
all pregnancies - as compared to the present 5.4Z -
focusing on high-risk pregnancies;
(ii) to improve the conditions of deliveries in health facilities;
(iii) to improve the conditions of home deliveries through
health education and supervision of traditional birth
attendants by the health services;
(iv) to secure hospitalization for high-risk deliveries.
The project will implement standardized clinical and laboratory
procedures for prenatal aid obstetrical care, based on risk
assessment; retrain and re-assign 60 female nurses already
in service, to carry out prenatal and FP activities in ambulatory
facilities; train and supervise traditional birtb attendants;
upgrade existing maternity beds in rural health centers and
provide for two additional rural maternities.

Page 4 of 6
(b)  Postnatal and Clinics for Children Under-Five Yeagr of Ate.
Periodic clinics for postnatal -- including PP care - and
growth monitoring of cbildren under five will be expanded
to 77 facilities in the project area. Present coverage of
mother and infant under one year of age will increase from
current 202 to 30S in 1987 and 551 in 1990.  Special attention
will be given to imunizations (I above) and control of diarrheal
diseases, for wbich detailed procedures have been prepared.
Control of acute respiratory infections will be introduced
in 1987 under WH0' LachaiC&l a8SicStancC.
IV. *NDITICE
In coordination with other government agencies and assistance
from UNICEF, USAID, World Food Program and UNFPA, NOPE has initiated
interventions at the national level such as: reactivation of the production
and marketing of Actamine; research of alternative supplementation formulas
(such as ANDY), introduction if nutrition activities in the program
of the Mobile Family Health bnits (UMSF), and reactivation of the
Interministerial Commission on Food and Nutrition (CIAN).
Under the project, a limited number of well-defined interventions,
integrated in the PSME program, will be implemented in Agadir, Settat
and Taroudant:
(a) The major operational innovation will be the detection and
referral of malnourished children and pregnant women by
itinerant nurses or uobile teams, either by home visits
(Strategies 1, 2 and 3), or at Contact Points (Strategies 4
and 5). Similarly, villages, hamlets and pockets of poverty
at high riak of malnutrition will be identified and screened
(active detection). This approach will permit the detection
of malnourished ehildren below 5 years of age whose wast'ig
or stunting seldom motivates consultation.
(b) Introduction of PSME units, staffed with female nurses, in the
peripheral facilities, particularly the Rural Dispensaries,
will facilitate th.e fclol-up of referred cases and the long-term
rehabilitation of malnourished children and pregnant vomen.
In addition, pwsetnatal clinics will contribute to the detectiou
of malnourished infants and toddlers of 0 to 2 years of age
by systematic growtb monitoring (passive detection).
(G) Generalization of nutritional rehabilitation by the mother at
home - rather than at the hospital, by improving the fauily's
diet and cooking methods instead of providing supplements
especially intended for the patient which are expensive and
seldom reach the child. This approach reduces hospitalization

costs but requires increased supervision by itinerant nurses
or mobile units according to the different outreacb strategies.
It also requires a dependable supply of supplementation nutrients.
The intervention has undeniable educational value but needs
to be precisely targeted if it is to remain within the present
limited budget.
T. yaU  LIM cURTvE CAN
MOPH acknowledges the necessity to improve access to the healtb
services. During project preparation, consultations with representatives
of the coumunity have underlined the need for effective basic curative
care as a prerequisite for any further intervention in preventive care.
Objectives were set in three areas:
(a)  Hospitality:  Improved reception and orientation of patients,
improved orgenization of clinics and changes in working hours
for consumers' convenience, decrease of waiting tine, easier
access to nurse or physician, facilitation of referral and
transportation.
(b)  Ouslity of Core:  More efficient response to the felt needs,
improved laboratory and X-ray services, assistance in trans-
portation of emergencies, facilitation of admissions to hospitals,
continuity of care and medical records, standardization of
5 treatments, provision of basic emergency dental care.
(c)  DisnensinE of Basic Druns: Improved supply of appropriate
drugs, correct prescription, efficient dispensing.
Civil authorities, traditional and religious leaders have
made clear that continued participation of the cou.m.ity in health matters
is likely to be conditional to progress made in those three areas.
To assess present and potential deuatd for care, a study of consultation
was carried out in Agadir and Settat during project preparation. Causes
of consultation were surveyed and the effectiveness of the medical and
social answers provided by the health services was analyzed. NOPR now
has a precise profile of current demand and a good insight of major
flaws; a timetable for improvement has been set according to each one
of the six proposed strategies. In view of the importance of qualitative
improvements. progress will be closely mouitored and several protocoles

tiveness and assessment of costs.
VI.  "SIC   IATIO
NOP's approach to sanitation is realistic and interventions
are well-designed. Priority is given to drinking water for wbich there
is a felt need, and collective interventions are well-accepted and

financially feasible. Some of the densely populated areas require,
however, inutallation of latrines which, conversely, are not traditionally
accepted, derive from individual initiatives and are relatively expensive.
Caution has boen exercised against introducing in rural or
periurban areas costly uodern solutions wbich may be culturally and
ecologically unadapted. Priority has beeD givan to support and
improvement of local initiatives.
The following objectives, allowing for variations according
to the terrain and settlement, are set for Agadir, Settat, Taroudant:
(a) In urban areas served by house convections or public standpipes
and sewage systems, bacteriological control and chlorination
will be improved.
(b)  In rural areas, wells, cisterns anI other groundwater points
already surveyed in 1983 will be placed under bacteriological
surveillance by health personnel according to Strategies 1
to 5. Wells and cisterns, within 5 koe of a bealth facility,
will be limed periodically or treated by continuous cblorination
with locally made chlore diffusers. Cases of typhoid will
be systematically followed up in the coemunity. In specific
areas, particularly in Settat, ground waters will be tested
for fluor, nitrates and ferrous sulphate.
(c) Improvement of 200 wells, cisterns and greundwater points
will be made cs demonstration projects, in collaboration with
the Ministry of Agriculture, in scbools, mosques, souks or
villages. Financial participation of the comunity will be
sought for the civil works in exchange for information, training
for local workers and technical advice by NOPE.
(d) Demonstration activities will also be carried out for household
water conservation -- local construction of filters, utilization
of storage tanks, and improved bandling of water. Kxperizental
construction of latrines will be carried out in selected villages
and periurban low-income settlements.
(e) Coordination will be established between several water supply
interventions - handpumps and plastic water tanks installed
witb UNICEF assistance, emergency relief by public water trucks
and Bank-financed water supply developments in liougra, Taroudant
and Ouled Teima in Agadir province and El Gara in Settat.
Responsibilities of the Health Services will be coordinated
with those of ONMP and the Ministry of Agriculture.
Iuplentatian of this progrin will require upgrading of public
health laboratory facilities, laboratory fixed and portable equipment
and umterials as well as a dependable supply of chlorine and line.

HEALTH PROJECT
Proposed Strategies for the Delivery
of Primarl Care
Based on precise mapping of population settlements and field
studies carried out for project preparation, MOPE identified different
combinations of resources for delivering primary care in a cost-effective
manner. Several combinations of resources - known as "strategies"
-  use fixed facilities and outreach in different ways according to
population density and dispersal, terrain and socio-economic organization.
In rural areas of Agadir, Settat and Taroudant, the strategy to be utilized
for each settlement, village or commune was discussed with health staff,
civil administrators, religious and community leaders. In most cases,
a formal agreement was reacbed between MOPH, civil authorities and the
comunity leaders on the contribution expected from each party. Six
strategies will be implemented:
SIDATEY I1
Concentrated Ponulation (small towns, periurban developments,
villages).  A fixed facility -   urban or rural health center, urban
or rural dispensary, according to the population - will deliver the
six core programs through general clinics, open to all patients, and
specialized clinics - prenatal, family planning, tuberculosis, NCR,
pediatrics -- held on specific days each week. Emergency care will
be available at all times by staff on call. Health centers will be
staffed with physicians, dispensaries will be staffed by nurses, with
at least one female nurse. Residents live within walking distance and
will be expected to aeek preventive as well as curative care at the
facility. Rome visits will be limited to the VDMS and special purposes
such as epidemiological inquiries and control of bedridden invalids.
3SRAPF 2
Populations located between 1 and 5 kms of a health facility
will still be expected to seek curative care and follow preventive clinics
at the facility.  Preventive care vill be complemented by home vi8s.ts
by an itinerant nurse equipped with a bicycle or moped - five visits
per year for the VDMS, special visits as in Strategy 1, and visits for
the control of wells and basic sanitation. An interplay will develop
between the facility and the outreach a'tivities.



- 72 -
Annex D
Page 2 of 3
STEATKG! 3
Population located between 5 and 10 kUs vill be expected to
seek emergency and curative care at the facility. It is however unlikely
that the population will follov preventive clinics. Outreach activities
become the main element of the system. Itinerant nurses equipped with
mopeds or motorcycles vill make home visits and vill be trained to provide
both curative and preventive care.
SAQI   4
Dispersed populations located beyond 10 km8 of a facility
are unlikely to seek curative or preventive care on a continuing basis
but only emergency care. Multipurpose clinics for curative and preventive
care vill be held once or twice a week at conveniently located Meetint
Points. These clinics vill require a paramedical staff of two to three
persons with a light vehicle and portable equipment.
5
Dispersed, distant, nomadic populations, or settlements that
are isolated during part of the year by rainfalls or snow, vill be served
by mobile teams. on a periodic basic - five times a year. At each
visit, curative and preventive care should be delivered as a one-time
operation. This modality will require a staff of three to four, larger
vehicles and heavier medical and dental portable equipment.
SlU*FGr 6
In the case of isolated clusters of population, where social
organization of the community is propitious, utilization of co  unitv
health vorkers may lend better results at a lover cost than the mobile
teams. Voluntary health vorkers and traditional birth attendants, under
the control of the community leaders and periodic supervision by nurse
supervisors vill serve as outposts of the health services. This approach
vill require well-trained supervisors and vehicles adapted to the terrain.
By constructing additional facilities in the rural areas -
48 basic rural dispensaries and 37 rural dispensaries - the project
will improve the percent distribution of rural population by distance
to the nearest facility:

Besides distance, a variety of criteria was utilized to
decide on the strategy to be used for each settlement.  Strategies are
therefore distributed to fit local needs realistically.  The distribution
of population by strategy vill be as follows:

HEALTH DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Structure and Resuonuibilities of the
Division de l'Infrastructure Chargfe de la Planification (DICP)
A. PLANNING
The planning section of the DICP has developed through project
preparation and is presently staffed by three physicians, an economist,
four instructors in nursing (cadristes), one administrator, statisticians,
computer programuers and support staff. Part of this staff - one physician,
one cadriste and one administrator -- will be assigned to the Project
Implementation Unit (PIU), and will only be available to the DICP part-time.
Before negotiations begin, two economists and a social scientist will
have been recruited. The DICP has successfully made good use of foreign
technical assistance and at present employs three full-time advisers
financed by USAID and two full-time WHO advisers.
To meet its responsibilities in the preparation, advocacy
and isplementation of the 1986-88 three-year plan, the DICP will develop
seven functiunal units or task groups, some of them permanent, others
temporary. Task groups will also utilize professionals from otber MOPE
departments to help on particular problems. The units will be as follows:
1.   Lont-ters Planning vill examine the long-term options for
the sector, thus providing a framework for short-term planning
and research.
2.   Short-term Plannin& will prepare the three-year Plan and coordinate
the consultative process within and outside MOPE.
!. Manpower Planning will reviev the performance and costs of
the main categories of personnel in collaboration with the
Training Division and the Division of Personnel, as a basis
for estimating future requirements and needs for training.
4.   Health Programs vill set standards and annual targets for
the health services, and monitor tae implementation of health
programs in the provinces, in particular in the three project
provinces, in collaboration with the PIU.



- 76 -
Annex F
Page 2 of 4
5.   Physical Planning presently regulates the creation of new
outpatient facilities. The scope of the unit will be extended
to include hospitals, and the unit will work in cooperation
with the construction unit of the DAA.
6.   Biomedical and Hospital Technology.  This unit will control
the acquisition and utilization of biomedical technology -
laboratory, radiology and radiotherapy, electro-medical diagnosis,
-- where major investment and recurrent expenditures are entailed.
7.   Research and Evaluation vill coordinate the research and evaluation
program described in B below.
B. STUDIES
The Health Development Plan for 1981-85 sets the following
researcn objectives for possible Bank financing: a) to carry a detailed
analysis of the health problems and problems posed by health care delivery;
and on that basis, b) to establish and implement appropriate programs
in the Basic Health Services (Agadir, Settat and Taroudant); c) to assess
the costs and benefits of programs; and d) to prepare their extension
to the rest of the country. Emphasis was placed on establishing a permanent
research capacity in MOPE for management and planning purposes.
three main research areas are proposed: a) health services
monitoring; b) financing of the health sector; c) hospital management
and performance.
Health Services Monitoring
Health services monitoring will cover three main areas:
(i) Evaluative research on performance will be based on standard
information collected monthly or weekly by all health facilities
in the three provinces, and focusing particularly on:
* Accessibility and effectiveness of family planning programs,
number of acceptors and contraceptive prevalence.
* Accessibility and performance of MCB programs. Catchment
areas and gradients of care.
* Outreacb activities. Performanve dnd output of itinerant
nurses and mobile teams.
. Referrals.
* Sanitation/Drinking vater. Number and type of activities
performed.



- 77 -
Annex F
Page 3 of 4
(ii) Operational research on alternative method of delivering care
vill be based on information collected by selected health
facilities. This research vill call for experimentation on
techniques and/or organization and management, carried out
in rural areas of the provinces of Agadir, Settat and Taroudant,
plus six other provinces. Priority areas vill be:
H Methods of contraception.
* Utilization of IEC materials.
* Techniques for monitoring pregnancy, growth and nutrition
rehabilitation.
* Distribution of health teams.
* Quality of reception and orientation of patients.
* Domestic use of vater.
(iii) Monitoring of bealth indicators - a statutory joint reponsibility
of the DICP and the Division of Epidemiology. Three priority
areas have been identified:
* Follow-up on the study of contraceptive prevalence.
* Follow-up on the study of infant mortality.
Application of the findings of the National Household
Survey of Expenditures on Nutrition for nutrition program.
Most of the evaluative research will be carried out directly
by the staff of the DICP with the participation of other Divisions
of MOPH assisted by Moroccan or foreign consultants, MHO and
USAID advisers as necessary.
Most of the field research vill be carried out by provincial
staff under the supervision and technical guidance of the
DICP, with the assistance of consultants as necessary. Research
that requires specialized capacity vill be carried out under
contracts for the DICP by faculty and graduate students of
the Departments of Social and Preventive Medecine of Rabat
and Casablanca Universities.
Study on the Financin2 of the Health Sector
The GOM gives high priority to a comprehensive study on the
financing of the sector as a follov-up to the 8ealth Sector Financial
Analysis prepared by the Bank in 1983. The study will cover the public,
parastatal and private subsectors. The first phase of the study vill
analyze the financial flows in the sector. It vill reviev the sources,
channelling and allocation of resources for health activities - including
the Rabat and Casablanca University E,spitals but excluding social welfare
- and will assess the equity and efficiency of the system. The second
phase of the study vill explore alternative methods of financing:
modalities of cost-recovery, the expansion of social security or insurance



- 78 -
Annex F
Page 4 of 4
schemes, and indirect revenues.  The Bank vill have an opportuniL7 to
express its views before any policy based on the study vas put into
effect. The results of the first phase are expected by mid-1986.
The study vill be directed by a Steering Comittee vith the
participation of the Ministries of Health, Finance, Planning and Economic
Affairs, and carried out by a Task Force under the direction of the
Secretary General of NOPR. Technical coordination will be provided
by the DICP with technical assistance from local and foreign consultants
or uultilateral agencies.
The project will finance contracts for services and technical
assistance for the preparation, discussion and publication of the study.
Study on Hospital Performauce and Management
Increasing demands for hospital care lead to delays in the
admission of patieuts referred by the outpatient services. In addition,
the escalating enats of hospitals threaten the financing of outpatient
services. Rerearch on hospital performance and management is urgently
needed to increase prodactivity and reduce costs. The study will cover
a sample of selected hospitals inside and outside the Project Area:
six provincial hospitals (Agadir, Settat, Narrakech, Fez, Neknes and
Kenitra) and four district hospitals to be selected.
Basic data on costs of provincial and district hospitals were
collected in 1983 and 1984, so that the study will focus on organization
(clinical and support services), performance (quantity and quality),
and management issues in 1985 and 1986.
The study will be carried out by a consulting firm assisted
by MOPE vith the technical assistance of local and foreign consultants.
The project will finance materials and local expenditures
related to the study, data processing, contracts for services and technical
assistance, seminars to discuss the findings and their application and
publLcation of the results.

HEALTH DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
SuDDly of Basic Druis
Since 1979 MOPE has been concerned with the progressive shortage
of basic drugs and the Central Tharmacy's aging facilities, and has
explored alternative supply systess. In search for solutions, the
Direction des Affaires Techniques has coordinated the work of WHO and
UNICEF consultants and technicctl assistance by Management Sciences for
Health (MSH) financed by USAID, as well as assistance offered as courtesy
of the local pharmaceutical industry. MOPE and/or consultants prepared
eight technical reports on public health, pharmacological, engineering,
architectural and economic aspects of the drug supply system vhich are
available in project files.
On the basis of these technical reports, discussions with
BOPH officials and representatives of the pharmaceutical industry, the
Appraisal Mission agreed that the reorganization of the drug supply
system is an urgent necessity. For NOPE's operations, efficiency requires
that the several managerial, administrative and technical functions
- selection of drugs, standardization, budgeting, ordering, procurement,
reception payments, storage, packaging, distribution and supervision
of utilization -- be regrouped under a single agency. This opinion
is strongly supported by the health services, wholesalers and manufacturers
who will then deal with one agency rather than several administrative
units in different departments of MOP8 and Ministry of Finance. The
real issue under discussion has been the opportunity for MOPE to buy
basic drugs, either locally or abroad, or to formulate its own basic
drugs. The Appraisal Mission revieved with MOPE officials, WHO, UNICEF
and USAID consultants, three major alternatives.
1. Formulation I by NOPH
NOPH's Central Pharmacy will continue to formulate some 46
basic drugs for primary care, and will improve and increase its output
to make up for the present shortage and meet future needs. This alternative,
originally proposed by MOPE, was included in the 1981-85 Health Divelopment
lote: "Formulation" is the final stage of drug production, from inter-
mediate ingredients to final or finished form. It consists of simple
mechanical operations such as mixing, solving or dispersing, and fragmen-
tation into dosage forms (tablets, capsules, tubes, etc.). By comparison,
"productione covers the entire transformation process from raw materials
or basic chemicals to intermediate ingredients and final formulation
- it consists of complex physical/ehemical operations such as extraction,
fermentation and synthesis.



- 80 -
Annex C
Page 2 of 3
Plan. It vill require, however, a US$10 million investment to construct
and equip a nev plant according to regulations and prevailing standards;
acquisition of advanced technology (i.e. in the formulation of antibiotics
and toxics), and a substantial increase of staff -- from the present
32 to 115 workers. According to MOPH's atudies, expected savings, as
compared to procurement, could offset the amortization of investments
and the additional operating costs, although significant risks - technical
as well as financial -- will be involved.
2.   Procurement of Finished Basic Drugs in Bulk
HOPH will procure all the 46 basic drugs needed for basic
health care, either in the local market or in the international market.
This alternative will spare NOPE a major investment and greatly simplify
its operations. Only a small formulation laboratory, such as all major
hospitals have, vill suffice to prepare about ten basic solutions and
ointments. A packaging unit will still be required to convert the drugs
in bulk into single-dosage packages. The local pharmaceutical industry,
however, has consistently shown little interest in tendering for the
formulation of low-cost generic drugs, which will require immobilization
of capital and production capacity, for minimal benefits. KOPH's basic
drugs will only represent 2Z of total drug expenditures in the country.
For similar reasons, joint ventures have not been attractive for the
industry. Procurement of basic drugs under finished forms in the
international market proved expensive in foreign currency, and the
finished forms did not always fit the needs of primary care. MOPE has
evidence of many failures with procurement of finished drugs over the
last years in spite of the declared good will of the industry.
3. Toll Formulation
This alternative has developed recently in many middle-income
countr es. Documented experience existc for India, Tunisia, Brazil
and Cost* Rica among others. Toll formulation consists of Government
procuring intermediate ingredients on the international open market
and contracting vith local industry for the formulation, on the basis
of costs plus an agreed-upon benefit. The finished product is deliver-d
in bulk under the Government's label. Toll formulation allows for
considerable savings by purchasing ingredients in the open market and
will spare NOPE major inveatments. It is attractive to the local industry
which will use its idle capacity witbout imobilizing capital. The
industry will be ready to toll-formulate the more sophisticated drugs,
such as antibiotics, for vhich idle technology and installations cannot
be utilized for other purposes. Eowever, for the simplest drugs which
require virtua!.ly no technology and only standard equipment, the industry's
idle capacity can be utilized for otber products, such as cosmetics,
for much larger profits. This alternative still requires from the Central
Pharmacy an accurate planning, an excellent procurement capacity based



- 81 -
Annex G
Page 3 of 3
on up-to-date information on international market prices, and flexible
and rcpid procedures for contracting and payment.
Having reviewed these alternatives with the assistance of
two consultants from the pharmaceutical industry, the Appraisal
Mission agreed to the final MOPE proposal, vhicb, in turn, meets the
local industry's approval:
MOPH will procure ingredients in the open international market
and vill:
(a) Contract with local industry for the toll formulation of anti-
biotics and some six products requiring sophisticated technology.
The industry will utilize its available capacity of non-versatile
equipment and deal witb the most expensive and therefore profitable
drugs. HOPH will be spared an investmeat of about US$8 million
in sophisticated and rapidly changing technology and equipment.
(b) Formulate in its own facilities the simplest high-volume,
low-cost, minimal technology products wbich yet represent
the most comon drugs in every day use in the health services
- pills, powders, ointments, solutions, syrups and
suppositories. The industry will rather avoid these cumber-
some operations. For the formulation of this group of drugs,

The proposed project reflects these conclusions.
