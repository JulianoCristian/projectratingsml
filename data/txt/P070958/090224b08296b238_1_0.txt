Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The project will be closing on December 31, 2014. The local investments implemented through the performance-based block grants are contributing to
 more balanced economic development and improved living conditions among the local population. A new and more equitable municipal fiscal transfer
 formula is being implemented. A proposal for the restructuring of the Cities and Villages Development Bank (CVDB) will be finalized by December 31,
 2014. A National Solid Waste Management Strategy will also be finalized by the same date.
