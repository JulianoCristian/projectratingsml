                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The local investments implemented through the performance-based block grants are contributing to more balanced economic development and improved living conditions among the
                         local population. A new and more equitable municipal fiscal transfer formula is being implemented.
                         A proposal for the reform of the Cities and Villages Development Bank (CVDB) is being prepared.
