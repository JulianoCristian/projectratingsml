components:\n            (a) A Rehabilitation Program (1982-1985) consisting of\n            resealing, overlay and intensive repair of about 400 km of\n            paved roads and regraveling of about 50 km of gravel roads\n            which can no longer be properly maintained. The first 184 km\n            have already been selected. The roads to be rehabilitated in\n            1983 to 1985 would be chosen in agreement with the Bank, out\n            of an agreed preliminary list. (b) A Maintenance Program\n            (1981-1985) consisting of measures to improve MOP's\n            maintenance capacity (a program started under the ongoing\n            Maintenance Project), including: (i) purchase of equipment\n            to increase production of crushed aggregate for asphaltic\n            concrete, base repair and surface treatment; (ii) workshop\n            improvements and tools; (iii) purchase of vehicle weight\n            control equipment to expand and improve axle load control;\n            and (iv) technical assistance for equipment fleet management\n            and repair, training of road and equipment maintenance\n            personnel.
