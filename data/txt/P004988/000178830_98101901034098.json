"The project comprises the expansion of\n            existing fertilizer production facilities owned by SEMADCO\n            at Talkha, to increase capacity by 570,000 TPY urea. The\n            project includes: (a) services of a technical advisor and of\n            a general contractor; (b) design, engineering, licensing and\n            commissioning, complete with off-site facilities and\n            ancillary and related equipment, of: (i) an ammonia plant\n            (based on natural gas feedstock) with an annual capacity of\n            396,000 TPY ammonia, of which approximately 330,000 TPY\n            ammonia will be converted to urea and about 66,000 TPY\n            ammonia will be utilized in the existing fertilizer\n            facilities; and (ii) a urea plant with an annual capacity of\n            570,000 TPY urea; (c) procurement and installation of a\n            polyethylene bag-making unit with an annual capacity of 20\n            million bags; (d) training and pre-operating expenses\n            required for SEMADCO to manage and operate the project facilities."}, "docdt": "1974-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
