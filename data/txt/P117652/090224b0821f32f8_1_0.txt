                         Implementation Status Overview
                         As of December 2013 CAB2 STP project has disbursed 96% out of the total amount of $14.9 million of project funds. All payments to the ACE consortium now completed and the
                         submarine cable is in operation and was commercially launched in February 2013. The use of capacity has gone from 50Mbs before the cable to 300Mbs in June 2013 and to
                         456Mbs n December - ie, the use has so far gone up 9 times when compared to the situation before the cable and it can still go up 10 more times before an upgrade is needed in
                         cable capacity. Average prices are already coming down (the operator is offering 4-8 times more capacity for the same price) and CST has launched lower end ADSL and mobile
                         services in October 2013, which allow lower income consumers to pay 10-30 times less for a lower quality service (more limited speed and traffic) - this is likely also driven by the

                         entrance of the second operator expected later in 2014.

                         The government has successfully awarded a second telecommunications global license in May 2013 to UNITEL International Holdings, and the legal deadline for the start of
                         operations is May 2014. While initially the second operator indicated it may become operational by 2013 year end, it has now delayed the expected date to first semester of 2014. As

                         part of the package for the second license the government has sold the whole 24.5% government participation in STP-Cabo, having fully divested from the cable - Government keeps
                         however one single share - a golden share, that gives it the right to veto any chances to the companies main operating principles, such as a possible change of the open access
                         principles.

                         Through the project Government has also developed an options study to look at the best manner of upgrading the existing connection with Príncipe island. In the short term the two
                         operators are going to setup their own microwave links with higher capacity - this should happen by June 2014. In the medium term Government is pursuing opportunities to develop
                         the submarine connection to Principe by piggy-backing on: (i) the return of the ACE boat to install Segment 4, and/or (ii) by coordinating with the authorities of Equatorial Guinea, who
                         plan to build submarine connection from Malabo to Annabon - the project could be reconfigured at marginal cost to include Malabo-Príncipe-(São Tomé)-Annabon. A financial
                         contribution would be needed, and this could possibly be obtained by aggregating investment from the two operators, other investors like HBD and oil companies operating in the
                         country's territory, and Government, for example through the Universal Service Fund (USF) - no Bank funds are currently being envisaged for this.

                         The mid-term review (MTR) for the project took place in June 2013. It was the opportunity to decide what would be the priority investments, to be structured on a PPP basis, going
                         forward: both using project funds but also by using part of the funds received with the sale of the second license, and which Government had committed to reinvest in the sector and
                         possibly any funds currently existing under the USF. Currently the projects that have been selected include: (i) connecting secondary schools to the internet (with CAB2 funds) and
                         (ii) implementing 2-3 telecenters, (iii) distributing internet-enabled tablets, with pre-loaded school textbooks, to secondary schools students and teachers (funded through Government
                         funds).

                         A consultancy to work with government and the regulator (AGER) on legal and regulatory amendments needed to reflect the new sector reality (submarine cable and competition) is
                         well underway. This consultancy also includes the development of regulatory and economic tools (cost models, etc) for issues like interconnection, as well as training in all of these
                         aspects.

                         The main milestones coming up over the next 6 months are (i) the conclusion of the legal and regulatory assistance to AGER (with approval/adoption of the new texts and tools); (ii)
                         the launch of the tenders for connecting schools, purchasing/distributing tablets and implementing telecenters; and (iii) the approval an adoption of the ICT strategy.
