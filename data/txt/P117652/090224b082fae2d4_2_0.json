Some lessons learned included: when the\n            implementation capacity of the borrower is limited, more\n            effort/resources are needed to provide strong technical\n            assistance and closer supervision. In small countries with\n            limited project implementation experience, the selection of\n            an existing PIU may prove to be a good decision, but\n            capacity may need to be strengthened in particular areas\n            where specific technical expertise is needed to ensure\n            successful project implementation. The Bank may want to\n            consider expanding the use of models where items are\n            considered as non-procurable (as was the case for 88 percent\n            of this project, which has certainly contributed to the\n            project success): In investment projects where private\n            sector consortium models intervene, if a comprehensive\n            analysis is carried out to ascertain the principles of\n            efficiency and transparency, accepting industry-specific\n            procurement processes and practices as valid may greatly\n            accelerate project implementation, while still ensuring\n            efficiency and transparency principles. In ICT projects\n            focused on the development of the infrastructure\n            supply-side, it is beneficial to incorporate demand-side\n            development components as well, like for instance connecting\n            schools to the Internet as was the case of CAB2 project, or\n            hospitals, and other government sites. In order to enhance\n            adoption of installed connectivity capacity it is useful to\n            envisage actions to stimulate demand so that the effects of\n            improved connectivity reaches the local population faster."}, "docdt": "2015-06-17T13:27:00Z"}
