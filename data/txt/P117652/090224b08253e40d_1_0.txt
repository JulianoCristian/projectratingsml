                         The development objective of the proposed project is consistent with the PDO for the CAB Program: To contribute to increase geographical reach and usage of regional
                         broadband network services and reduce their prices in the territory of São Tomé and Príncipe.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         As of June 2014 CAB2 STP project has disbursed 98% out of the total amount of $14.9 million of project funds. All of the main activities of the project have largely been completed,
                         namely the arrival and operation of the cable, the entrance of a second operator and full government divestiture from the cable company.

                         1. The ACE submarine cable is in operation and was commercially launched in February 2013. The use of capacity has gone from 50Mbs before the cable to 300Mbs in June 2013,
                         456Mbs in December 2013, and to 620Mbs in April 2014 - ie, the use has so far gone up 12 times when compared to the situation before the cable and it can still go up 7 more times

                         before an upgrade is needed in cable capacity. Average prices are already coming down: CST is offering 4-8 times more capacity for the same price, and has launched lower end
                         ADSL and mobile services in October 2013, which allow lower income consumers to pay 10-30 times less for more limited speed and traffic service - this trend is also likely to
                         continue with the entrance of the second operator.

                         2. On May 23rd, 2014, the second operator, UNITEL, successfully launched technically in STP and commercial launch is expected in July 2014. Interconnection fees have now been
                         agreed.

                         3. As part of the package for the second license the government has fully divested from the submarine cable vehicle (STP-Cabo) keeping only a golden share that enables it to
                         guarantee open access principles. STP-Cabo held its first board meeting including UNITEL in April 2014.

                         After delivering all of these activities successfully, the client team is now working on further improvements at the margin. Government was encouraged to follow-up on the adoption of
                         the ICT strategy, and of certain regulations prepared through the project and approval of revisions to the telecom law so that these are finalized by the project closing date, in
                         December 2014.

                         During the MTR mission conducted on June, 2013, a consultation workshop had been carried out with stakeholders to identify ICT priority projects to be financed with (i) remaining
                         project funds, and (ii) funds Government obtained from second operator’s license to promote ICTs in the country. It was agreed that CAB2 project proceeds will be utilized to connect
                         secondary schools in STP to Internet, and the Government would in parallel finance the establishment of three community Telecenters, and purchasing computing devices for
                         schools. The tender for connecting secondary schools to the internet, is expected to be launched in June 2014. This is the last activity to be financed through the project.

                         Preparations for the project Implementation Completion Report (ICR) have started, as the project closes on December 31, 2014.

                         Finally, a new additional financing for an education project is being discussed that could have potential synergies with the activities of CAB2

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project team will shortly launch the bidding documents for connecting schools to the internet, the last activity to be financed through the project.

                         In parallel, the government will confirm the use of proceeds from sale of the second license to finance Telecenters project and possibly computing devices for education.

                         The ICT and Education teams will collaborate to find suitable synergies between CAB2 and the Additional Financing for the Education project currently being prepared.
