Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 As of December 5, 2014 CAB2 STP project has disbursed 99% out of the total amount of $14.9 million of project funds. All of the main activities of the
 project have largely been completed, namely the arrival and operation of the cable, the entrance of a second operator and full government divestiture
 from the cable company.

 The ACE submarine cable is in operation and was commercially launched in February 2013. The use of capacity has gone from 50Mbs before the cable
 to 300Mbs in June 2013, 456Mbs in December 2013, and to 775Mbs in November 2014 - ie, the use has so far gone up more than 15 times when
 compared to the situation before the cable. Average prices are already coming down: CST is offering 4-8 times more capacity for the same price, and
 has launched lower end ADSL and mobile services in October 2013, which allow lower income consumers to pay 10-30 times less for more limited
 speed and traffic service - this trend is also likely to continue after the entrance of the second operator.

  On July 29, 2014 the second operator, UNITEL, successfully launched commercial operations (after a technical launch earlier). As part of the package
 for the second license the government has fully divested from the submarine cable vehicle (STP-Cabo) keeping only a golden share that enables it to
 guarantee open access principles. STP-Cabo held its first board meeting including UNITEL in April 2014.
 The project has supported the regulator and Government through the development of several legal and regulatory instruments. Some of these are
 pending approval by government.
 The project has awarded a contract to supply internet connectivity to all secondary schools in STP (an activity that was not initially foreseen in the
 project). The service is mostly installed and is currently being tested for acceptance and final payment. The original scope of this contract had to be
 drastically reduced following receipt of proposals, as the financial proposal largely exceeded the available budget. Given that there have since been
 exchange rate gains, the project is team is now negotiating a small amendment to the contract that allow reinforcement of the service in 2-3 larger
 schools.
 Both the Bank and Government teams have initiated preparation of the project's ICR, and first drafts are expected by the closing date.

         The unit is bits per second per person.
         The total use of international internet bandwidth has steadily grown from 50Mbs before the cable to 300Mbs in June 2013, 456Mbs in
         December 2013, 775 Mbs in November 2014, to 1,085 Mbs at the end of the project. As of November 2014, the allocated capacity within
         the international STP cable is 4,500Mbs, and installed 775Mbs. The use has so far gone up 15 times when compared to the situation before
         the cable and it can still go up 20 times in two years after the project.

         Operators have seen their DSL subscription base grow (from 600 to 5,300 according to the main operator), and the
         sector in Africa has experienced a significant growth in the use of mobile technologies as one of the main means of
         accessing the internet today (something not foreseen at the time of project preparation). As of June 2014 the reported
         indicator for Internet penetration per 100 people remained unchanged at a steady 0.7% as at the beginning of the
         project. This indicator will be reviewed at project closing to verify the final Internet penetration figure (the December
         2014 will only become available after the project closing date), including an analysis of what is included in this figure (in
         terms of technology). Given that the submarine cable became operational on February 2013, and competition in the
         market just started in mid-2014 (both later than expected), it may be too early to measure full impact of these events
         on internet penetration and internet subscriber base is forecasted to increase further after project closure.

         Comments
         The arrival of the submarine cable and the entrance of a telecom competitor in the market (although later than initially planned) have
         boosted the telecom sector by lowering prices and increasing network coverage. As a result, fixed mainlines plus cellular phones per 100
         people has increased beyond the indicator target set at appraisal, and it is expected to keep growing as competition continues stimulating
         the market.

         With the arrival of the submarine cable on February 2013, the cost of international connectivity has dropped drastically,
         allowing the country to access for first time to low-cost international connectivity. Average monthly price of wholesale
         international E1 capacity link from capital city to Europe, measured in monthly US$ for 2Mbps dropped from US$9,000
         in 2010 to US$2,500, far below the US$6,000 target set at appraisal.

         This indicator looks at the number of active fixed and mobile subscribers (internet subscribers not accounted to avoid double counting). The
         value for June 30, 3014 already surpsasses the current target by 14%.
         Female beneficiaries have been calculated on a pro-rata basis using the figure: 50.5%. The improvements in ICT
         sector in STP can allow Sao Tome´s women to access markets in growing numbers by lowering the transaction costs

               Comments
               This indicator is measured as the rate of competitiveness of the telecom sector as a result of the project assistance. Connecting the country
               for the first time ever to reliable and affordable international connectivity, bringing competition and private sector participation in the
               telecommunication, together with updating the legal framework and strengthening the regulatory authorities, has showed a highly relevant
               impact in the sector, as shown by the impact on access rates, prices, and the additional player in the market (the second operator).
               Interviews with key sector staekholders and population in general unanimously recognize the impact of the main project activities on the
               sector.

               This is indicator will be reviewed at project closing to verify final price value, particularly given that competition in the market just started in
               August 2014 (later than planned), and latest figures are from June 2014. It is not expected that the impact on prices will be immediate and it
               may be too early to see impact.

               Comments
               In May 2013, the government successfully awarded a second telecommunications global license to UNITEL International Holdings. In late
               July 2014 UNITEL started its commercial activity in STP.
               While the start of operations of the cable could have motivated the entrance of an additional ISP. In practice, however, these days mobile
               operators mostly play that role in the market elsewhere in Africa. It is therefore not likely that an additional ISP will enter the market
               immediately.

               Comments
               This indicator measures the progress of unfettered access for all operators to regional infrastructure. The technical assistance provided
               throughout the project help ensure the principles of open access to cable capacity for future operators, and affordable access to STP
               citizens. The second telecommunications global license the GoSTP awarded to UNITEL International Holdings satisfactory accessed to
               regional infrastructure. As part of the package for the second license, the government divested from STP-Cabo keeping only a golden share
               to guarantee open access principles to regional infrastructure for future operators.
               As of now, there are no additional operators or service providers, so the rate is 100%.

               Comments
               Immediately after the entry of the submarine cable, Internet access prices started to fall drastically until reaching a price of US$52 monthly
               subscription per Mbit per second. This price highly surpassed the targeted price reduction estimated at appraisal. Also, the arrival of
               competition in the telecom market by licensing a second operator has already shown its impact in lower average prices.

               Broadband coverage has improved in a 24%, 5 p.p. slightly below the expected increase. This indicator will be updated at project closing
               when both operators are expected to have finalized their upgrade in their links connecting Principe Island.
