                         Implementation Status Overview
                         As of March 2013 CAB2 STP project has disbursed 93% out of the total amount of $14.9 million of project funds - with all payments to the ACE consortium now completed. The ACE
                         submarine cable has landed in the country in November 2012 and was commercially launched in February 2012. With little over a month of operation the use of capcity has gone up
                         5 times (from 50 to 250Mbs), and given the current cable capacity it can still increase 18 time more before requiring an upgrade of the international cable capacity. Average prices are
                         already coming down (the operator is offering 4-8 times more capacity for the same price).

                         The government has launched tender to select a second telecommunications operator and one proposal was received on March 8, 2012. While the license award is not yet
                         complete, it is expected to be over the next few days. In its technical proposal the proposed licensee shows investments plans for $16m in capex, with 25 stations in São Tomé and 5
                         in Príncipe (against CST's current 17 in São Tomé and 3 in Príncipe). The network should become operational 1 year after the license final award (ie in May 2014, if the license award
                         is confirmed for early May 2013). The tender for the second license also included the possibility for bidders to buy the totality or part of Government's investment in the STP-Cabo

                         SPV. The operators has decided to buy the whole 24.5% government participation, and therefore, if the license and purchase of shares are confirmed over the next few days, the
                         Government will have fully divested from the cable. Government will always keep one single share - a golden share, that gives it the right to veto any chances to the companies main
                         operating principles, such as a possible change of the open access principles.

                         The project is planning the mid-term review (MTR) for the project - the MTR is contingent on the license award, the latest estimate is end May/early June. The project mid-term review
                         will be the opportunity to consider what what would be the priority investments, to be structured on a PPP basis, going forward. During project preparation it was agreed with
                         Government that Government would reinvest part of the license and share sale proceeds into the sector. The project will work with government to identify the priority investments, to
                         be structured as PPPs with project assistance, and to e financed from (i) funds remaining in the project and/or (ii) the funds governments decides to reinvest as the result of the sale
                         of the license and STP-Cabo shares. Early potential candidates are: the connection to Príncipe, setting up rural shared internet access points in different parts of the country, (iii)
                         connecting secondary schools to the internet.

                         The main milestones coming up over the next 6 months are (i) the final award of the second license, (ii) the kick-off of the legal and regulatory assistance to AGER (a package to
                         assist the regulator adapt to the new sector reality - ie arrival of the ACe cable and competition); (iii) the mid-term review with decisions regarding future investments, (iv) the approval
                         an adoption of the ICT strategy.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         During the project mid-term review scheduled for May-June 2013, the team will look at the remaining un-disbursed balance in the project and consider whether reallocations or
                         restructuring are needed.
