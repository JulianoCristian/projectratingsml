      follows: the project outcome is unsatisfactory, the\n            project's sustainability is unlikely, the institutional\n            development impact is modest, and the Bank and Borrower\n            performance are both satisfactory overall.  The experience\n            of the project provides some lessons regarding the\n            Bank's involvement in highly sensitive or contentious\n            sectors, and regarding the Bank's management of\n            learning and innovation projects. First, with respect to the\n            issue of the Bank's assistance to difficult but\n            critical sectors, the project highlights the need for\n            consistency in the Bank's strategy over an extended\n            period of time and an understanding that there will\n            inevitably be reversals in Government capacity to sustain\n            momentum. The Bank's tendency to focus on the actions\n            of individuals at particular points in time, rather than on\n            the overall trend of government actions, is a particular\n            weakness that needs to be overcome if it is to be successful\n            in its mission. With respect to learning and innovation\n            projects, it is critical to honestly state what the learning\n            objectives are, rather than to meet theoretical\n            best-practice visions of what should be accomplished. For a\n            much larger project that could then allocate funds\n            specifically for monitoring and evaluation, but for an\n            introductory LIC in a sector about which almost nothing was\n            known, higher level outcome indicators should have been\n            rejected in favor of simple output indicators.The project\n            provided some indication that it is possible to overcome\n            disinclination to use foreign consultants for technical\n            assistance, however, it is extremely important to balance\n            the trade-offs between higher quality outputs from foreign\n            consultants and buy-in from government counterparts. In this\n            project, heavy use of local consultants had a positive\n            impact, but could potentially have had a greater impact if\n            it had been combined with greater direct technical\n            assistance from Bank staff during the course of supervision.\n            This was unfortunately not possible due to inadequate\n            resources -- there are simply insufficient staff in terms of\n            sectoral expertise and language ability, especially taking\n            into account the other significant demands placed on them --\n            and security concerns that prevented staff from visiting\n            Yemen. The project provided an excellent example of the\n            importance of local language skills. For the judicial sector\n            in Yemen, which has little interaction with the non\n            Arabic-speaking world, there would not have been a project\n            without an Arabic-speaking task team leader. However, this\n            also meant that much of project supervision was conducted by\n            phone and fax, in Arabic. This in turn placed additional\n            importance on implementation documentation and thorough\n            communications to management. Finally, the project provided\n            an example of the positive effect of ministry\n            implementation. Placing implementation responsibility for\n            the Legal and Judicial Development Project within the two\n            relevant ministries (ministries that did not have previous\n            experience with Bank projects) -- one of the first instances\n            of the direction towards which the Bank was moving --\n            contributed in a positive way to ownership of the project by\n            ministry staff and reinforcement of project goals. However,\n            it also placed additional burdens on the task team leader,\n            and, as would be expected, resulted in a slowdown of\n            activity as a consequence of the change in political\n            leadership at the Ministry of Justice."}, "docdt": "2003-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
