objectives, in that legal\n            and judicial reforms, supported by the project, are designed\n            to complement the structural reforms undertaken lately in\n            Yemen. The project aims at implementing a pilot program of\n            judicial training, to assess, and enhance the effectiveness\n            of the judiciary, provide business advise, as well as\n            develop an economic legislation. The project components\n            include: 1) the judicial development, which will set viable\n            alternatives to the court system, will train judges, and\n            arbitrors, in dispute resolution mechanisms, and provide\n            diagnostic assessments on institution building and judicial\n            efficiency; 2) the legal development, will provide policy\n            and institution building advise, through assistance to the\n            Ministry of Legal and Parliamentary Affairs (MOLPA). The\n            diagnostic assessment of the legal framework, will create\n            the adequacy for prosperous private sector activity; 3) the\n            development of a public awareness campaign, through policy\n            and program management, will provide better understanding of\n            the improved judicial and legal systems."}, "docdt": "1999-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
