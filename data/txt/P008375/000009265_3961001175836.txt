HMflUM  AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PMgSIDENT
OF HEE IUTERAMTIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AD rEWV MEN
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON PROPOSER LOAS
TO THE LAiNACA SEUERAGE AND DRAINAGE BOARD.
THE PARALINNI SEWERAGE BOAR-. AND TIE AYIA NAPA SEWERAGE BOARD.
1.   The following memorandum and recommendation on proposed loans to the
Larnaca Sewerage and Drainage Board (LSDB), the Paralimni Sewerage Board
(PSB), and the Ayia Napa Sewerage Board (ANSB). with the guarantee of the
Republic of Cyprus for US$ 32.0 million equivalent is submitted for approval.
The loans would be made on standard Bank terms to assist in the construction
and implementation of sewerage and drainage systems for the Larnaca area, and
sewerage systems for the communities of Paralimni and Ayia Napa. Financing in
the amount of US$ 32.0 million is to be provided by the Council of Europe
Resettlement Fund. The Government is to provide funds in the amount of US$
21.6 million equivalent as an investment in wastewater re-use schemes in the
project areas.
Backgrgou
2.    Cyprus is a small country with a population of about 690,000 and an open
economy: exports and imports averaged about 552 of GDP in recent years. The
economic structure is diversified: in 1990, industry contributed 262 of GDP
and employed 382 of the labor force; the services sector contributed about 612
(including government) of GDP and employed 452 of the labor force.
3.    Cyprus has a long history of good economic performance, characterized by
high growth, low unemployment, a manageable external debt burden, and
reasonable price stability. Continued gains in output and incomes have been
recorded over the last decade. While rapid growth in exports of agricultural
and manufacturing have played an important role in development, tourism
remains the dominant foreign exchange earner in the economy, with real growth
in the sector of almost 102 per annum over the last decade.
4.    In 1988, Cyprus entered into a Customs Union Agreement with the European
Community (EC), and the phasing out of restrictions on trade between Cyprus
and the EC has begun to take effect.  In July 1990, it formally applied to
join the EC. Cyprus has recently embarked on an industrial restructuring
program with the objective of moving towards a fully open regime consistent
with EC requir^ments.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
5.    The Government is in the process of a transition to meet the challenge
of the impending unification of the EC, and is focussing its efforts on
competing within this market. The objective of the Bank's assistance strategy
in Cyprus is to support the Government's efforts to diversify the country's
economic base and foster exports, and to protect the environment, particularly
its coastal waters. The main areas of concentration have been infrastructure,
industry, agriculture, and water resource development. Recent efforts have
focused increasingly on projects that aim at relaxing major sector
constraints, and include industrial restructuring and financial sector reform



- 2 -
actlvLties, in response to the Government's request for assistance during the
period of transition under its association with the EC.
6.    In providing assistance, the Bank focusses on those areas where its
technical expertise and international experiences are most useful,
partlcularly in project design, pollcy and institutional advice and sector
work. Also, the Bank's financial contribution to a project often plays a
catalytic role in attracting other financiers. Bank assistance is justified
for the proposed project because of limited operational experience with
centralized sewage collection and treatment systems and reuse of treated
effluent. The proposed project supports the Government's environmental
policies concerning the protection of coastal waters and maximum utilization
of scarce water resources. The Bank's involvement in this project would
continue what promlses to be a successful collaborative effort, started under
the Limessol-Amathus project (approved in June, 1990), for solving the twin
environmental concerns of safe dlsposal of waste water and maximum re-use of
resources in a water-scarce situuzion.
7.    The rapid growth of tourism in recent years contributed to a
concentration on construction of accommodation capaclty, which, together with
weak zoning regulation and enforcement, has resulted in some serious
deficiencies in infrastructure, particularly sewerage. Provision of sewerage
in both urban and rural areas has been given preeminence by the Government of
Cyprus. As part of a Government initiative to provide sewerage and drainage
schemes for high priority areas, plans are under way to lnstall piped sewerage
systems for the currently unserved larger towns and tourist centers (Limassol,
Larnaca, Ayia Napa, ParalimnL, and Paphos).  The proposed project would
benefit the towns of Larnaca. and Paralimni, the village of Ayia Napa and
their environs, which, together, account for about half of all tourist
overnights in Cyprus. A comparable project for the Limassol area was approved
in June, 1990.
roglect ObiectLves
8.    The project's objectives are to address the drainage and waste water
disposal problems ln Larnaca, Ayia Napa and Parallmni, three towns on the
southeast coast of Cyprus.  The project would: (i) provide safe, reliable, and
urgently needed systems for the disposal of domestic and commercial waste
water and thereby eliminat. the nuisance and health risks, including the
threat to the area's imporcant tourist industry, that arise from the present
unsatisfactory disposal arrangements; (ii) provide key elements of stormwater
drainage systems to reduce intermittent flooding; (iil) lmprove environmental
conditions and management of scarce water resources; and (iv) strengthen the
institutional capacity of thx sewerage boards of the project towns, which at
present have only a nucleus of staff.
9.    The environmental impact assessments (EA) carried out for the project
highlight its major posltive environmental impacts, since it will reduce
groundwater and seawater contamination, and contribute to the optimum
utilization of critically scarce water resources through the wastewater re-
use component of the project. The incorporation of the EA recommendations



- 3 -
into the projict design, construction, and operation and maintenance
procedures sbould ensure that no adverse environmental effects occur from
project implementation.
10. 1roect: Desgription. The project would consist of: (i) sewerage and
drainage schemes for Larnacs, including a sewage collection system, sewage
treatment plant, a distribution system for treated effluent, and drainage
works in priority areas; and (ii) a sewerage scheme for Ayia Napa and
Paralimni, consisting of separate sewerage systems for the two comrunitios, a
common sewage treatment plant, and distribution systems for the treated
effluent. Due to the nature of coastal development, which has a considerable
bearing on capital cost, only the low lying coastal area of Larnaca,
encompassing about 60X of the town's population, would be included in the
project. In the higher inland areas, the existing sanitation arrangements
generally function adequately, and chere are no immediate plans to provide
sewerage. In Ayia Napa and Paralimni, however, the majority of the
residential and hotel areas would be serviced. The project would also include
technical assistance and training for the sewerage boards' staff.
11.   The cost of the project is estimated at US$ 103.3 million equivalent,
with a foreign exchange component of US$ 43.4 million equivalent (421). A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disburseament schedule
are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations In Cyprus are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. Maps are also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 9635-
CY, is being distributed separately.
12.   Environmental Impa.  Environmental assessments (EA) were carried out
for the Larnaca and Paralimni/Ayia Napa components. As part of the EA
process, public meetings/hearings with environmental non-governmental agencies
and local community representatives were held. Various alternatives for the
different project components were analyzed; the most desirable environmental
options and their possible impacts and mitigating measures were identified.
The EA conclude that the environmental impact Df the proposed project will be
positive, in that groundwater and coastal pollution will be prevented, and
water conservation will be enhanced through wastewater re-use. As a result of
the EA process, the threat to an ecologically important area was averted by
relocating the site of the effluent r.servoir. Other possible detrimental
impacts are largely related to risk and safety considerations related to
system operation. These aspects will be incorporated in the project's final
design and construction contracts. An environmental mitigation and monitoring
plan was agreed during negotiations.
13.   greed Act.gj.   During negotiations, the following principal
agreements were reached:
(a)   The approval of the sewer rates by the Guarantor, the satisfactory
completion of arrangements and procedures for billing and
collecting revenues, the implementation of lease agreements for
the land required for the treatment plants and reservoir sites,



- 4 -
and arrangements for financing from the Council of Europe
Resettlement Fund (CERF), or other arrangements satisfactory to
tha Balnk, are conditions of effectiveness for the loans. In
addition, the effectiveness of the PSB loan is contingent on the
effectiveness of the ANSB loan, and vice versa.
(b)   Beginning in FY 1992, the Boards will implement rates and e'ther
charges to provlde adequate funds to cover: (i) all expenses of
operations, uaintenance, administration and taxes and other
contributions required by law, and depreciation; (ii) all interest
and other charges on debt as well as principal repaymnts in
excess of depreciation; (iii) all increases required to maintain
adequate levels of working capital; and (iv) at least 202 of each
year's annual investment (excluding investments for the effluent
re-use scheme) determined as the average of investment over the
subject year and two subsequent years.
(c)   The Boards' rate structures will be amended at least one year
before customers are connected to the system, In order to meet the
Borrowers' financial objectives, and these structures will include
(in addition to the sewer rates): (i) a surcharge to be applied
against water consumption by those customers, and (ii) a fee for
sale of irrigation water. The Borrowers will, starting in FY
1992, provide the Bank with a copy of their proposed budgets and
financial projections as well as their plans for proposed rates
and charges in respect of the following fiscal year, in adequate
time for review.
(d) The Borrowers agreed to implement the environmental action plan
agreed at negotiations.
14.  BenefZi. The proposed project represents a major contribution towards
improving the environment in the communities along the southeast coast of
Cyprus, and protecting its tourism industry, which is of critical importance
to the economy of the project area and of the whole country. In all three
communities, the present methods of sewage disposal are highly unsatisfactory,
being increasingly responsible for both groundwater and sea water pollution
and pr:aenting health risks and nuisance odors. The benefits from the
proposed project would include: (i) reduction in the health hazard to the
residential and tourist population by eliminating the ove.rflow from on-site
disposal systems; (ii) protection of the tourism industry; (iii) development
of a perennial source of irrigation water in a water-scarce enviroment; (iv)
reduction of losses in property and labor productivity resulting from
flood4ing; and (iv) provision of an essential prerequisite for future economic
development in tZ'. project areas.
15.  I&,jkg. The main risks associated with the project are: (i) possible
lack of cooperation between the two communities of Ayia Napa and Paralimni in
the construction and operation of a shared sewage treatment plant; and (ii)
difficulties in implementing the necessary tariffs. To minimize the first
risk, a legal agreement between the two communities will define institutional



arrangements and respective responsibilities satisfactory to the Bank. To
minimize the risks under (Hi), approval of adequate tariffs will be requJred
before effectiveness.
16.   Recommendatl   .   I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loans.
