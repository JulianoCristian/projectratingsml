3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The project's objectives were to address the drainage and wastewater disposal problems in Lamnaca,
Paralimni and Ayia Napa, three towns on the southeast coast of Cyprus. The project would: (i) provide
safe, reliable, and urgently needed systems for the disposal of domestic and commercial waste water and
thereby eliminate the nuisance of noise and health risks, including the threat to the area's important tourist
industry, that arise from the present unsatisfactory disposal arrangements; (ii) provide key elements of
storm water drainage systems to reduce intermittent flooding; (iii) improve enviromnental conditions and
management of scarce water resources; and (iv) strengthen the institutional capacity of the sewerage boards
of the project towns, which then had only a nucleus of staff.
The objectives were clearly defined and consistent with the country's sector strategy for eliminating health
risks and protecting the coastal lines from sewage pollution and conserving scarce water resources. The
project was almost identical to the Limassol-Amathus Sewerage and Drainage Project (Loan No. 3222-CY)
which was completed with a highly satisfactory rating in 1996. While the project was not complex and
involved similar components, the water pollution control aspect was much stricter than under the
Limassol-Amathus Project: no sewage nor tertiary treated effluent discharge is allowed to the ocean even at
the time of emergencies.
3.2 Revised Objective:
The original objectives were not revised.
3.3 Original Components:
The project consisted of: (a) sewerage and drainage schemes for Larnaca, including a sewage collection
system with 17 pumping stations, a sewage treatment plant, a storage reservoir and a distribution system
for treated effluent, and a storm drainage system in priority areas; (b) a sewerage scheme for Ayia Napa
and Paralimni, consisting of separate sewerage systems for the two communities, a common sewage
treatment plant, and distribution systems for the treated effluent; and (c) consultant services for project
implementation and institutional development of the Larnaca Sewerage and Drainage Board (LSDB), the
Paralimui Sewerage Board (PSB) and the Ayia Napa Sewerage Board (ANSB).
The components were reasonably well designed to achieve the objectives of the project and the borrower's
administrative and financial management capacity was taken into account. The project components were
similar to the ones of the Limassol-Amathus Project except that the sewage treatment plant (STP)
construction and operation, and the consultant services for the Paralimni and Ayia Napa project
components were jointly contracted and managed by the two municipalities.
3,4 Revised Components:
The original description of the components was not revised, but the project cost was increased by about
39% or about $40 million. The main reasons for these increases are as follows: (1) the $15 million cost
increase for Lamaca component was due to: (a) VAT of 8% was newly introduced by the Government after
loan signing; (b) the capacity of STP, including a Tertiary Treatment Plant, was increased by 21% due to
an inclusion of new refugee areas in the project; (c) the scope of work for drainage was increased due to an
additional area coverage and a need to install drainage deeper than in the original plan in some areas; and
(d) the consultant contract was extended for a year due to the scope of work increase; and (2) the remaining
$25.5 million cost increase for Paralimni and Ayia Napa components was caused by:
-2 -



(a) the Government's decision to increase the capacity of the tertiary treatment plant; (b) increase in the
number and size of pumping stations; (c) need for additional land; (d) imposition of VAT of 8 % after the
loan signing; (e) the consultant contract was extended for two years due to the scope of work increase and
the delay in the project implementation.
In order to accommodate the cost increase, reallocations of proceeds of the loan were made on several
occasions. The first reallocation of unallocated amount of $400,000 to engineering/TA/training category
for the Lamaca component was made in June 1995, the second reallocation of $400,000 was made in
September 1996 in a similar manner, and the third reallocation of $300,000 was made from goods to
engineering/TA/training category in July 1998. Reallocation of the unallocated amount of $400,000 to the
engineering/TA/training category of the Paralinni and Ayia Napa components was made in December
1998.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
There was no QAG (Quality Assurance Group) review conducted for this project. At appraisal, the
technical and financial preparations of the various project components were prepared based on the example
of Limassol-Amathus Sewerage and Drainage Project which was then being successfully implemented.
The ICR rates the quality at entry for the Lamaca component as fully satisfactory, because the physical
investment and the institutional aspects were satisfactorily implemented taking into account the
Limassol-Amathus project experience. But the rating for the Paralimni and Ayia Napa components is
marginally satisfactory, because project progress was delayed for two years mainly due to an inadequate
introduction of the joint-venture between the PSB and the ANSB, which was very difficult to establish
under the local law and, consequently, delayed project implementation.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The project's outcome was fully satisfactory for the Lamaca component: the physical implementation of the
component was outstanding and the institutional development for the LSDB was excellent. The LSDB
however, faced cash flow problems due mainly to insufficient internal cash generation to cover rapidly
increasing debt service obligations at the later stage of the project. Agreement has been reached with the
Government to take specific measures to rectify the situation (refer to para. 10.1).
The project outcome was marginally satisfactory for the Paralimni-Ayia Napa component. The physical
implementation of the component is two years behind schedule or only about 60% completed. Paralinini
and Ayia Napa did not request an extension of the loan closing date because they were able to obtain
financing from European Investment Bank (EIB) and the Council of Europe Social Development Fund on
more favorable terms. Thus, the two loans were closed leaving several project components unfinished.
However, with the appointment of the project manager for the STP construction in 1999, the STP contract
implementation has been progressing satisfactorily. Taking into account that all contracts are in place and
that no difficulty in project implementation is foreseen, the Paralinui and Ayia Napa components are rated
as marginally satisfactory.
4.2 Outputs by components:
The design of the project was generally appropriate for all three project components. There were no
macro-economic policy or sector policy objectives included in the project. Achievement of each project
objective is evaluated below.
(i) to provide a safe, reliable system for the disposal of human, and commercial waste water.
-3 -



*   The LSDB component is able to serve 60% of the population. Conmection to the STP with re-use
of effluent, has begun to minimize disposal of untreated or partially treated effluent into the sea and
has increased water availability in the area.
*   The PSB and the ANSB have completed about 60% of the physical investment and is expected to
serve about 90% of the population after two years, although later than originally planned. The STP
capacity was reduced from 26,000 m3/day to 12,000 m3/day due to the reduced populiation
projection forecast. The STP, with re-use system of effluent, is also expected to operate as
satisfactorily as the LSDB component.
(ii) to provide key elements of storm water drainage systems to reduce intermittent flooding.
*   The LSDB constructed the main storm water drainage network in low lying areas and the flooding
problem in the area has been significantly reduced. A storm water drainage Master Plan is under
consideration to further alleviate the flooding problems.
* There are no storm water drainage system investments included in the PSB and ANSB components
(iii) to improve environmental conditions and management of scarce water resources.
*   The LSDB project component, with the addition of the Government-financed tertiary treatment
plant and irrigation network, had a positive environmental impact. A number of studies (including
an environmental study for the location of the STP, effluent and sludge re-use, etc.) have been
carried out and have contributed to the overall environmental management capacity in the area.
The quality of bathing waters on the beach in Lamaca, which attract many tourists, has improved.
*   The PSB and the ANSB are expected to show the same achievement as LSDB once completed.
(iv) to strengthen the institutional capacity of the LSDB, PSB and ANSB.
*   The LSDB has made significant improvements in its institutional capacity since the start of the
project. It has strengthened its organizational structure in keeping with its workload expansion. At
present there are 28 people working under the chairman of LSDB, including 13 people for
operation of the STP and 24 pumping stations.
*   The PSB and the ANSB have not fully achieved the expected institutional strengthening because of
the difficulty in setting up the joint venture Board under local law. The two Boards decided to
place the STP operation in the charge of the private sector and the first five years of operation are
included in the STP construction contract. This is a good option for the PSB and the ANSB which
are facing human resource constraints due to the size of the municipalities.
*   Achievement of financial targets for all the three Boards, are considered unsatisfactory. The main
issues are related to a substantial increase in capital costs, the lower than projected sewer rates,
and the relatively low collection rate. During the implementation period, the Boards were not able
to fully achieve the target of increased self-financing (refer to paras. 4.4 and 10).
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
LSDB - The economic rate of return (ERR) for the project is 10%. This is lower than the appraisal
projection of 13.6%, due mainly to: a 23% increase in capital costs; the lower than projected sewer rates;
and the lower than estimated revenue from surcharge on water consumption and effluent sales because of
delays in the connection of private properties to the sewerage system as well as in commissioning of the
tertiary treatment plant. The assumptions on costs and benefits stream follow those used at appraisal for
consistency. As noted in the appraisal report, the ERR calculation is very conservative since it excludes
-4 -



many benefits that are difficult to quantify, e.g., property value increases, additional tourist revenues, and
the health and air quality benefits.
PSB and ANSB - The ERR was not re-estimated because the project is not yet fully implemented and data
were inadequate.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
While the financial rate of return was not calculated during project appraisal, other financial indicators
were calculated for the project (refer to annex 1). The financial performance of the Boards fell short of
targeted levels, primarily because: (i) project costs increased substantially due mainly to increase of
capacity for tertiary treatment, implementation delays and extension of engineering and supervision
contracts, expansion of the project areas to include additional refugee settlements, and imposition of VAT
in 1992 after the loan signing ; and (ii) sewer rates and bill-collection were much lower than assumed at
appraisal. The Government financed 35% of the total cost overruns, covering the share of tertiary treatment
and a re-use network that was to be fully financed by the Government. The Boards covered the remaining
increases with additional loans extended by the co-financiers (the Council of Europe Social Development
Fund and the EIB). The Bank's share of financing was reduced from 31 % to 17% of the total project cost,
with over 23% of the original loan amounts unused because the government was able to obtain loans from
EIB and the Council of Europe Social Development Fund on more favorable terms. Sewer rates were far
below appraisal estimates mainly because of considerable resistance by hoteliers, whose share of the total
projected revenue base was nearly 50%. These hoteliers had already invested in their own package
treatment plants and were reluctant to write off their recent investments. Their sewer rates were two to
three times more than those charged for the population at large. The Government also delayed on its
payments, in some cases because of technicalities (such as responsibilities for payments of sewer charges
on properties with a long-term lease agreement with refugees), but also because of disputes on whether
Government was required to pay. Billing of sewer charges started in Lamaca in 1992, while actual
construction work started in 1993. In Paralimni and Ayia Napa, billing started three to four years prior to
the start of construction. The above factors adversely impacted on the scheduled sewer rate structure and
bill collection. During the implementation period, sewer rate increases were not timely and bill collection
was consistently difficult. The Boards thus complied only partially with the self-financing target of 20% in
the loan covenant (refer to paras. 5.4 and 10).
4.5 Institutional development impact:
The institutional capacity of LSDB has significantly improved since the start of project. First, the LSDB
recruited an engineer and an accountant about five months before loan signature and new staff was
gradually recruited in accordance with the progress of project implementation. The LSDB recruited
operation and maintenance staff in 1995 after the STP and about 30% of the networks had been completed.
Most of the key staff are in place and many have benefited from training. The LSDB comprises four
departments and 28 staff: Administration (4); Accounting and Finance (5); Technical Department (6); and
Operation and Maintenance (13). The LSDB's decision to operate the STP with its own staff has been
working very well. The operation of the STP, sludge treatment facilities and pumping stations is highly
satisfactory.
The institutional development goals of the PSB and the ANSB have been slow to achieve due to the
joint-venture issue (see para. 4.2 (iv) and para. 5.3) and the two-year delay in project implementation. The
PSB consists of 9 Board members and the ANSB, 9 Board members. Members of the two Boards are
elected to serve simultaneously as the Municipal Council members. Both mayors act as the chairperson of
their respective Board. The PSB currently employs 10 people and the ANSB, 4 people and expect to
employ more people as project implementation progresses. The PSB and the ANSB decided to
- 5-



put the maintenance and operation of the STP in the charge of the private sector, which is a good decision
in view of the difficulty in establishing a legalized Joint Venture Board and in coordinating the two Boards.
The three Boards from the beginning, have developed their own accounting and budgeting systems in
accordance with International Accounting Standards and in line with the provisions of the Sewerage and
Drainage Law of 1971. All functions of the accounting departments have been fully computerized. The
billing system, general ledger, receivables, collections, fixed assets and inventories have been computerized
through a fully integrated system. Audited financial statements were submitted annually to the Bank mostly
on time and were unqualified. After initial delays in acquiring the computerized system for billing and
collections, billing and collection of sewerage charges started in Larnaca in 1992, and in 1993 for Ayia
Napa and Paralimni. Billing and collection of the water surcharge in Larnaca is being handled by the Water
Board, and a simnilar arrangement is expected also for Ayia Napa and Paralimni.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
S. l Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
There are no major factors affecting implementation and outcome that is outside the control of Govermment
or implementing agency.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
According to the Guarantee Agreement, the Government provided to the LSDB, loans of CYP 5.1 million
to enable the Board to provide the counterpart funds and service debts, but with substantial delays. The
Government also delayed its payments of sewage bills initially because of disputes on whether the
Government was required to pay and who was responsible to pay for properties leased to refugees. The
non-payment by Government agencies had an adverse influence on other rate payers. The Government was
also late in reimbursing the Boards for payments on tertiary treatment and effluent re-use scheme, creating
very difficult cash flow problems for the Boards, in particular, the LSDB. In order to avoid the cash flow
problems, the PSB and ANSB later amended the construction contracts of the tertiary treatment plant
whereby payments are made directly by the Government. The Loan and the Guarantee Agreements required
that an agreement had to be reached between the Government and the Boards regarding the operation and
maintenance of the effluent re-use scheme by December 31, 1994, or by completion of the construction of
such scheme, whichever was earlier. Discussions are now under way to finalize such agreement with the
LSDB. The reason for the delay was because of difficulties that emerged with the Limassol-Amathus
agreement on the same subject, which should have served LSDB as a basis. It is expected that the
agreement will be reached soon, as the Government is disassociating the two agreements. The above factors
therefore, partially affected the implementation of the project.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
The main reason for the two-year delay in project progress of the PSB and ANSB components was the
difficulty in making joint decisions by the two Boards. It was agreed during the negotiations that the PSB
and the ANSB would enter into a joint venture agreement and that the joint venture would be a legal entity.
Although the JV agreement was reached between the PSB and the ANSB, its legalization has been very
difficult, because the local law does not allow municipalities to form a joint venture. Therefore, when joint
venture matters need to be discussed, the JV chairman has to call the two Boards for meeting. Also, they
were not able to meet for the day-to-day matters as frequently as required, thus contributing to the two-year
project delay. The components particularly affected are the consultant contract and the STP contract,
jointly contracted by the two Boards. In order to accelerate the project implementation, the two Boards
appointed an experienced ex-Water Development Department (WDD) officer as a project manager of the
STP construction. Under this arrangement the STP construction is progressing satisfactorily and is
- 6 -



expected to be completed before the end of 2000. This factor also partially affected the implementation of
the project.
The ability to raise sewer rates was controlled by the Boards to some extent, but only within a ceiling
approved by the Council of Ministers and the House of Representatives. The Boards were responsible for
providing an adequate financial rationale when requesting either a rate increase within the pre-approved
ceiling or a request for an increase of the ceiling. In addition, the Boards took aggressive measures for
improving collection rates and cost savings. Therefore, this factor partially affected the implementation of
the project.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
In Larnaca, the final project cost was US$69.6 million rather than the appraisal estimate of US$54.6
million. In Paralimni and Ayia Napa, the estimated final cost is US$74.2 million vs. the appraisal estimate
of US$48.7 million.

The main reasons for the 39% increase in total project costs are explained in para. 10 and can be
summarized as follows:
Cost Increase (US$M)
Reasons for Cost Increase
LSDB           PSB-ANSB         Total
Increase of capacity for tertiary treatment plant                  4.4              8.1           12.5
Cost overruns due to implementation delays
and expansion of the project areas                               4.0               7.7           11.7
Imposition of VAT effective July 1992                              4.5              5.1            9.6
Extension of contract (engineering & supervision)                  2.1              4.6            6.7
Total             15.0              25.5           40.5
The increases associated with tertiary treatment and a re-use network would be fully financed by the
Government. The remaining increases would be funded from the Council of Europe Social Development
Fund and EIB, preventing likely disruptions in project implementation due to lack of local counterpart
funds. The share of the Boards' self-financing was in fact reduced to 10% of the total project cost, from the
appraisal estimates of 17%. Otherwise, the Boards would have had difficulty in meeting their debt service
obligations. Likewise, the share of the Bank loans was reduced from 31% to 17%.

6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationalefor sustainability rating:
Project sustainability is likely. Because tourism is of the highest priority in Cyprus, this project has enjoyed
strong commitment from the central and local govermnents, but to a lesser extent from local communities,
particularly the hoteliers. The institutional framework for the LSDB is well established (see para. 4.5).
However, given the high debt service obligations and the current sewer rate schedules, LSDB will continue
to face difficult cash flow problems in the next several years. In order to solve these financial problems,
LSDB has reached an agreement with the Government on specific measures to eliminate the estimated
negative cash flows, except for its request for additional Government loans (see para. O). The situation is
similar for project sustainability of the PSB and ANSB components. Unlike the LSDB, the STP is jointly
owned by the two Boards. Given the likely difficulty in coordinating the two Boards, it was decided to put
the private sector in charge of the maintenance and operation of the STP. The PSB and the ANSB would
evaluate the benefit of subcontracting the STP operation before renewing the contract. It is expected,
however, that subcontracting maintenance and operation will continue to be a good option of the PSB and
the ANSB in view of its jointly-owned nature and the human resource constraints of the two boards.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
No follow-up project is planned, because Cyprus has graduated from Bank lending. However, it is
recommended that OED look into the unique aspect of this project in the future: no sewage nor tertiary
treated effluent is allowed to discharge in the ocean. This unique aspect was built into the design of the
sewerage system because of the very strong environmental concem of the local communities about the
water pollution control of the coastal line. There is, however, a potential risk of sewage flooding due to the
malfunctioning of the pumping stations. In the Limassol-Amathus project an emergency discharge to the
ocean is allowed from major pumping stations and the STP. The three sewage Boards may need a similar
emergency outlet in the future.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
Project identification, preparation and appraisal were carried out by the Bank in accordance with the
Government's development strategy and priorities for the sector and reflected the Banks assistance strategy
for Cyprus. During the project preparation stage the Bank provided adequate and timely assistance to the
borrowers who had only a nucleus of staff. It was also very helpful and efficient that the Bank advised the
-8 -



borrowers to follow the experience of the Limassol-Amathus Sewerage and Drainage Project that was
completed in 1997 with a highly satisfactory rating The decisions taken by the borrowers, with assistance
from the Bank, have contributed greatly towards successful preparation of the project.
During project appraisal the Bank followed up the issues identified during project preparation and the
experience from the Limassol and Amathus project, particularly in designing the water re-use scheme
which was built in the project design in a satisfactory manner. However, there are two technical aspects
that require an evaluation of Bank performance at a later stage: (a) no sewage nor tertiary treated effluent
discharge is allowed in the ocean even during an emergency (see para. 6.2); and (b) the STP site is 118 m
higher than the service area for major hoteliers located in the ocean front. These technical approaches are
not conventional in sewerage engineering but could be justified if the maintenance and operation of the
facilities remain highly satisfactory. In addition, the assessment of willingness-to-pay, in particular of
hoteliers, was optimistic. As a result, the appraisal forecasts for the sewer rate structure proved to be
overly optimistic, leading to difficult cash flow problems. The establishment the JV Board of the Paralimni
and Ayia Napa components as a legal entity seems not to have been properly researched, either it should
have been one of the conditions of effectiveness for the project, or the joint venture arrangement should not
have been considered at the outset of the project design. This joint venture issue was the main reason for
the two-year project delay of the PSB and ANSB components. Therefore, the ICR rates Bank performance
in lending as marginally satisfactory.
7.2 Supervision:
Bank performance in supervision was of mixed quality and marginally satisfactory. The borrowers
appreciated the active involvement of the Bank in advising on technical and administrative problems in
efficient utilization of the funds. However, there were a few changes in Bank management and project team
members which caused delays, in particular, in assisting with procurement. The Bank was too optimistic in
the procurement area, and did not take into account the borrower's lack of experience in international
bidding procedures--particularly in selecting the consultants and the STP bidding for the PSB and ANSB.
In the Borrowers' view, the Bank's strict and demanding procedures caused high administrative costs,
without providing flexibility in procurement.
The Bank's supervision, however, helped the Boards trigger more aggressive actions on bill collection and
financial practices. In addition, with assistance from the Bank, the Boards were able to mobilize additional
loans from EEB and the Council of Europe for financing of cost overruns. The co-financiers relied on the
Bank's involvement in monitoring of the project.
The Bank's supervision inputs were substantially reduced in early 1997 as it was expected that the PSB and
ANSB components (Lns. 3399 and 3400) would have beeen canceled immediately after refinancing loans
by the EIB and the Council of Europe materialized. However, the Paralimni and Ayia Napa Boards did not
cancel the Bank loans and requested that the Bank continue to assist them throughout the bidding process
for all components. Thus, the Bank remained involved until June 1999, albeit with a much lower profile.
Project implementation had no deviation from Bank policies and procedures. There were three
reallocations: in 1995, 1996 and 1998 (see para. 3.4).
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
The Bank's overall performance on this project is rated marginally satisfactory. Considerable support was
provided in a satisfactory manner to the borrowers, in particular at the initial stages, because the borrowers
comprised only a nucleus of staff, but the Bank was too optimistic in its reliance on a joint venture
arrangement and assessment of willingness-to-pay during the project preparation. The Bank's performance
-9-



during supervision is also marginally satisfactory. Since Cyprus had graduated from the Bank lending and
the project was the last one in Cyprus, the Bank supervision coefficient became low.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The borrower prepared the project efficiently taking into account the experience of the Limassol-Amathus
project. The project executing agencies, the LSDB, the PSB and the ANSB are public utilities established
by the Council of Ministers in 1992. At the beginning of the project the three Boards only had a small
nucleus staff. The staff was fully committed from the beginming and assisted Bank missions in all aspects
of project preparation. The performance of the borrower is considered satisfactory during project
preparation.
7.5 Government implementation perforrnance:
Government performance was marginally satisfactory. The Government provided general guidance as well
as full financing for construction of tertiary treatment and effluent reuse schemes. Yet, the receivables that
accumulated due to delays in reimbursement of actual expenses incurred on the Government component
and initial non-payment of sewer rates by the Government, weakened the overall financial position of the
Boards.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
The implementing agencies are the Larnaca Sewerage and Drainage (LSDB), the Paralimnni Sewerage
Board (PSB) and the Ayia Napa Sewerage Board (ANSB) and the ICR rates the LSDB performance as
fully satisfactory and the PSB and the ANSB performance as marginally satisfactory. Although each Board
has only a small number of permanent staff, the staff were technically capable and demonstrated high
professional competence despite various technical and non-technical problems encountered during project
implementation. In order to promote the public acceptance of the project and an acceptable public image of
the Boards, considerable effort was made by the Boards to reduce the nuisance and inconvenience
associated with construction work. A mechanism was also established for immediate action in cases of
complaints from the public.
Tlhe LSDB successfully implemented the project within agreed performance parameters, with the exception
of financial performance. The financial covenants were met only partially. During the eight-year
implementation period, the Boards met only partially the requirements of a 20% self-financing ratio and a
1.2 debt service coverage ratio because of substantial cost overruns and lower than projected sewer rates
and low collection ratio due to non-payment by hoteliers and Government.
The physical implementation of the PSB and ANSB project components became satisfactory about a year
before the closing date. Project progress was delayed by two years although no major problems are
anticipated in the coming years. The main reason for the delay was that the it was not possible for the JV
Board to meet as frequently as needed (para. 5.3). The institutional development has not been achieved
because of the delay. Therefore, the ICR rates the performance of the PSB and the ANSB as marginally
satisfactory.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Overall Borrower's performance of the three project components was satisfactory: The LSDB's
performance was fully satisfactory and the PSB and ANSB's performance was marginally satisfactory.

8. Lessons Learned
8.1 As mentioned in para. 4.5, the PSB and the ANSB faced difficulties in handling promptly the issues
that needed the joint decision of the two Boards. The joint venture concept was introduced in view of the
economies of scale associated with joint construction. While the contracts under the separate responsibility
by each municipality (such as sewerage and pumping stations construction contracts) have progressed
satisfactorily, the jointly responsible contracts such as the STP and the consultant contracts experienced a
long delay. The STP location of 118 m higher than the service area for major hoteliers, which is unusual
for an STP location from an engineering viewpoint, was selected because it lies half-way between the two
municipalities and is the only available site. During project preparation, the joint venture approach should
have been subject to a more thorough review taking into account not only the economic and fnancial
implications, but also the legal, social, and political aspects and engineering issues.
8.2    The STP procurement process took more than two years after the joint venture Board had issued
the bidding documents to the pre-qualified firms. Two lessons relate to the STP turnkey bidding. First, the
tumkey approach is sometimes favored by the employer because the employer does not need to carry out
the detailed design before issuing the invitation to bid. However, the employer should consider the total
amount of time required for completing the whole bidding process before adopting a turnkey approach.
Second, a technical alternative should have been considered only for the lowest evaluated bidder of the base
bid, because evaluating all technical alternatives submitted is a very lengthy and difficult process for the
consultant and the employer. In this regard, the Bank failed to provide sound advice.
8.3    The appraisal projections for sewer rate structure and the revenues proved to be overly optimistic
as all of the three Boards fell short of attaining the envisaged financial targets which admittedly were quite
ambitious. The authority to raise the sewer rates was not entirely within the control of the Boards, as there
was a ceiling set by the Council of Ministers and the House of Representatives. The borrowers had little
control over key actions (such as rate adjustments and timely reimbursement of accrued expenses on the
Government component) required for full compliance with financial covenants.
8.4    The assessment of willingness-to-pay during appraisal was not adequate. It focused mainly on
domestic households instead of hoteliers, which accounted for 50% of the projected revenue base. By and
large, the population was willing to pay but due to the non-payment by hoteliers, the collection rate was
significantly lowered. Ironically, hoteliers would benefit the most from the project with the resulting
positive impact on tourism. Yet, there was considerable resistance among hoteliers because they had only
recently invested in their own package treatment facilities and thus, were reluctant to write off their
investments. Moreover their sewer rates were two to three times more than those charged to other users.
On these matters, the Bank could have provided more advice during project preparation.
8.5    The scope of the project should have been defined in a much more participatory manner to gain
support not only from the local authorities and central government, but more importantly, from the general
public at large. Despite the efforts made in terms of dissemination of public information, intensive public
campaigns, proactive rather than reactive in nature, would have provided better public awareness of the full
benefits of the project and an understanding of the need to increase sewer charges. The low collection rate
that they faced, particularly in the early years of the project, could have been improved.

10. Additional Information
10.1   Achievement of Financial Targets: While the major objectives of the project have been met,
achievement of financial targets is considered unsatisfactory. The main issues are related to: (i) a
substantial increase in capital costs; (ii) the lower than projected sewer rates; and (iii) the low collection of
bills. As a result, during the implementation period between 1992 and 2000, the Boards were not able to
fully achieve the self-financing targets.
The project was approved on August 30, 1991 and signed on November 7, 1991 with a repayment period
of 15 years, including a 5-year grace period. Loan effectiveness was delayed due to delays in the approval
of sewer rates and the progress in setting up billing and collection system and procedures. The loans
became effective on May 1, 1992 (3398-CY) and on July 28, 1992 (3399-CY, 3400-CY). Actual
construction work started in early 1993 in Lamaca, but only in 1996 in Paralimni and 1997 in Ayia Napa,
due mainly to procurement-related issues. Principal repayment for the Bank loans had already begun in
May 1997, two years prior to loan closing and three years prior to the estimated project completion. The
Paralimni and Ayia Napa Boards thus requested in 1996 to extend the grace period on the Bank loans from
May 1997 to May 2001. However, since the the drawdown on the loans was more than the first installment
on the principal repayment, according to the Bank policy, the two Boards were not eligible for extension of
the grace period. This contributed to the financing problems.
Subsequently, all of the three Boards mobilized additional financing from the cofinanciers and the
Government to mitigate their finance burden of providing counterpart funds for the project and service
debts. Similarly, the acceleration of drawdown on loans and principal repayments on the Bank loans
beginning in 1997 contributed to a consistent drop in the debt service coverage ratio below the covenanted
ratio of 1.2. The Bank's ICR mission in July 1999 agreed with the three Boards that specific steps would
be taken to achieve the financial sustainability of the Boards. The LSDB obtained the Government
approval on its proposals to resolve expected cash flow problems through combinations of (i) sewer rate
increases; (ii) the collection of drainage charges of CYP 0.50 per CYP 1,000 of property value begining in
2000; and (iii) a loan from the Council of Europe Social Development Fund. These measures would still
leave a financing gap. The LSDB's request for Government loans of CYP 0.9 million per annum for
financing debt service obligations for the next five years, was rejected. The Government proposed instead
that LSDB obtain such financing from local banks with a Government guarantee, but according to LSDB,
the prospects of such financing to refinance other foreign loans are slim. During the project implementation
period, LSDB has already obtained Government loans of CYP 5. lmillion, or CYP 0.6 million more than
agreed initially, to enable LSDB to meet its obligations under the Loan Agreement. The other two Boards
did not utilize the Government funds which were also available to them under the Guarantee Agreements.

10.2    Cost Overruns. The project cost was escalated to US$144 million, or 39% above the appraisal
estimate of US$103 million. The overruns were due to: (i) the longer than expected project design
completion, and the delays encountered in the tendering, evaluation and contract award procedures resulting
in delays for project completion of about 2-3 years, which, in turn, resulted in substantial unit price
increase; (ii) increase of capacity for tertiary treatment plant and the effluent re-use scheme, increase in the
number and the size of pumping stations, and the expansion of sewer areas including additional refugee
settlements; and (iii) imposition of VAT (8%) which became effective in July 1992 after loan signing, thus
not included in the original estimate.

In Lamaca, the Government financed 35% of the total cost overruns of US$15 million. It covered the entire
cost increase of the effluent re-use scheme which includes a tertiary treatment plant and irrigation network.
The effluent re-use scheme is fully funded by the Govenmment and will remain the property of the
Govemment, but will be operated and maintained by the Board. The remainder was covered partly by the
increase in the loan from the Council of Europe (51 %) and a self-financing of the Sewerage Board (14%).
The Bank's share of civil works financing was increased from 24% to 40% in 1996 to support the Board in
maintaining the pace of project implementation to complete the project on time. Nearly all of the loan
proceeds (US$14 million) was disbursed prior to the closing date and the remaining balance of
US$11,949.82 was canceled on the closing date of June 30, 1999.
In Ayia Napa and Paralimni, the financing plan changed significantly. The cost increase of the effluent
reuse scheme was fully covered by the Government, as in LSDB. To meet the increase in other capital
costs, the two Boards obtained an EIB loan of US$18 million and additional funds from the Council of
Europe in May 1997. For the EIB loan, the repayment period is 15 years, including 5 years of grace, with
2.65% interest, net of 3% interest subsidy. The funds from the Council of Europe were almost doubled
from US$14 million to US$26 million. For this loan, each disbursement would have a 5-year grace and
amortize thereafter for 5 years with a fixed interest rate applicable at the time of each disbursement. Due
to refinancing on more favorable tenrs, the Bank's two loans (Lns. 3399 and 3400) were expected to be
canceled, with the understanding that the Bank would continue to assist the Boards throughout the bidding
process for all components. However, the Boards decided to wait until the procurement process for STP
was complete and the revised financing needs become clear before proceeding with cancellation. Due to a
two-year delay in the procurement process, the STP contract was signed in October 1998, only eight
months prior to the closing date of June 30, 1999. The Boards then opted not to cancel the loans, but
indicated their interest in the extension of the closing date so that the Bank loans could be fully utilized. The
- 13-



Bank advised the Boards to officially request the extension of the closing date, but indicated that a
favorable decision required appropriate justification as the existing loans from EIB and the Council of
Europe were estimated to suffice their needs. The official request for extension of the closing date was not
received. Of the total loan amounts of US$17.3 million, total disbursements were US$9.8 mnillion. The
remaining US$7.5 million was cancelled in November-December 1999.
10.3   Sewer Rates. The sewer rates during the implementation period were far below the appraisal
estimates, with revenues totaling only about 50% of the projected sum. The rate structure was initially
approved by the Government as part of the effectiveness conditions. However, there was lack of acceptance
of the project by the public, in particular by hoteliers. There was considerable resistance among the
hoteliers during the initial stages of the project implementation, especially those who had already invested
in their own biological treatment plants. Sewerage fees were perceived by them as a new form of taxation.
Moreover, the sewer rates for hotels were two to three times those charged for the population at large. Thus
it has been consistently difficult for the Boards to collect sewerage fees from hoteliers in a timely maimer.
Long delays in the project implementation caused many rate payers to question why they needed to pay
rates when the project implementation had not yet begun. For this reason, the three Boards felt it would be
more prudent to raise sewer rates only after the start of project implementation. As a result, the sewer rates
averaged only about 50% (Larnaca) to 65% (Paralimni and Ayia Napa) of the appraisal estimates. Initially
the increase in sewer rates required approvals of the Council of Ministers and the House of Representatives
each time. The by-laws for the Boards were later amended during 1993 (Paralinini and Ayia Napa) and
1994 (Larnaca), allowing the Boards to set sewer rates within a ceiling approved by the Council of
Ministers and the House of Representatives without each time having to obtain their approval.
10.4   Bill Collection. The delays in payment by two major groups of users resulted in difficult cash flow
problems. In addition to hoteliers, LSDB had difficulties initially in collecting dues also from Govenrment
institutions since it was contested whether the Government could be made liable to pay sewerage rates. It
was argued that since sewer rates are based on property values, they were eqivalent to taxes. Finally in
1995, the Sewerage Law of 1971 that govems the Sewerage Boards in Cyprus, was amended to explicitly
state that the Government is required to pay sewerage dues. The Government also delayed its payments of
sewer charges on properties with a long-term lease agreement with refugees. The Boards have also taken a
number of measures to improve the collection rate as follows: (i) designate a specific payment date on a
permanent basis, rather than changing the due date every year; (ii) not pennit extension of the payment due
date; (iii) impose penalties as well as interest charges for late payments; (iv) initiate court suits for
non-paying consumers; and (v) use public relations measures to create greater public acceptability. As a
result, the collection rate has improved substantially. The initial collection rate was 70% in Lamaca and
50% in Paralimni and Ayia Napa in the first year of billing. As of end-September 1999, the weighted
average collection ratio for the 1993-98 bills was 93% in Larnaca, 85% in Paralimni, and 87% in Ayia
Napa. Lamaca shows much higher rate relative to the other two Boards, because its 1998 bills were due in
November 1998, while in Paralimni and Ayia Napa, the due date was September 1999. The lowest
collection is still from hotels and hotel apartments in all of the three Boards. Hotels and hotel apartments
account for the largest share of the revenues with almost 50%. The bill collection is expected to improve
after project completion.

Notes:
(i)    The sewerage surcharge on water consumption ("water surcharge") is applicable when customers
are first connected to the new system. The treated effluent ("charge for irrigation water") is a fee
for the water sold for irrigation of parks and hotel grounds, The appraisal estimates for these rates
were mere projections and detailed methods for charging for the water surcharge and the irrigation
water were expected to be developed during project execution. In Lamaca, collection of the water
surcharge started in 1995 as projected but actual rates were about 40-50% below the estimated
rates. In Paralimni and Ayia Napa, collection of the water surcharge is expected to start at
end-2000. An agreement is expected to be reached with the Government on effluent reuse scheme
prior to commissioning of the tertiary treatment plant and the effluent re-use scheme.
(ii)   In Larnaca, operating ratio deteriorated toward the end of implemenaion because of rapidly
increasing depreciation costs as construction work was nearing completion. In Paralimni and Ayia
Napa, operating costs were below the appraisal estimates because of very small depreciation and
O&M costs resulting from implementation delays.
(iii)   The targeted self-financing and the debt service coverage ratios were met only in part.
(iv)   Accounts receivable averaged about 8 months of billings in Paralimni and Ayia Napa as
compared to 2 months in Larnaca. This is because of different billing arrangements adopted by the
Boards. Paralimni and Ayia Napa issues the current year bills in November, but the payment is due
in September of the following year. In Larnaca, bills are issued in July and the payment is due in
November of the same year.

|ERR 10%/D
Notes:
1. A discount rate of 9% is used as an estimate for the opportunity cost of capital.
2. Financial rate of return was not calculated at appraisal or for the ICR.
3. The re-estimated ERR of 10% is lower than the appraisal estimate of 13.6% due mainly to a 23%
increase in investment costs; the lower than projected sewer rates; and delays in the connection of
private properties to the sewerage system as well as in commissioning of the tertiary treatment
plant.
4. Revenues attributable to the project are used as a proxy for consumers' willingness to pay in
quantifying the benefits for the estimated rates of retum. The revenue streams are based on
project sewer rates and sewerage surcharge on water consumption, and the costs are based on
capital investment program and operation and maintenance expenses.

APPENDIX
Larnaca Sewerage Board Comments
INTRODUCTION
This report is Lamaca Sewerage and Drainage Board's (LSDB) contribution to the preparation of the
Implementation Completion Report (ICR) in accordance with the Bank's procedures.
THE PROJECT
The Larnaca Project area extends over approximately 7,000 hectares, encompassing part of the Lamaca
Municipality, five refugee settlements (or "villages"), a coastal strip extending north of the town with
most of the hotel development in the area, and south to include the Larnaca International Airport and the
Salt Lake. This area extends for about 20 kilometres along the bay, with a maximum width of about 10
kilometres (Map IBRD 22890). The Municipal Corporation of Larnaca has jurisdiction within the town
limits; the remainder of the project area, including the northern coastal strip, is administered by the
Larnaca District.
Larnaca area sewerage and drainage scheme provides sewerage for the coastal part of the Lamaca area
and for the refugee settlements on the northern edge of the town, a sewage treatment plant, and facilities
for treating, storing, and distributing the effluent for irrigation purposes. It also upgrades the storm
drainage system in parts of the area most susceptible to flooding. These project components constitute a
first phase, i.e., the higher priority works, constructed during the 1992-1999 period, and include the
following major components:
(a)  a sewerage system with 12 sub-systems having about 60 km of laterals and main sewers, including
service connections within the public right-of-way, and associated appurtenances;
(b) an interceptor sewer with sewage lift stations at intervals, located in the north coastal area and
central Larnaca, extending to about 16 km in length;
(c) 17 pumping stations and associated pumping mains;
(d) a sewage treatment plant sized for an average sewage flow of 8,500 m3/day, with a peak flow of
25.920 m3/day;
(e) a storm drainage system consisting of: (i) about 4 km of flood control canal and secondary
collector drains at the northern end of Lamaca; (ii) about 1 km of interceptor drains to drain
low-lying areas at the southern end of Larnaca; and, (iii) about 2 km of drains for central Larnaca
flood control; and seven pumping stations;
(f) operation and maintenance equipment for the sewerage and drainage systems;
(g) consultant services for project implementation, including institutional development of LSDB; and
(h) 2 storage reservoirs and distribution system for treated effluent.
The sewer system comprises laterals, main sewers and collector sized to meet sewage flows through the
year 2010. The area's topography, i.e., a low-lying coastal strip, dictates that the laterals discharge into a
series of main sewers, parallel to each other, running west to east towards the sea, with the collector
traversing the area from north to south close to the shoreline (Map IBRD 22890). Pumping will be
required along the whole length.
Sewage Treatment: The STP design, based on 2010 water use projections, consists of two oxidation
ditches and two final sedimentation tanks. As the sewage is expected sometimes to be septic, no primary
sedimentation tanks are provided, and sewage is mixed with returned activated sludge prior to its
distribution to the inlet works and delivery into the highly oxygenated liquor in the oxidation tanks in
- 1-



order to minimize odour nuisance. Effluent is further treated by rapid gravity filters before passing to a
storage reservoir. From there, it would be chlorinated and pumped into the distribution system. Surplus
sludge is thickened, digested aerobically, and dried on sludge drying beds.
Distribution System for Treated Effluent (not yet in operation): From the pumping station at the STP,
effluent would be pumped through a main along the public highway along the coast parallel to the trunk
sewer. Branch lines were laid to the public parks and tourist areas, where the treated effluent would be
used for irrigation purposes.
Drainage: The drainage works included in the project cover only those priority areas recommended in
the Larnaca Drainage Master Plan dated 1982. The proposed drainage systems have been based on an
evaluation of alternatives, such as reducing the systems by reforestation, and flood control dams within
the watersheds (which are long-term solutions), and various channel routings and sizes of structures, etc.
Design is based on a storm return period of 2 years. A major part of the improvement works lies in
increasing the carrying capacity of the Kalo Khorio river channel.
PROJECT HISTORY
The Municipal Corporation of Larnaca, with the assistance of consultants, developed a master plan and
carried out a feasibility study for storm water drainage and sanitary sewerage systems for Larnaca and the
surrounding areas in 1982. The terms of reference for the study were in accordance with the
Government's 1978 policy decision to provide for the reuse of all treated sewage effluent, and
consideration of sea outfall was excluded from the study. A Bank mission reviewed the feasibility study
and master plan in June 1984, and agreed that a supplementary study, taking into account some of the
options previously excluded, was needed to expand and update the original study. The findings of the
supplementary study, and of a Government Committee review of the preliminary environmental and
agricultural studies, were that the least cost solution included a treatment plant on a site south of Larnaca
airport, with a sea outfall. This site was recommended because of (i) its distance from bathing beaches
and inhabited areas, and (ii) its proximity to agricultural and grazing lands that would allow a future
pilot scheme for land disposal of the effluent. A Bank mission of February 1985 concurred with these
findings, and a project for Larnaca was appraised in July 1985.
Approval of the sewer rates by the Sewerage Board was one of the conditions for negotiations, to be held
in late 1985. Approval was not obtained, however, because the rates were perceived to be too high by
Larnaca's Chamber of Commerce; the hoteliers were also not supportive, having already invested in
individual treatment plants. The project remained inactive for several years. In early 1989, the
Government requested that the Bank again consider financing sewerage and drainage schemes in high
priority coastal towns. Progress in the preparation of a project for Larnaca and other coastal towns was
followed during the processing of the Limassol-Amathus project. By October 1989, after efforts by the
Larnaca authorities in explaining the environmental and financial consequences of further delay, it was
felt that the residents of Lamaca were now fully aware of the need to finance the scheme as soon as
possible, resolving the previous difficulties regarding the financing scheme. The Sewerage Board hired
consultants in August 1990 to update the necessary studies. The updated studies outlined a feasible
re-use scheme for the treated effluent, and concluded that a sea outfall would not be necessary.
Implementation of the project began in early 1993 and by late 1995 the STP was put in operation
servicing about 30% of the project area with an average flow of 1,300 m3/day.
Completion of all works of the project which will gradually service approximately 60% of the whole
population of Larnaca is expected by April 2000.

ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
Project Objectives, as stated in the Staff Appraisal Report of August 2, 1990, are listed below and a brief
assessment of the relative results and degree of achievement follows:
(i) To provide safe, reliable systems for the disposal of human and commercial waste water and
thereby eliminate the nuisance and health risks, including the threat to the area's important tourist
industry, that arise from the present unsatisfactory disposal arrangements.
The project is currently servicing about 6,000 residents and numerous hotels in the area and it is
expected that soon after the completion of the whole sewerage system in the project area,
anticipated in December 1999, the number will gradually increase to 40,000 and reach full capacity
in the year 2010. All hotels and hotel apartments in the tourist areas will be serviced by the
sewerage system.
(ii) To provide key elements of storm water drainage systems to reduce intermitted flooding. The main
storm water drainage network has been constructed in flood susceptible areas (low-lying areas) and
flood problems will be eliminated to a large degree.
LSDB is currently contemplating the preparation of a Storm Drainage Master Plan for the whole of
Larnaca to further alleviate flood problems.
(iii) To improve environmental conditions and management of scarce water resources.
The Project incorporates a Government-financed tertiary treatment plant and irrigation network to
fully exploit the treated effluent for irrigation of green areas, parks, hotel grounds, a golf course,
etc. When fully fledged, the project will cause dismantling of more then 50% of septic pits in the
area of Larnaca, thus, reducing underground water pollution. Also, prior to the project, the
individual septic sewage was being disposed at the Kellia disposal area. The reduction of the septic
sewage prompted the Government to discontinue the use of that disposal site eliminating
environmental problems in the area.
(iv) To strengthen the institutional capacity of the Sewerage Board, which at present have only a
nucleus of staff.
LSDB recruited key personnel, an engineer and an accountant, in June 1991, before the loan with
IBRD was signed in November 1991. They undertook all necessary, critical tasks, to ensure proper
functioning of the Board's capacity in accounting and finance and facilitate the development of an
accounting department and a system for billing and collection of revenue. At the same time, all
accounting functions as well as billing and collection had been fully computerized. During the
period of project implementation, new technical staff had been recruited. In 1995, the first part of
the project, including the STP and approximately 30% of the networks had been completed, and put
in operation. At the same time, operation and maintenance staff had been added who underwent an
extensive hands-on, training by experts in the field.
Presently, the Board is comprised of 4 departments as follows:
Administration                              4 persons
Accounting and Finance                      5
Technical Department                        6
Operation and Maintenance                   13 persons
28 persons

EVALUATION OF BORROWER'S OWN PERFORMANCE
Up to 1991 LSDB did not have any permanent staff employed. Administrative and other services had
been obtained from the Larnaca Municipality. The project design and construction supervision had been
contracted out to an international consulting firm, associated with local firm of consultants.
During the implementation period (1991-1999) various problems were encountered, which have
generally been overcome successfully:
(a) Delay in awarding the Consultancy Services Contract for Supervision by two months which had the
effect of shifting the starting date of the project as well as the implementation of the project for the
said period.
(b) Delay in awarding Contract No. 3 by nine months due to the fact that our consultants overmeasured
the laterals in certain catchment areas and undermeasured the laterals in other catchment areas to
the extent that using the unit rates of the various contractors, the lowest evaluated bidder (as per the
original lengths) no longer had the lowest bid. As a result of the aforesaid, re-tender procedure was
adopted and in order to minimize the effects on the Project completion date, we reduced the
construction period quoted in the tender documents by six months.
(c) Delay in awarding Contract No. 4 by eight months due to the fact that the Consulting Engineers
included in the tender documents a clause unacceptable to the World Bank. Consequently, we
adopted re-tender procedures and in order to meet the project completion date, we reduced the
construction period quoted in the tender documents by six months.
(d) Dust, noise and odours
The control of dust, noise and odours was the prime responsibility of the Site Engineer with
expertise provided by the Public Health Officers of the Municipality.
In order to avoid/reduce dust problem we had to water the construction site utilising water tank
trucks on a regular basis and for noise control we had to use electric generators for the dewatering
system and construction machinery which they do not produce noise more than 50 dBs.
As a result of the above actions, we did not receive any complaints for odours during construction
due to the fact that underground water is seawater. Furthermore, we had to flush with clean water
the main sewers during initial connection with the house connections and also until now we are
doing a periodical flushing to avoid odour problems to the sewers in operation.
(e) Groundwater
In many parts of Larnaca we had to deal with unexpected very high water table. Trenching in these
areas to lay sewers and stormwater drains required accumulated water to be dewatered from
excavations or run under gravity. The potential for faecal contamination of the underground water
in these areas was very low and to an acceptable standard.
(f) Archaeological Features (Antiquities)
We discovered some archaeological features during construction of the sewerage network but we
handled them by liaising with the Director of Antiquities prior to carry-out of any excavation to the
potential areas of antiquities and in such a way as to keep the disruption to the constructional work
to the minimum.
(g) Traffic
In liaison with Larnaca Police Department, Municipal Officers, Shopkeepers and Public
Representatives, we selected possible alternative traffic routes in order to solve traffic problems
which were arising during construction and we published, a week in advance, notices in the
newspapers.
-4-



(h) Effects on the underground services
The Contractor was responsible to liaise with the Public Utility Services to locate in plan and
elevation of the mains and services and to provide this information to the Engineer's Representative
within a period of four weeks and then they had to agree on the possible routing of the proposed
sewerage network.
We were following the above procedure by having in hand all the available utilities site plans and
consequently, we had to meet on site with the utilities officers in order to set the exact location of
their services. As a result of the above, we had to do very few permanent diversions of the existing
services and the aforesaid procedure has minimized the claims of the Contractor for extension of
time.
(i)  Land acquisition and way leaves
We did not face any problem with land acquisition and way leaves except from pumping station "C"
due to legal implications. We eventually proceeded with the construction of the pumping station
pending the decision of the Supreme Court of Cyprus on the Acquisition Order. The pumping
station "C" acquisition problem had caused delays to Contract No. 3 which are concurrent with the
delays caused due to the design of General Timayia Avenue by Municipality.
(j) Effects of the new design of General Timayia Avenue by Municipality
During the execution of Contract No. 3, the Municipality of Larnaca sent to us new design drawings
for the General Timayia Avenue with the restriction to keep our sewerage network outside of the
new boundaries of the proposed Avenue. As a result of this restriction, we had to redesign our
sewerage network with deeper sewers and to acquire strips of private land which has caused further
delays to the said Contract.
(k) New parcellations of Land
Implications to Contract No. 4 due to the new parcellations of land within the project area. These
have been included on time in the Contract drawings prior to tendering procedure.
(1)  Commissioning problems of the Sewerage System
During the first stages of commissioning of the system a series of many activities and functions had
to be performed which needed a great deal of planning and coordination between many authorities.
The initial low flow of effluent caused minor problems of odour and nuisance. Commissioning of
the tertiary treatment plant is pending as a result of insufficient flow to the Sewage Treatment Plant.
It is estimated that by December 31, 1999, the latest, commissioning of the tertiary treatment plant
will take place.
EVALUATION OF FINANCING ORGANIZATIONS
(a) IBRD (The Bank)
From the experience obtained during the implementation of the project, cooperation and assistance of the
financing bodies, especially IBRD, was invaluable. The close and practical involvement of the Bank's
staff and specialists, from the very beginning of the project, and during the design and the project
appraisal stage has helped LSDB to overcome successfully the many problems encountered. The
decisions which have taken place by LSDB and the Bank, during the initial stages of implementation,
with respect to many practical and technical problems, have contributed tremendously to the success of
the project. At the initial stages the Borrower comprised a nucleus of staff and the experience and
guidance given by the Bank's staff was critical to the success of the project.
Certainly the active involvement of the Bank in advising and solving practical, technical and
administrative problems, secured the efficient utilization of the funds borrowed. The Bank's demanding
and strict procedures have been used as a guideline and as a compliance standard which LSDB staff had
to follow, thus transmitting to the Borrower the required attitude, motivation and management behaviour
and style which contributed to the success of the project.
- 5-



However, it should be noted that strict and demanding procedures and Bank regulations caused high
administrative costs on both the Bank and the Borrower and in some cases, not allowing the required
flexibility. It is understandable though that the application of strict regulations and procedures ensures
the proper utilisation of the Bank Funds and the proper implementation of a project which is to the best
interests of the Borrower.
In view of the above, it might be worthwhile that the Bank considers the introduction of a system of
"credit rating" or "incentive scheme" in order to impose under certain circumstances more lenient
regulations, less documentation etc.
In order to avoid problems of discretionary or unfair treatment, the scheme could operate on a similar
basis as the "Waiver of Interest" scheme which is granted only to the "punctual" borrowers. At the initial
stages of a project implementation, the general framework of procedures and regulations should be
applied to all borrowers strictly and indiscriminately. As the project progresses, however, a system of
points or marking could be applied whereby each borrower should be awarded certain marks according to
his track record, adherence to the rules, progress of works, performance with respect to timetables etc.
Certain objective criteria and procedures should also be established in awarding the points. As the
project implementation time passes, certain relaxations should be allowed to borrowers according to their
record or points of performance described above.
(b) Council of Europe Social Development Fund (CESDF)
During the implementation period the CESDF was not actively involved in the progress and close
monitoring of the works. A brief progress report is submitted to the CESDF at regular intervals by the
Ministry of Finance.
FINANCIAL OBJECTIVES
Accounting and Auditing
LSDB has developed its own accounting and budgeting system, on the basis of acceptable accounting
principles in accordance with the International Accounting Standards and in line with the provisions of
the Sewerage and Drainage Law of 1971.
All functions of the Accounting Department have been fully computerised. The Billing System, General
Ledger, Receivables, Collections, Fixed Assets, Inventories etc have been computerised through a fully
integrated system.
Financial Statements consisting of Balance Sheet, Income and Expenditure Account, Cash Flow
Statement etc are prepared annually. Annual audits of the Financial Statements and the Special Account
are systematically carried out by the Auditor General of the Republic of Cyprus.
Although actual construction started in 1993, billing and collection of Sewerage Charges had started in
1992, in accordance with the procedures and details agreed with the Bank. Billing and collection of
Service Charges on water consumption had also started in 1995 as agreed with the Bank. LSDB has
entered into an agreement with the Water Board of Lamaca for the billing and collection of this charge
from all beneficiaries connected to the system.
Rate Structure and Revenues
The agreed rate structure has been applied and implemented as from 1992.
The main sources of Revenues of LSDB are as follows:-
(i) Sewer rates on assessed values of all properties within the boundaries of LSDB.
(ii) Sewerage surcharge on water consumption (Service Charge).
-6 -



(iii) Extra house connections requested from the public
(iv) Connection fees
(v) Interest received
(vi) Other income
On the basis of a study, a differential or discriminatory rate structure has been imposed with higher rates
imposed on Hotels, Industries, the Airport, Petroleum Installations, the Port, the Marina etc and lower
rates on other properties situated in the project area. The lowest rates have been imposed on properties
situated in Phase B or General Benefit Area.
Ayia Napa Sewerage Board Comments
INTRODUCTION
This Report is prepared for purposes of the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) in accordance with
the World Bank procedures.
THE PROJECT
Project Area
Ayia Napa is situated on the southeastern coast of Cyprus a few kilometers south of the city of
Famagusta which has been inaccessible since 1974. The project area covers both the residential and the
coastal tourist areas of Ayia Napa Municipality.
Project History
The original Master Plan for the Sewerage Project of Ayia Napa was completed in 1983. Additional
studies were carried out on the disposal of the effluent. Having considered the sea discharge possibility
the Board decided to opt for the more environmentally beneficial method of irrigation. Project
implementation did not take place for a number of years due to the following reasons:
(a)    Procedures needed for the securing of the necessary project funding;
(b)    Examination of the various alternatives regarding the disposal of the effluent;
(c)    Examination of the various possible locations for the central treatment plant;
(d)    Deliberations with Paralimni Sewerage Board for the establishment of a common
treatment plant.
The Master Plan and Feasibility Study were updated in 1989. An environment assessment was carried out
in 1991. In the summer of 1993 Ayia Napa Sewerage Board, in conjunction with Paralimni Sewerage
Board, signed a consultancy agreement with Soil and Water Ltd. for the detailed design, supervision and
maintenance of works. The project is comprised of a gravity sewer network, sewer force mains, treated
effluent distribution for irrigation, pumping stations and the common treatment plant.
Ayia Napa Sewerage Board secured finance for the project from the World Bank (Loan CY 3400 US$
6,000,000 dated 7111/91) and from the Council of Europe Development Fund (CERF) acting as
co-financier with a loan of CYP 4,711,400 (Loan F/P 1037 as amended in 1997). The balance of the
project cost would be met by the Board and by the Government of Cyprus which is covering the cost of
the tertiary treatment, the reservoirs and the effluent redistribution system.
-7 -



Project implementation was delayed because of a number of reasons, the most notable being the longer
than expected design period and the delays encountered in the tendering, evaluation and contract award
procedures. Whereas, the initial operation year was anticipated to be 1994, actual construction work took
place for the first time in early 1997 with the commencement of the networks contract I-AN- 1. Contract
I-AN-2 was awarded in November of 1997. The pumping stations contract was awarded in March of
1999 and the common treatment plant contract was awarded in October 1998.
Revised cost estimates carried out in 1995 indicated that the final cost of the project would be higher
than expected. The implementation delays had also eroded many years away from the World Bank loan
validity period and faced with the fact that the World Bank loan would expire in the summer of 1999, the
Board, having sought and obtained the clearance from all concerned, applied to the European Investment
Bank (EIB) for a subsidized interest environmental loan. Following detailed project review and the
preparation and submission of a new feasibility study, the BIB, in September of 1996, approved a loan to
Ayia Napa Sewerage Board of EURO (ECU) 5,730,000.
Progress of Works

New networks are also being scheduled in order to cater to new developments in the area.
Description
Tlhe sewerage project covers the area within the water supply boundary line, being the residential and the
tourist area of Ayia Napa. Total population served will be 27,300 including residents, tourists, daily
visitors and the labour force in the tourist industry. The number of tourist beds used for design purposes
is 36,000. The estimated total sewerage flow will be about 5,500 m3/d during the peak season and the
used design year for the proposed system is the year 2010. The sewer network consists of gravity and
pressure sewers and pumping stations. The total length of the lateral and main collectors is about 45 km
and the number of pumping stations is 10, plus a booster station.
The system includes a common treatment plant for Ayia Napa and Paralimni Sewerage Boards, situated
near Ayios Loannis forest. The treatment process includes biological treatment (extended aeration) and
tertiary treatment (sand filters) . Effluent will be disinfected and conveyed for irrigation to the hotel
areas, forests, playgrounds, and other designated green areas. It is proposed that during winter, the
effluent will be used. for the irrigation of forest areas near the treatment plant and the excess water be
stored in reservoirs close to the plant to be used for irrigation during summer.
The sludge treatment includes thickening, dewatering and composting. The composted sludge will be
used as soil improvement material.

Project Benefits
The benefits attributable to the implementation of the sewerage system can be summarized as follows:
1.  Increases in property values due to the improved sewerage system.
2.   Reduced risks to human health due to wastewater related diseases.
3.  Improvement in the air quality form the elimination of methane gas (one of the major contributors
to the "greenhouse" effect) and from the elimination of odors from overflowing septic tanks and
from the regular emptying process.
4.   Avoidance of sea pollution through leakage or illegal disposal of effluent direct into the sea and the
infiltration of ground polluted water towards the sea.
5.   Protection of the tourist industry in the area, a major source of foreign exchange earnings and
employment.
6.   Saving in the volume of clean water supplied to the community since the treated effluent will be
used for the irrigation of parks, green and forest areas, playgrounds etc.
7.   The project will have a major positive environmental impact in removing polluting wastes from the
urban area and treating and disposing of them with minimum environmental degradation. The
treatment plant is located in an area remote from any tourist or residential development.
8.   Treatment efficiency is normally better in a larger well operated plant than in individual small
plants.
9.   The treatment cost is lower in bigger plants.
10.  The number of disposal sites can be centrally organized.
Common Treatment Plant
The Treatment Plant is jointly owned by the Sewerage Board of Ayia Napa and the Sewerage Board of
Paralimni. A Joint Venture consisting of the two Boards has been set up in order to construct and operate
the Treatment Plant which will service both areas. The sewage component of the Treatment Plant cost
will be financed by the two Boards as follows:
Paralimni Sewerage Board    58%
Ayia Napa Sewerage Board   42%
The tertiary component and the reservoirs will be financed exclusively by the Government.
Proposed sewage production
The following are the three main components contributing to the quantity and quality of wastewater in a
sewer system:
I. Domestic wastewater
2. Industrial wastewater
3. Intrusion of stormwater/groundwater into the sewer system
There is no major water consuming industry in the project area, and according to the available
development plans the situation will remain the same in the future. Small-scale industries, like laundries
and handicrafts will develop along with the growth of population and tourism. Component 3 may be
omitted in this case as the sewers will be installed above the groundwater level and any stormwater
leakage is expected to occur during the low tourist season when water consumption is low.
Total sewage production
Total population served in the project area will be 27,300 incorporating residents, labour force in the
tourist industry, tourists and daily visitors. The number of tourist beds in hotels apartments used for
design purposes is 36,000. The estimated total wastewater flow is about 5,500 m3/d during the peak
season (August).
-9-



The dimensioning of the wastewater treatment plant is based on the maximum daily flow of the peak
season (year 2010) and the dimensioning of the sewerage network on the estimated peak flow.
Water consumption in Ayia Napa
At present, Ayia Napa is supplied with water through the Famagusta water supply pipeline of the recently
constructed desalination plant. Water is also conveyed to the Famagusta area from the Khirokitia water
treatment plant located between Larnaca and Limassol. Several reservoirs in the project area with total
capacity of about 2.000 m3 are used for storing the water from the Famagusta pipeline. Larger reservoirs
(at least one day's supply) have been considered for future development. The local distribution networks
of the Water Board of Ayia Napa service the residential areas, and the coastal tourist areas of Ayia Napa.
POPULATION
The permanent population of Ayia Napa is about 2,000 residents. The highest population densities are
within the town centre of Ayia Napa. Tourism is the main industry in the area. There are no other
significant industries. The system has been designed in such a manner as to allow for future expansion.
The number of hotel beds in the tourist area of Ayia Napa is currently 15,848 (source: Cyprus Tourist
Organisation 1999). This number will increase to 20,000 tourist beds by the year 2010 through the
construction of new hotels and apartments. In addition to the overnight tourists there are also daily
visitors in the project area, the number of these is currently estimated to be about 5,000. This is estimated
to remain the same until the year 2010.
Projected population development
Ayia Napa has experienced a very rapid growth in tourism during the last few years. This growth is
expected to continue in future years, although it is expected that the growth rate will slow down due to
several restrictive factors, such as the scarcity of fresh water and labour. Despite of this and in order to
allow for future expansion, the dimensioning of the sewerage system has been based on scenarios with
quite large growths in tourism. The number of residents in Ayia Napa is estimated to grow by 2.2%
annually up to the end use design year of 2010.
IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAM
The overall project is divided into the following 3 contracts:
Contract I: This is comprised of the complete implementation of sewerage and irrigation networks
including the supply of all materials in accordance with the conditions of the contract for works of civil
engineering construction, FIDIC.
Work on Contract I, which is subdivided into two subcontract areas, began in early 1997 and it is
expected to be completed by February 2000.
Contract II: This is comprised of the implementation and material supply contract for electromechanical
and civil works for.pumping stations in accordance with the conditions of contract for electrical and
mechanical works including erection on site, FIDIC.
Work on Contract II, began in April 1999 and is expected to be completed by November 2000.
Contract III: This is comprised of the implementation of the sewerage treatment plant and effluent
reservoir, being a turnkey contract in accordance with the model form for turnkey contracts published by
the World Bank.
- 10 -



Work on Contract III, which began in January of 1999 and is expected to be completed by November
2000, thus enabling the whole project to operate therefrom. The procurement procedures for all contracts
have followed the guidelines of the World Bank. Prequalification tenders were announced and
applications from different firms, both local and international were received.
FINANCIAL OBJECTIVES
Accounting and Auditing
Ayia Napa Sewerage Board has developed its own accounting and budgeting system, on the basis of
acceptable accounting principles in accordance with the International Accounting Standards and in line
with the provisions of the Sewerage and Drainage Law of 1971. Most functions of the accounting
department have been fully computerised. The billing system, general ledger, receivables collections,
budgeting etc, have been computerised through a fully integrated system.
Financial Statements consisting of balance sheet, income and expenditure account and a cash flow
statement are prepared annually and are audited by the Auditor General of the Republic of Cyprus.
Although actual construction started in early 1997, billing and collection of sewerage charges was
effected as from 1992 in accordance with the procedures and details agreed with the World Bank.
EVALUATION OF BORROWER'S OWN PERFORMANCE
Up to the middle of 1992 the Board did not have any permanent staff employed. Administrative and other
services were obtained through services from other organisations such. as the Ayia Napa Municipality
and the services of the secretary/accountant of the now displaced Sewerage Board of Famagusta. The
project design and construction supervision was contracted out to an international consulting firm which
is associated with local firms of consultants. Prequalification and selection of same was carried out using
World Bank procedures.
During the implementation period (1997-1999) a number of problems have occurred which have been
generally overcome, albeit with some delays. The problems encountered may be classified into two main
categories:
(a) Technical Problems
The technical problems have generally been overcome and resolved more easily than the non technical
problems. The following are the main technical problems which have been encountered:
i.    Delivery of some sites to the contractors was delayed by exterior factors such as the Town
Planning Authority, the Forestry Department, private owners etc.
ii.    Temporary roads for traffic diversions had to be constructed in many instances.
iii.   Land acquisition and wayleaves were in many cases problematic causing thereby delays.
iv.    Underground utilities such as electricity, telephone and water caused many technical problems,
redesign of pipeline routes, additional costs and delays in various parts of the project.
v.    Relocation and redesign of a number of pumping stations in order to accommodate the
expansion of the rural road system and realignment of the main collector caused many
technical problems, delays and additional costs.
(b) Non-Technical Problems
The most important non technical problem was the public acceptability of the project and the creation of
an acceptable public image of the Board. A considerable effort has been put in maintaining the public
image of the Board at relatively high levels. This is being achieved mainly'by reducing the nuisance and
inconvenience to the public as much as possible. A mechanism has been established for immediate action
from the Board in cases of complaints from the public. Another problem which was faced during the
- 11-



initial stages of project implementation was the acceptability by the public of the new "form of tax," i.e.,
the sewerage charges which were to some extent considered as a new form of taxation leading to some
adverse comments especially during the first year.
A public campaign is ongoing by the Board. Generaly, it can be considered that the sewerage charges
have now been accepted by the majority of the people. A problem continuous to exist with a few of the
hotel owners some of whom resist payment of sewerage charges on the grounds that they are unfairly
treated. However, 90% of the owners at large are paying their dues.
Measures taken by the Board
During the implementation period the policy adopted by Board concentrates on the following areas:
1.    To maintain a continuous productive dialogue and preserve a framework of satisfactory
cooperation with all interested parties; and
2.    The establishment of an efficient and effective procedure for solving the day-to-day problems.
EVALUATION OF FINANCING ORGANIZATIONS
IBRD (The Bank)
From the experience obtained during the implementation of the project it is obvious that the cooperation
and assistance of the financing bodies to the Board was and still is excellent. With respect to the IBRD's
contribution to the ongoing success of the project, it must be mentioned that, should there not have been
the assistance, goodwill and persistence shown by the World Bank in implementing this project, it is
certain that further delays would have occurred and the project might not have been on its way to
completion.
The close and practical involvement of the Bank's staff, from the very beginning of the project during the
design and the project appraisal stage, has helped the Board to overcome successfully the many problems
encountered. The decisions made by the Board and the Bank during the initial stages of implementation,
with respect to many practical and technical problems, have contributed tremendously to the success of
the project. At the initial stages the borrower was comprised of a nucleus of staff and the experience and
guidance given by the Bank's staff was invaluable.
It is certain that the active involvement of the Bank in advising and solving practical, technical and
administrative problems, secured to a great extent the efficient utilization of the funds borrowed. The
Bank's demanding and strict procedures have been used as a guideline and as a compliance standard
which the Board's staff had to follow, therefore transmitting to the borrower the required attitude,
motivation and management behaviour and style which is contributing to the success of the project.
However, it should be noted that some strict and demanding Bank procedures caused high administrative
costs to the Borrower and in some cases, hinder the necessary flexibility. Nonetheless, it is also true that
the application of strict regulations and procedures ensures the proper utilisation of the Bank funds and
the proper implementation of a project which is to the interest of the Borrower.
Social Development Fund of Council of Europe (CERF)
During the initial implementation period the CERF was not actively involved in the progress and close
monitoring of the works. A six-monthly progress report. is submitted to the CERF at regular intervals.
The CERF has now undertaken a more active role in the monitoring of the project with annual technical
and financial appraisal visits. The Fund has also been extremely helpful through its positive response to
the Board's request for an increase in the loan limit.
- 12-



European Investment Bank
The Bank has taken a very active role in the project ever since their initial involvement. Their initial
review of the design of the project and their, ongoing technical support, have helped reduce the overall
cost of the project by several hundreds of thousand of Cyprus Pound. The Bank's generous interest
subsidy policy for environmental projects has also helped the financial position of the Board.
Paralimni Sewerage Board Comments
INTRODUCTION
This Report is prepared for the purposes of the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) in accordance
with the World Bank procedures.
THE PROJECT
Project Area
Paralimni is situated on the southeastern coast of Cyprus a few kilometres south of the city of Famagusta
which has been inaccessible since 1974. The project area covers the residential area of Paralimni and the
coastal belt tourist area of Paralimni known as Protaras. The residential area is located east of Paralimni
lake which is dry throughout the greater part of the year.
Project History
The original Master Plan for the Sewerage Project of Paralimni was completed in 1984. Additional
studies were carried out on the disposal of the effluent. Having considered the sea discharge possibility,
the Board decided to opt for the more environmentally beneficial method of irrigation.
Project implementation did not take place for a number of years due to the following reasons:
(a)     Procedures needed for the securing of the necessary project funding;
(b)     Examination of the various alternatives regarding the disposal of the effluent;
(c)     Examination of the various possible locations for the central treatment plant;
(d)     Deliberations with Ayia Napa Sewerage Board for the establishment of a
common treatment plant.
The Master Plan and Feasibility Study were updated in 1990. An environment assessment was carried out
in 1991. In the summer of 1993 Paralimni Sewerage Board, in conjunction with Ayia Napa Sewerage
Board, signed a consultancy agreement with Soil and Water Ltd. for the detailed design, supervision and
maintenance of works. The project is comprised of a gravity sewer network, sewer force mains, treated
effluent distribution for irrigation, pumping stations and the common treatment plant.
Paralimni Sewerage Board secured finance for the project from the World Bank (Loan CY3399
US$11,300.000 dated 7/11/91) and from the Council of Europe Development Fund (CERF) acting as
co-financier with a loan of CYP 8,464,800 (Loan F/P 1036 as amended in 1997). The balance of the
project cost would be met by the Board and by the Government of Cyprus which is covering the cost of
the tertiary treatment, the reservoirs and the effluent redistribution system.
Project implementation was delayed owing to a number of reasons, the most crucial being the longer than
expected design period and the delays encountered in the tendering, evaluation and contract award
procedures. Whereas, the initial operation year was anticipated to be 1994, actual construction work took
place for the first time in early 1996 with the commencement of some network sub-contracts, and early
- 13 -



1997 with the commencement of the networks contracts 1-P-I and I-P-2. The pumping stations contract
was awarded in March 1998 and the common treatment plant contract was awarded in October 1998.
Revised cost estimates carried out in 1995 indicated that the final cost of the project would be higher
than expected. The implementation delays had also eroded many years away from the World Bank loan
validity period and faced with the fact that the World Bank loan would expire in the summer of 1999, the
Board, having sought and obtained the clearance from all concerned, applied to the European Investment
Bank (EIB) for a subsidised interest environmental loan. Following detailed project review and the
preparation and submission of a new feasibility study, the EIB, in September of 1996, approved a loan to
Paralimni Sewerage Board of EURO (ECU) 9,270,000.
Progress of Works
Progress of works currently stands at:
Completed         Estimated
Percentage     Completion Date
Networks 1-P-i and 1 -P-2 (including effluent redistribution)  100%  Completed
Pumping stations                                         80%        May, 2000

- Electrical and mech. supply              20%        April, 2001
Networks are subdivided into 3 contracts, namely, I-P-1, 1-P-2 and 1-P-3. The construction of the initial
areas of Contracts 1-P-l and 1-P-2 has been completed. Certain areas of Contract 1-P-3 are currently
being constructed under Contract 1-P-i which has been extended accordingly. Networks have been
designed to provide for the ultimate development of the Paralimni area and the two nearby villages, those
of Dherynia and Sotira with an approximate population at present of 5,000 people each.
Description
The sewerage project covers the area within the water supply boundary line, being the residential area of
Paralimni and the coastal tourist area of Protaras . It is estimated that the total population which will be
served by the year 2010 will be 68,000 including permanent residents from Paralimni, Sotira and
Dherynia, tourists, daily visitors and the labour force in the tourist industry. It is estimated that the
number of tourist beds in hotels and hotel apartments will be 20,000 in the year 2010. The estimated total
sewage flow in the year 2010 will be about 8,840 m3/d during the peak season (August).
The sewer network consists of gravity and pressure sewers and pumping stations. The total length of the
lateral and main collectors is about 100 km and the number of pumping stations is 20.
The system includes a common treatment plant for Paralimni and Ayia Napa Sewerage Boards, situated
near Ayios Loannis forest. The treatment process includes biological treatment (extended aeration) and
tertiary treatment (sand filters). Effluent will be disinfected and conveyed for irrigation to the hotel areas,
forests and other designated green areas. It is proposed that during winter, the effluent will be used for
the irrigation of forest areas near the treatment plant. Excess water will be stored in reservoirs close to
the plant to be used for irrigation during summer.
The sludge treatment includes thickening, dewatering and lime stabilization. Stabilized sludge will be
transported to the landfill site.

Project Benefits
The central treatment plant has many advantages compared to the present situation of several small
treatment plants. The possible odour and noise nuisances are less as the treatment plant is quite far from
other buildings (>1.5 km from the tourist areas). The plant will be operated by full-time and well-trained
operators. Operational failures causing occasional spills and other nuisances will be less than in the
current situation. At present, spills of raw sewage into the sea have not been reported, but there could be
some cases when treated effluent from inigation systems leaks into the sea.
Since there will be no outlet to the sea, no loading to the sea will occur: Thus the sea water quality may
improve, although the current eutrophication situation and sea pollution level are little known.
Effluent would be used for the irrigation of hotel lawns and gardens, forest areas, public green areas and
playing fields. Effluent quality could be more efficiently controlled in the centralized system and the
possible contamination risk would be smaller. In addition, increased use of treated wastewater for
irrigation will decrease the use of scarce freshwater for the same purpose.
The nuisances caused by emptying the holding tanks and transporting sludge from the hotel treatment
plants would be eliminated in the centralized system. Also the hygienic risks of present sludge dumping
would be eliminated with a centralized sludge treatment.
Projected sewage production
The following are the three main components contributing to the quantity and quality of wastewater in a
sewer system:
1. Domestic wastewater
2. Industrial wastewater
3. Intrusion of stormwater/groundwater into the sewer system
There is no major water consuming industry in the project area, and according to the available
development plans the situation will remain the same in the future. Small-scale industries, like laundries
and handicrafts will develop along with the growth of population and tourism. Component 3 may be
omitted in this case as the sewers will be installed above the groundwater level and any stormwater
leakage is expected to occur during the low tourist season when water consumption is low.
Total sewage production
Total population served in the project area will be 68,000 incorporating residents, labour force in the
tourist industry, tourists and daily visitors. The number of tourist beds in hotels and hotel apartments
used for design purposes is 20,000. The estimated total wastewater flow is about 8,840 m3/d during the
peak season (August). The dimensioning of the wastewater treatment plant and pumping stations is based
on the maximum daily flow of the peak season (year 2010) and the dimensioning of the sewerage
network on the ultimate development to the area which will be served.
Water Consumption in Paralimni
At present, Paralimni is supplied with water through the Famagusta Water Supply pipeline of the recently
constructed desalination plant. Six reservoirs in the project area with total capacity of about 3,000 m3 are
used for storing the water from the Famagusta pipeline. Larger reservoirs (at least one day's supply) have
been considered for future development. The local distribution networks of the Water Board of Paralimni
service the residential area of Paralimni town and the coastal tourist area.
- 15 -



POPULATION
The permanent population of the town of Paralimni is about 10,000 residents. The highest population
densities are within the town centre of Paralimni. Tourism is the main industry in the area. There are no
other significant industries. The network system has been designed in such a manner as to allow for
future expansion through the connection and servicing of two nearby villages which at present number
some 10,000 inhabitants.
Projected population development
Paralimni has experienced a very rapid growth in tourism during the last few years. This growth is
expected to continue in future years, although it is expected that the growth rate will slow down due to
several restrictive factors, such as the scarcity of fresh water and labour. Despite of this and in order to
allow for future expansion, the dimensioning of the sewerage system has been based on scenarios with
quite large growths in tourism. The number of residents in Paralimni is estimated to grow by 2.2%
annually up to the end use design year of 2010. The area also attracts some 5,000 daily visitors. This is
estimated to remain the same until the year 2010.
IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAM
The overall project is divided into the following three contracts:
Contract I: This comprises complete implementation of sewage and irrigation networks, including the
supply of all materials in accordance with the conditions of contract for works of civil engineering
construction, FIDIC.
Work on Contract I is subdivided into three contract areas. The construction of the initial areas of
Contracts 1-P-i and 1-P-2 began in January 1987 was completed in April 1988. An extension was
granted on Contract 1 -P- I in order to accommodate the construction of certain areas of Contract 1-P-3
which are currently being constructed.
Contract II: This comprises the implementation and material supply contract for electro-mechanical and
civil works for pumping stations in accordance with the conditions of contract for electrical and
mechanical works including erection on site, FIDIC.
Work on Contract II, began in May 1998 and is expected to be completed by May, 2000.
Contract III: This comprises of the implementation of the sewerage treatrnent plant and effluent
reservoir, being a turn-key contract in accordance with the model form for turnkey-contracts published by
the World Bank.
Work on Contract III began in January of 1999 and is expected to be completed by April 2001 thus
enabling the whole project to operate therefrom.
The procurement procedures for all contracts have followed the guidelines of the World Bank.
Prequalification tenders were announced and applications from different firms, both local and
international were received.
FINANCIAL OBJECTIVES
Accounting and Auditing
Paralimni Sewerage Board has developed its own accounting and budgeting system, on the basis of
acceptable accounting principles in accordance with the International Accounting Standards and in line
with the provisions of the Sewerage and Drainage Law of 1971.
Most functions of the accounting department have been fully computerised. The Billing system, general
ledger, receivables collections, budgeting etc, have been computerised through a fully integrated system.
- 16-



Financial Statements consisting of balance sheet, income and expenditure account, and a cash flow
statement are prepared annually and are audited by the Auditor General of the Republic of Cyprus.
Although actual construction started in 1996, billing and collection of sewerage charges was effected as
from 1993 in accordance with the procedures and details agreed with the World Bank.
EVALUATION OF BORROWER'S OWN PERFORMANCE
Up to the middle of 1992 the Board did not have any permanent staff employed. Administrative and other
services were obtained through services from other' organisations as for example the Paralimni
Municipality and the services of the secretary/accountant of the Sewerage Board of Famagusta. The
project design and construction supervision was contracted out to an international consulting firm whish
is associated with local firms of consultants. Prequalification and selection of same was carried out using
World Bank guidelines.
During the implementation period (1997-1999) a number of problems occurred which generally have
been overcome, albeit with some delays. The problems encountered may be classified into two main
categories:
(a)    Technical Problems
The technical problems have generally been overcome and resolved more easily than the non technical
problems. The following are the main technical problems which have been encountered:
i.    Delivery of some sites to the contractors was delayed by exterior factors such as the Town
Planning Authority, the Forest Department, private owners etc.
ii.    Temporary roads for traffic diversions had to be constructed in many instances.
iii.    Land acquisition and wayleaves were in many cases problematic, causing delays.
iv.    Underground utilities such as electricity, telephone and water caused many technical problems,
additional costs, and delays in many parts of the project.
v.    Relocation and redesign of a number of Pumping Stations and realignment of the main collector
caused many technical problems, delays and additional costs.
(b)    Non-Technical Problems
The most important non technical problem was the public acceptabilit3 of the project and the creation of
an acceptable public image of the Board. A considerable effort has been put in maintaining the public
image of the Board at relatively high levels. This is being achieved mainly by reducing the nuisance and
inconvenience to the public as much as possible. A mechanism has been estab4shed for immediate action

Another problem which was faced during the initial stages of the project implementation was the
acceptability by the public of the new "form of tax," i.e., the sewerage charges. Sewerage charges were to
some extent considered as a new form of taxation and there some adverse comments especially during
the first year.
A public campaign is ongoing by the Board. Generally, it can be considered that the sewerage charges
have now been accepted by the majority of the people. A problem continuous to exist with the hotel
owners some of whom resist payment of sewerage charges on the grounds that they are unfairly treated.
However, 90% of the owners at large are paying their dues.

Measures taken by the Board
During the implementation period the policy adopted by Board concentrates on the following areas:
1.    To maintain a continuous productive dialogue and preserve a framework of satisfactory
cooperation with all interested parties, and
2.    The establishment of an efficient and effective procedure for solving the day to day problems.

The Bank has taken a very active role in the project ever since their initial involvement. Their initial
review of the designs of the project and their ongoing technical support, have helped reduce the overall
cost of the project by several hundreds of thousands of Cyprus Pounds. The Bank's generous interest
subsidy policy for environmental projects has also helped the financial position of the Board.
