RevisedProjectDevelopmentObjectiveandoutcomes [proposed]

The Project Development Objective (PDO) is unchanged. The project's aim is to achieve a
strong and effective regulatory and supervisory system for Bangladesh's banking sector.
However, the PDO outcome indicators have been changed to ensure more effective
monitoring o f progress toward meeting the PDO. The Bangladesh Bank (known also as the
Central Bank) remains the implementing agency.


I.IntroductoryStatement

1,      The Bangladesh Bank (BB) requested the restructuringof the Bangladesh Central
Bank Strengthening Project (Credit No. 3792-BDYP62916) (CBSP) in July 2008. The
request included an extension for completing work in progress and adding new activities
under the existing components o f the project as per BB's reform agenda. The discussion
on the restructuring has been ongoing since the request. The International Development
Association (IDA) considered various responses, including (i)closing the project, (ii)
starting a new project, and (iii)
                                restructuring the project inpartial or in full. Closing was
ruled out because the World Bank cannot abandon the project in midstream and the
Bank's engagement onbankingsector reform inBangladeshwould be adversely affected,
as BB is the main champion for the reforms. Starting a new project was not viable
because o f pending commitments and contracts in progress, the cancellation of which
would result in legal complications and reputational risk to the Bank. As a result, IDA
decided that it was best to restructure the project. Since partial restructuring would
impede achievement o f the Project Development Objective (PDO), a full restructuring as
requested by BB was the only logical outcome. In line with the decision to restructure,
IDA required BB to demonstrate commitment and produce tangible evidence of the
resolution o f implementation problems faced by the project. The Bank reviewed the
progress in phases and is satisfied that the measures taken by BB are satisfactory,
especially in the area o f procurement and BB's ability to manage and implement
contracts. The Bank also noted that the CBSP gained additional momentum when the
new governor of BB assumed a four-year term of office. This Project Paper seeks the
approval of the Executive Directors to introduce the following changes and
accompanying amendments to the project's legal documents.

2.      Project time frame: The current closing date is December 31, 2009. It is
proposed that the project closing date be extended to December 31, 2011. The change
will help to ensure successful completion of the project's activities. The new leadership
inBB is committed to the national aspiration of Digital Bangladesh, aimed at improving
transparency and governance, and this project contributes directly to that effort. The
action plan and risk-mitigation measures were discussed and found to be acceptable by
IDA.

3.     New activities: To support BB's new priority reform agenda, the undisbursed
credit proceeds would be directed toward existingcomponents to fund four new activities
not included in the original project. The new activities will contribute substantially
toward the better achievement o f the PDO andPDO output and outcome indicators.

4.       Projectdescription: The Development Credit Agreement andProject Agreement
for a credit amounting to Special Drawing Rights (SDR) 27.20 million between the
People's Republic o f Bangladesh andthe IDA was signed on June 30,2003. The original
project closing date was December 31, 2007 but was later extended to December 31,
2009. The original estimate for the project's total financing was estimated at US$46.13
million, out o f which IDA agreed to provide US$37.00 million (equivalent to SDR 27.20
million at the time o f Board approval). The objective o f the project i s to achieve a strong
and effective regulatory and supervisory system for Bangladesh's banking sector. This
would be accomplished by supporting the strengthening o f BB, including automation o f
its core functions, to enable it to play its due role as the country's monetary authority and
bank regulator and supervisor. The project comprises three components. The first
component i s Strengthening the Legal Framework. It includes anti-money laundering
activities and activities for countering the financing o f terrorism (AMLKFT). The second
component, Reorganization and Modernization, consists o f functional reorganization and
automation. The third component, Capacity Building, i s aimed at strengthening areas o f
the Research Department of BB,the prudential regulations andsupervision functions, and
the accounting and auditing functions.

5.       Successes: Over the years, the project has progressed successfully on many fronts
(as defined inthe project outputs) toward achieving its principal objective o f supporting
an effective regulatory and supervisory system for Bangladesh's banking sector. Policy
gains include the following: (i)  BB entered into memorandums ofunderstanding (MOUs)
with all banks to ensure they meet regulatory capital provisions for bad debts; (ii)       BB
issued necessary circulars to ensure soundness and stability o f the banking system; (iii)
the Government approved an amendment to the BankingCompanies Act and Bangladesh
Bank Order to         improve corporate       governance.     Institutional capacity-building
improvements were also achieved, including the following: (i)      the introduction o f modern
human resources (HR) policies and performance management systems, (ii)the
introduction o f a bank supervision manual, (iii)   the establishment of a dedicated policy-
analysis unit (PAU) in BB, and (iv) the completion o f a training-need analysis and the
subsequenttraining o fBB staff incore centralbanking skills..

6.      IT disbursementlag: Automation activities, onthe other hand, consumed a large
part o f the project's finances and also presented implementation problems. Information
                                               3

technology (IT) packages represented 80 percent o f the total project cost, and a delay in
their procurement resultedin disbursement lag of US$32 million. The disbursement rate
of the project stands at 16 percent as o f July 2009, and related output indicators could not
be achieved. The original IT package-which           included all the IT components o f the
project-was     cancelled in 2005 because the Government refused to endorse BB's award
recommendation. Consequently, the single IT package was broken into six interlinked
packages in consultation with IDA. BB then started the process o f procurement o f the
first package (personal computers) in late 2006, but the process became entangled in a
legal challenge. This involved, among other things, the unsuccessful bidder appealing
BB's recommendation of award to the Central Procurement Technical Unit (CPTU) as
well as the successful bidder filing a case in court to defend the award. The legal
entanglement caused further delay in project implementation. Meanwhile, as suggested
by IDA, BB proceeded to buy the personal computers using its own resources. BB also
sought the assistance o f the Department for InternationalDevelopment (DFID) for setting
up the Automated Clearing House (ACH) and Credit Information Bureau (CIB), given
the urgency of establishing these two entities to make the existing payment system and
credit approval process efficient and rapid.

7.      Additional disbursement lags: In addition to the lag in IT procurement, there
was no disbursement on some other activities o f the project, including disbursements for
the management team for nationalized commercial banks, an AML/CFT expert, the
operations and maintenance expert, and a counseling and tracking cell. There were
limited disbursements for some activities such as establishing the positions o f bank
supervision expert and the modernization expert. The delay inthese activities forced BB
to remove these activities from the project in 2005. The disbursement rate was further
worsened by an increase in the credit amount from US$37.00 million in June 2003 to
approximately US$44.00 millioninJune 2009 due to the appreciation o f the SDR.

8.      Implementation Status and Results (ISR) ratings and output indicators: The
ISR ratings have fluctuated over the years due to the slow pace o f procurement and lack
o f progress inproject implementation. The ratings varied from Satisfactory to Marginally
Unsatisfactory, but all the ratings have now improved to a Satisfactory level. The
achievement o f output indicators has also been mixed. The output indicator on adoption
o f modernHRpolicies by BB has been only partially met because BB has finalized a new
structure for the HR Department with specified objectives andjob description but has not
yet implemented the new structure. Inthe case of the output indicator requiring BB to
fully automate its work processes, the result has been negative due to the delay in the
procurement o f various IT packages. Similarly, the output indicator on having half o f all
the commercialbanksreporting to BB online by June 30,2006, hasnot beenmet because
the requisite Data Warehouse IT package, which supports data reporting and analysis
function, i s not yet inplace. A summary o f the results o f the 19 output indicators is listed
inAnnex I.

9.      Significant progress: During the past two years, from 2007 to 2009, there has
been significant progress inthe procurement of IT packages. The momentum picked up
with the award for a LAN/WANpackage of US$10 millioninApril 2008, the largest IT
package after a lull o f five years. It was followed by the award o f the Enterprise Resource

                                                4

Planning (ERP) contract worth US$5 million in April 2009. The remaining two other IT
contracts - Banking Application and Data Warehouse are in the final stages o f being
awarded, and IDA i s now reviewing BB's bid evaluation reports (BER) for those
packages..The award o f ERP contract has raised the level o f committed funds from 28
percent to 42 percent. The level i s expected to reach 71 percent by October 2009. BB has
a fully dedicated project implementation team supported by a procurement expert and IT
specialists. BB has also met the preconditions for the restructuring agreed upon with
IDA.These include monthly projectimplementationmeetingswithIDA, the award ofthe
ERP contact, the finalization o f the BidEvaluationReports (BER) for Banking and Data
Warehouse IT packages, andthe selection o f the ITprogram manager.

10.     Success factors for the restructured project: IDA i s convinced that the
proposed restructured project will be successfully implemented giventhe following:

 (9     A re-energized project implementationteam and improved capacity to manage IT
        projects and administer contracts;
 (ii) AtangibletrackrecordofBBperformanceincontractingITpackages;
 (iii) acommitmentbyBBtoadherestrictlytothetimelineforprojectimplementation
        in terms of project plan and system design, shipment of hardware, hardware
        installation and commissioning, software development and installation, testing o f
        system, and so forth as applicable to eachITpackage;
 (iv)   Substantial reduction in risk associated with procurement process since the IT
        component has moved from the procurement phase to the implementationphase;
 (4     A significant reduction inthe procurement risks associated with the bidding for
        and awarding o f contracts as a result of the award of all but two major IT
        contracts;
 (4     Delegation o f authority to a project director andhis staff;
 (vii) Alignments ofBB leadership withthe MinistryofFinance; and
 (viii) Renewed commitment and championship from BB management. The stages of
        procurement for each o f the IT packages under the project are described inAnnex
        I1

11.     Risk mitigation: Risks faced by the restructured project include the delay in
procurement o f and complications inthe implementation o f the IT packages, but these do
not appear significant. The procurement risks are minimal because, as noted, most o f the
IT packages have been awarded or are in the final stages of being awarded. The
remaining procurement risks, if any, can be mitigated through the retention o f an IT
procurement specialist and training o f BB staff on procurement issues. Complications
arising in implementation can be similarly addressed. BB has a credible plan to reduce
procurement and implementation risks by hiring local and international technicians to
support the project management team. BB i s at the final stages o f hiring banking,
treasury, and ERP specialists (local consultants) and an IT program manager
(international consultant) for the project, and these specialists are expected to come on
board by August 2009. The monthly project implementation meetings with IDA will also
assist inthe foregoing progress.

12.     Reasons for supporting request for restructuring: In summary, the project
needs to be restructured, andthe reasons for supporting the restructuringare as follows:

    (i)  The ratingof progress toward Achievement o f the PDO inthe ISRwas upgraded
         to Moderately Satisfactory in November 2007 and since June 2009 has been
         upgradedto Satisfactory (S).
    (ii)Restructuringwill better align resources, implementation, and activities to
         achieve the PDO.
    (iii)ThenewGovernoroftheBangladeshBankisfullyonboardinimplementing
         the project successfully and BB has agreed to adhere strictly to the timeline for
         project implementation, and
    (iv) IDA cannot end its engagement when the client is fblly committed and the
         activities are half way through completion.


111.Proposed Changes

13.     Project Development Objective: The objectives and the project components o f
the project will not be changed. The PDO remains the same: to achieve a strong and
effective regulatory and supervisory system for Bangladesh's bankingsector. However, it
i s proposed that the two current PDO outcome indicators be replaced with three new
indicators in order to ensure a more effective monitoring o f progress toward meeting the
PDO. These three new PDO outcome indicators are as follows: (i)acceptance and
implementation by BB o f ERP; (ii)  acceptance and implementation by BB o f the Banking
Application; and (iii)acceptance and implementationby BB o f the Data Warehouse. The
proposed restructuringalso entails three other actions:

     (i)Extensionoftheclosingdateby24monthstoDecember31,2011,
     (ii)TheadditionoffouractivitiestotheexistingReorganizationandModernization
         component of the project, and
     (iii)Reallocationoffindsamongthe10existingsubcomponentsoftheproject.

14.     Extension of closing date: It i s proposed that the closing date be extended by 24
months to allow BB to continue with work in progress. Work has been interruptedby
such procurement-related obstacles as the difficulty in convening a quorum o f the
Technical Evaluation Committee, the frequent extension of bid submission dates due to
last-minute requests by bidders for additional information or clarification, and so forth.
The earlier extension granted inDecember 2007 was basedon an actionplanagreed upon
by BB and IDA that would mitigate procurement and contract management risk for
CBSP. BB was able to carry out most o f the actions related to contract administrationand
other actions but was unable to meet the timeline for bid evaluations and contract awards.
(See Annex I11for more details). Nevertheless, the PDO continues to be achievable, and
the performance o f BB i s satisfactory. A new action plan satisfactory to IDA has been
submitted for the purposes of project restructuring. Now that most of the major IT
packages have been awarded or are the final stages o f being awarded, the only major
governance risk that may arise during project implementation relates to insufficient
checks and balances in the disbursement policies and practices. These could result in

                                             6

disbursements to fraudulent claims. To mitigate this risk, payments to suppliers are made
directly once invoices are presented. Inaddition, significant emphasis i s placed on post-
disbursement review and verification. Last but not least, the Capacity-Building
component o f the project will help improve these processes. BB and IDA have agreed
that an annual written review o f compliance will be carried out. Achievement o f the PDO
continues to be a priority to the Government. The Government believes that, with the
recent reform in the procurement regulations and continuing anticomption drive, the
objective i s more attainable than ever before. Also, leaving the reform program
unfinished would result ina reversal, particularly with regard to the gains achieved so far
by the initiation o fthe automationandthe restructuring o f core central banking activities,
including the HR reform.

15.     New activities: It i s proposed that four new activities are added to the project to
better align resources, implementation, and activities to achieve the new PDO outcome
indicators. All fall under the Reorganization and Modernization component. The first
activity i s Modernization o f the Bangladesh Bank Training Academy (BBTA). The
second i s to the establishment of an IT Lab at BB headquarters. The third activity is BB
Office Layout and Office Modernization. The fourth is installation o f the Video
Conferencing Facility at BB. These activities will help transform BB into an efficient
central bank by improving its operational efficiency and its business processes. They will
contribute directly to the achievement o fthe PDO outcome indicators o f transforming BB
into an efficient central bank by implementing an effective management information
system and high-end connectivity for internal and external linkages. Details o f these
activities are listed inAnnex IV.

16.     Reallocation: BB has proposed to strengthen its capacity in the following areas:
supervision, accounting and audit, human resources, training o f staff, research at the
Policy Analysis Unit (PAU), and support for IT implementation. The details of the
reallocationo f funds under the various components are giveninAnnex V.




                                              7

 IV.Analysis

 17.     There are no changes envisagedinthe project's (i) institutionalarrangements, (ii)
 financing    mechanisdconduit, (iii) financial       management, (iv) disbursement
 arrangements, and (v) procurement. BB will continue to be the implementing agency.
 Total disbursements as of June 3, 2009, under IDA allocation were SDR 4.22 million,
 which is utilization of 15.5 percent of the credit amount. Considering the proposed
 inclusion o f new itemdactivities based on BB's priority reform initiatives, a Revised
 Financial Resources Estimate for CBSP has been prepared and approved by the
 Bangladesh authorities. As per the new estimate, it is proposedthat the total cost of the
 project will beUS$53,346,000, out of which IDA would provideUS$44,000,000 andBB
 would provideUS$9,346,000.     The revisedfinancial resources estimate is given intable

 20.     None o f the proposed changes will have an effect on the original economic,
 financial, technical, institutional, or social aspects o f the project as appraised. The
 proposed changes will not raise the environmental category o f the project or trigger new
 safeguard policies. The proposed restructuring does not involve any exceptions to IDA
 policies.

 Financial Management

 21.     There are no outstanding audit reports. IDA has received a timely audit report
 from BB for FY 2008, including a response to audit observations identified by IDA.
 Audit replies were found to be satisfactory.      BB has also been submitting Project
 Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) within 45 days from the end o f each quarter.
 Upon review o f FMRs, it i s evident that CBSP Cell (Project Management Unit o f BB) i s
 able to preparetimely and accurate project FMRs.BB has strengthenedoverall budgeting
 and accounting and the internal audit function by recruiting professional staff. However,
 most o f the professional staff is hired on term contracts, which may end with the
 completion o f the project, posing a serious threat to the capacity developed and
 sustainability. The financial management has consistently been rated satisfactory. To
 improve its financial management practice further, BB has agreed to include in its entity
 audit report for FYlO a separate opinion on Statement o f Expenditure (SOE)/Dollar
 Special Account (DOSA) Account and a disclosure on IDA finances.


                                              10

Procurement

22.     In addition to the reasons attributed above for delays in procuring IT
components/packages, implementation progress was affected by BB's weak procurement
capacity and the lack of the Government's commitment in awarding contracts in a timely
manner. But as mentioned earlier, the factors leadingto prior delays (mainly procurement
related issues) are no longer posing major impediments to project implementation. A
hll-time procurement specialist works for the CBSP Cell and CBSP Cell now has an
adequate number o f staff trained and experiencedinIDA procurement. Inaddition, inorder
to mitigate procurement and contract management risks, a timeline o f appropriate
process-related issues dealing with procurement within BB has been agreed to with BB.
The Government has also taken steps to address major procurement, contract
management, and fiduciary issues to IDA'Ssatisfaction. IDA has been having regular
(monthly) project implementation meetings with BB, and this has been contributing
positively to procurement management and contract management issues. It is expected
that procurement-relatedissues will no longer hamperproject implementation.

V. ExpectedOutcomes

23.     Output indicators: To monitor the development impact o f the automation of
BB's operations, three new output indicators are being proposed for the project's
Reorganization and Modernization component. They are (i)timely and accurate
preparation and reporting o f financial statistics by BB, (ii)
                                                            timely and accurate accounting
and reporting o f government accounts and securities, and (iii)timely and accurate
submission o f prudential returns by financial institutions (FIs) and better management o f
foreign exchange by BB.A summary o f the existing PDO, new PDO outcome indicators,
andadditionaloutput indicators for the project's components are given inTable 5.

 To achieve a strong and effective regulatory and supervisory      No change

 accomplished by supporting the overall strengthening o f
 Bangladesh Bank (BB), the central bank, to enable it to play
 its due role as the country's monetary authority andbank
 regulator and supervisor.

VI. BenefitsandRisks

24.     The political situation of Bangladesh is not expected to have a major impact on
this project given the fixed tenure of BB's staff at all levels. Political interference in
procurement decision stemming from lobbying efforts by competing bidders may pose a
threat to timely implementation of the project. Fortunately, however, this risk has been
mitigated as all the major IT contracts are now at an advanced stage ofprocurement (ina
two-stage bidding process) and it is expected that all these contracts will be awarded by
October 2009. Going forward, careful project management (especially management of
the automation program) assisted by expertise from the private sector will be neededto
helpBBto strengthencapacity through a comprehensivebusiness processre-engineering.

STATUS OF PROCUREMENTOF IT PACKAGES


1.      IT-2 standard hardware and software for acquiring PCs, related IT
equipment, and software and training are largely completed with BB's own funds.
Over 2,250 PCs and laptops along with printers, scanners, and furniture have been
acquired and supplied to the headquarters and branch offices. A key accomplishment was
the training program runby CBSP Cell with the assistance o f BBTA for more than2,200
BB staff, including general managers, on basic computer operating skills for Microsoft
Office 2007, an intranet, and email systems. When the PCs are networked and connected
to the servers inJuly 2009, BB staff will be fully functional with basic computer skills.

2.      IT-3 LANIWANIOffice automation package was approved by IDA, but
progress has been slow due to difficulties with vendor Singapore Technologies (ST)
Electronics and its subcontractor. In spring 2009, progress has been noted with four
consignments o f goods received by BB including servers, CISCO routers, switches,
Systimax products, and cables, which are now in various stages o f deployment. BB has
extended the implementation period of this contract to July 31,2009.

3.      IT-4 Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution is making good progress
with a strong ERP implementation team led by a general manager of accounts. The
contract was signed for about $5 million with the vendor Indra Systems from Spain on
April 25, 2009. Inparallel, BB has taken necessary measures to prepare itself for ERP
implementation, by identifying25 staff members from business and IT teams for training
on ERP project implementation at the Asian Institute o f Technology in Thailand. The
project i s headed by the general manager o f accounts, a chartered accountant with
appropriate experience, who has been hired from the private sector to lead the
implementation o fthe project.


4.      IT-5 Banking software is at the final stage of procurement. T BB sent its bid
evaluation report for IDA's review and no-objection. The procurement process is
expected to be finalized by August 2009.

BB sent its bid evaluation report for IDA's no-objection to award contract following the
second stage bid on May 25,2009. The procurement process i s expected to be completed
by August 2009.

6.      IT4327 System Integrationis inthe RFP process with an expected completion
date by end o f June 2009. 4 pre-bid conference held by BB on April 13, 2009 was well
attended by five out o f six responsive bidders. A total o f six RFPshave beenreceived and

ANNEX I V

NEW ACTIVITIES UNDERTHE REORGANIZATION AND MODERNIZATION
COMPONENT

1.        The first new activity is the modernization o f the Bangladesh Bank Training
Academy (BBTA). BBTA has recently been relocated to a new, modern, and spacious
building in Mirpur. In the new environment, BBTA is expected to provide extensive
training on the new systemshusiness processes to more than 3,000 BB staff however it is
not yet equipped with the essential modern facilities and supplies needed for
uninterrupted and high-quality training.      To transform BBTA into a modern training
academy, equipment such as multimedia and overhead projectors, laptops, audio systems,
photocopiers, scanners, vending machines will have to be procured. An amount o f
US$197,000 has been estimated for this activity. This new activity will contribute to the
transformation o f BB into an efficient central bank by providing requisite quality training
to BB's staff.

2.       The second new activity is to set up an IT lab at BB headquarters to support post-
implementation operation o f the information system (automation component). It will
allow BB to set up an IT help desk and conduct training and product development. The
new activity will provide work stations and other equipment such as whiteboards, audio
systems, and servers.    The total estimated cost i s US$28,000. This new activity will
improve BB's business processes by implementing high-endconnectivity for internal and
external linkages, thus enabling the project to achieve its PDO.

3.       The third new activity i s BB office layout and office modernization. The
experience o f similar central bank modernization projects in Pakistan and Sri Lanka
showed that a modern office layout is essential to ensure IT security and better
functionality o f staff. As part o f the IT upgrade, both the State Bank o f Pakistan and the
Central Bank o f Sri Lanka introduceda completely redesignedoffice layout with modern
facilities, including cubicles in line with the LAN/WAN design and the procurement o f
supplies needed to modernizehenovate office premises.             Considering the ongoing
automation program under CBSP, it has become imperative that BB have a proper office
layout with modern facilities. To this end, cubicle type work stations in the BB head
office, branch offices, and BBTA for officials o f the rank o fjoint director and below will
be procured. Inaddition, enclosures such as meetingrooms, visitor areas, and common
areas with proper seating arrangements and furniture will be procured. Total estimated
cost i s US$2,985,000. Experience from central bank modernization projects in Pakistan
and Sri Lanka also showed that this activity contributed to improved staff morale, greater
productivity, and improved operational efficiency, thus having a direct bearing on the
PDO o f improving the standards, processes, and quality o f personnel.

4.       The fourth new activity is the installation o f a video-conferencing facility at BB.
This facility, at the head office and BBTA, will be installedto add further use of modern
technology for essential communications and greater collaboration with other central
banks, monetary authorities and research facilities. The facility will provide Bf3 with an
enhanced global reach, enabling it to adopt timely and effective monetary policy. Video

                                              23

conferencing systems with necessary licenses, plasma monitors, and necessary fixtures
will be procured. Total estimated cost is US$47,000. This activity will help improve
communicationand flow o f information between BB's head office andbranch offices and
enable BB to participate inglobal dialogue on financial crisis preparedness and response,
regional integration, and harmonization o f prudential norms. It will c0ntribut.e directly to
the achievement o f the PDO o f transforming BB into an efficient central bank by
implementing an effective management-information system and high-end connectivity
for internal and external linkages.

ANNEX V

REALLOCATIONOF FUNDS

The proposed reallocation o f funds among the various activities and under the various
components o f the project would be as follows:

 Strengtheningthe Legal Framework

1.      AML/CFT expert: The original cost estimate was US$300,000 for 24 staff
months. The position remains vacant due to non-availability o f suitable candidates. BB
has taken another initiative with modified terms o f reference, which require involvement
o f four staff months only. Accordingly, the financial involvement has been reduced to
us$80,000.

Reorganization and Modernization of BangladeshBank

2.      Organization and management expert: Original estimated cost was
US$150,000. As the tasks o f O&M expert have considerable overlap with those o f the
modernization advisor and the services for such consultancy would be more useful at the
end o f successful automation, it was decided that hiring o f O&M expert i s not necessary
at this stage.

3.      Modernization advisor: Although the contract value for this consultancy
position i s US$1.01 million plus BDT 230 million, BB noted that usage will be much
lower as the actual involvement in staff months is very low and the contract period has
expired. Consideringthe amount already paidandto be paid for actual involvement along
with a provision o f US$lOO,OOO for a new position o f change management advisor
(national) at the end o f successful automation, the financial allocation has been reduced
to US$600,000 from US$1,050,000.

4.      IT specialists: BB utilizes the services of various IT specialists, including IT
program manager, procurement specialist, network specialist, and Internet and intranet
specialist for different staff months. However, considering the realistic estimation o f the
possible implementation period o f all the IT components o f the project, further services
o f a few IT specialists e.g., IT program manager and procurement specialist, will be
necessary. Thus, the tenure o f IT program manager has been increased from 36 man
months to 78 staff months, and the tenure of the procurement specialist has been
increased from 36 man months to 74 staff months. The involvement o f the Internet and
intranet specialist (national) has beenincreased from 30 months to 36 months. The tenure
o f other positions has either remained unchanged or reduced. On the other hand, several
individual IT specialist positions have been included in the System Integration (firm)
Package. Accordingly, the total financial allocation for IT specialists (individuals) has
increased to US$3,060,000 from US$700,000. A breakdown o f the revised estimate is
giveninTable 6.

5.       NationalHR advisor: BB usedthe services of a national HR advisor from two
separate contracts. One consultant served for 14 months and the other for 11 months.
Total utilization is 25 staff months against the original estimate o f 36 staff months.
However, BB envisaged another 12-month involvement o f this consultancy for the post-
automation period. Downward adjustment from US$200,000 originally estimated to
US$137,000 has beenmade considering the actual remuneration packages.

6.       Counseling and tracking cell: This position was originally included in the
project to provide counseling to staff opting for voluntary retirement scheme (VRS)..
Original estimated cost was US$50,000. As no VRS was offered during this period and
there i s no immediate plan to do so as BB wants to reduce staff through natural attrition,
BB does not need such service.

7.       Training programManagement development program: US$3,000,000 was
estimated for this component for the purpose o f local and foreign training for BB
officials. In the revised estimate, an amount o f US$2,960,000 has been allocated.
However, due to scarcity o f quality training sources locally and considering the increased
expenses for travel abroad, the portion for foreign training (including study visits abroad)
out o f the total amount has been increased to US$2,460,000 from the US$1,647,000 in
the original plan.

CapacityBuilding

8.      Strengthening the research department: An amount of US$2,150,000 was
estimated for this component for the purpose o f recruitingrequiredexperts and to provide
necessary training for staff inthe Research Department o f BB. The component has been
successfully implemented with the help o f the World Bank Institute at a lesser cost,
amounting to US$396,000. However, considering the requirement o f institutionalizing
the knowledge, BB feels that the services o f four senior research economists and twelve


                                             26

 research economists for another 12 months period can be financed from CBSP funds.
 Accordingly, the financial allocation has beenrevisedto US$601,100.

 9.      Strengthening prudential regulation and supervision: In the original plan,
there were two expert positions: one bank regulation expert and one bank supervision
expert, andthere was provisionfor management support for the NationalizedCommercial
Banks. The estimated cost for the two positions was US$400,000. Subsequently, the two
positions were consolidated and BB utilized the service o f one bank supervision and
regulation advisor for US$270,000. Considering the requirement after implementation o f
Base1I1and automation, provision for six months involvement o f a prudential regulation
and supervision expert has been made. The financial involvement has been revised to
US$420,000 accordingly. BB utilized one consultancy position for management support
at a cost o f US$28,300. The management support for the NationalizedCommercial Banks
was subsequently taken out from the project and funded under the IDA'SEnterprise
Growth and IDA Modernization Project. This subcomponent has thus been revised to
U S$448,3 00 accordingly.

 10.     Strengthening the accounting and auditing standards: The original plan was
to utilize the services o f one reputable local auditor with international affiliation to audit
BB FY03 accounts to strengthenthe accounting and auditing standards of BB. Audit of
FY03 accounts was done accordingly. Eight months service o f the accounts and audit
specialist were utilized, but subsequently the tasks o f the position were completed by
using the services of a local accounting firm. The services o f an accounts and audit
specialist will be required during the implementation o f the Banking and ERP software
packages. Accordingly, a provision for 12 months has been made. The original estimate
o f US$900,000 has been revised to US$314,600 in view o f actual and envisaged
expenditure.

11.      Project Implementation Unit (PIU) support costs: In the original plan there
was no provision for the implementation costs o f the PIU, which i s responsible for
overall implementation, coordination, and supervision o f various activities under the
project. In order to strengthen project implementation and improve the prospects for
achievement o f the PDO, it is proposed that IDA supports the implementation costs o f the
PIU. An amount o f US$63,000 has been allocated to this activity which would fund the
transportation cost o fthe PIU.

Unallocated

12.     Inthe original cost, estimated at US$3,248,000, was kept aside to finance any
shortfall inimplementingany component o f the project. This fund has beenreallocated to
different components, and so there is no unallocated fund left from IDA portion at the
end o f the project. However, BB will set aside US$l,OOO,OOO from its own budget for any
shortfall infinancing the project components.
