2.       Summary of Project Implementation Progress.

        Since the project underwent Level I restructuring in July 2009, there has been
significant progress in the procurement of IT packages and other components of the
project. Consequently, the disbursement rate improved from 16% to 45%. There is a
strong likelihood of achieving the Project Development Objective (PDO) based on
expected achievement of project outcomes and targets. Though the disbursement rate at
                                                         2
45 percent is low, 80 percent of project funds are now fully committed and are expected
to be disbursed within the next 10 months.

        The expected project savings proposed for reallocation are due to delayed
procurement of IT systems experienced early in the project life which will result in the
project's closing on December 31, 2011 before 5 years of post-implementation
expenditure can be funded. The post implementation expenditure comprises the total cost
of warranty and post warranty services and other recurrent fees that were, by design,
included in 4 IT packages. As a result, the project will have USD 8 million of unused
funds or 13 % of total project funds when the project closes. BB has agreed to bear all
the post-implementation cost elements (USD 8 million) from its own resources as per the
existing contracts of the IT Packages and has requested IDA to allow the USD 8 million
of the project funding to be used for other related reform activities in BB.


3.      Rationale for Proposed Reallocation

       The proposed reallocation is necessary to allow Bangladesh Bank (BB) to utilize
the unused funds to finance existing components and three new activities not included in
the original project. The reallocation of unused funds for the new activities will
contribute substantially toward the better achievement of the PDO and PDO output and
outcome indicators.

       The project components remain unchanged. There is only a reallocation of funds
from an existing component to support three new activities that are nevertheless
consistent with BB's priority reform agenda which this project is supporting. The three
new activities are: (i) National Payment Switch (NPS) and e-Payment Gateway, (ii) IT
System for Anti-Money Laundering Department (AMLD) for Suspicious Transaction
Reporting (STR) and Cash Transaction Reporting (CTR), and (iii) System for Public
Accounts Department (PAD).1 IDA has agreed to finance NPS and e-Payment Gateway
100% of the expenditure up to a maximum amount of SDR3.8149 million (USD 6.0
million). A separate sub-category under (1) Goods will be created for this activity. The
three new activities will contribute substantially toward achievement of the PDO and
PDO output and outcome indicators.

  Another proposed new activity -- Central Depository System (CDS) for Government Securities ­ has
already been incorporated into the project by broadening the scope of the Banking Application IT Package.
