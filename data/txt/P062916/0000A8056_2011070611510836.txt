                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project was restructured for the second time in March 2011 to permit reallocation of funds to finance three new activities: (i) National Payment Switch (NPS) and e-Payment

                         Gateway, (ii) IT System for Anti-Money Laundering Department (AMLD) for Suspicious Transaction Reporting (STR) and Cash Transaction Reporting (CTR), and (iii) System for
                         Public Accounts Department (PAD). Since all IT Packages other than NPS and e-Payment gateway have been awarded (worth USD 30.2 million out of USD 43 million of the credit)
                         and the project previous major procurement risks that had slowed project progress have now been reduced, the likelihood of achieving the PDO is good.

                         Key Decisions for Disclosure

                         Following our recent implementation support mission, the team decided to retain the Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU) rating previously given for Overall Implementation Progress (IP),
                         Financial Management, and Project Management, reflecting the team's assessment of the current actual performance of the Central Bank to implement the project and the low level
                         of disbursements. The team hopes to upgrade the project as soon as disbursements pick up and completion of contracts accelerates.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Following our recent implementation support mission, the team decided to retain the Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU) rating previously given for Overall Implementation Progress (IP),
                         Financial Management, and Project Management, reflecting the team's assessment of the current actual performance of the Central Bank to implement the project and the low level
                         of disbursements. The team hopes to upgrade the project as soon as disbursements pick up and completion of contracts accelerates.
