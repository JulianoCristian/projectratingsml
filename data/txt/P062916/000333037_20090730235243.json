However, it is proposed that the two current\n            project development objective (PDO) outcome indicators be\n            replaced with three new indicators in order to ensure a more\n            effective monitoring of progress toward meeting the PDO.\n            These three new PDO outcome indicators are as follows: (i)\n            acceptance and implementation by Bangladesh Bank (BB) of\n            Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP); (ii) acceptance and\n            implementation by BB oft he banking application; and (iii)\n            acceptance and implementation by BB of the data warehouse.\n            The restructuring also entails three other actions: (a)\n            extension of the closing date by 24 months to December 31,\n            2011; (b) the addition of four activities to the existing\n            reorganization and modernization component of the project;\n            and (c) reallocation of funds among the 10 existing\n            subcomponents of the project."}, "docdt": "2009-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
