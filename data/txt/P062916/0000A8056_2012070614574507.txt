                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The automation of Bangladesh bank is functional with the commissioning of the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Core Banking, and Enterprise Data Warehouse systems.
                         Moreover, all Bangladesh Bank branches are now connected to each other and also to the newly installed systems. The Credit Information Bureau and the Clearing House have also
                         been automated. The use of the Electronic Fund Transfer Network supported by the core banking solution, has made it possible for government salaries to be paid directly in to the

                         bank accounts of the beneficiaries. It is expected that gradually all government payments will be made through the electronic funds transfer system. Due to delays in initiating the
                         National Payments Switch and the Office Layout and Modernization packages, these two activities may not be completed by the extended Project Closing Date of December 31,
                         2012. However, the likelihood of achieving the PDO is good.
