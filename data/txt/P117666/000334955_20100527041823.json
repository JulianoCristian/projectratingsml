standards. PL3 continues to support the Government's\n            successful policy response to the economic slowdown. Key\n            reform initiatives included the anti-crisis stability and\n            development plan; the reduction in the tax wedge; the\n            phasing out of early retirement pensions; and the amendments\n            of the law on freedom of business operations, the public\n            finance act and the 2009 state budget. Following the second\n            policy loan, PL3 will continue to support Government\n            measures to mitigate the impact of the global crisis on\n            households, workers and businesses. With the recovery\n            gaining speed, it also supports Government efforts to unwind\n            the extraordinary anti-crisis policies and step up reforms\n            to reinforce Poland's growth prospects."}, "docdt": "2010-05-11T00:00:00Z"}
