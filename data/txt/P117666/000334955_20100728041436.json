The requesters state\n            that their property at Chocimska six Warsaw, Poland, was\n            expropriated in the 1970s without the payment of any\n            compensation. They further claim that this property is\n            likely to be \"privatized\" by the Polish Government\n            with the active support of the World Bank through this\n            operation. The Requesters further state that they owned\n            extensive tracts of agricultural land in Silesia and that\n            land was also expropriated without payment of compensation.\n            They claim that Polish Government refused to discuss either\n            claim with them. On July 14, 2010, management provided a\n            note to the panel with information concerning the activities\n            supported under the operation. According to management, the\n            operation has impacts on six different areas of policy:\n            labor markets, social assistance (pensions), public finance,\n            health, education, and private sector development.\n            Management further stated that the operation does not\n            support any privatization with respect to individual\n            companies or even the broader policy of privatization, and\n            that the areas of policy supported do not involve the sale\n            of any assets that are the subject of this dispute.\n            Management added that, in this light, there is no nexus\n            between this operation and the particular concerns raised in\n            the request."}, "docdt": "2010-07-23T00:00:00Z"}
