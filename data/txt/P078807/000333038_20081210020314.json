         development outcome was low or negligible, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was highly satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            despite the small size of Bhutan and the high costs of\n            operations, it was recognized that it was important and\n            worthwhile to sustain a close engagement, as there are\n            strong impacts of Bank interventions in a small economy.\n            Accordingly, DPG2 sought to deepen the engagement for wider\n            and longer-lasting impacts. Efforts to support institutions\n            and capacity building were seen to be worthwhile, in order\n            to consolidate progress made on various reform efforts.\n            Accordingly, DPG2 saw a stronger support for capacity\n            building initiatives, with parallel Institutional\n            Development Fund (IDF) grants and other measures.\n            Identifying good indicators upfront to gauge progress can be\n            difficult, especially in a country with limited capacity and\n            data. The DPG experience also shows the difficulty in\n            finding suitable indicators of progress, when attribution is\n            difficult. The follow-up operations will pay closer\n            attention to this issue. Achievement of the development\n            objectives is more likely when the upfront actions supported\n            under such operations are part of the borrower's\n            overall Plan objectives and goals. Accordingly, the\n            follow-up DPG program will align closely with the Tenth Plan."}, "docdt": "2008-11-21T00:00:00Z"}
