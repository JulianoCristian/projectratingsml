Description           The proposed first Development Policy Grant (DPG I)      i s in support o f an
                      ongoing reform program, which includes four components: (i)      ensuring the
                      maintenance o f a sound macroeconomic framework, strengthening fiscal
                      policy, and bolstering financial management; (ii)  enhancing the investment
                      climate for private sector growth and employment generation, (iii)
                      augmenting the quality o f and access to education; and (iv) improving
                      health care.

Benefits              Inproviding support for the reformprogramofthe Royal Government of
                      Bhutan, this operation recognizes progress to date and will facilitate the
                      Kingdom's next steps towards achieving better socioeconomic outcomes
                      and reducing poverty. More specifically, the benefits expected from the
                      development policy program include: (a) improved delivery o f public
                      services as a result o f better public budget and financial management, (b)
                      greater foreign direct investment and more job opportunities due to
                      improvements in the investment climate and increased labor market
                      flexibility, (c) higher school enrollment and completion, particularly in
                      previously under served areas, as access to schooling services i s expanded,
                      and (d) better health outcomes in such critical areas as maternal mortality,
                      as a result o f an increased number o f births being delivered in health
                      facilities.

Risks                 The major risks stem from: (a) low technical capacity and s h l l shortage
                      which i s the leading factor impeding Bhutan's overall development
                      progress, (b) lack o f economic diversification and dependency on
                      hydropower, and (c) reforminertia due to political developments.

                                                     I.INTRODUCTION

1.      The Royal Government of Bhutan's (RGoB) ongoing medium-term policy and institutional reform
program is anchored in its Ninth Five-Year Plan, which i s also its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP).' Reflecting the distinct vision o f Gross National Happiness (GNH), the NinthFive-Year Plan has
five overall goals: (i)       improving quality o f life and income, especially for the poor, (ii)             ensuring good
governance, (iii)promoting private sector growth and employment generation, (iv) preserving and
promoting cultural heritage and the environment, and (v) achieving rapid economic growth and
transformation. The strategies outlined to achieve these goals include expanding infrastructure, maintaining
sound macroeconomic policy, ensuring good governance, and improving access to enhanced social
services. The RGoB's reform program underpinsthese goals and strateges, and i s selectively supported by
the DPG. The program i s at an early stage and i s still gathering pace. It is, however, moving in the right
direction and i s commensurate with the existing technical capacity and circumstances o f the country. More
importantly, the government's commitment to implementing the reformagenda i s strong.

2.      Duringthe CAS consultations inearly 2005, the RGoB requestedpolicy-based assistance inorder to
pursue its poverty reduction strategy (PRS).2 In view of the existing capacity constraints, PRS
implementation in Bhutan i s technically-demanding and requires long-term support from development
partners. This was recently confirmed in the NinthRound Table Meeting held in Geneva on February 15
and 16, 2006. Development policy lending i s an appropriate instrument in such circumstances. Bhutan i s a
top performer among IDA countries, and its development progress and commitment to moving forward
justify policy-based support, helping maintainthe momentumo freform.

3.      The proposed Development Policy Grant (DPG) would be the first in a series of programmatic
budget operations, and would seek to support key components o f the government's p r ~ g r a mThe grant               . ~
would provide US$15 million in budget support in FY06 to help the RGoB meet its development goals.4
Given that the proposed DPG will be the first policy-based operation inBhutan, it will entail a deepening o f
the policy dialogue and a process o f learning. A second operation, Development Policy Grandcredit 11, i s
planned for 2007-08, and would be linked to a strengthening o f the reform program as well as to a

 'The  PRSP and the Joint Staff Advisory Note (Bhutan: Joint StaffAdviso y Note of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, [Report
No. 30716-BT]) prepared by the staffs of the International Development Association and the InternationalMonetary Fund, was
discussedby the Boardon February8,2005.

  The Bhutan CAS (World Bank: County Assistance Strategyfor the Kingdom of Bhutan for the Period FY06-FY09, Report No.
33704-BT, September28,2005) was discussedby the BoardonNovember 1,2005.

  Bhutanis an IDA only country, and under IDA-14, it qualifiesfor 100percent grants inFY06 basedon: (i) the 2004 present value
 o f external debt to GDP which i s above its indicative threshold(50%), and (ii)
                                                                                the 2004 present value of externaldebt to exports
ratio which is also above its indicativethreshold(200%). The RGoB can frontload up to 80% of the indicative 2006-07 and 2007-
 08 allocations.IfBhutan continues to receive 100 percent grant assistance from IDA, the indicative allocationfor the remainder of
 the CAS period-FY07       to FY09-would      be about USS44.0 million. Actual allocations will depend on a variety of factors
 including the country's own performance (absolute and relative to other IDA countries), and the amount of overall resources
 availableto IDA.

   The Bhutanesefiscal year runs from July 1 to June 30. The RGoB's 2005-06 budget projectsa fiscal gap (the overall fiscal deficit
 including grants that is not financed by project-tiedloans) ofNu.780 million (about US$l8 million,or 2.1 percent o f GDP), which
 would needto be financeddomesticallyinthe absence of budget support.

quickening o f the pace o f implementation. These two operations are programmed in the current CAS
period, FY06to FY09. As the reformprogram matures and deepens, future operations could be annual and
have broader coverage. They would also buildon lessons learnt, including the usefulness o f this instrument
infacilitating development inBhutan.

4.     Under the overarching themes o f enhancing economic growth, reducing poverty and achieving the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the following four components o f the RGoB's interrelated
developmental reform strategies are beingsupportedby the DPG operation:

        1. Ensuring the maintenance o f a sound macroeconomic framework, strengthening fiscal policy,

5.     The Bhutan CAS emphasizes selectivity to maximize the development impact o f the Bank's limited
financial  and staff resources. Selectivity i s also a key feature o f the proposed DPG operation. While there
are numerous meaningful development initiatives beingundertaken by the RGoB,' the proposed operation
will focus on the four strategc areas noted above, which are considered important to the overall success o f
the program. Selectivity will also help keep the operation manageable.

6.      Section I1o f this Program Document (PD) summarizes key aspects o f development progress and
challenges in Bhutan. Section IIIreports on Bhutan's overall medium-term development reform program
and the Bank's assistance strategy of support. Section N discusses the policy and institutional reform
components supported by the proposed DPG I.Section V describes implementation o f the proposed
operation.


                   11.BHUTAN'SDEVELOPMENT:PROGRESSAND CHALLENGES


7.      Bhutan i s a small, mountain lungdom landlocked inthe eastern Himalayas between China and India.
Over the past 25 years, the people o f Bhutan have made rapid social and economic progress. Real GDP
growth averaged more than 6 percent a year over this period, and sustained growth has increased Gross
National Income (GNI) per capita to about US$720 in2004. The population was estimated to be 752,700 in
2004 (source? I s this the RGoB number?) and is widely dispersed, with 79 percent living in rural areas.6
While the cities and towns remain small, urbanizationi s accelerating, and Thimphu(the capital) i s growing
by about 10percent a year.

 8.     Structure of the economy. The economy is undergoing profound structural change. Agriculture
continues to account for about 25 percent o f GDP, and over 70 percent o f employment (including
substantial subsistence agriculture), but the sector i s lagging behind the rest o f the economy, as arable land

  For example, decentralization o f decision-making and service delivery i s a major element o f the NinthFive-Year Plan. Assistance
inthis areaisbeingprovidedbythe SNV (the NetherlandsDevelopment Organization) andthe IDA-supportedDecentralized Rural
Development Project. Improving access to infrastructure i s another major objective o f the NinthPlan. The Bank i s supporting the
expansion of rural access through the ongoing Rural Access Roads Project.

  Source 2004 Statistical Yearbook ofBhutan (2005). There i s substantial variation inthe estimates o f Bhutan's population, ranging
from the official RGoB figures to much larger estimates by UN agencies. The first national census was conducted in June 2005,
 and the results are expected to be published in April 2006. The publication o f the census will be a major step forward in
underpinning national data and strengthening future survey efforts.



                                                                 2

i s limited, and land holdings are small and fragmented, constraining the potential for farm mechanization.
Driven by the exploitation of vast hydropower potential+urrently          estimated at 30,000 megawatts-and
donor support, the economy i s modernizing rapidly. India i s the largest donor, and hydropower resources
are being developed mainly with Indian support. As a result o f public investment in hydropower and other
infrastructure, the construction sector i s growing swiftly. Private investment in housing and hotels i s also
boosting the sector. Tourist arrivals have risen sharply since 2004, increasing activity in the services sector.
Opportunities are expanding for the formal private sector, but with electricity revenues and donor financial
support flowing throughthe government, the public sector remains the primary engine o f growth inBhutan.

9.      Political developments. A process of political change is underway in Bhutan. A new constitution,
aimed at creating a democratic political system consistent with the country's vision and values, has been
prepared and was widely distributed in March, 2005. His Majesty the King and the Crown Prince are
leading a nationwide consultation process, involving public meetings, and open comment through postings
on the internet.7 The Constitutioni s to be enacted by the National Assembly in2008. According to the draft
Constitution, the Parliament o f Bhutan will include a National Council and a National Assembly. The
National Council will consist o f 20 members directly elected by the people and representing each o f the
Dzongkhags (districts), and five members nominated by the King. The National Assembly will have a
minimumo f 75 members electedby eachDzongkhagaccording to itspopulation. His Majesty the Kinghas
announced that he will step down in 2008 in favor o f the Crown h n c e , once a democratic, constitutional
monarchy i s established.

 10.    The draft Constitution articulates a vision o f good governance based on accountability o f the
government, responsible management o f state resources, independence o f Constitutional Offices, rule o f
law, and legal protection o f human rights. To help implement this vision, special meetings were convened
 at the end o f 2005 in order to review the existing governance arrangements, and develop recommendations
 for improvements. These are described in a paper titled Good Governance Plus: I n Pursuit of Gross
National Happiness, which highlights the importance o f transparency, accountability, efficiency and
professionalism. The document points to a number o f policy malung and institutional changes, such as
 integrating the preparation o f a Medium-Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF) into the budget process, and
 usingthe MTFF as the basis for a new planning approach (the Alternative Planning Framework) that seeks
 to strengthen the links between goals and resource availability. The Good Governance Plus document
 emphasizes the importance of the media, civil society, and the use o f information technologies to underpin
 strong anti-comption measures and increase the transparency and accountability o f the government.
 Finally, the document also recommends furthering decentralization by devolving more decision making
 authority to lower levels o f government.

 11. As first key steps towards implementinggovernance and institutional reforms in preparation for the
 enactment o f the Constitution in 2008, three independent constitutional bodies have been established.
 These are the Office o f the Auditor General, the Anti-Corruption Commission, and the Election
 Commission. The Heads o f these institutions are independent o f the executive and report directly to the
 National Assembly.

 1.       Poverty inBhutan

  12.    Efforts to measure and analyze poverty in Bhutan are relatively recent initiatives. The pilot
 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) o f 2000 was the first attempt to quantify poverty in
 Bhutan at the household level.8These efforts were followed by the Bhutan Living Standard Survey (BLSS)

 'Available at www.constitution.bt,where anyone can send comments.

   Inthe same year, the RGoBprepareda PovertyAssessment andAnalysis Report (PAAR) which presentedresults on poverty at
 the Dzongkhag(district) and Gewog(block) levels.

o f 2003.' While data issues make comparisons between the HIES and the BLSS difficult, these comprise
the best statistics available, and suggest that poverty has declined over time inBhutan (Table 1).

13.       The BLSS estimates suggest that the poverty headcount rate is 31.7 percent, and based on the official
population figures for 2004, there are about 238,606 poor people in the Kingdom. The poverty rate i s
comparable with neighboring counties in South and Southeast Asia (Figure 1). Poverty i s concentrated in
rural areas, which are home to 97.4 percent o f the poor in Bhutan. At the regional level, the East is the
poorest part o f Bhutan (Figure 1).

2.         Attainingthe MillenniumDevelopmentGoalsfor Poverty ReductionandHumanDevelopment

 14. Notwithstanding data limitations," available information suggests that Bhutan is likely to achieve
most o f its MDGs by 2015 (see Table 2). In fact, it has already attained two o f the MDGs-reducing                                  the


  The BLSS was a nationwide survey o f households undertaken by the National Statistical Bureau, using the Living Standards
Measurement Study (LSMS) methodology developed by the World Bank.

 lo rigorous analysisof MDGs inBhutan is constrainedbyalack ofdata. Inorder to assessprogresstowards the MDGs, it is
   A
important to have time-series data on relevant indicators. The MDG analysis reported here i s based on piecing together available
data through linear trend analysis. Officially, the MDGs are set interms o f targets for 2015 relative to the attainment levels o f 1990.
In order to get the 1990value o f an indicator for Bhutan, linear extrapolation is used from actual available data. The 2015 target is
then estimated from the extrapolated figure for 1990. This is compared with the predicted value of the indicator for 2015 from its
actual linear trend. Thus, the actual path i s compared to the MDG target path to judge whether Bhutan is on track to achieve an

  number o f underweight children under-five years of age and improving access to safe water. For universal
  primary enrollment and reducing the incidence o f malaria, the Kingdom i s marginally o f f track, but the
  deviation from the target path i s small and achievement remains possible. Bhutan seems largely off-track
  only for gender equity intertiary education enrollment and births attended by slulled personnel.

      Nofes: The likelihood of attaining MDGs is based on linear projections from available time series data (National Health Survey for health
      indicators, Education MIS for the education indicators). For poverty, trends are calculated from HIES and BLSS data, 1990 data are
      extrapolated from linear trends. The data for 2015 are targets as related to the 1990s extrapolated values. Data are as presented on the

above the predicted actual value for 2015-indicating                       that the Kingdom i s on track to reduce the IMR and
C M R by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015 (Figure 2). On the other hand, for access to reproductive health
services, Bhutan appears off-track in its goal o f providing skilled attendants to all births by 2015-as                              the

16.     Some specific policy challenges are identified based on the linear trend analysis. First, special
efforts are needed to enroll and retain all children in school. Reaching out-of-school children i s a major
challenge, since they belong to families who need the children's financial contribution inthe form o f work,
andor who live in remote, isolated communities. Second, in order to meet its Maternal Mortality Rate
(MMR) reduction objectives, the RGoB needs to make major efforts to expand access to Emergency
Obstetric Care (EOC) services, reduce maternal anemia (largely due to iron deficiency - which was as high
as 88.2 percent in 2001), and increase the share o f deliveries attended by skilled personnel. Third, even
though gender disparity inthe country i s low in general, and there are only small differences inpoverty and
human development outcomes by gender, it i s clearly important to have specific measures to encourage
women's participation inhigher education. It should be noted that geography greatly increases the unit cost
o f providing adequate public services, especially in initiatives like expanding access to schooling or EOC
services invery remote and sparsely populatedareas.

3.         MacroeconomicDevelopments and Outlook

17.     Over the past two decades, Bhutan's economic performance has been strong as indicated by low
inflation, manageable fiscal deficits, high reserves, and solid growth. As noted above, growth averaging
more than 6 percent over the past 25 years has been underpinned by sound macroeconomic management,
the exploitation of hydropower resources, and strong donor support. The free trade regime with India and
the policy o f maintaining the Ngultrumexchange rate pegged to the Indian Rupee have been instrumental
inmaintainingthis solidmacroeconomic performance.

18.    In2004-05, growthis likely to have decelerated to around6 percent, mainly due to a slowdowninthe
construction sector with the winding down o f the Tala Hydropower Project (Table 3). Although agriculture
continues to employ over 70 percent o f the labor force, its share o f GDP i s in secular decline, falling from
52 percent in 1980 to about 25 percent at present. Following several years o f stagnation in the number o f
tourist amvals after the 9/11 terrorist attacks inthe United States, tourism boomed in2004-05, with arrivals
and revenues from related activities growing by over 65 percent compared with the previous year. The
sector continues to account for less than 2 percent o f GDP, however, though it holds muchpotential. On the
expenditure side, the public sector remains a key driver o f growth. Large revenues from external donor
assistance and hydropower sales to India flow through the government, and public investment (like in
hydropower projects) and spending on the provision o f public services plays a central role in ensuring the
continued buoyancy o f the economy. Spending by state owned enterprises also accounts for a significant
portion o f GDP (roughly 14percent in2004-05).

 19.   The external sector has exhibited substantial current account deficits inrecent years. In2004-05 two
new Airbus passenger jets were acquired, raising the current account deficit sharply to about 25 percent o f
 GDP. Over 90 percent o f Bhutan's trade i s with India. Receipts from abroad are dominated by revenues

                                                                       7

from hydropower exports to India, grants (both project tied and program) from India, and grants from other
development partners. Tourism i s the largest earner o f hard currency.

20.  While the RGoB aims to limit the overall fiscal deficit, including grants to 4-5 percent o f GDP, the
small scale o f Bhutan means that one or two items can have a major impact, and volatility remains a major
concern. For example, a delay in the program grant caused a large deficit in 2002-03, followed by a sharp
improvement in2003-04 (Table 4). The purchase o f the Airbuses led to an overall deficit o f 12.5 percent of
GDP in 2004-05, after significant fiscal retrenchment. In the 2005-06 budget, the RGoB has projected
revenues based on Tala coming on-stream in mid 2006, and two years' o f excise duty refunds from India.
A delay in Tala o f only a couple of months, or realizing only one year's worth o f excise duty refunds,
would bring a substantial change in the fiscal picture, in excess o f 10-15 percent o f total revenue. Hence,
managing volatility continues to be an important challenge for the RGoB. Persistent deficits and the 40
percent debt portion of the massive investment inthe Tala Hydropower Project have led to a sharp increase
indebt stocks, from the equivalent of about 40 percent of GDP in2000 to over 90 percent o f GDP in2004-
05.

21.    With continuedgood macroeconomic management, hydropower development, and donor support, the
economic prospects in Bhutan are bright. Muchwill depend on the timing and net impact o f Tala coming
on stream. Electricity generation from Tala i s expected to begin in July 2006. When the plant is fully
operational, it will raise electricity generation by 230 percent and lead to a 28 percent jump in GDP in
2006/07 (similar to the rise experienced when the previous major hydroelectric power plant, Chukha, was
commissioned in 1988)."

22.    It i s worth noting that hydropower does not directly generate manyjobs, and total employment inthe
sector, including Tala, i s likely to remain below 4,000, less than 2 percent o f the estimated labor force,
when the sector will account for about 25 percent o f GDP. Generating adequate employment opportunities
for growing cohorts o f school leavers, as well as those moving out o f agricultural activities as part o f an
accelerating trend towards urbanization, i s a major challenge. Manufacturing appears to be growing slowly,
constrained by the absence o f scale economies and other hindrances like access to suitable land. Tourism
holds much potential for broad based service employment, but remains a relatively small share o f the
economy, and highly seasonal. Hence, public sector spending i s likely to continue to drive employment and
growth, through investments in infrastructure and the like, boosting construction activity, and expenditure
on the provision o f public services, such as education and health. Indeed, the RGoB i s loolung to Tala
revenues to help meet its rising recurrent costs associated with the expansion in access to schooling and
health care.

23.    Highexpectations surround the commissioning o f the Tala hydropower plant and domestic revenue
and grants are likely to increase by over 33 percent in 2006-07 compared to the previous year (Table 5).
Still, the overall resource envelope may increase by much less, as large repayments will begin with the
commissioning o f Tala, and the Government o f India may reduce its program grants to Bhutan. Inaddition,
other donors also plan to reduce or cease operations in Bhutan concomitantly, either for logistical reasons,
or because o f the highexpectations associated with Tala. This was also discussed at the recently concluded
NinthRoundTable MeetinginGeneva, where itwas felt that further support was neededto help the RGoB
meet emerging development challenges (such as political and institutional reforms). Given these
circumstances, expenditure growth will need to be moderate in the coming years (especially current
expenditure, which i s not financed by project-tied loans) in order to limit the extent o f domestic borrowing
(Table 5). Part o f the impetus for the DPG stemmed fiom the anticipated financing needs for 2005-06 and
2007-08, as described inthe MTFFlaid out inthe Table 4.

24.   Bhutan's debt burden indicators are expected to remain high over the short term; however, they are
set to decline sharply after the Tala hydroelectric project comes on stream and are likely to remain within
manageable levels thereafter. The commissioning o f Tala will, however, initiate the servicing o f Tala-
related debt. This is expected to raise Bhutan's debt servicing obligations. It should be noted that debt
service obligations have beenrisingmore slowly than debt, since much o fit i s highly concessional."

25.    Overall, the macroeconomic framework i s adequate. It is worth noting that the RGoB has taken
several initiatives to strengthen capacity for macroeconomic monitoring and analysis, to help underpin
policy formulation and possible corrections, should they be needed. These include strengthening, refining
and integrating the MTFF into the budget formulation process (as a first step towards its goal o f
implementing multi-year rolling budgets), and building debt management capacity with new software and
training that will enable the RGoB to monitor debt more closely. Indeed, these elements are to be supported
bythe DPG, as described ingreater detailbelow.


               111.REFORMAGENDA OFTHE ROYAL GOVERNMENT OF BHUTAN
                                         AND SUPPORT FROMTHE BANK


1.       DevelopmentVision andPoverty ReductionStrategy

26.    Bhutan's development has been directed by its own distinctive approach, which has attracted strong
support from external donors. This approach rests on the overarching notion o f Gross National Happiness,
propounded by H i s Majesty the King in the early 1970s, and emphasizing the importance o f balancing
material, spiritual, emotional and cultural wellbeing as elements that together bringuhappiness to the
individual. More recently, these aspirations were articulated in the document Bhutan 2020: A Vision f i r
Peace, Prosperity and Happiness, prepared in 1999 through a highly consultative process involving
representatives from the RGoB, the private sector, non-governmental organizations and communities. It
seeks to translate the notion o f GNH into a series o f national objectives emphasizing: (a) human
development, (b) cultural heritage, (c) equitable development, (d) good governance, and (e) environmental
conservation. In the same vein as the MDGs, Bhutan 2020 establishes long-term objectives, including
providing electricity to 50 percent of the rural population, and ensuring that 75 percent o f the rural
populationlive within half a day's walk from the nearest "motorable" roadby 2012.

27.    The Ninth Five-Year Plan (2002-03 to 2006-07) outlines more detailed targets and strategies, and
was prepared following a consultative process that pulled together 201 Gewog (block) plans, 20 Dzongkhag
(district) plans, and numerous sectoral plans. As noted above, the Ninth Five-Year Plan has five overall
goals: (i) improving quality of life and income, especially for the poor, (ii)         ensuring good governance, (iii)
promoting private sector growth and employment generation, (iv) preserving and promoting cultural
heritage and the environment, (v) achieving rapid economic growth and transformation. The strategies for
achievingthese goals are:

0    Infrastructure Expansion: The NinthPlan gives a high priority to improving infrastructure, including
     roads, electricity, and telecommunications to help address the key issue o f access, especially in rural
     areas.

 0   Sound Macro-economic Policy: With a view to providing the macroeconomic underpinnings for
     continued and steady economic growth, the Plan sets several targets, such as meeting recurrent
     expenditures with domestic revenues, limiting inflation to around 7-8 percent per annum, and
     maintaining an adequate level o f international foreign exchange reserves.


 12The next annualjoint World Bank-IMF DSA will bepreparedsometime in the first half o f 2007.


                                                         10

    Ensuring Good Governance: Good governance through increased decentralization is a key part o f the
     development strategy, and the Dzongkhag and Gewog elected councils have substantial autonomy to
    make plans, allocate resources, and frame rules and regulations applicable within their respective
    jurisdictions.

    Improving Access and Enhancing Social Services: Access i s the defining development issue in
     Bhutan, and the NinthPlan aims to improve access for rural populations to opportunities and services.
     Hence, rural development i s being promoted with the expansion o f roads, the improvement o f market
     access, and the creation o f opportunities in agro-business, horticulture, and small-scale handicraft
     industries. Improvedaccess to key public services i s also a highpriority. Ineducation, the government
     i s constructing community primary schools, revising curricula, continuing adult literacy programs, and
     establishing the Royal University of Bhutan. Similarly, in health, the RGoB is workmg to increase
     access to doctors, control the spread o f STDIHIVIAIDS, and ensure the financial sustainability o f
     health services.

28.     Inaddition to the overall development program outlined above, the RGoB has embarked on a series
of related reform initiatives over the past few years. For example, the RGoB seeks to implement Multi-
Year Rolling Budgets (MYRB) to strengthen links between annual budgets and the Five-Year Plans. There
i s an effort to foster private sector development through new legislation on labor and foreign direct
investment. As described in greater detail below, the DPG supports these elements o f the Government's
reform program, and helps draw them together inan integrated manner.

2.        World BankGroup Assistance Strategy (FY06 09)    -

29.     The FY06-09 CAS is closely aligned with the Ninth Five-Year PlanRRSP. It was prepared in
consultation with various levels o f government, the private sector, development partners, and other
stakeholders. As described above, the CAS emphasizes selectivity, and envisages Bank Group support for
development in Bhutan based on three pillars: (i)expanding access to better infrastructure and quality
social services, as well as connecting communities to markets; (ii)   promoting private sector development
and employment; and (iii)   strengthening the management o f public resources, as well as the monitoring and
evaluation o f development outcomes. The CAS also aims to help underpin several o f the cross-cutting
elements o f the RGoB's development program, including promoting effective decentralization, good
governance, and sound environmental management.

30. Followingfrom these CAS pillars insupport o f the RGoB's NinthFive-Year PlanPRSP, the FY06-09
CAS proposes financial assistance inthe form o f two development policy operations. As noted above, with
a deepening o f the reform initiative, future operations could be annual and be designed on the basis o f
lessons learnt. These budget operations will be a central part o f the Bank's strategy to help the RGoB in
implementing its poverty reduction strategy and in achieving other development goals.

Bank Activities and Collaboration with Other Development Partners

31.      The Bank's support to the various proposed sectors/themes through the CAS builds on the ongoing
engagement both in terms of projects, as well as analytical and advisory services. There has been a
deepening engagement on macroeconomic, fiscal and financial management issues, which i s to be further
assisted through CAS pillar 3 and DPG item 1. The Bank and other development partners (including the
UNDP) have been providing technical assistance to help the RGoB develop capacity for monitoring
macroeconomic indicators, preparing an MTFF, and moving forward with their goal o f implementing
MYRB.To support these importantpublic expenditure management initiatives, an IDFgrant was approved
 at the end o f 2004-05. Similarly, in the financial management area, an existing IDF i s supporting (i)  the
 drafting o f the Public Finance Act; (ii)the establishment o f a training and certification program to build
.capacity for finance, accounting, internal audit, and management staff in the National Finance Service; and


                                                       11

(iii)buildingcapacity inthe Department of Budget and Accounts to implement budget reforms, as well as
inthe Royal Institute of Management to improve training. This technical assistance programwas designed
on the basis o f the Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) that was done in February 2002.
Bhutan's development partners, including the Bank, are working together to help promote harmonization
around the country's national fiduciary and safeguard systems. The Bank's ongoing fiduciary work i s
seeking to compare national and international public sector accounting and auditing standards.

32.    The Bank has sought to help the RGoB foster the nascent formal private sector, which i s to be further
supported under CAS pillar 2 and DPG component 2. Technical assistance has been provided inkey areas
such as the development o f legislationfor foreign direct investment (FDI), promotion o f small and medium
enterprises (SMEs), and capacity building in the Bhutan Chamber o f Commerce and Industry (BCCI).
Analytical support has been provided through the Private Sector Suwey (2002) mentioned above, and the
Doing Business Report (2005). Building on the private sector survey work, the Bank Group, in
collaboration with the Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS), i s providing crosscutting support to
help improve the country's overall business environment. The IFC approved a $10 million investment in
the tourism sector in2004.

33.    Improving access to public services, especially education and more recentlyhealth, has been a central
plank o f Bank financial assistance. The ongoing Education Development Project ( E D P t a $31 million
IDA credit-supports    Bhutan's five-year education development program to expand access to primary and
secondary education, and improve education quality at all levels. The RGoB has coordinated the EDP's
inputs with those of other donors, including Canada's support for curriculum reform for English at all
levels of schooling, UNICEF's assistance with the establishment o f resource centers, and DANJDA's
budget support to the Ministry o f Education. The HIV/AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI)
Prevention and Control Project (IDA Grant H1030) was approved in June 2004 to help the RGoB make
progress in this vital area. While the project's main focus i s on prevention, it also provides support for
treatment and activities designed to strengthen Bhutan's ability to control HIV and STI. DANIDA,
UNICEF and WHO are other development partners who are providing technical support on a number of
related activities. Improving access to education and health are to be supported under CAS pillar 1 and
throughDPGcomponents 3 and 4.

34.    Several background notedpapers have been prepared by the Bank`s team in developing this
operation. The papers are on (a) poverty and MDGs; (b) private sector development and employment
generation; (c) medium-term macro/fiscal issues; (d) financial management; (e) education; and (0 health
issues.


                   IV. THE PROPOSEDFIRSTDEVELOPMENT POLICY GRANT


 35. The proposed DPG Ii s the first in a series o f two planned budget operations over the current CAS
period FY06-FY09, and supports four components o f the RGoB's interrelated developmental reform
 strategies. The associated policy program matrix, which outlines specific actions and benchmarks for these
 components, i s appended to this ProgramDocument. The reform components supported by the DPGare:

        1. Ensuring the maintenance o f a sound macroeconomic framework, strengthening fiscal policy,
            and bolsteringfinancial management and accountability;

        2. Enhancing the investment climate for private sector growth and employment generation;

        3. Augmenting the quality o f and access to education; and

        4. Improvinghealth care.

                                                      12

36. Specific government actions supported by the proposed DPG are described in Box 1(see below) and
are also reported at the end of each-sub-section. The Bank's program has two types of actions: (i)                                        up-front
or prior actions that are to be completed before the proposed DPG will be presented to the Bank's
Executive Board; and (ii)triggers which are indicative for a second DPG/DPC and would need to be
largely met before it could go forward. The RGoB has met all o f the up-front actions.

37. Several o fthese up-front actions and triggers are process oriented, but this i s appropriate inthe context
o f Bhutan because: (i)            some o f these processes relate to specific policy or institutional changes that are
desirable, and (ii)these actions and triggers are both meaningful and feasible, given the capacity
constraints. For example, while the successful implementation o f a new law i s a desirable outcome, the
interim process could be long, technically-demanding and politically-sensitive, requiring strong support for
the process. Inaddition, low technical capacity and skill shortage i s a significant factor impeding Bhutan's
overall development progress, and the design o fthe proposed actions i s mindfulof these limitations.

1.       Ensuring the Maintenance of a Sound Macroeconomic Framework, Strengthening Fiscal
Policy, and Bolstering FinancialManagement and Accountability

(0 Institutional Changesin Macroeconomic and FiscalManagement

38. As described earlier, Bhutan's strong economic performance over the past two decades i s in good
measure attributable to the RGoB's sound macroeconomic and fiscal management. Still, the RGoB aims to
improve its monitoring o f macroeconomic indicators, including debt, and has undertaken specific initiatives
to strengthen the budget preparation process. Buildingon a deepening dialogue between the RGoB and the
Bank, along with other development partners, these areas are to be supported under the proposed DPG:



                                                                         14

    (a) Strengthening the macroeconomic framework. A Macroeconomic Framework Coordination
        Committee (MFCC) and a Macroeconomic Framework Coordination Technical Committee were
        established by the RGoB at the end o f 2005, to facilitate the regular preparation o f reliable and
        systematically compiled macroeconomic and fiscal projections. This initiative arises from the
        RGoB's efforts to monitor macroeconomic and fiscal developments more closely, and will play an
        important role in helping the RGoB implement MYRB. Careful monitoring and possible policy
        changes to address emerging issues i s especially important in the Bhutanese context, where a
        small number o f factors can have a dramatic effect on the overall macroeconomic and fiscal
        situation. An importantpart o f the MFCC's work will lie indisseminating its findings.

    (b) Improvingdebt management systems.The RGoB has acquired new debt management software
        and i s currently training staff inthe use o f this tool to improve debt monitoring and to carry-out its
        own debt sustainability analyses in future (covering both external and domestic debt). Given the
        rapid buildup o f debt in recent years (due to the Tala hydropower project as well as other deficit
        spending), careful monitoring and management o f debt i s a highpriority.

    (c) Bolstering the budget preparation and implementation process. As a part o f its effort to
        strengthen public expenditure management, the RGoB revisedthe Budget Manual in 2001, calling
        for the preparation o f MYRBs.Among other goals, the MYRB initiative aims to link the five-year
        plans more closely to the annual budget process. However, the RGoB has yet to implement
        MYRBs, mainly due to capacity constraints and uncertainty surrounding the extent to which the
        existing budget system would need to be altered. As a first step toward instituting MYRBs, the
        MFCC prepared an MTFF (see Table 4 above), and used it as the basis for the 2006-07 budget
        calls that were issued at the end o f 2005. The MTFF was endorsed by the Committee o f the
        Council o f Ministers (CoM) inJanuary 2006 (thereby meeting an up-front action o f the DPG), and
        i s to underpin the `Alternative Planning Framework' (APF) that was proposed by the Good
        Governance Plus taskforce. Following some further refinements, the RGoB plans to share the
        MTFF more widely and integrate it into the budget preparation process to help set the overall
        resource envelope. A workshop was held by the Department o f Budget and Accounts o f the
        Ministry of Finance in January 2006 to review how the MTFF envelope could be best used to
        develop sectoral expenditure envelopes and move to MYRB through: (i)the existing budget
         system, (ii)the APF, (iii) revised framework being developed by the Planning Commission,
                                     the
        and (iv) the structure described by the Ministry of Health. The approaches were congruent, but
         some effort i s neededto resolve coordinationissues, and develop a template for the line ministries.
        The MTFF will be instrumental in implementing MYRB, which is to be piloted in at least one
         sector in advance o f the second planned DPG operation and following the preparation o f
         guidelines.

Prior action for the DPG:

(Iof 7)      The RGoB's MTFF will speciJL target ranges for key fiscal indicators, including overall
            balance, the resource gap and debt, based on and consistent with a sound macroeconomic
            framework. It will be submitted to the CoM in January 2006 and the CoM's endorsement of the
            MTFF will be sought as a basisfor thepreparation of the 2006-07 budget.

Triager for a future DPGIDPC:

(Iof 7)      The MTFF is circulated as a part of the annual budget preparation process starting in 2007-
             08, and annual budget numbers (expenditure, revenue, deficits and debt) are developed in
            accordance with MTFF targets. This will also involve implementing the strengthened debt
            managementsystem.




                                                        15

39. As noted above, the prior action relating to the preparation o f a sound and credible MTFF, and its
endorsement by the C o M was completed in January 2006, and i s an essential part o f the RGoB's effort to
strengthen fiscal policy, build closer linksbetween sectoral goals and budgets, and foster transparency. The
endorsement o f the MTFF from the C o M signals that the MTFF process enjoys sufficient support from
across the government, beyond the Ministry o f Finance. The trigger for a possible second operation, hinges
on the actual integration o f the MTFF and the budget preparation process, and will provide a clear
indication that the RGoB is making good progress towards its goal o f implementing multi-year rolling
budgets. Progress inthis area will assist the RGoB inmanaging spending expectations for improvedbudget
discipline, as well as anticipate variations inbudget outcomes and take early corrective measures as needed.
Itwill thereby also improve fiscal marksmanship, andbe useful inhelpingthe RGoB to manage volatility, a
continuing challenge for the authorities.

(io Financia1Management and Accountability

40. While the RGoB's existing public financial management and accountability system lacks legal
underpinnings, it has been functioning satisfactorily. Following the Country Financial Accountability
Assessment in 2003, a series o f technical assistance activities have been undertaken, supported by several
Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grants. Ongoing work notes the following strengths o f the existing
financial management system inBhutan:

     0   The existence of detailed guidelines for the budgeting and monitoring o f public funds, especially
         at the individual transaction level. The system provides good procedural transaction control over
         individual items o f expenditure and receipts. All donor funds for development activities (except
         Tala) are included inthe budget.

     0   The independence from the Executive o f the external auditor, the Royal Audit Authority, i s well
         established and recognized. Audits are regularly carried out and the Annual Audit Report o f the
         RGoB i s issued on a consistent basis (usually about 13 to 15 months after the end o f the year).
         Annual reports are submitted to His Majesty the King and the National Assembly, and made
         publicly available.

     0    The ongoing computerization o f all major payment, accounting and payroll-related functions,
         when fully integrated and networked, will help to significantly improve the quality, timeliness and
         reliability o f accounting and financial information.

 41. The RGoB recognizes that more needs to be done to strengthen and modernize its public financial
 management and accountability (PFMA) system. The following key components of the RGoB's on-going
 PFMAreforminitiative havebeen includedinthe DPGprogram:

      (a) Establishing the legal underpinnings of the PFMA system. The RGoB has drafted a Public
          Finance Act which will: (a) establish lines o f responsibility for the use o f public financial
          resources and provide a legal basis for the RGoB's financial rules; (b) provide a framework for
          scrutiny by the National Assembly o f the RGoB's management o f public assets and liabilities,
          including expenditure and revenue proposals; (c) encourage sound fiscal policy by specifying rules
          for fiscal sustainability and transparency; (d) establish financial management incentives to
          encourage the effective and efficient use o f financial resources in the ministries and agencies; (e)
          specify the minimal financial reporting obligations o f the RGoB's budgetary bodies and public
          enterprises; and (f) safeguard public assets by providing statutory authority and control for raising
          loans, issuing securities, giving guarantees, operating bank accounts, and investing funds.
          Submittingthe draft to the C o M i s an up-front action for DPG-Iand was met inearly 2006.

      (b) Separating thefunctions of the Department of Budget and Accounts. The existingjoint budget
          and accounting functions carried out by the Department o f Budget and Accounts (DBA) are


                                                       16

         overwhelming. At present, the DBA's budget functions (including notification, review o f
        proposals, and eventual preparation) crowd out its accounting and treasury functions. As a result,
         insufficient attention i s being paid to accounting work, which leads to major delays in the
        preparation of financial statements. The RGoB has segregated these key functions into two
         separate departments by Government Order. The next steps will be to re-assign staff and ensure
         that the roles and responsibilities o f key staff are clarified. This change will assist in bringing
         efficiency and timeliness to the accounting and reporting functions.

     (c) Improving the Management Information System: The adoption o f the budgeting and accounting
         system (BAS) in the line ministries/agencies and the central budgeting and accounting system in
         the DBA has brought about significant improvements inthe financial management system over the
         past several years. Still, inthe absence o f adequate networlung facilities, the process o f compiling
         and preparing consolidated financial statements i s time consuming. Another important
         responsibility of the DBA i s to release funds to spending agencies on a timely basis. At present,
         funds are releasedthrough a manualLetter o fCredit systemwith intimation to the respectivebank.
         In order to expedite the release of fbnds, the DBA is proposing to develop a system using
         electronic transfers. Planned institutional changes include: (a) malung the electronic transfer o f
         fund releases operational in all spending agencies inThimphuby January 2006, and (b) piloting
         the networlung o f the BAS between the DBA and three selected spending agencies inThimphuby
         June 2006.

     (d) Strengthening legislative oversight of public Jinances. Deriving its mandate from a Royal
         Decree, the Royal Audit Authority (RAA) ascertains and evaluates whether government resources
         are handled in accordance with the established rules and regulations, and assesses whether public
          agencies within its audit jurisdiction, achieve the purposes for which they were established and for
         which resources have been made available. The Royal Decree provides a broad scope and a wide
          coverage for the audit function, and ensures that the RAA i s fully independent. The institutional
          change proposed by the RGoB i s to bringthis within the legal framework o f an Audit Act. A draft
          act has been prepared and i s to be submitted to the National Assembly in the upcoming spring
          session. In addition, the RAA has set up a separate division to actively track and monitor
          responses by public spending unitso f audit observations until settlement/adjustment.

          The role o f the Legislature in scrutinizing the external audit reports i s still emerging. The draft
          Constitution provides for the setting up o f a five member Public Accounts Committee to review
          and report on the Annual Audit Report to the Parliament. Inthe interim, in accordance with the
          National Assembly Committees Act, 2004, a Public Accounts Committee has been set up and
          Rules o f Procedures o f the Public Accounts Committee drafted.

Prior actions for theDPG:

(2 of 7)       The draft Public FinanceAct is submitted to the CoM.

Triggers for a future DPG/DPC:

(2 of 7)       In-year budget reports and annualfinancial statementsprepared on a timely basis.

42. Overall, the RGoB i s malung good progress towards strengthening financial management, and the
Public Finance Act was submitted to the C o M in February 2006, meeting this up-front action for DPG-I.
The enactment o f the Public Finance Act will provide the much needed legal underpinning for the
Bhutanese financial management and accountability system. Clearly specifying rules and regulations,
including lines o f authority and responsibility, will facilitate the timely preparation o f in-year budget
reports and annual financial statements.

2.     Enhancingthe Investment Climate for PrivateSector Growth andEmployment Generation

43. As noted above, the Bhutanese economy i s dominated by the public sector, with the nascent formal
private sector continuing to be weak and small. Productivity i s low and the cost o f doing business i s high,
mainly due to high transport costs, inadequate infrastructure, lack o f economies o f scale stemming from
small market size, and slull shortages. The challenging geography i s an important determinant of these
factors, compounded by a weak regulatory environment for domestic and foreign investment, rigid labor
markets, and difficulties in accessing finance. Overcoming the constraints to private sector development
will be important to sustaining robust growth and generating adequate employment. The tourism sector i s
growing rapidly and holds much potential, and could help absorb an increasing number o f Bhutanese job
seeker~.'~Invigorating growth inmanufacturing, particularly in ago-processing and forest-based industries
also has the potential to provide good payingjobs. Inthe near term, however, public spending on services,
and investment in hydropower development and other areas, like roads, will remain the main drivers o f
economic growth.

(i) Private Sector in Bhutan: Composition, Growth and Employment

44. The bulk o f the formal private sector in Bhutani s small-scale, with nearly 98 percent o f all licensed
entities being cottage and small enterprise^.'^ Most o f these enterprises are sole proprietorshipswith limited
scope for growth due to both demand and supply side constraints. The medium and large enterprises-
including agro processing units, cement, ferro silicon, calcium carbide, distilleries-account                      for the major
share o fprivate sector's businessturnover and revenues.

45. There has been a rapid expansion in the number o f licensed private enterprises in recent years (see
Table 6)." By 2003, there were 32,035 commercial and industrial establishments-an                                almost threefold
increase since 1998. Of these establishments, the majority are in trade (55 percent) and construction (28
percent), followed by services (14 percent), and trailed by manufacturing (just over 2 percent).

        m:Departmentofhdustry,    Ministry of Tradeand Industry,2004




l3 According to a recent projection by the Ministry o f Labor, done in connection with the Tenth Five-Year Plan preparation, there
will be a minimumo f 56,850 job seekers at the end o f 2012, out o f which only about 36,200 are likely to find employment in the
formal private sector. (Source: Kuensel, Vol. XX, No. 72, October 5,2005.)
14 The size o f establishment i s determined by capital input: cottage enterprises have a capital base o f Nu. 0.5 million (about
US$l0,500) or less, small enterprises have a capital base between Nu. 0.5 and 5 million (between about US$10,500 and
US$105,000), medium enterprises have a capital base o f between Nu. 5 and 20 million (between about US$105,000 and US
US$420,000), and large enterprises have a capital base greater than Nu. 20 million (about US$420,000). The cottage and small
firms are largely comprised o f small family-run businesses such as restaurants, tea stalls, and rice mills.
15 In view of limited data, the number of business licenses issued for private sector business is the best available indicator for
measuring private sector growth.


                                                                     18

46. While hydropower has been and will remain the major source o f economic growth in Bhutan, it does
not provide much employment directly, and the whole sector probably employs less than 4,000 people, as
noted above. Hydropower and infrastructure projects, nonetheless, have led to a boom in labor intensive
construction activities, providing substantial employment opportunities. Employment o f Bhutanese
nationals inthe construction industry has grown from 5,592 in2001 to 7,770 in2003.16 As noted above, the
agnculture sector i s mainly subsistence and employs over 60 percent o f the labor force, but its share in
GDPhas fallen from over 50 percent in 1980to about a quarter now (see Table 7).

47. Since 1991, tourism i s wholly run by the private sector. While it accounts for less than 2 percent o f
GDP, it i s the single largest foreign exchange earner.'' It also has good potential for further employment
generation. While there are important limitations in the employment data, estimates o f direct employment
suggest that the number ofjobs has tripled from less than 1,000 in 1998 to over 5,000 currently. Inaddition,
the sector provides seasonal employment for many workers inboth urban and rural communities, as well as
helpinggenerate income inthe handicraft and transport industries. The tourism industry is thus among the
largest employers in the formal private sector. Given that the full potential o f the industry has yet to be
realized, prospects are good that the sector will enhance broad-based employment over the medium-term,
especially among Bhutanese youths.

(io Private Sector DevelopmentReforms

48. One o f the four key objectives of the Ninth Five-Year Plan i s to promote private sector growth and
employment generation. Indeed, the RGoB's ongoing reform initiative in this area i s impressive in its
breadth and           depth      of coverage.      Expanding infrastructure,         including roads,    electricity   and
telecommunications, i s a key part of the strategy. The RGoB i s also developing several industrial estates
with reliable, affordable power, and is planningto builda dry port to facilitate trade. Neighboring India has
 agreed to explore the potential o f extending railway links to the Bhutanese border. Related policy reforms
 are also underway. Inthe last couple o f years, a foreign direct investment policy was approved, the import
tariff structure was simplified, the sales tax and customs duty on a wide range o f domestic and commercial
 goods were abolished, a business facilitation cell was opened as part o f the South Asia Sub-regional

Economic Cooperation initiative, and new prudential regulations have been implemented towards
strengthening the financial system.

49. During the Ninth Plan period (ending in 2006-07), the RGoB hopes to increase tourist arrivals to
15,000 without compromising the country's vision o f balanced growth, and cultural and environmental
preservation. International access to Bhutan i s constrained by the fact that there i s only one airport in the
country, which i s limited to visual approach landings. Recently, Druk Air, a public company and the only
carrier flying to Bhutan, purchased two new aircraft, thereby increasing passenger capacity by 42 percent
over the existing aircraft, as well as boosting cargo capacity that should help the nascent export sector.
Efforts directed at expanding air services, upgrading the quality o f hotel accommodations and services,
diversifying and expanding tour programs and activities, and implementing more active and creative
tourism marketing campaigns, are underway. With Austrian assistance, a Tourism Master Plan has been
formulated to guide on-going efforts to scale up and attract the high-value segment o f the market. The
RGoB also considers the ICT sector an important potential source o f direct and indirect employment. The
sector holds promise for improving productivity and increasing competitiveness in existing private sector
industries. Agri-processing i s another potential source o f growth in Bhutan, and has been identified as a
priority export sector.

50. The Bank Group has been helping Bhutan in promoting private sector growth and in addressing
concerns about growing unemployment. As noted earlier, analytical support has been provided through a
Private Sector Suwey (2002) and the Doing Business Report (2005). The RGoB has subsequently
developed a rich agenda o f policy and institutional reforms, covering labor market issues, s h l l shortages,
regulations for facilitating domestic and foreign investment, and access to finance. The Foreign Investment
Advisory Service (FIAS) has provided technical assistance inthe development o f the regulatory fi-amework
for foreign direct investment (FDI).The South Asia Enterprise Development Facility (SEDF) has sought to
play a catalytic role in the promotion o f small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and in the building o f
capacity in the Bhutan Chamber o f Commerce and Industry (BCCI) as well as in financial sector
institutions. The pace o f reform i s slow due to limited capacity and the time needed for institution building,
but positive results are expected from ongoing policy initiatives as implementation gathers momentum.l8
The following three key components o f the RGoB's PSD reform activities have been included inthe DPG
program:

      (a) Improvingthe functioning of labor markets through the development of flexible labor and
           employment laws. As noted above, weaknesses in the functioning o f the labor market are key
           constraints for private sector growth and employment generation. According to the Doing
           Business indicators, Bhutan currently has the least flexible labor market inthe South Asia region:
           on the rigidity o f employment index, which captures the rigidity o f working hours as well as the
           difficulties and costs associated with hiringand firing workers, Bhutan's score i s 49, compared to
           a regional average o f 42. With the exception o f some rudimentary regulation, there i s no
           legislation or policy framework governing labor markets in the c o ~ n t r y ' ~Inflexibility can be
                                                                                                           .
           partially explained by the segmented nature o f the labor market: o ftotal formal wage employment,
           it is estimated that non-nationals represent approximately 50 percent. Stringent restrictions exist
           on the recruitment o f foreign workers; and when permitted, entail time-consuming procedures.
           Employment o f nationals falls under the draft Rules and Regulations on Employment of Bhutanese




l8 Given the recent and nascent nature of private sector activities in Bhutan, the country i s starting from a narrow base in the
development ofkey policies, laws, rules and regulations, along with accompanying institutions.

l9 These include: (i)Chatrim for Wage Rate, Recruitment Agencies and Workmen's Compensation, 1994, and (ii) Rules and
                                                                                                                  draft
Regulations on Employment of Bhutanese Nationals in the Private Sector, December 1997. The latter are still under review and
hence, they are not yet enforceable.

                                                               20

          Nationals in the Private Sector (1997).*' Inpractice, these rules are not well-enforced and firms
          report some flexibility in hiring and firing employees, and setting wages without any influence o f
          organized labor.21 The minimum wage applies only to Bhutanese public sector workers, with
           limited impact on the private sector.22
          To address these issues, the RGoB i s developing a comprehensive labor policy, along with
           legislation and accompanying rules and regulations, inorder to streamline processes and help ease
           employment constraints. A central reform measure in this area i s the drafting o f a Labor and
          Employment Act to balance the legitimate needs o f workers with the promotion o f private sector
           activity. Key provisions o f the draft Act that may help alleviate Bhutan's skdl shortages and low
          productivity pertain to employee working hours, restrictions on night work, proscription o f
           activities for 15-18-year olds-the             group most affected by stringent labor institutions, and
           employment o f foreign workers. Once effective, this Act will: (i)                  allow employment in a wide
           spectrum of economic activities (particularly for youths), (ii)              provide for flexible workmg hours,
           (iii) nightworkinindustriesrequiringanaround-the-clock-work schedule, and(iv)make
                permit
           rules less restrictive on the hirindfiring o f foreigners workers. The Bank's support would
           complement the Asian Development Bank's plans to provide follow-on technical assistance to the
           Ministry of Labor and Human Resources to help with the framing o f accompanying rules and
           regulations and malung the Act fully operational. Process reforms for recruitment o f foreign
           workers are well-advanced. Through the launch o f Labor Net                     - a web-based labor recruitment
           system - employers are able to apply for foreign workers' permits on-line, thereby facilitating
           access to applications and reducing the time needed for the approval processes.                  23The draft act
           was submitted to the CoM at the end o f 2005, meetingthis up-front action for DPG-I.

           Onthe supply side, shortages o f slulled workers are a bindingconstraint for private sector growth
           and productivity. The on-going efforts to raise the retention rates o f children in school through
           secondary education, adapting the secondary school curriculum more closely to the needs of the
           private sector, and strengthening vocational training, job counseling, and entrepreneurship
           programs will be critical to raising the availability o f slulled workers. The success o f these
           programs will be gauged by the improved matching o f labor supply from the vocational schools
           withthe demands o f the market.
       (b)Creating an enabling environment for foreign direct investment: Creating an enabling
           environment for foreign direct investment (FDI) i s an important element of the RGoB's private
           sector development and employment generation strategy. The overall objectives o f encouraging
           FDI are to broaden employment and training opportunities, benefit from technology and shlls
           transfer, expand the revenue base, and raise foreign exchange earnings. Towards achieving these
           goals, an FDI Policy was approved in 2002. This provides a clear policy on the regulation o f
           foreign investment, particularly the entry o f such investment, and policy on other matters,
           including guarantees that pertain only to foreign investors. Accompanying FDI Rules and
           Regulations were approved in December 2005, meeting this up-front action for DPG-I. The
           approval i s considered an important first step in helping operationalize a transparent FDI


2o Every time a new investment i s made, a Memorandum o f Understanding (MOU) i s signed between the employer o f the
enterprise and the Ministry o f Labor and Human Resource on behalf o f the Government concerning the gradual replacement of
foreign workers by Bhutanese "to meet the national objectives o f generating sufficient gainful employment opportunities for
Bhutanese nationals and to further economic development in the Kingdom."
21 According to the Bhutan Private Sector Survey (2002), no company in the sample experienced problems in firing poor
performers - either Bhutanese or non-nationals.

22The minimumwage for Bhutanese workers in the public sector is fixed at Nul00 per day. Some large private sector firms have
followed the public sector's lead. Overall wage levels vary considerably with nationalities and regions.

                                                                21

         registration system. Within the regulated Bhutanese economy, it i s expected that this will give
         comfort andprotectionto foreign investors. Some initial FDIgains have already been made inthe
         manufacturing sector and in the tourism sector - with the establishment of new high-end and
         internationally renowned hotels. Efforts are also underway to strengthen investment promotion
         capacity within the Ministry o f Trade and Industry. At the same time, the RGoB has drafted an
         Industrial and Investment Act, which would provide legal backing to the FDIPolicy 2002. Upon
         the effectiveness o f the FDI rules and regulations, serious FDI inquiries are likely to increase,
          followed by an increase in the number o f MOUs signed. Once fully effective, the strengthened
         FDI law and set of policies/regulations should result in a significant increase in foreign
          investment.

      (c) Reducing the cost of doing business by simplifying the business registration process. The
          RGoB recognizes that business registration and regulations pose a significant barrier to entry for
         new firms. As reflectedinthe DoingBusiness findings, in2004-05 it took an average firm 62 days
          to register a company in Bhutan compared to the South Asian average of 47 days. To improve
          efficiency in the business registration process, the Department o f Industries has undertaken a
          reform initiative to simplify the registration process. Inaddition, the amendment o f the Companies
          Act and the consolidation o f existing rules and regulations are being initiated. Reform efforts are
          also underway for improving the business environment for micro enterprises by streamlining entry
          and operational regulations. Capacity building initiatives have been undertaken for key staff o f
          the Registrar o f Companies. Once these reforms become effective, the time taken to register a firm
          i s expected to be reducedto at least the regional average o f 47 days.

Prior actions for theDPG:

(3 of 7)        The draft Labor and Employment Act is submitted to the CoM, and theprocessfor recruiting
               foreign workers is streamlined.

(4 of 7)       Foreign Direct Investment rules and regulations are approved.

Trigrers for a future DPG/DPC:

(3 of 7)       TheLabor and Employment Act is submitted to the National Assembly by July 2006.

(4 of 7)        The business registration process is simplij?ed, including the number of procedures, time
                taken, and costs involved by March 2007.

51. The RGoB's private sector development agenda i s moving forward, and the two up-fi-ont actions in
this area for DPG-I have been met. Over time, the initiative will help generate job opportunities, increase
productivity enhancing FDI, and foster greater private sector dynamism. Progress will be monitored
following several key indicators, such as the time taken to receive approval for foreign worker recruitment,
the amount o f FDIentering the country, the number o f licensed enterprises, and the number o f tourists.


3.       Augmentingthe Quality of and Access to Education

52. As noted above, human development i s the cornerstone o f Bhutan's development vision, and the
NinthPlan sets ambitious goals for the expanding access to primary and secondary education, as well as
raising the quality of education at all levels. To support these goals, the Bank has undertaken a series of
education sector projects, and the DPG will further underpinthe RGoB's efforts.

(i) School Education: Achievementsand Challenges

53. Since the adoption o f a modem, western education system in the 1950s, the RGoB has expanded the
number o f schools and institutes from 11 in 1961 to 476 in 2005.24The number o f students has risen to
about 162,000 (as o f February 2005). In2003, according to the BLSS, the gross enrollment rate (GER) at
the primary level was 93 percent and the net enrollment rate (NER) was 69 percent.                           At the lower
secondary level, the GER was estimated at approximately 56 percent, dropping to just 13 percent at the
higher secondary level. Literacy rates have risen over the last 15 years due to the promotion o f basic
education throughout the country, and the establishment o f non-formal education (literacyhumeracy)
classes for out-of-school youth and adults. The BLSS reported literacy in2003 for the 10 to 14 age group at
75 percent, versus only 13 percent for those over 60. The numbers for girldwomen for these two age
groups are 70 and 1 percent, respectively. As noted earlier, these numbers indicate sustained progress
toward gender parity inprimary education.

54. The NER at both the primary and secondary levels i s relatively low and early drop-out i s a continuing
concern. The problem i s more acute inrural areas, where the primary NER i s estimated at 65 percent, and
as low as 27 percent at the secondary level. Drop-out rates rise after the age o f 16, corresponding to the
transition to higher secondary education, and rural children consistently lag behind their urban counterparts
with completion rates below 73 percent. Access i s also a major challenge, particularly for girls. In urban
areas, about 14 percent o f children enrolled inprimary school live more than 30 minutes from their school.
The issue i s exacerbated inrural areas, where nearly 37 percent o f primary school students live more than
45 minutes from their school.

 55. High pupil-teacher ratios and overcrowded classrooms are seen as the most important factors
impinging quality in Bhutan's schools. These are largely an outcome o f the enormous increases in
enrollment over the past ten years, in-line with Bhutan's commitment to achieving `Education for All'
 global targets, while the number o f available trained teachers has been unable to meet the growing demand.
These are key factors contributing to poor learning outcomes, as well as highrepetition and drop-out rates.




 24 The Bhutaneseeducation system includes seven years o f primary (from pre-primary to grade 6), two years of lower secondary
 (grades7 and 8), two years of middle secondary(grades9 and 10) and two years ofhigher secondary (grades 11 and 12) education.
 Educationis providedbythe RGoB free o f charge.


                                                              23

56. The RGoB seeks to manage the increased role o f the private sector in a measured way to stem rural-
urban migration and maintain acceptable levels o f quality and consistency for both types o f service
delivery, public and private. There i s a positive relationship between the RGoB and private providers in
terms o f human resource development and the existence o f a sound regulatory environment. Education
professionals (teachers, head teachers, principals, and specialists) can move from the public to the private
sector for determined periods o f time. This provides an enriching professional experience and income
earning opportunities for the individual. It also helps the RGoB ensure consistency in education program
content, philosophy and administration, and will limit the emergence o f gaps in the nature and quality o f
service delivery betweenpublic and private education. There are strong regulatory requirements/procedures
for establishing private schools, in order to ensure acceptable quality and accordance with standards related
to culture, content, training. The proportion o f students enrolled in private schools is small at the primary
and lower secondary levels, but rises to almost 50 percent at the higher secondary level. The role o f the
private sector inthe education sector i s likely to grow inthe coming years.

(io Education SectorReforms

57. Improving access to and the quality o f education are major objectives o f the RGoB, as described by
the NinthFive-Year Plan (2002-03 to 2006-07) education sector goals:

     0   Increasing the primary gross enrollment rate to 90-95 percent by 2007;

     0   Raisingthe promotion rate from grade 10to 11from 38 to 56 percent over the plan period;

     0   Developing the tertiary education system through the newly-established Royal University o f
         Bhutan;

     0   Increasing the literacy rate from 54 to 80 percent over the course of the plan;

     0   Establishing a program o f inclusive education for children with special needs; and

     0   Developing a more sustainable system through private participation and cost-sharing.

Since 1988, the Bank has supported education system development in Bhutan, initially to expand access
and increase quality at the primary levels, and more recently at the secondary level. The ongoing Education
Development Project (EDP) i s the largest IDA Credit ever to Bhutan, and i s helping to finance the
expansion and improvement o f secondary education on the basis o f the sector development strategy o f the
NinthFive-Year Plan. To assist the RGoB further towards meeting its goals in the education sector, the
DPG supports reforms inthree key areas:

     (a) Improving access to schooling by establishing new Community Primary Schools (CPSs) in
          remote and/or underserved areas. As a result o f the rapidly increasing enrollment at each level
          o f schooling, the RGoB has undertaken a large expansion o f the education infrastructure.
          Providing schooling for the significant proportion o f children living inremote, sparsely-populated
          areas i s a major challenge. The primary strategy adopted by the RGoB has been the establishment
          o f CPSs with the participation o f local communities who contribute labor and locally-available
          materials for school construction. The Ministry o f Education (MoE) contributes non-locally-
          available materials (such as tin sheet roofing and plexi-glass windows), teaching-learning
          materials and a teacher(s). These schools are part o f the regular education system, supervised by
          Dzongkhageducation officers and under the full authority o fthe MoE.

         The CPS model involves: cost-sharing with communities, a high level o f community ownership
         and decentralization o f education service delivery, as local authorities have key decision-malung
         authority over their establishment. CPSs also support child welfare as they alleviate the need for
         children to leave their home areas for schooling. This i s o f particular importance to young children
         at the lower primary level (kindergarten to grade 3). The RGoB established 23 new CPSs by the

                                                       24

        end of 2005, meeting this up-front action for DPG-I. There are currently 221 CPSs throughout the
        country.

   @) Improving the quality of education through the development of a curriculum framework.
        Bhutan has made important strides inrecent years to improve the quality o f curricula at all levels o f
        schooling. Considerable work has been camed out at the primary level to make curricula more
        relevant and reflective o f the unique character o f Bhutanese society and culture, as well as o f
        higher pedagogic quality. The MoE's Cumculum and Professional Support Services Division
        (CAPSD) i s responsible for the on-going review, development and implementation o f curricula at
        all levels of education. CAPSD has been supported throughthe last three IDA-funded operations in
        the education sector, primarily through human resource development and technical assistance for
        the development o f new curricula and textbooks. CAPSD i s now a fully functional unit managing
        all aspects of curriculum development, and capable o fproducing highquality outputs.

        Recent years have seen a shift from out-dated rote teaching-learning approaches to more modern
        active-learning, child-centered methodologies. These require extensive pre- and in-service training
        of teachers, which has proved to be challenging in light o f the unfamiliarity to teachers o f many
        new concepts, who themselves were taught using rote learning methodologies. This underscores
        generational differences in the nature o f many key facets o f education system reform. With rapid
        increases inenrollment over the past decade, particularly at the primary level, and the challenge o f
        usingchild-centered learning approaches in over-crowded classrooms, the impact o f good teaching
        practices has been limited. The RGoB has been concerned, inparticular, with students' acquisition
        in the core subjects of English and mathematics. Under the Ninth Five-Year Plan, emphasis is
        being placed on improving students' competency in these two key subject areas. This i s viewed as
        an important strategy for improving linkages between employment and later participation in the
        labor market where acceptable levels o f Englishfluency are required. The DPG supports reforms in
        thiskey area, andthe development o fa curriculumframework for Englishfrom classes pre-primary
        (PP) to 12i s an up-fkont action that was met inDecember 2005.

     (c) Strengthening the education management information system (EMIS) to help underpin
         policymaking.The rapid expansion o f schooling and the decentralization o f data collection to the
         Dzongkhag and school levels have raised several challenges for the data management system.
         The RGoB has sought technical assistance for enhancing the management o f education data and
         generating budget information. Indeed, external donors have provided substantial assistance in
         training Policy and PlanningDivision (PPD) personnel. The DPG supports the RGoB's efforts to
         strengthen monitoring and evaluation, and a concept paper i s under preparation on EMIS reform
         options and strategies to improve data collection, reliability, usability and automation.

Prior.actions-forthe DPG:

(5 of 7)     As part of the implementation of its policy to expand education coverage through the
             establishment of new community primaly schools (CPSs) in undersewed areas, the RGoB will
             establish 23 new CPSs in remote and/or undersewed areas to increase enrollment and
             completion at theprimary level, to support progress toward the achievement of the education-

(6 of 7)    A reformed EMISsystem is piloted, with afirst version availablefor use, learning and capacity

58. Each o f these areas represents an important challenge, particularly given the difficulty o f access to
remote parts o f the country and the lack o f sufficient human resources, especially teachers. The M o E has a
strong track record for implementingreformmeasures, meeting the education sector prior actions for DPG-
I,andmalunggoodprogressontheotherrelatedinstitutionalandpolicyreforms.WhiletheBhutanese
education system could benefit from a variety o f inputs at this point in its development, and the M o E i s
open to dialogue on a range o f issues, the actions supported by the DPG are well-placed within the context
o f other measures being carried out by the M o E with the substantial assistance o f bilateral and multilateral
development partners. For example, concerns over the extent to which the education system serves the
requirements o f the labor market are being addressed under the on-going IDA-financed EDP, through
mathematics curricula reform at all levels o f education, and the carrying out o f a tracer study o f secondary
school leavers. Similarly, pre-service teacher training i s supported through Bhutan's long-term
collaborationwith Switzerland inthe education sector.

59. Progress on the education sector reforms is expected to lead to better outcomes over time. The
establishment o f new CPSs will increase access to primary education (and raise the overall NER). The
Englishcurriculum framework i s expected to lead, over the course o f several years to increased English
proficiency among school leavers, as evidenced by employers' perceptions and student evaluation tools
(both continual and terminal assessments, such as in examinations). The reformed EMIS system will
generate the accurate education data needed to inform improved policy making, as reflected in more
targeted interventions, and better planning leading into the preparation o f the Tenth Five-Year Plan at the
dzongkhag and central levels.

4.       ImprovingHealthCare

60. The RGoB places the well-being `of people at the center o f development. This i s shown by the
allocation o f 30 percent o f the national budget to health and education (2005-2006), 43 percent o f which i s
allocated to health (representing 13 percent o f recurrent expenditures). Health care in Bhutan i s publicly
provided and financed. According to Bhutan's constitution, "the state shall provide free access to basic
public health services in both modem and traditional medicine" to the population. Thus, the state provides
health care free of charge, including essential drugs. BLSS data indicate that 8 percent o f health
expenditures are financed privately through out-of-pocket spending, primarily for "non-essential" drugs,
and other services not provided by the government. Public health spending as a share o f GDP and public
expenditure has remained stable over the last few years, at about 4.5 percent o f GDP and 12 percent o f all
public spending. However, in absolute terms, expenditures have been increasing. Roughly half o f this
spending is financed by external donors including mainly DANlDA (financing 18 percent o f the Eighth
Five-Year Plan and 10 percent o f the Ninth Five-Year Plan expenditures in the sector), WHO, the
Government o f India, and IDA.

61. The Bhutanese health care system is primary care oriented. Public health care i s provided through
three referral hospitals, 26 district hospitals, a network of 160 Basic Health Units (BHUs), and 447
Outreach Clinics (ORCs) spread throughout the country. Hospitals provide secondary and some tertiary
care, though most specialized care i s referred to other countries like India and Thailand. Indigenous
medical care i s provided through the hospital in Thimphu and 18 Indigenous Units attached to District
Hospitals.




                                                       26

(i) Health Care: Achievements and Challenges

62. Notwithstanding the scarcity o f data on health status, available information clearly indicates that the
health and well-being o f the Bhutanese population has improved steadily over the past two decades." Life
expectancy increased from 60 years in 1991 to 66 years in2003. Bhutanhas a relatively young population,
withnearly 40 percentunder 15 years o f age and about five percent over 65 years o f age. This age structure
i s similar to that o f India and Bangladesh, with the main difference being a sharp decline in fertility in the
last five years in Bhutan, and a somewhat greater proportion of the population over age 65. This places
Bhutan midway along the epidemiological and demographic transition, with the main causes o f death
including communicable diseases and maternal and peri-natal causes, but a growing incidence o f non-
communicable and chronic conditions including cancer, injuries and cardiovascular problems.

63. As discussed earlier, Bhutan has made significant progress in lowering both infant and child mortality.
Infant mortality rate decreased from 102.8 to 60.5 (per 100,000) between 1984 and 2000, and child
mortality rate fell from 162.4 to 84.0 (per 100,000) over the same period. Both o f these rates are lower than
inIndia, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh.Itis likelythat the markedreductionininfant and childmortality
i s partly due to an effective immunization policy and broader access to safe drinlung water and sanitation.
Immunization in Bhutan i s one of the great public health success stories, with universal child immunization
having been achieved in 1990. Access to safe drinkingwater and sanitation increased considerably during
the 1990s, rising from about 30 percent in 1994 to about 70 percent in2001, and Bhutanhas met this MDG.
Access to safe water plays an important role inreducing the incidence o f diarrhea related illness.

64. The prevalence o f stunting-an             indicator o f long-term malnutrition-among                    children under-five
dropped from 56 to 40 percent between 1988 and 1999. This figure i s somewhat lower than in the rest o f
the region where stunting ranges from 43 to 50 percent. The proportion o f children who are underweight-
which indicates short-term malnutrition-declined from 38 percent in 1988 to 19 percent in 1999, showing
that Bhutan has also already achieved this MGDtarget.

65. Progress with respect to reducing maternal mortality has been marked inthe last two decades, with the
maternal mortality rate (MMR) declining from 770 per 100,000 live births in 1984 to 260 in 2000. The
average MMR for the region i s 430. Progress to date can be explained by increased awareness, improved
health-seekmg behaviors during pregnancy and delivery, increased distribution of iron and folic acid to
pregnant women, greater coverage of tetanus immunization, increased use o f modern family planning
methods, and expanded access to health facilities in general. However, further reductions in the MMR can
only be achieved through better access to institutional deliveries by adequately trained personnel and
improved access to quality antenatal care (ANC). This means better access to Essential Obstetric Care
 (EOC) byremote communities, improving the quality and coverage o fANC, and increasingthe demand for
ANC and professionally delivered births. While interventions at the community level, such as ANC,
improved health seelung behavior (through increased knowledge about health and health promotion), and
improved nutrition, can reduce the number o f complications and facilitate their management, maternal
 deaths will not substantially decline unless complications can be treated ina timely fashion. This requires a
 functioning referral system, including transport, timely hospital bed availability, and effective care at
higher levels. Extendingaccess to EOC to women living inremote areas is part o f the RGoB's strategy to
reachthe underserved.

 66. Although health care i s free o f charge, utilization i s not as high as it could be. According to available
 surveys, between 15 (BLSS, 2003) and 22 percent (NHS, 2000) o f the Bhutanese who are sick or injured do
not seek health care. While the main reasons for underutilization by the poor and rural population are


 25 Household data are available from the BLSS carried out in 2003, and two National Health Surveys carried out by RGoB in 1994
 and 2000. Data are available on reproductive and child health including nutrition. On other health conditions, data are available
 from annualhealth bulletins, though the numbers are not as reliable since they are based on service statistics.


                                                                 27

related to distance and the time needed to reach service centers, it is clear that the quality o f care and
limited knowledge about the benefits o f maternity care are also important factors. Analysis o f the BLSS
data also indicates that household income i s an important determinant o f demand for health care in rural
areas, suggesting that even though free o f charge, the use o f services impliessome important costs. Rugged
terrain and scattered settlements make communication and transportation difficult, and fragmented health
networks limit possible economies of scale inhealth care delivery, constraining the health sector's reach to
remote populations. A general shortage o f human resources for health, particularly for specialized care
impinges quality. The lack o f specialists at the district level i s even more pronounced, with a large share o f
the health system relying on paramedics. Other health inputs are also insufficient, including medical
equipment and adequate drug supply. Health regulation and management needs to be strengthened to
ensure improved quality, effectiveness and efficiency. Finally, health care expenditures have been
increasing rapidly, at about 18 percent per year, and already half o f all health financing relies on foreign
aid. Options for increased financial sustainability needto be examined.

(ii) Health Care Reforms

67. Improving access and quality o f care, particularly to the under served, are the major objectives of the
Ninth Five-Year Plan. Although a secondary objective is to increase the sustainability of health care
services, the emphasis i s not on encouraging private sector delivery and financing but rather on public
solutions. DANIDA i s worlung closely with the RGoB on the sustainability o f health care financing. The
key health goals described inthe NinthPlan include:

      e  Enhancing the quality o f health services;

      e  Targeting health services to reach those who do not get these services;

      e Building self-reliance and the sustainability o fhealth services;

      0  Intensifyinghumanresource development for health and establishing a system of continuing
         education;

      e  Strengthening health management information systems and research;

      e  Developing appropriate secondary and tertiary health care services, while maintainingthe balance
         betweenprimary, secondary and tertiary health care;

      0  Strengtheningprevention and control o fprevailing health problems.

 68. The Ministry o f Health (MoH) sees the DPG as an opportunity to advance the reform agenda laid out
 inthe NinthFive-Year Plan, contributing to the achievement of the health MDGs.Building on the work
 that the RGoB i s carrying out with key partners in the health field, including the Bank, DANIDA and the
 WHO, the DPGsupports three policy and institutional reforms beingundertakenby the MoH:

      (a) ReducingMaternalMortality and Morbidity (an MDG) As noted above, further reductions in
          the MMR can be achieved mostly by increasing access to institutional deliveries by adequately
          trained personnel (EOC), improved access to ANC, improved health-seeking behavior, and overall
          improvements in the quality o f care. In 2000, only eight district and referral hospitals could
          provide EOC. Not only were they insufficient given the distances and difficult terrain, these were
          often understaffed and lacked the necessary inputs. Realizing the need to prioritize adequate
          obstetric care to reduce maternal mortality-which         affects primarily remote, rural populations-
          the RGoB shifted its policy in 2000 from an emphasis on promoting safe home deliveries to
          expanding access to EOC and institutional deliveries. However, a clear strategy for rolling out
          EOC, in light o f human resource constraints is still lacking. The adequacy o f existing referral
          systems needs to be assessed and strengthened, and community support needs to be garnered to
          bring women to the necessary facilities when locally available health sector resources are

                                                        28

   insufficient. Overall, communities need to take a more active role in improving community health.
   The goal o f the NinthPlan i s to establish functioning EOC facilities in the 26 referral and district
   hospitals by 2007. The goal i s very ambitious, and adequate progress will only be achieved with a
    clear strategy inplace. Thus, the development o f a draft strategy to increase institutional deliveries
   was included as an up-front action for DPG-I and has been met, but more effort will be needed to
   refine the draft further.
@) HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (an MDG) Bhutan i s at an early stage o f the HIV/AIDS
   problem-UNAIDS         estimates a current 0.01 percent HIV prevalence rate-but          the number o f
    detected cases i s growing exponentially and the presence o f risk factors i s significant, such as high
    rates o f sexually transmitted infections, multiple sexual partners, commercial sex, and high
    mobility within and outside the country. To avoid a full blown epidemic, which would have a
    devastating impact on the country's human development gains, prevention efforts need to be
    focused on highly vulnerable subpopulations (people engaging in high risk behaviors and their
    partners) and on high transmission areas, such as border towns. Prevention needs to focus on
    communication aimed at highrisk groups to encourage changed behavior, promotion o f condom
    use, and reduction o f the incidence o f sexually transmitted diseases, which have been found to
    increase the risk o f becoming infected with HIV. The national prevention program i s currently
    being scaledup with support from an IDA Grant for US$5.8 million.

   Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) are on the increase in Bhutan and there i s some evidence
   that antibiotics currently usedto treat STIs are becoming ineffective due to the growing resistance
   o f existing strains to penicillin (the main drug currently used to treat STIs). The RGoB needs to
   assess the extent o f resistance and adjust its treatment protocols to include more effective
   treatment. The RGoB i s conducting a Gonoccocal Susceptibility Study to determine the level o f
   resistance to currently used drugs, in order to adjust its policy on STI management and supply all
   health care facilities with new drugs. This i s a crucial input to the RGoB's efforts to combat the
   epidemic, and progress on the analysis o f the data collected and on the adoption o f an adjusted STI
   treatment policy are included inthe DPGreform measures.

(c) Overall Quality of Health Care. Having significantly expanded the health care infrastructure in
    recent years, the RGoB has shifted its focus from expanding coverage to improving the quality o f
    services, a critical thrust o f the Ninth Five-Year Plan. To this end, the M o H has established a
    Quality Assurance and Standardization Division (QASD),            and has developed a conceptual
    framework for the institutionalization o f quality assurance (QA). Four areas are being prioritized,
    focusing on: (a) clients, (b) systems rather than inputs, (c) measurementhesults, and (c) teamwork.
    The QASD will be responsible for accreditation and licensing.                  Quality assurance and
    standardization includes the development o f guidelines for practice (standard operating
    procedures, SOPS) and standardization o f services, staffing levels and equipment across facilities.
    With roles and responsibilities for the various actors already defined, and some QA activities
    already being rolled out, the M o H seeks to institutionalize QA at all levels o f the health sector,
    from the center to all BHUs. QA teams are being set up in all 26 hospitals and will begin to
    establish an MIS to monitor hospital service quality. Relevant staff have been trained on the
    principles o f QA, and discussions are being held on the need to reestablish the Health Technology
    and Quality Committee (HTQC) in order to manage the process, which was disbanded when the
    Educationand Health Ministries were split into separate ministries.

   Other reforms to improve the quality o f care and health regulation involve the partial restructuring
   o f the M o H to establish separate, semi-autonomous bureaus including: the Information and
   Communication Bureau, the Bhutan Medical and Health Council, the Drug Regulatory Authority,
   and the Health Trust Fund. At the central level, emphasis has been placed on systems
   development, including the Planning, Budgeting and Monitoring (PBM) tool and the Health
   Management Information System (HMIS), as well as several other service specific management

                                                  29

        information systems (MIS). At the Dzongkhag level, the roles and responsibilities o f the
        Dzongkhag Health Officer and Senior Medical Officer were specified and training on the use o f
        health data for management i s being camed out. Most training at the district level, however,
        continues to be focused on technical aspects rather than on management. Muchremains to be done
        at the central level as well, as only 13 o f the 21 posts in the Policy and Planning Division (PPD)
        had been filled by June 2005, and several components o f the MIS are under development.
        Improved quality and better regulationwill increase utilization, efficiency and effectiveness.


Prior action for theDPG:

(7 of 7)     A draft strategy to increase institutional deliveries (child birth) is developed, and two districts
             where the strategy is to bepiloted are selected.

Trigger for a future DPGIDPC:
(7 of 7)     Guidelines for the establishment of improved patient referral networks for institutional
             deliveries), quality of care and measures to increase demand at the community level on the
             basis of lessonsfrom thepilots areprepared by June 2007.
69. The RGoB has taken meaningful steps towards implementing the policy and institutional reforms
needed to achieve better health outcomes. The up-front action on preparing a draft strategy for institutional
child birth has broadly been met, and other reforms are moving forward. These are to be monitored over
time through indicators on the proportion o f births delivered at EOC facilities, the percentage of STIs
treated with effective drugs, and the doctor attendance records o f hospitals.


                                  V. OPERATIONIMPLEMENTATION

70. The key elements o f implementingthe proposed operation are described below:

1.       Povertyand Social Impacts

71. The 2003 BLSS indicates an aggregate poverty rate o f 31.7 percent inBhutan. Disaggregated analysis
suggests that health and education outcomes are lower for the poor compared to the non-poor. Poor
individuals are less likely to consult health care professionals and send their children to school. The poor
are more dependent on agnculture for employment, with fewer opportunities for remunerative off-farm
employment.

72. The proposed operation seeks to provide sound macroeconomic and fiscal underpinnings for
continued steady economic growth which will help improve the quality o f life for all sections o f the
population, especially the poor. Measures to enhance access to education and health services-with              a
special focus on remote, under-served areas-will      be particularly beneficial to the poor. Efforts to enhance
the investment climate for private sector growth and employment generation will create new opportunities
and reduce the dependence o f the poor on agricultural employment.

73. No update o f the BLSS i s proposed during DPG-I, though the RGoB plans to introduce a system of
surveys and/or censuses on a quinquennial basis. However, changes in social indicators will be tracked
through the EMIS and the HMIS. The findings from the first statistical census in the country are to be
available inthe first half o f 2006, and are expected to provide further indications o f progress.




                                                       30

2.       Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation

74. The Department of Aid and Debt Management (DADM), Ministry o f Finance will be responsible for
overall implementation of DPG-I.The RGoB has established a multi-ministerial group o f officials, headed
by the Secretary, Ministry of Finance to provide overall coordination for DPG-I. This group has been
working with the Bank team since the inception o f the proposed operation.

75. The Bank team's supervision plan will monitor actions and review implementation progress of the
proposed operation. The Policy Program Matrix (Annex I)o f the proposed operation provides a results
framework that describes expected outcomes at the end o f the program, as well as indicators to measure
success. Duringthe supervision phase o f the operation, these benchmarks will be regularly evaluated and
the interim steps taken by the RGoB will be monitored.

76. While considerable gains have been made to strengthen technical capacity in the sectors directly
involved in the DPG, a lack o f technical capacity i s a major constraint to Bhutan's overall development
(see below the sub-section on risks). This i s often cited as a reason for delayed progress inproject activities
across sectors, and wide-ranging technical assistance inputs are included as a part of most donor-financed
operations inBhutan. As the DPG-I operation evolves, country circumstances, including technical capacity
may change. Decision-malung on the identification o f feasible options for achieving development goals
will need to be flexible. Hence, while maintaining a clear focus on the desired impactloutcomes of the
program, the Bank team also recognizes the importance o f linkmg ongoing monitoring to decision-making
on appropriate adjustments to reflect these realities.

3.       Fiduciary Aspects

77. Financial Management. As part o f the project preparation process, the Bank team supplemented the
Country Financial Accountability Assessment (2002) with an update o f the ongoing reforms and other
medium- and long-term improvements being considered in the public financial management area.26 As
noted above, the update shows that while the core elements o f an effective financial management system
are largely in place, several major challenges remain, including the timeliness o f accounting and reporting,
the monitoring o f financial performance, the effectiveness o f internal audits, and the execution o f other
control functions. There i s also a need to further strengthen the capacity o f the accountability and oversight
institutions, and to establish the necessary legal underpinnings they require in order to meet the financial
management and transparency demands arising from the increased revenues and spending expected over
the coming years.

78. The RGoB has been actively pursuing several reform initiatives, outlining a positive trajectory for
improvements in public finance management (PFM) and demonstrating its commitment. K e y components
o f the RGoB's ongoing PFMreform program are included inthe Policy Program Matrix (Annex I)                  and aim
to: (a) provide a satisfactory legal and institutional framework for PFM; (b) improve the timeliness, quality,
transparency and reliability o f the RGoB's accounting and reporting functions, and (c) strengthen
accountability on public financial management issues. These positive steps, as well as the RGoB's
demonstrated results and the strong commitment for continued PFM reforms provide a satisfactory basis
for proceeding with the DPG.

 79. The IMF has not carried out a Safeguards Assessment o f the Royal Monetary Authority, Bhutan's
central bank. Hence, as part of the appraisal for the DPG operation, the audit report and published annual
 financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2005 were reviewed by the Bank. The audit opinion

World Bank.


                                                           31

provided by the auditor, a private firm o f chartered accountants from Kolkata, India is unqualified. The
accounts are compiled on the basis o f generally accepted accounting standards and the audit was conducted
inaccordance with generally accepted audit standards. Based on the audit report and the satisfactory track
record o f in the operation o f special accounts in several IDA-financed investment operations which have
been held in the RMA, it may be concluded that the Bank has reasonable assurance that the control
environment for foreign exchange at the RMA i s satisfactory for the purposes o fthis operation.

80. Procurement. Last revised in 1998 with assistance from the Asian Development Bank, the
Bhutanese procurement system i s described in Chapter 17 o f the Financial Manual and provides a good
basis for procurement in the country. With over six years o f experience in applying the legal framework,
and having identified some weaknesses and areas for improvement, the RGoB i s currently inthe process o f
revising the procurement manual. While external donors have looked favorably on the national
procurement system, and have relied on it to a significant degree, it i s recognized that there are a number o f
areas which need to be further improved. Bhutan's development partners, including the Bank, are workmg
together to harmonize around the use o f Bhutan's fiduciary (including procurement) and safeguards
systems. The South Asia Regon's Procurement and Financial Management units are currently in the
process o f drafting a workplan for the RGoB to assist them with the relevant reforms to allow for such
universal reliance on country owned systems.

81. While there are also a number o f technical details that should be improved, a weakness o f the system
lies with implementation and enforcement. In the area o f implementation, additional work is required to
improve the scope and quality o f supporting documentation, particularly with regard to standard form
bidding, contract documents, and specialized guidelines and manuals. More effort i s also needed to
strengthen procurement capacity, which may become a major constraint in the RGoB's move towards
greater decentralization o fprocurement functions.

82. Whilst poor implementationcan be linked to a lack o f capacity and a deficit of supporting documents
and guidelines, weak enforcement i s also an issue. There i s only an informal complaints mechanism in
place to deal with failures to comply with the provisions o f the FinancialManual. This has been a cause for
concern not only within the RGoB, but also among its development partners and i s one o f the areas that are
to be addressed under the above-mentioned workplan.

83. Overall, the procurement risk can be gauged as medium. To mitigate this risk, actions should be taken
to improve the legal framework, strengthen implementationthrough the development o f specialized bidding
documents and guidelines, support the introduction o f a sustainable national capacity building program
usingexisting Bhutanese institutions, and encourage the creation o fan effective enforcement mechanismto
ensure that the provisions o f the Financial Manual are implemented as intended. Inpartnership with other
donor agencies, a Bank team i s working with the RGoB to develop fiduciary reforms necessary to facilitate
progress inthese areas.

4.       DisbursementandAuditing

84. Once the Grant is approved by the Board and becomes effective, the RGoB will submit to the IDA a
withdrawal application. IDA will disburse the U S dollar proceeds o f the Grant in one tranche to the credit
o f the RGoB's account with the RMA. This account will be part o f Bhutan's official foreign exchange
reserves. An amount equivalent to the grant proceeds will be credited into an account o f the Government
that i s available to finance budgeted expenditures. Transactions and balances o f the Government account
will be promptly and fully incorporated into the Government's accountingrecords and financial statements
(inthe ConsolidatedFund).The RGoBwill confirm to the Bankwithin 30 days ofdisbursement, the receipt
o f these funds and its credit into the Consolidated Fundo f the country (including the date and n a m e h m b e r
o f the government's bank account inwhich the funds have been deposited). The administration of this grant
will be the responsibility o fthe Ministryo fFinance.

85. Disbursement of the grant proceeds would not be linked to specific purchases. However, the RGoB
would not use the grant proceeds to pay for expenditures included in the Bank's standard negative list
which includes expenditures on military hardware and environmentally hazardous goods. If any portion o f
the Grant i s used to finance ineligible expenditures as so defined in the Development Grant Agreement,
IDA shall require the RGoB to refund the amount to IDA. As disbursement will not be tied to specific
expenditures, no procurementrequirements are necessary.

5.       EnvironmentalAspects

86. Bhutan i s rich innatural resources with an abundance o f forests, biodiversity, water and hydro-power
potential. These have provided the platform for sustaining growth and rural livelihoods. Recognizing the
significance o f its natural assets, environmental issues occupy a central place in the RGoB's development
priorities. The country's environmental policies and institutional structures have been described in
numerous documents including Bank assessments (including the CAS, the Country Policy and Institutional
Assessment (CPIA), and numerous project documents) and academic papers.

87. The RGoB has committed to maintaining 60 percent o f the land under forest cover, and has further
reaffirmed this policy in the draft Constitution. Indeed, the fiscal transfer system being considered under
the Alternative Planning Framework i s to include criteria on the contribution o f the district to maintaining
forest cover. The Environmental Assessment Act (2000) remains the centre-piece o f Bhutan's approach to
environmental protection. The Act makes environmental assessments mandatory for activities that could
have an adverse environmental impact. To support the Act, the National Environmental Commission has
issued regulations and sectoral guidelines. Guidelines exist for all major sectors o f the economy including
roads, power, industry, public utilities and tourism. This i s complemented by the Forest Conservation Act
(1991), which places priority o'n the conservation o f biodiversity and environmental services such as soil
and water conservation. Economic benefits fiom forests are considered secondary. The legislation i s
enforced through a series o f rules and ordinances, which cover development activities, agriculture, forest
management and wildlife conservation.

88. By the standards o f most developing countries, environmental policy implementation in Bhutan i s
strong. Accordingly, the Bank's 2005 CPIA ranked Bhutan's environmental institutions as the best in the
South Asia region. Other appraisals such as the Environmental Sustainability Index, confirm the Bank's
as~essment.'~

89. EnvironmentalImpacts of the Development Policy Grant. Overall, the environmental impact o f
the four components o fthe DPGi s not likely to be significant:

        1. Ensuring the maintenance of a sound macroeconomic framework, strengthening fiscal policy,
            and bolstering financial management and accountability. These macro policy reforms are
            unlikely to have any direct environmental impact and are therefore judged to be environmentally
            benign.

        2. Enhancing the investment climatefor private sector growth and employment generation. These
            reforms are aimed at improving the investment climate through labor market reforms,
            streamlining business registrationprocesses and changes to FDIrules. These are unlikely to have
            any direct environmental impact. Inso far as the reforms promote economic diversification, the


27 The most comprehensive measure o f environmental performance i s the Environmental Sustainability Index (ESI). It ranks
Bhutan as an environmental exemplar with the highest rating in South Asia. This score reflects both low levels o f environmental
stress and an institutional and policy environment that i s capable o f addressing emerging pressures. The regional ESI scores are
(from low [worse] to high [better]): Pakistan- 39.9; Bangladesh -44.1; India-45.2; Nepal - 47.7; Sri Lanka - 48.5; and Bhutan-
53.5.


                                                                33

          operation can be expected to ease some o f the demographic pressures on agricultural lands and
          could generate indirect environmental benefits.

      3 . Augmenting the qualily of and access to education and improving health care. These reforms
          have no discemable environmental impact and are therefore environmentallybenign.

      4. Improving health care. These reforms also have no discemable environmental impact and are
          therefore environmentally benign.

90. This i s also described inthe environmental screeningmatrix inAnnex 11.

6.      Risks and Mitigation

91. Major risks to the RGoB's medium-term reformprogram and associated risk mitigation strategies are
characterized as follows:

0  Technical capacity risks. Likemost small developing countries, Bhutan's workforce faces major slull
   shortages, and accountants, engineers, economists, lawyers, statisticians and other professionals are in
   short supply. There are few think-tank institutions, public or private, engaged inprofessional research
   and advisory services. Very little, if anything, i s done in research and development. L o w technical
   capacity and slull shortage i s a major and arguably the leading factor impeding Bhutan's overall
   development progress. As much o f this risk i s difficult to overcome inthe short-term, donor-supported
   development programs and their expected results must be designed to reflect existing capacity
   constraints. For example, well-crafted legislation can be enacted, but would be largely ineffective inthe
   absence o f a threshold number o f technically-competent individuals to ensure its proper
   implementation. The design o f the proposed DPG i s mindful o f these limitations, and in seelung to
   mitigate these risks, recognizes that technical support, provided in collaboration with other
   development partners, will continue to be an important feature o fthe Bank's assistance to Bhutan.

0  External shocks. All economies, particularly small ones, are vulnerable to external shocks. In this
   regard, Bhutan i s no exception. Hydropower currently accounts for 12 percent o f the economy and 32
   percent o f total revenues. With the commissioning o f the Tala Hydropower Project inmid-2006, these
   numbers are expected to increase to 25 and 50 percent, respectively. Any shocks, natural or otherwise,
   have the potential o f creating major problems in the economy. The RGoB takes into account natural
    shocks to hydropower (such as reduced water level inthe project canals) when calculating its potential
    electricity generation in any given year. Yet, dependency on exporting all electricity to one buyer,
    India, i s a risk; even though Bhutan's excellent relationship with India continues to yield rich
    dividends. There have been continuous efforts to expand the tourism sector to promote' economic
    diversification, and the proposed DPGprogram supports that strategy.

0   Reforminertia and political risks. It is possible that the pace o f reform will not accelerate due to
    political developments. There are two mitigating factors for this risk. First,the Bhutanprogram has full
    country ownership, and actions supported by the proposed operation are anchored in the Ninth Five-
    Year Plan that was put together through a wide consultative process over the course o f two years.
    Experience suggests that reform programs are more likely to succeed when there i s strong country
    ownership. Second, the design o f the Bank's proposed development policy program seeks to minimize
    such risks. While DPG-I will support selected components o f the RGoB's medium-term reform
    program, each programmatic operation would provide financial support on the basis o f progress made,
    as measured against a set o fmonitorable actions identifiedthrough the previous operation.

Dear Mr.Wolfowitz,

                             Letter of Development Policy

        This Letter of Development Policy outlines how the proposed Development
Policy Grant (DPG), financed by the World Bank, will support the Royal Government
of Bhutan's (RGoB) ongoing rnedium-term policy and institutional refom program as
articulated in its Ninth Five-Year Development Plan. The Ninth Plan has five overall
goals: (i)improving quality of the life and income, especially for the poor, (ii)
                                                                               ensuring
good governance, (iii)promoting private sector growth and employment generation,
(iv) preserving andpromoting cultural heritage and environmental conservation, and (v)
achieving rapid economic growth and transformation. The strategies outlined to reach
these goals include infrastructure expansion, maintaining sound macroeconomic policy,
ensuring good governance, improvingaccess, and enhancing social services.

        The DPG selectively supports these goals and strategies, and the RGoB is
strongly committed to implementing the institutional and policy reforms described in
the attached Policy Program Matrix as a part of its effort to foster development and
accelerate poverty reduction. The proposed DPG is the first programmatic budget
support operation in Bhutan by the World Bank, and will also mitigate the need for
domestic financing in FY06 by helping to close the expected fiscal gap. Under the
overarching themes of enhancing economic growth, reducing poverty and achieving the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the following four components o f the
RGoB's interrelated developmental reform strategies are being supported by the DPC
operation:    (i) ensuring the maintenance of a sound macroeconomic framework,
strengthening fiscal policy, and bolstering financial management, (ii)enhancing the
investment climate for private sector growth and employment generation, (iii)
augmenting the quality of and access to education, and (iv) improving health care.
Before turning to these four areas, Iwould like to provide some information on recent
developments regarding the economy, the implementation o f the NinthPlaniPRSP and
initiatives ingood governance.

A.      Recent Developments
Macrosconmic Outlook
        Bhutan's economic performance is strong, and over the past two decades, real
GDP growth has averaged over 6 percent. Growth has been supported by sound
macroeconomic management, generous donor support and the development of
hydropower resources. Indeed, the large Tala hydropower project that has been under
construction since 1997 is nearing completion, and when it is commissioned later in
2006, GDP will rise sharply. Tourism i s also contributing increasingly to growth and
employment generation. The policy of pegging the Ngultrum to the Indian rupee has
served the country well, and inflation has been close to 3 percent for some years.
        The RGoB aims to keep the overall fiscal deficit including grants to below 5
percent of GDP, but volatility remains a major challenge. In recent years, volatility in
fiscal outtums has been the result o f delayed donor grants, lumpy expenditures (like the
two new replacement aircraft for DrukAir,the only carrier serving Bhutan), and delays in
the completion of Tala. The latter is part o f the rea$on for the emergence of a significant
fiscal gap inthe RGoB's 2005-06 budget, which the DPGwill help address. Volatility is
also manifested inthe balance of payments, and in 2004/05, for example, the purchase o`f
the two aircraft led to a current account deficit o f almost 25 percent of GDP.
        As described in greater detail below, the DPG will contribute to the maintenance
of the positive macroeconomic trend, byhelping the RGoB meet its goal o f strengthening
macroeconomic and fiscal management, and fostering greater private sector dynamism.
Ninih PlanDRSPlmpleineittution Updute
        A mid-term review of the Ninth PlanfPRSP implementation was undertaken in
mid-2005, and found that despite some short-comings, there has been substantial
progress. The review showed that implementation has been slower than expected, due to
lower levels of donor assistance, funding delays, the introduction o f the more
decentralized planning approach, and capacity constraints.          Still, activity has been
gathering pace in the later years of the five-year plan (as has been the norm over the past
few decades), and the stable macroeconomic environment together with the people-
centered development approach have brought rapid socio-economic progress towards
Gross National Happiness.
        These steps forward are also reflected in positive trends on the Millennium
Development Goals (MDG), as described in the MDG Progress Report released by the
RGoB at the end of 2005. While any assessment of development trends in Bhutan is
constrained by data limitations, available information suggests that most of the targets are
on track, and some have afready been achieved. For example, the target on reducing the
percentage of under-weight, under-five children (part o f the first MDG) has already been
achieved. Similarly, the targets on increasing the proportion of households with access to
improved water sources and sanitation (under the seventh MDG) have also been attained.
One area requiring attention is the ratio of females to males attending tertiary institutes
(part of the fourth MDG), where efforts will be strengthened for meeting the MDG by
2015.

                                                                                     Page 3 of 24




        It is worth noting that the Joint Staff Advisory Note on Bhutan's Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paperminth Plan (discussed by the Board o f the World Bank in
February 2004) emphasized three areas: the need to strengthen the macroeconomic
framework, the importance o f bolstering public expenditure management, and the
necessity o f adequate arrangements for monitoring and evaluation.               Seeking
improvements inthese areas is an enduringobjective o f the RGoB, and goodprogress has
been made over the past years. The prospects for growth within the macroeconomic
framework are good, especialiy once Tala comes on-stream later this year and growth is
raised on a more sustainable basis through the private sector reforms supported by the
DPG. Efforts to improve public expenditure management are ongoing, and the
preparation o f a Medium-Term Fiscal Framework is central to the initiative, also being
supported by the DPG as a first step towards implementing multi-year rolling budgets.
Finally, the first national level census was carried out in mid-2005 (results expected
shortly), and other improvements in monitoring and evaluation are also being sought
(such as in the education and health sectors), again supportedby the DPG.
Governance
        The transformation o f Bhutan's political system is gaining momentum with
nationwide public consultation o f the draft Constitution taking place and with the
establishment o f an Election Commission Office. The Constitution is to be adopted in
2008, and the first government under a system o f parliamentary democracy i s to be
elected in the same year. With the establishment o f a constitutional monarchy, H i s
Majesty the King has decided to pass on the throne to the Crown Prince in 2008. The
vision o f good governance articulated inthe draft Constitution is based on accountability
o f the government, responsible management o f state resources, independence of
Constitutional Offices, rule of law, and legal protection o f human rights. Inkeeping with
this vision, a month long exercise to look into the institutional mechanism to enhance
good governance was undertaken at the end of 2005.              The exercise focused on
transparency, accountability, efficiency and professionalism. The review recommended
several legislative    initiatives and institutional changes, inchding restructuring
government at the central and local Ievels, empowering the Planning Commission to lead
the formulation of policy and impact evaluation, enabling the MinisQy o f Finance to
develop a Medium Term Fiscal Framework, and to allocate resources to agencies
following an explicit set ofcriteria, based on the Alternative Planning Framework.
        The results of the exercise called "CG plus" also calls for the adoption of strong
anticorruption measures, by making the government more transparent and accountable to
the public. Towards this end, the RGoB has established the Office of the Anti-corruption
Commission and emphasizes the role of the media, civil society and the use of ICT. One
recommendation which has already been implemented is that the post of CEOs of state
owned enterprises is now open to competition. To further strengthen the decentralization
process and devolve greater power to lower levels o f government, implementation
manuals for the 2004 GYT and DYT Chathrims (Local government Acts) were drafted,
and elected representatives were trained in their use. In addition, a Department of Local
Governance was created in the Ministry of Home and Cultural Affairs to support local
governments. Insum total, promoting good governance remains an enduring goal of the
RGoB.

B.       Ensuring the Maintenance of a Sound Macroeconomic Framework,
Strengthening Fiscal Policy, and Bolstering Financial Management
Macroeconomic Framework
         As a result o f sound macroeconomic and fiscal management diligently pursued by
the government, Bhutan saw strong economic performance in the last twenty years or so.
To further enhance its budgetary management and monitoring of fiscal and debt
indicators many initiatives are being under taken. A notable intervention i s the
establishment o f a Macroeconomic Framework Coordination Committee (MFCC) to
facilitate and coordinate the generation of reliable fiscal projection and expenditure
forecasting. Careful fiscal monitoring i s crucial for Bhutan given the small size of the
economy. The information generated by MFCC will not only help the government
monitor fiscal developments but will help in the implementation of Multi-Year Rolling
Budgets (MYRB). In addition, to strengthen the debt management system, debt
management software has been procured and staff are being trained in the use of the
software.
Pubiic ExpenditureManagement
         The Budget Manual was revised in 2001 indicating the government's move
towards more dynamic budgeting by following MYRBs. Due to capacity constraints
coupled with decentralized implementation o f programs and activities, the government is
yet to fully integrate M Y R B s in the budgeting system. As a first step toward instituting
MYRBs, the MFCC has undertaken several iterations of a preliminary MTFF. 'The
exercise was completed in January 2006, and was subsequently endorsed by the Council
of Ministers (GoM).
         As shown in Table 1 below, revenues are projected to grow sharply with Tala
coming on-stream of in 2006107. Still, the expansion of the overall resource envelope is
less than expected because the increase inrevenue from Tala i s partially offset by a fall in
program grants and the start of high debt service payments on Tala (the loan portion o f
Tala is to be amortized in 12 years). The overall resources picture in 2007/08 is also
tight, as program grants are yet to be finalized, and project tied borrowing falls as well.
The continuing challenge o f volatility for the overall, fiscal situation cannot be over-
emphasized.       In particular, the timing o f the coming on-stream of Tala has major
implications -a delay of even a couple o f months, will have a substantial impact on GDP
growth, revenue and other variables.       Another example i s the projected excise duty
refund from the Government of India, where the RGoB has applied for two years' worth
of refunds in 2005/06, but if only one year's worth materializes, revenues may be up to
10percent lower in2005/06 than budgeted.
         Still, the MTFF is proving a useful tool in helping the RGoB develop projections
for sound macrolfiscal management, manage expectations on the part of line agencies,
address compositional issues (linkingcapital and recurrent spending), mobilize resources
from donors, and meet the RGoB's other public expenditure management goals such as
the MYRB and the Alternative Planning Framework (APF).

Financial Managemenz
        Intandem with the government's effort to enhance good governance practices in
the country, the Public Finance Act was drafted to provide legal underpinning for
financial management. The draft Public Finance Act underscores the importance o f
public financial management and accountability (PFMA) system. The draft Public
Finance Act amongst others will: (a) establish lines of responsibility for the use of public
financial resources and provide a legal framework for the RGoB's financial rules, (b)
provide a framework for scrutiny by the National Assembly for the management o f
public assets and liabilities, including expenditure and revenue proposals, (6) encourage
sound fiscal policy by specifying rules for fiscal sustainability and transparency, (d)
establish financial management incentives to encourage the effective and efficient use o f
financial resources by the government agencies, (e) specify the minimal financial
reporting obligations of the RGoB's budgetary bodies and public enterprises, and (0
safeguard public assets by providing statutory authority and control for raising loans,
issuing securities, givingguarantees, operating bank accounts, andinvesting funds.
        To provide closer attention to accounting and treasury functions and to enable
timely preparation of government financial statements, the Department of Budget &
Accounts has been segregated into two separate departments in December 2005 as: (i)
Department o f National Budget, and (ii)Department o f Public Accounts. This change
will assist inbringingefficiency andtimeliness to the accounting andreporting functions.
        The adoption o f the computerized Budgeting and Accounting System (BAS) in
line rninistries/agencies and the Central Budgeting and Accounting System (CBAS) in
DBA has brought about significant improvements in the financial management system
over the past severat years. However, the progress is hampered by the lack of adequate
networking facilities. The process o f compiling and preparing consolidated financial
statements is time consuming. At present, the releases are made through a manual Letter
o f Credit system with intimation to the respective bank. To ensure speedy releases of
funds, the DBA has started releasing funds electronically for the spending agencies in
ThimphuinDecember 2005. Pilotingthe networkingof the BAS between DBA and three
selected spending agencies inThimphuwill be carried out inJune 2006.
        The Royal Audit Authority (RAA) ascertains and evaluates whether public
resources are handled in accordance with the established rules and regulations; and
assesses whether public agencies within its audit jurisdiction, achieve the purposes for
which they were established and for which resources have been made available. The
Royal Decree for the RPLA provides a broad scope and a wide coverage for the audit
function, and ensures that the RAA is fully independent. In order to provide a legal
framework for the RAA, a draft Act has been prepared and submitted to the CoM in
September 2005. The Rh4 actively tracks and monitors responses by public spending
units o f audit observations until settlement'adjustment. To further enhance transparency
and accountability, audit reports are published in the national newspaper and made
available on the RAA website.

e.      Enhancing the Investment Climate for Private Sector Growth and
Employment Generation
       The development o f the private sector has been accorded high priority by the
RGoB since the Sixth Five Year Plan. The private sector has been designated as an
engine o f growth in light o f its potential contribution to employment and revenue
generation. In spite o f the RGoB's concerted efforts in developing and providing an
enabling environment for the sector, it is still weak and ina nascent stage.
       The RGoB is trying to develop more flexible labor laws and employment policies
to reduce employment constraints for young people. A key reform measure in this area i s
the drafting of a Labor and Employment Act to balance the legitimate needs o f workers
with the promotion o f private sector activity. The Act was submitted to the CoM in
October 2005.
       A Private Sector Development Committee (PSDC) was established in 2000 as a
public-private consultative forum for maintaining regular and structured dialogue on
cross-cutting and sector-specific issues to foster private sector development. The
Committee ceased operation in 2003 owing to the lack of a clear mandate and weak
follow-up actions. A 12 member PSDC was re-invigorated in September 2005 chaired by
the Minister of Trade and Industry and the Minister o f Information and Communications
as the Vice Chairman. The terms o f reference and the procedural rules o f the PSDC were
finalized duringits first meeting inNovember 2005.
        Creating an enabling environment for foreign direct investment (FDI) i s an
important element o f the RGoB's private sector development andemployment generation
strategy. The overall objectives o f encouraging FDI are to broaden employment and
training opportunities; to benefit from technology and skills transfer; to expand the
revenue base, and to raise foreign exchange earnings. Towards achieving these goals, a
revised FDI Policy was approved in 2002, which provides a clear direction on the
regulation o f foreign investment. More recently, accompanying FDI Rules and
Regulations were approved in October 2005 to help operationalize a transparent FDI
registration system. It is expected that this will give comfort and protection to foreign
investors.
        The RGoB recognizes that business registration and regulations pose a significant
barrier to the entry for new firms, and seeks to reduce the cost o f setting up a business.
Some o f the ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency o f the business registrationprocess
are: (a) the simplification o f the registration process, (b) the amendment of the
Companies Act, (c) the strengthening o f capacity at the Registrar of Companies, and (d)
the rationalization of entry and operational regulations to improve the business
environment for micro-enterprises.
D.      Augmenting the Quality of and Access to Education
        Increasing access to education has been a key priority of the RGoB since the start
o f formal schooling system in the late 1950s. In line with Bhutan's commitment to
achieving the `Education for All' global targets, there hasbeen considerable expansion o f
schooling at the primary and secondary levels. Improving access to and the quality o f
education are major objectives o f the RGoB, as described in its Ninth Five-Year Plan.

Goals include: (a) increasing the primary enrollment rate to 90-95 percent by 2007, (b)
increasing the promotion rate from grade 10 to 11 from 38 to 56 percent by 2007, (e)
developing the tertiary education system through the newly-established Royal University
o f Bhutan, (d) enhancing the literacy rate from 54 to 80 percent, (e) establishing a
program o f inclusive education for children with special needs, and (f)developing a more
sustainable education system through the introduction o f private participation and cost-
sharing measures. The DPG supports education reforms to meet these goals by helping
the RGoB (a) increase access to schooling, (b) improve the quality o f education, and (c)
strengthen the education management inforrnation system.
         A major challenge for the RGoB is the provision of educational access to children
in remote, sparsely-populated areas, where a significant proportion of the population is
found. With a relatively low number o f students in any given area and constraints on the
availability o f resources overall, the RGoB has established `community primary schools'
(CPSs) with the participation o f local communities, which contribute labor and locally-
available materials for school constructions. The Government contributes payment for
skilled labour and non-locally-available materials (such as tin sheet roofing or plexi-glass
windows), teaching-learning materials, and teachers as well as providing for regular
recurrent costs. Over the past several years, the number of CPSs has been growing and as
o f December 2004, there were 198 CPSs in Bhutan. Based on analytical work that
examined existing policies for increasing enrollment and completion rates, the RGoB is
implementingpolicy reforms concerning the location o f new CPSs.

         Bhutan has made important strides in recent years to improve the quality o f the
curricula used at all levels o f schooling. Considerable work has already been carried out
at the primary level (grades PP-6) to raise pedagogic quality and make curricula more
relevant and reflective o f the character of Bhutanese society and culture. The RGoB has
been particularly concerned with the extent to which students at all levels of education are
acquiring sufficient competency in the core subjects of English and Mathematics. The
RGoB seeks to improve quality by developing a School English Curriculum Framework
(SECF) which will guide the production of Programs o f Study (PoS) for each grade level.
This would be followed by the development o f English textbooks and the training o f
teachers intheir use.

         Implementing adequate arrangements for the monitoring and evaluation of
education sector results i s a key priority of the RGoB. Data are prepared on gross
enrollment, repetition, drop-out and promotion rates, and include some information on
the characteristics of students, but because the system is not automated, the recorded
information faces problems of accuracy and reliability. Financial information is also
difficult to obtain. Inorder to generate accurate and timely statistics, which can be used
to facilitate policy making, it is necessary to institute a user-friendly, functional, reliable
and automated education management information system. To this end, the RGUB
prepared a concept note for the adoption of an Education Management and Information
System (EMIS) inDecember 2005, which will be piloted between January 2006 and June
2007.

E.      Improving Health Care
        The RGoB continues to put great emphasis on the health sector, as evidenced by
the policy of providing health care free o f charge and the achievement (given our terrain
and scattered population) that 90 per cent of the population now live within 3 hours
walking distance from health facilities. The Ninth Five-Year Plan places an important
emphasis on improving the health of its citizens. The key health goals of the Ninth Plan
include: (a) enhancing the quality of health services, @) targeting health services to reach
the unreached, (c) building self-reliance and the sustainability of health services, (d)
intensifying human resource d'evelopment for health and establishing a system of
continuing education, (e) strengthening health management information systems and
research, (f) developing appropriate secondary and tertiary health care services, while
maintaining the balance between primary, secondary and tertiary health care, and (g)
bolstering the prevention and control of prevailing healthproblems. With the support of
the DPG, the RGoB will implmenent policy and institutional reforms, aimed at (i)
reducing maternal mortality (an MDG), (ii) curbing the spread of HIV/AIDS and STIs
(also an MDG), and (iii) improvingthe overall quality o f care. The difficulty of access to
some remote areas and the iack o fsufficient humanresources pose significant challenges.
        Available information suggests that significant      progress has been made in
reducing maternal mortality, which declined from 770 per 100,000 live births in 1984 to
260 in2000. Further reductions in the MMRare a major challenge, however, and can be
achieved mainly through improved access to quality antenatal care (ANC) as well as to
Essential Obstetric Care (EOC) by remote communities (institutional deIiveries by
adequately trained personnel). Cognizant of the need to prioritize adequate obstetric care
to reduce maternal mortality, the RGoB shifted its policy in 2000 from an emphasis on
promoting safe home deliveries to expanding access to EOC and institutional deliveries.
In 2000, Bhutan had eight health facilities providing EOC. Given the distances and
difficult terrain, the number and distribution o f these facilities has proven to be
inadequate. The goal of the Ninth Five-Year Plan i s to reach 100 percent coverage o f
institutionaldeliveries by establishing 29 functioning EOC facilities by 2007.
         Bhutan is at an early stage of the HIV/AIDS problem-UNAIDS                currently
estimates a 0.01% HIV prevalence rate-but          is experiencing exponential growth of
detected cases and a significant presence o f risk factors, such as high rates of sexually
transmitted infections, multiple sexual partners, commercial sex, and high mobility
within and outside the country. To avoid a full-blown epidemic, the RGoB i s working to
focus prevention efforts on highly vulnerable subpopulations (people engaging in high
risk behaviors and their partners) and on high transmission areas, such as border towns.
Although Bhutan i s at an early stage o f the epidemic, there is a strong political
commitment to fighting and containing the spread HIVIAIDS.
         Having significantly boosted the health infrastructure inrecent years, the RGoB is
increasingly focusing on improving the quality o f services, a criticat thrust o f the Ninth
Five-Year Plan. To this end, the RGoB has established a Quality Assurance and
Standardization Division, and has developed a conceptual framework for the
institutionalization of quality assurance (QA). With roles and responsibilities for the
various actors already defined, and some Q A activities already being tested, the RGoB
seeks to institutionalize QA at all levels o f the health sector. Relevant staff has been

trained on the principles of QA,and discussions are being held on the need to reestablish
the Health Technology and Quality Committee (HTQC).             It is expected that these
initiatives will improve the utilization and effectiveness o f existing services, and
contribute significantly to improvinghealth outcomes.
F.      Summing-up
        W e remain very much committed to our reform agenda - including the medium-
term institutional and policy reforms supported by the Development Policy Grant seeking
to strengthen fiscal and financial management, accelerate private sector development, and
improve outcomes in the education and health sectors. Attached to this letter is the
RGoB's reform program (supported by the DPG) inthe form o f a policy program matrix.
It will also serve as a framework to analyze and evaluate the reform program over time.
            W e would like to express our appreciation for the support and assistance from
the World Bank. The Bank has played a very important role in our development process
since the early 1980s and we look forward to continuingthis productive and very positive
collaboration inthe years ahead.

developments andprospects for the IDA DeTseloptusnt Policy Gantbeing consideredbythe
Executive Boardof the WorldBankonMay 18.

Bhutanconhues to enjoy robustgrowth, moderate inflation, andmanageablefiscal
and balance of payment3positions. Macroeconomicconditions appear to be et-olvmg
broadly inline with the 2005 Article fv projections:


b      RealGDPiSexpectedto growbyabout 7percentin2005J06 (July/June), somewhat
       lower thananticipated at the time of the 2005Article IV owingto the delay inthe
       Tala hydropowerproject coming on-stream to September 2006.
*      Inflationis expectedtorise to 5%percent in2005105 reflectinginpartthe
       pass-through of a 2005 civil savant wage increase. With interest rates broadly stable,
       credit growth has rma.ined strong with total credit extendedby the financialsector
       risingbyabout 19percent year-m-year inDecember 2005.

b      The overall fiscal deficit i s expected to fall in200Si06. The 20041;05 fiscal deficit rose
       to 6.4 percsntof GDPdue to exceptional outlays far the purchase ofanaircraft as
       well as a wage iucrease. The 2005106budget aims to reduce the o t * e ddeficit to
       about 5 percent of GDP m d y thr0ughreduced expmnlture.E x t e d loans are
       expected to finance about tUr0-th.ird.softhe anticipated budget deficit, with the
       remainderhanced thoughdomesticharrowing. Public sector debt i s expected to
       peakat about 84%percent o fGDPirz 2005i06, largely due to the impact ofthe
       external borrowkguudertalrwinzecmt years to finance the Tala hydropowerproject.

*      The current account deficit i s projectedto decline irz 2   5/06 after peakingat over
       23 percent of GDP in200U05 onaccount of imports for         &le Tala Hydropower project
       andthe purchase ofaircraft. Donor inflows shuuldbe sufficient to h c e the deficit
       andp&t      a small increase inintpmatianalresemes. This will leave the resen-e
       importcoverage ratio comfortableatjust over 10ruanths.

Macroeconamicpolity implementation has beensatisfactory and while &he
commencement af Tala will bringsubstantial benefits, it will also create same
challenges.


b      The initiation of the Tala hydropowerproject i s likely to result iua sipficant
       impro-mncrttinBhutan's medium-tern growthand export prospects. GDP growth is

   offset by the stixt o fTala debt service.

0  The exchangerate pegta the Indianrupee has sewed Bhutanw e l l helping to anchor
   d a t i o n expectations andfacilitate trade with Inda,Bhutan's largest trading partner.
   As Tala comes onstream, the challenge willbe to manage the r dappreciation
   pressures onthe nguhminthe context of the peg. The onus dllargely fall on the
   private sector to raise its efficiency so as to counter an).r e d qqxeciation effects.
   Howevzr, the RoyalMonetary Authority needs to remainwatchful that excess
   liquidityinthebankingsystemdoes notcontributeto overheatingpressures. Fixal
   tightening wouldalso help contain$emandpressures.

0  The keychallengefor k a Ipolicy willbe to enme that the revenue gain ficmTala
   will beusedto reduce debt andpromote development. Partofthe increase inthe
   debt-to-GDP ratio inrecent years will mderate once Tala comes on stream anddebt
   service should re&       manageable. Ifdebt is to remain on a cbwnwardtrajectory, the
   authorities will needto ensurethat their ambitiouspublic expenditweprogramis
   managedprudently.As envisagedinthe authoritiesymedium-term fiscal framework,
   the current budget balance millneedto move into surplus so the extra revenue
   generatedbyTala (estimated at 4%percent ofGDP, net of debt senice ona fdl year
   bask)        be directed to in&astrwtuse and social needs. Althoughgrants rnflowsare
   likely-to moderatefrom the recent five-year average of about 14percent of GDPpsr
   annum, the ftscaldeficit shauldfall tobetween3-3% percent ofGDPprovidedgrant
   inflows remainat a b u t 7percent o fGDP. Such a strategy wouldlimit recourse to
   external debt financing-which      shouldremainat concessionalterms-wkle          keeping
   dumestic financingto between $511percent-of GDPper annumto ensure that the debt
   burdencanhues to fall. The placement of the aunuaf budget ina medium-term
   budgetingframework will help in this regard by strengthening &e links between
   mudspadingtargets mdlong-term godsandaidingbetterprioritizationinthe
    went ofrevenue shortfalls.

   to promote gowthinthe non-powex sectors ofthe economy, including tourism.
