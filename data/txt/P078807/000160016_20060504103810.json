Bhutan Development Policy Grant\n            supports an ongoing reform program that focuses on: (a)\n            improved delivery of public services as a result of better\n            public budget and financial management, (b) greater foreign\n            direct investment and more job opportunities due to\n            improvements in the investment climate and increased labor\n            market flexibility, (c) higher school enrollment and\n            completion, particularly in previously under served areas,\n            as access to schooling services is expanded, and (d) better\n            health outcomes in such critical areas as maternal\n            mortality, as a result of increasing the number of births\n            delivered in health facilities. It includes four components:\n            (1) ensuring the maintenance of a sound macroeconomic\n            framework, strengthening fiscal policy, and bolstering\n            financial management; (2) enhancing the investment climate\n            for private sector growth and employment generation, (3)\n            augmenting the quality o f and access to education; and (4)\n            improving health care. The grant would be disbursed in one tranche."}, "docdt": "2006-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
