      an appropriate policy and institutional framework to improve\n            water resources planning, development and management;\n            initiating an integrated and comprehensive approach to water\n            shed management to sustain water sources; improving existing\n            irrigation system efficiency, thereby increasing\n            agricultural production, and alleviating rural poverty;\n            improving irrigation services in the long term by\n            accelerating management turnover of irrigation systems to\n            water users and by increasing the National Irrigation\n            Administration's (NIA's) institutional\n            effectiveness; and improving the environment in irrigated\n            areas.  The five year project will include the following\n            components: a) improved water resources planning and\n            management - preparation of a national water resources plan,\n            improvement of national data collection networks,\n            establishment of a national water information network and\n            strengthening of the National Water Resources Board (NWRB);\n            b) improved watershed management - formulation of a national\n            watershed management strategy and investment and\n            institutional strengthening program, investments for\n            improved management; and staff training/study watershed\n            management tour; c) improvement and repair of National\n            Irrigation System (NIS) - system improvement, repairs in\n            major structures, strengthening of Masiway dam, and\n            construction of sediment inclusion structures; d)\n            institutional strengthening of NIA and Irrigators\n            Associations (IAs) - staff training, consultancies,\n            computers and incremental operating costs to facilitate\n            progressive management; and e) environmental improvement -\n            control of schistosomiasis, erosion control works; sediment\n            monitoring, and establishment of an Environmental Unit\n            within NIA and provision of training and consultancy to the unit."}, "docdt": "1996-10-10T00:00:00Z"}
