Lessons\n            learned from the project: Water resources management remains\n            a priority of the national government and will continue to\n            be an important element in the country's development\n            strategy. The success of any irrigation management transfer\n            (IMT) initiative must include skills and technical\n            capacity-building for farmers especially in aspects of\n            irrigation modernization, monitoring and evaluation,\n            operations and maintenance, and funds management. Uniform\n            IMT policies applied to all systems, regardless of funding\n            sources, lead to effective overall management of irrigation\n            systems. Watershed management can be effective if activities\n            and investments are linked to local priorities, make use of\n            local knowledge and experiences, and are oriented towards an\n            ecosystem approach. Accurate information and a complete data\n            base significantly contribute to sound decision-making,\n            networking, and planning. A key factor that contributes to\n            the success of any IWRM effort is the strong partnership\n            among the different agencies and sectors involved in water\n            resource management. Undertaking a long-term programmatic\n            approach at the national and local levels will ensure and\n            sustain the positive impacts of IMT. Effective watershed\n            management requires a highly participative and\n            \"bottom-up\" approach that begins with\n            multi-sectoral consultations, planning, priority setting,\n            implementation and monitoring and evaluation with technical\n            guidance from the Department of Environment and Natural\n            Resources (DENR)."}, "docdt": "2006-06-18T00:00:00Z"}
