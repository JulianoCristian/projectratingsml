Guinea aims at increasing the\n            effectiveness of service delivery in primary education,\n            basic health, rural development, and paralegal services in\n            four prefectures and 24 rural development communities\n            (CRDs). There are four main components. The first\n            consolidates and deepens the budgetary reforms undertaken\n            since 1996, promoting fiscal decentralization by shifting\n            responsibilities for expenditures and revenues management to\n            local governments and communities; and assists local\n            governments in implementing a bottom-up performance\n            budgeting approach and promoting decentralized resource\n            mobilization. This component finances technical support and\n            carries out implementation studies, staff training and\n            workshops on budget and financial management, micro\n            computers and server systems, and critical operating costs.\n            The second component revises the institutional framework,\n            strengthens the ability of strategic and financial units,\n            establishes decentralized delivery and management systems;\n            and improves leadership and management capacity of elected\n            officials and administrative staff by providing training in\n            planning and budgeting, project identification and\n            preparation, and program monitoring and evaluation. The\n            third component improves communication with beneficiaries\n            with a public information program. The fourth component\n            introduces a performance incentive system to improve service delivery."}, "docdt": "1999-11-22T00:00:00Z"}
