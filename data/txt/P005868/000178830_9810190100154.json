providing\n            technical assistance, farmer and technician training, farm\n            inputs and agricultural equipment and research for the\n            project area. It will also include the rehabilitation and\n            improvement of the spate irrigation network, demonstration\n            of date palm rehabilitation and overhead irrigation systems,\n            feasibility studies for a possible follow-up project, and\n            flood and erosion control studies for all major agricultural\n            valleys in PDRY. The project will benefit directly 925\n            families. In addition, 200,000 persons will benefit\n            indirectly from the project through the increased\n            availability of foodstuffs."}, "docdt": "1983-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
