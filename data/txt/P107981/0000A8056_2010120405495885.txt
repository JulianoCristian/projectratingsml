                         Implementation Status Overview
                          Out of the total project funds of $7.44 million, 60% has been disbursed, mostly against the main project component; the Maldives Interoperable Payment System (MIPS) represents
                         67% of the total project costs. The main elements of the MIPS consist of the Mobile Payment System (MPS), a Real Time Gross Settlement system (RTGS), an image enabled
                         Automated Clearing House system (ACH), and an EFTPOS/ATM front end processing system. Thus, this technical solution will provide the simplest possible interface to Bank's

                         Specifically notable progress has been achieved as the vendor has already installed the hardware and most of the application software. They have also partially completed user
                         training and the User Acceptance Testing is well advanced. In order to avoid further delay, the MMA's (Maldives Monetary Authority) decision to install a `Gateway Protocol
                         Converter' will enable the National Switch to interface with the participant banks' card systems and thus support interoperability of electronic fund transfers. The MMA also has
                         posted an announcement on the MMA website calling for applications for the agents from all the islands. The MMA has also made provisions in the MIPS for all banks and all MNOs
                         to participate.

                         Already MMA has identified through a competition a name for the MPS account and a logo also has been selected. The business model has been discussed with the stakeholders;
                         the banks and the Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) and a detailed a marketing plan has also been prepared by the MMA. The MPBP team has conducted several focus group
                         meetings in outer atolls to assess the demand and is planning a nationwide marketing campaign closer to the Service Launch.

                         The regulations are being finalized by the recently recruited legal consultant and the regulations to be issued by Communications Authority of Maldives will be drafted. All regulations
                         will be uploaded on the web for public review and appropriate clearances will be obtained prior to issuance by the MMA.
