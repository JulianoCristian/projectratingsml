                         The objective of the project is to significantly increase the use of banking system transactions for effecting or receiving payments for labor, goods and services
                         nationwide through the implementation of a national inter-operable payments system that facilitates access to financial services and allows users access to their bank
                         account using any mobile phone operator and cashing through any banking agent.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The rating of the overall project performance has been downgraded to ‘moderately unsatisfactory’ since Mobile Payment system (MPS) operations face serious implementation
                         uncertainty. Out of the total project funds of US$7.44 million, 84% percent has been disbursed including the balance in the designated account. The main elements of the MIPS
                         consist of the Mobile Payment System (MPS), a Real Time Gross Settlement system (RTGS), an image enabled Automated Clearing House system (ACH), and an EFTPOS/ATM

                         the new mobile payment system as part of the country's financial sector.

                         The Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS) has been operational for over one year and is operating as planned. One of the sub components of the Automated Clearing House
                         (ACH) i.e Direct Credit payments has been launched successfully and is satisfying commercial bank and customer needs. The Mobile Payment System (MPS) bid closing was
                         extended at the request of the bidders. The draft regulations on consumer protection and on agency were reviewed and comments were provided to the MMA legal team. The
                         mission noted that very little progress has been made in the establishment of MPS since the last mission.
