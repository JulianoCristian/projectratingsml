                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the project is to significantly increase the use of banking system transactions for effecting or receiving payments for labor, goods and services
                         nationwide through the implementation of a national inter-operable payments system that facilitates access to financial services and allows users access to their bank
                         account using any mobile phone operator and cashing through any banking agent.

                         The rating of the overall project performance will be continue to remain ‘unsatisfactory’ since Mobile Payment system (MPS) operations face serious implementation uncertainty. Out
                         of the total project funds of US$7.44 million, 100% percent has been disbursed including the balance in the designated account. The bank is awaiting the refund of the unutilised
                         funds to cancel and reallocate US$ 1.5 millon as per the Government request.

                         The main elements of the MIPS consist of the Mobile Payment System (MPS), a Real Time Gross Settlement system (RTGS), an image enabled Automated Clearing House system
                         (ACH), and an EFTPOS/ATM front end processing system. Thus, this technical solution will provide the simplest possible interface to existing core banking systems of the banks that
                         will integrate all mobile network operators and all banks and ensure basic payment services throughout a set of remotely populated and disbursed island population. The second

                         project component ($1.0 million) focuses on building the legal and regulatory enabling environment, capacity within the Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA) and other related
                         stakeholder groups to manage the new mobile payment system as part of the country's financial sector.

                         The Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS) has been operational for almost two years and is operating as planned. One of the sub components of the Automated Clearing
                         House (ACH) i.e Direct Credit payments has been launched successfully and is satisfying commercial bank and customer needs. The Maldives Monetary Authority has not been able
                         implement the MPS yet. The draft regulations on consumer protection have been finalized and are being translated. The mission noted that no progress has been made in the
                         establishment of MPS and the remaining components of the ACH for almost a year.
