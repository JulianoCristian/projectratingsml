                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the project is to significantly increase the use of banking system transactions for effecting or receiving payments for labor, goods and services
                         nationwide through the implementation of a national inter-operable payments system that facilitates access to financial services and allows users access to their bank
                         account using any mobile phone operator and cashing through any banking agent.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Out of the total project funds of $7.4 million, 84% has been disbursed, mostly against the main project component; the Maldives Interoperable Payment System (MIPS) that
                         represents the majority of the total project costs. The main elements of the MIPS consist of the Mobile Payment System (MPS), a Real Time Gross Settlement system (RTGS), an
                         image enabled Automated Clearing House system (ACH), and an EFTPOS/ATM front end processing system. Thus, this technical solution will provide the simplest possible interface

                         The vendor has completed the installation of hardware and application software of all four systems (i.e RTGS , ACH , Switch and the MPS) for the primary and disaster recovery
                         sites. The RTGS and the direct credit system have been officially launched and are being used by the banks currently to transfer large value and time critical payments as well as
                         conduct direct credits. The RTGS has been operational for over one year and is operating as planned. Between 100 and 150 large value and time critical payments are being
                         processed on an average day. One of the sub components of the ACH (Direct credit payments) has also been launched successfully and is satisfying commercial bank and customer
                         needs. On an average 190 transactions are conducted daily. There had been 12,558 MVR transactions and 4,307 USD transactions since commissioning. The other components are
                         at different stages of implementation. Since the Bank of Maldives has declined to join the MIPS at this late stage, both the Ministry of Finance and Treasury and MMA have come up
                         with an alternate mechanism to achieve the project objective to provide better access to financial services for the Maldivians living especially in the outer atolls.
