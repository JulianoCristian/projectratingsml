                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the project is to significantly increase the use of banking system transactions for effecting or receiving payments for labor, goods and services
                         nationwide through the implementation of a national inter-operable payments system that facilitates access to financial services and allows users access to their bank
                         account using any mobile phone operator and cashing through any banking agent.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Out of the total project funds of $7.5 million, 84% has been disbursed, mostly against the main project component; the Maldives Interoperable Payment System (MIPS) that
                         represents the majority of the total project costs. The main elements of the MIPS consist of the Mobile Payment System (MPS), a Real Time Gross Settlement system (RTGS), an
                         image enabled Automated Clearing House system (ACH), and an EFTPOS/ATM front end processing system. Thus, this technical solution will provide the simplest possible interface

                         The vendor has completed the installation of hardware and application software of all four systems (i.e RTGS , ACH , Switch and the MPS) for the primary and disaster recovery
                         sites. The RTGS has been officially launched and is being used by the banks currently to transfer large value and time critical payments. The other three components are at different
                         stages of implementation with user testing in the real life and simulated environments well advanced to a point that demonstrates technical viability. The Bank of Maldives has
                         declined to join the MIPS at this late stage and both the Ministry of Finance and Treasury and MMA have not been able to persuade them and are looking at other options to ensure
                         better access to financial services for the Maldivian population especially those in the outer Atolls.
