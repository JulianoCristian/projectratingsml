"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Mobile Phone Banking\n            Project for Maldives were as follows: outcomes were\n            unsatisfactory, risk to development outcome was high, Bank\n            performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: this project has also demonstrated the need for\n            meaningful consultations with all stakeholders at all times.\n            Simply relying on the power and influence of the government\n            to force the participation of an unwilling participant did\n            not work in this case. On the other hand, continuous and\n            regular consultations at every step of the project, and\n            listening carefully to the needs of the participants, could\n            have been more effective in ensuring greater commitment and\n            ownership from the stakeholders. Shifting course during\n            project implementation, when a critical event that\n            significantly impacts project completion is triggered, is an\n            essential element of good project management. In this\n            project it seems that the project team never attempted to\n            change course during the six years of the project period.\n            Often there are different paths that can be taken to achieve\n            the same goal and this project might have had a more\n            successful end if the project had been restructured when it\n            was facing challenges. Another key lesson is the importance\n            of defining the project development objective and to link it\n            closely with a results framework (outcome and output\n            indicators) that allows accurate measurement of progress\n            towards achieving the project goal. Some project components\n            were not adequately linked to the PDO or the performance\n            indicators. As a result, it was difficult for the project\n            team to accurately assess project achievements and ratings\n            (even though these components were successfully implemented)."}, "docdt": "2014-06-10T00:00:00Z"}
