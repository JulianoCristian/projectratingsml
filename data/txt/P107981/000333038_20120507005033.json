The closing date for the project will be extended\n            from June 30, 2012 until December 31, 2013. The extension is\n            necessary to overcome implementation delays due to the\n            political turmoil in the country over the past few years,\n            which hampered the decision making process. The extension\n            will allow the completion of critical components of the\n            mobile payment system and of the automated clearing house,\n            as well as further capacity building for the Maldives\n            Monetary Authority (MMA) staff and implementation support to\n            ensure smooth functioning of the system after its launch.\n            Once implemented, the project will also provide learning\n            experience for the Bank to replicate in other similar\n            geographically challenged countries. In order to achieve the\n            completion of activities and supporting the implementation\n            during the initial implementation stage, an 18 month\n            extension is requested to the closing date. The recipient\n            has an action plan to implement the project during the\n            extension of the project. This will be the first extension\n            of the project."}, "docdt": "2012-05-04T00:00:00Z"}
