The objectives of the project were to\n            continue: (a) strengthening cost recovery, encouraging\n            efficient use of water resources, and supporting the\n            turnover of small public irrigation schemes to water\n            users' associations (WUAs); (b) supporting\n            institutional development; and (c) improving the physical,\n            programming, budgeting and institutional aspects of O&M,\n            so that the effectiveness of existing systems could be\n            sustained. Bank\u2019s performance was satisfactory. The Borrower\n            has generally performed satisfactorily. The key lessons\n            learned were as follows (a) good performance would be\n            achieved more efficiently if the institutional structure\n            under the Bupati and the process and procedures for\n            implementing the Irrigation Service Fee (ISF) program were\n            reviewed and strengthened; (ii) most construction quality\n            deficiencies are due to lack of compliance with existing\n            construction specifications and standards; there is a need\n            to establish accountability; (iii) expensive groundwater\n            development is unlikely to be economically viable if it is\n            used to irrigate low value crops with low cropping\n            intensity; and (iv) efficient water allocation to improve\n            water resources management requires an effective long-term\n            institutional arrangement."}, "docdt": "1996-01-24T00:00:00Z"}
