 Synopsis

  Successful economic and social development in Latin America and the Caribbean, as in other regions,
  hinges upon the availability of reliable and affordable energy supplies. IBRD is working with governments
  and the private sector throughout Latin America and the Caribbean to help connect more people and
  businesses to modern energy supplies that are supplied and consumed efficiently and are increasingly
  environmentally-friendly.
