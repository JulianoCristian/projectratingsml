                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The project development objective is to enhance the provision of environmental services of national and global significance and secure their long-term
                         sustainability. This would be done by strengthening and expanding the national PSAH and CABSA programs and supporting the establishment of local
                         payments for environmental services (PES) mechanisms in selected pilot areas.

                          The objective will be achieved through the following key outcomes and outputs: (i) strengthening the capacity of CONAFOR, community associations, and
                         NGOs to increase flexibility and improve efficiency of existing service provision to support long-term development of the PSAH program in Mexico; (ii)
                         establishing and securing sustainable long-term financing mechanisms; (iii) establishing legal, institutional, and financial arrangements to pilot market-based
                         mechanisms for payment for environmental services; (iv) documenting links between land use changes and water services improvements and biodiversity
                         conservation; and (v) defining good practices to replicate, scale up, and sustain market-based PES programs.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                            Yes           No

                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The global environment objective of the project is to enhance and protect biological diversity and preserve globally significant forest and mountain ecosystems.

                          This objective will be achieved through the following key outcomes and outputs: (i) improving the targeting of the existing PSAH program; (ii) piloting a market-
                         based system to contract environmental services; and (iii) establishing an endowment fund for biodiversity conservation to provide long-term financing for
                         payment for environmental services. The project will ensure that only sites with globally significant biodiversity will receive GEF funds under the national or
                         local programs in the project area. In addition, these sites (see Annex 17) are recognized as part of the national protected areas system. Furthermore, all land
                         management systems with PES support under the project (from any funding source) will be biodiversity-friendly (see Annex 10 for details).
