4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation period: Four years (1998-2001)
The proposed project would be a follow-on to the ongoing Antananarivo Urban Works Project (Cr. 2591 -MAG) which is implemented
by AGETIPA. It would broaden the scope of implementation to six additional cities.
Executing agencies:
Municipalities: Mayors and municipal technical agencies at the local level will prepare Priority Investment Programs of
Municipalities (PIPMs) with consultant assistance in consultation with beneficiary groups. These will be reviewed by municipal
councils and publicized.
Delegated Project Management Agencies (AGETIPs): AGETIPA will continue working in Antananarivo and will facilitate the
progressive development of delegated project management capacity in six regional cities. AGETIP(s) will package sub-projects from
the municipal PIPs into viable work programs in compliance with the project objectives and a Procedures Manual (Manuel de
Procedures). They will be responsible for managing design and supervision contracts and works contracts on a project-by-project basis
under delegation from the municipalities for a fee. Under the project, delegated contract management will be introduced on a phased
basis in the six regional cities. Ail regional municipalities and Antananarivo would prepare PIPMs, choose specific sub-projects to be
financed and benefit from investments under the project. However, local capacity to finance and manage investment programns is likely
to develop at different rates and all cities may not necessarily develop sufficient work volumes to warrant the establishment of fully
independent AGETIPs during the project period.
A three-step process for the expansion of delegated project management is proposed: (i) mayors identify one or more eligible sub-
project and deposit the necessary counterpart funds. Delegated project management agreements are signed with AGETIPA which
manages design/supervision and works contracts; (ii) AGETIPA verifies whether PIPs have been prepared with sufficient eligible sub-
projects and whether the municipality can provide counterpart fmancing (5% of works and consultant contracts) to support a
US$1 million program over two years. Delegated project management agreements are signed with AGETIPA, the mayors deposit
counterpart funds and a permanent office with one director is opened by AGETIPA to manage the programn (overhead less than
US$S00,000); (iii) PIPs and local fmancial capacities indicate that a US$3 million annual program over three years is feasible.
A separate AGETIP agency is created and a separate convention is signed between the Government and the new agency in accordance
with conditions acceptable to the Government and IDA. The new AGETIP's overhead could be up to US$250,000 per year.
Recruitment of directors for AGETIP(s) is on the basis of competitive advertisement from the private sector. He/she will report to a
General Assembly which includes representatives of local public interest groups such as unions and professional associations and other
NGOs.
Project oversight (policy guidance, etc.): The Govemment and the AGETIP(s) will sign Conventions giving AGETIP(s) full
responsibility to manage contract administration. The Ministry of Urban and Regional Planning (Aménagement du Territoire et de la
Ville) is the Government Ministry responsible for AGETIP(s).
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements: AGETIP(s) would follow a detailed Manuel de Procedures, and be examined through
biannual technical, managerial and financial audits. AGETIP(s) report progress on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis to the
Government and the Bank and to the mayors of their respective towns. Annual reviews will be carried out to monitor progress on
works, maintenance, and beneficiary satisfaction, and assess and modify as agreed the types of works to be financed under the project,
the geographical extension of investments, AGETIP(s) costs, structure and fees and municipal financial contributions.

project:                               Date ofBoard Discussion: February 18, 1997
Broad-based growth led by the private sector (adequate infrastructure; private sector capacity)
Strengthening the public sector in its changing role (decentralization)
Human capital development (direct poverty alleviation activities).
6. Main sector issues and government strategy:
The need for further improvements in infrastructure and services is evident not only in Antananarivo but also in secondary centers
throughout the country. Experience with the ongoing Antananarivo Urban Works Project suggests that a broader use ofdelegated
project management could introduce efficiencies in other regions of the country (sec Section 10). It is also important to improve the
capacity of local govermments to manage and maintain new investments.
The Govermment is already supporting a two-pronged strategy to confront deficits in urban infrastructure and services. First,
implementation capacity is being expanded under the ongoing Urban Works Project with the development of AGETIPA in
Antananarivo and the introduction of delegated project management capacity in four additional cities -- Antsiranana, Mahajanga,
Toamasina and Antsirabe. It also proposes that two additional cities -- Fianarantsoa and Toliary -- be considered for future activity.
Second, there is a recognition that imnproved imnplementation capacity must be complemented by improvements in local govermnent
finance and infrastructure management. A decentralization program has recently been initiated by Government, beginning with the
clection of mayors and local councils and the assignment to the municipalities of responsibility for infrastructure maintenance and
services. The decentralization process would be assisted by IDA through a proposed Decentralized Infrastructure Management
Project, scheduled for FY98, which would design clear guidelines for local govemment functions and inter-governmental relations,
including fiscal relations, and introduce inprovements in local finance and management. In addition, the French MCAC is working
with the six largest municipal governments to build their management capacity. In particular, they are helping to establish contrats de
villes, under which cities would undertake to improve management and revenue collection. This activity would complement the
proposed project which would augment project implementation capacity.
7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
Creation of new AGETIP Agencies: There is a political urge to create separate regional capacity for delegated project management.
However, to ensure adequate technical management and financial control, clear criteria are being established to goverm the
development of regional agencies (see Section 4). The new entities would have a sufficient volume of activity to justify their
projected overheads. A phased approach would also be necessary, since Government requires that new entities be established for at
least one year to be recognized as public utilities before being able to make transactions with public funds.
Use ofsmall and rmedium enterprises. In the ongoing project, 60% ofcontracts have been awarded to the largest 10% ofcontractors
(three large international fiTns; the rest medium domestic firms). The use of larger contractors has been due in part to the type of
works carried out which included a high percentage of main city streets. In this project, sub-projects using labor intensive techniques
and small contracting and consulting firms will be given greater encouragement. Specific targets for employment generation have
been established. A large training program for small firms is included in the project. Such efforts will be especially necessary in
regional cities.
Support for decentralized municipal management. In order to assist the decentralization process, the project wilI work closely with
newly elected local governments and with beneficiary groups to help them prepare Priority Investment Programs. This work, only
partly successful under the ongoing project, will be given more emphasis and is expected to have greater success now that elected
mayors and municipal councils are in place. A proposed IDA project and ongoing MCAC assistance for improved municipal
management (sec Section 6) will complement this process.
Financing and maintenance of infrastructure. Municipal contributions to project fmnancing will be paid in advance before construction.
The national contribution will include financing ofthe tax percentage of total cost. Each annual review will assess whether adequate
maintenance has been carried out to maintain project works. If not, maintenance sub-projects would be included among the sub-
projects of the following year.

8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
*  Until recently, the rehabilitation and maintenance of municipal infrastructure was undertaken by municipal employees through
force account and managed by the municipal engineering department. This has proven very inefficient. The Antananarivo Urban
Works Project (Credit 2591 -MAG) has demonstrated the success of delegated project management which would be continued and
expanded under the proposed project. Experience of the first project shows that the cost of works is 20% to 25% lower than with
traditional methods.
*  Encouraged by the present successful experience of AGETIPA in Antananarivo, other regions are eager to have independent
AGETIP(s), consistent with their decentralization efforts. However, while independent regional management remains the ultimate
objective, it is recommended that a more prudent progressive evolution in this direction be adopted to allow for the development
ofregional implementation capacity and public works management before creating independent agencies.

mid-term review, three times the number of contracts originally expected had been signed and disbursements were almost twice their
projected level. In less than two years (as of the mid-term review), the project had rehabilitated 81 km. of roads (of the 119 km. of
main roads identified by the Ministry of Public Works), 50 km. of sidewalks, 60 km. of gutters and drains, 16 stairways and public
alley-ways, about 100 retaining walls and two covered markets in Antananarivo. Success is due in part to the speed of implementation
ofsub-projects. AGETIPA issues contracts in 7 days and pays work orders in a maximum of 10 days. A total of 387 contractors and
40 consulting firms had been pre-qualified by the mid-term review, and 128 contractors and 30 consulting firms had participated in
bidding. After 28 months of implementation (up to December 5, 1996), the project had generated 100,000 man-months of
employment in 638 signed contracts, of which 454 have been finished. AGETIPA's overhead costs are only 4% of works executed.
AGETIPA headquarters staffhas consisted of only 6 professional staff and a total of 12 staffto manage a US$18 million program over
3 years. Of the 683 contracts signed, 77% have finished within the expected time allotment and 68% have achieved cost estimates. In
the training of enterprises, the ongoing project has set up several "construction site schools" which helped to improve skills of 101
workers and 57 supervisors. The public works profession has aiso been helped by the creation by AGETIPA of associations for
consulting firms and for contractors. These initiatives can now be extended to other regions.
The strengths of AGETIPA are autonomous management and transparent involvement of the private sector; it has quickly provided
highly visible results. Experience in West Africa has shown that a particular risk of AGETIPs is that they could take over resource
allocation and subvert the prerogatives of elected authorities and user groups. For this reason, more recent AGETIP projects are
placing a greater emphasis on enhancing the municipalities' ability to plan for and manage urban facilities (e.g. Mauritania and
Senegal) and on working in concert with national decentralization efforts which strengthen local government. The proposed project
would complement ongoing efforts to improve decentralized municipal management.
11. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
Elected mayors have requested in letters to AGETIPA that infrastructure investments and the benefits of delegated project
management be extended to their cities. There is a strong sense of ownership, since the mayors would select sub-projects according to
local priorities; some have begun to deposit counterpart funds for the project. A letter from the Prime Minister to IDA dated
December 18, 1996 requested that AGETIPA activities be extended to Antsirabe, Toamasina, Mahajanga and Antsiranana under the
present project. A letter from the Prime Minister dated February 20, 1997 requested a new credit from IDA to support the
development of regional delegated project management capacity, to support the development of economic and social infrastructure and
to help develop small and medium enterprises. The newly elected President has personally requested Mr. Wolfensohn to assist the
establishment ofthe AGETIP system in the regions under the proposed project. AGETIPA has begun identifying and training
personnel for regional activities.
12. Value added of Bank support:
The Bank has provided most of the support for delegated project management in Madagascar to date, and it brings to bear a large
amount of experience with AGETIP-type projects from the rest of Africa. There is an active Bank-sponsored network of these
experiences which benefits agencies such as AGETIPA. The Bank's broader experience in building decentralized local government
capacity throughout Africa and specifically in Madagascar is also directly relevant. Further support is critical to broaden the
geographical scope and expand the types of investment to be undertaken through delegated project management in Madagascar. Other
donors have noted that the project would complement their efforts and that the new implementation capacity could facilitate their
programs in the future.

Madagascar: Urban Infrastructure Project
Block 3: Summary Project Assessments (Detailed assessments are in the project file. See Annex 8):
13. Economic            [XI  Cost-Benefit Analysis
assessment                    ERR=  12 %
(see Annex 4):                Individual sub-projects will be subjected to economic
analysis to determine their eligibility for fmancing.
The above rate is the minimum rate of return to be met
in order for sub-projects to be financed under the
project. The average economic rate ofreturn of
representative samples ofroad sub-project is 34.8%.
Fiscal impact (for alt projects):
The fiscal impact would be neutral for the central Government because the VAT to be collected on investments associated with
the project investments would be about 19%, and other lessor taxes would be 1% to 2%, indicating that the net impact on the
Government would be negligible. At the local level, additional revenue from revenue earning projects and savings on economic sub-
projects is expected to cover increased recurrent costs mainly the maintenance ofrehabilitated infrastructure (see Annex 4).
Ongoing FAC supported initiatives to improve municipal management are also expected to generate increased local revenue.
14. Financial assessment (see Annex 5):         NPV=US$              million; FRR=  15 %
The above is a minimum rate of return to be met in order for revenue earning sub-projects to be included in the project.
A sample of revenue earning projects (e.g. markets, abattoirs) indicates an average financial rate ofreturn of 34.3% which indicates
that feasible sub-projects are available. Financial analysis will be conducted on proposed new sub-projects to ensure a financial rate of
return ofat least 15%.
15. Technical assessment:
AGETIPA has established a code of technical standards (charte de qualite) in consultation with the construction industry.
Consulting and contracting firms are expected to subscribe to this code when awarded their furst contracts. The project includes
biannual technical audits which monitor actual enforcement of the code. Technical audits of the ongoing project indicated positive
changes in infrastructure implementation and found overall works quality to be satisfactory.
16. Institutional assessment:
(a) Executing agencies: The project is extending the benefit of delegated project management to six regional cities. AGETIPA has
developed a successful model for this in Antananarivo (see Section 10). A program for phased introduction of delegated contract
management is outlined in Section 4.
(b) Project management: The use of Priority Investment Programs of Municipalities (PlPMs) will be introduced to help
municipalities to imnprove selection of municipal investments. Direct municipal financial contributions to the project will enhance
ownership and local responsibility and will be an incentive to improve the management of financial resources.
17. Social Assessment:
At the mid-term review of the ongoing project, social assessment showed a high level of beneficiary satisfaction with the sub-
projects that had been implemented. Urban infrastructure improvement and market programs will have a direct impact on living
conditions ofthe urban poor. Under the proposed project, social impacts will be assessed by consultants annually and reviewed during
annual reviews.

18. Environmental assessment:         Environmental Category  []  A     [x]      B      []   C
The sub-projects financed under the project would provide localized improvements in the environment, as has been the case
under the ongoing AGETIPA project, consistent with experience under most AGETIP projects in Africa. The project has, therefore,
been given a "B" rating. As was the case under the ongoing project, environmental assessments have been carried out for a
representative sample of each type of sub-project in each city before appraisal. Based on this information and on experience under the
ongoing project, a questionnaire has been developed for screening sub-projects which deserve special investigation and specific
mitigation measures. Sub-projects likely to have significant environwental impact, and all revenue generating sub-projects, will be
subject to an environmental assessment. During implementation, AGETIPs and supervising engineers will ensure that any mitigation
measures called for are taken by contractors. The adequacy of environmental assessment and mitigation procedures wilI be carefully
examined at annual reviews.

20. Sustainability:
Sustainability is dependent on the capacity of central and local government to finance works and maintain them over time.
Experience elsewhere has shown that governments are often willing to contribute larger amounts of their own funds once the success of
delegated project management has been demonstrated. Additional revenues created by the project are projected to be higher than costs.
Efforts are being made in parallel to improve local governmnent finances and maintenance efforts (see Section 6).

22. Possible controversial aspects:
Experience with ongoing and complete projects of this type have shown very few controversial aspects. There is very little opposition
to the AGETIP program in Madagascar or in the Bank. There are potential controversies between AGETIPA in Antananarivo and the
regional authorities who would like to see more rapid creation of independent branches. This will require a careful balance between
regional aspirations and the need to establish efficient financial and technical control and to achieve a viable work program with
acceptable administrative costs.

Detailed Project Description
Project Component 1 - US$39.7 million WORKS (including design and supervision)
Works will be selected from the Priority Investment Programs prepared by municipalities.
They would meet eligibility criteria (minimum rates of return, feasibility of implementation).
There will be two categories of works: (i) economic sub-proiects, including roads, drainage, sidewalks,
public stairways and retaining walls; and (ii) revenue earning sub-projects, including markets, bus stations
and abattoirs. Additional types of works may be added to the list of eligible project types during the annual
reviews, upon request by the mayors. Works will be undertaken by contractors and design and supervision
by local consultants. Works will cost US$36.8 million; design and supervision will cost US$2.9 million.
Project Component 2 - US$O.6 million EQUIPMENT
Provision of basic laboratory equipment in cities where it is lacking, provision of pre-cast concrete
molding machines in cities where the construction industry is weak. These machines will be leased to the
private sector during the projected period.
Project Component 3 - US$2.5 million TRAINING and STUDIES (other than design and supervision)
Training (US$1.2 million) will be undertaken for municipal staff to improve project selection and
management. Contractors will be trained to enhance the quality of works, work site management and
corporate management. Presentations will be given on environmental management. Training will also
support the development of staff who will support the proposed expansion of the AGETIP system.
Studies will include technical and fmancial audits of the project (US$300,000);
economic and environmental assessment (US$400,000); information and sensitization canpaigns
(US$400,000); and preparation and expenses for annual reviews (US$200,000).
Project Component 4 - US$3.0 million AGENCY OPERATING FEES
Agency operating costs will be paid on a fee basis on all contracts managed by AGETIP(s).
The average fee will be about 6.8% covering all wages, rents and other recurrent costs, amortization of
equipment and initial setting-up costs. All costs would be net of taxes.
AGETIP Project Management
AGETIPA was created under the ongoing Madagascar Urban Works Project (Credit 2591-MAG)
as a non-profit organization to mnanage public works contracts in the Antananarivo area under a delegated
project management system. Other similar agencies will be created under the project. AGETIPs sign
specific conventions with project sponsors (ministries and municipalities). They contract design and
supervision services to consultants and works to contractors.

considered under this phase. AGETIPA charges its usual management fee (6%/0),*
Preparation for Phase Il: AGETIPA recruits a consulting fim to assist municipalities to prepare a
Priority Investrment Plan of Municipalities (PIPM) of sub-projects (standard TORs; nature of works at
the discretion of the mayor). AGETIPA informs the mayor which sub-projects are eligible for the
project. A draft PIPM is published, a public meeting is held and the proposals are submitted to the
city council for a vote, As soon as the PIPM and the financial condition of the commune indicate that
an annual program of at least US$I million is sustainabte for at least two years, Phase Il can begin.
Phase : The mayors indicate at the beginning of the year the sub-projects from their PIPMs they want
to include i-n the annual work program. AGETIPA evaluates the eligibility of each sub-project and the
capacity of the commune to pay its contribution. AGETIPA puts the sub-projects proposed by ail
- mayors into a consolidated draft annual work program and submits it to govermuent (IDA clearance).
AGETIPA infonns the mayors of the decisions taken and signs conventions of delegated project
management for the accepted sub-projects. The mayors pay the communes' contributions (in one or
more installments). AGETIPA begins the sub-projects for which deposits have been made. AGETIPA
opens a permanent office with a project director (expected annual opersting costs less than
US$100,000). AGETIPA charges a management fee 1% higher than its standard fee.*
Preparation for Phase III: Local associations are recognized as associations d'utilité publique and
adopt the Manuel de Procedures,  The PIPM, the financial capacity of the communes and
commitments from other projects/donors guarantee a minimum annual program of sub-projects of
US$3 rnillion sustainable for at least three years.
Phase III. AGETIP X is created. The Government signs a convention with AGETIP X to receive
funds and manage sub-projects in accordance with procedures established under the project. AGETIP
X then plays the role of delegated project manager according tothe Manuel de Procedures. Its fe is
10% at the beginning, unless its work volume permits a lower fee. This will be reviewed periodically.*
AGETIPA X has a full management team (expected operating costs lesm than US$250,000; a work
program of over US$3 million per year). AGETIP X sends annual programn proposals to AGETIPA
which consolidates them for subrnission to Government and to IDA for clearance. AGETIPA informs
AGETIP X and the mayor of the Government's decision.
* As a non-profit agency, any surplus earned by AGETIP(s) would be invested in additional works.

Cost Benefit Analysis Summary
Economic analysis of proposed sub-projects wil1 be undertaken to ascertain their eligibility for the project.
Economic sub-projects would have a minimum economic rate of return of 12%. Road rehabilitation sub-projects
involve the rehabilitation of existing roads, drains and sidewalks. The main types of benefits are an increase in
transport speed leading to a reduction of transport time and lower vehicle maintenance and repair costs. Drain
improvements reduce the future cost of road maintenance. The health benefits of drain improvements, potentially
large especially in coastal cities, have not been quantified. Economic evaluations of a sample of road sub-projects
proposed for regional cities have revealed ERRs ranging from 17% for roads requiring major rehabilitation to 36%
for roads requiring only resurfacing (see table). Proposed stairway rehabilitation would yield benefits from
increased pedestrian use and reduced future maintenance costs. A sample stairway yields an ERR of 64%; a
retaining wall yields an ERR of 32%. The samples indicate that the target ERR of 12% is likely to be exceeded in
many cases. To ensure simplicity and transparency, shadow pricing of labor has not been used.
Revenue earnings among sub-projects (markets, abbatoirs, transport depots) would be expected to have an
economic rate of return of 15%. The rehabilitation of markets in regional centers is intended to improve the
conditions for the sale of goods and services. The density of markets and stalls will be reduced and drainage works
constructed. Benefits are estimated based on expected rents. Municipalities will be encouraged to involve the
private sector in the operation and maintenance of revenue earning facilities. Proposed market sub-projects for
Antsirabe and Mahajanga show ERRs of 19% and 29%, indicating the target ERR of 15% would be attainable.
Table A also shows the sensitivity ERRs to an increase in investment and operating costs of 10%. In
almost all cases the proposed sub-projects would remain feasible even with higher costs.
The results of economic analysis for sub-projects will be examined at annual reviews and changes, if
necessary, will be incorporated into the methodology.

Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement
Procurement methods (Table A)
Civil Works contracts for construction, repair and rehabilitation of infrastructure which cost less than
US$500,000 per contract up to an aggregate amount of US$36.8 million would be procured through NCB
procedures applicable to AGETIPA and described in the Manual of Procedures which is acceptable to IDA.
Although most contracts are not expected to exceed US$150,000 each, this threshold has been accepted on the
recommendation of the Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) of July 1995. AGETIPA will maintain a
roster of contractors, according to procedures acceptable to IDA, spelled out in the Manual of Procedures.
Contracts for goods and equipment costing more than US$ 1 00,000 for an aggregate of US$300,000 would
be purchased through ICB in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA
Credits (published in January 1995 and revised in August 1996). Contracts for equipment available locally for an
aggregate amount of US$200,000 which cost more than US$30,000 but less than or equal to US$ 100,000 would be
procured through NCB procedures acceptable to IDA. Small quantities of office supplies and consumable materials,
which are normally available off-the-shelf at economical prices and cannot be grouped into packages of US$30,000,
would be procured through prudent national shopping, based on price quotations obtained from at least three
reliable suppliers, provided that the aggregate does not exceed US$100,000.
Consultant Services financed by IDA would be for (i) design and supervision of works; (ii) technical and
financial audits; (iii) technical studies; and (iv) training, a total of US$5.45 million. Consultants would be hired in
accordance with the Banks Guidelinesfor the Selection and Employment ofconsultants (January 1997). Most
consultant selection (design and supervision, technical audits, training and technical studies) will be addressed
through competition among qualified short-listed firms in which the selection will be based on Quality-and Cost-
Based Selection (QCBS) by evaluating the quality of the proposai before comparing the cost of the services to be
provided. For financial audits of a standard nature (estirnated at US$ 160,000), Least-Cost Selection (LCS) will be
the most appropriate method. The fîrm will be selected, provided its technical proposal receives the minimum
mark. Individual Consultants for some specialized technical studies (estimated at US$400,000) where firms would
not be required would be selected based on consultant' experience and competence for the assignment.
Short-lists for contracts estimated under US$200,000 may be comprised entirely of national consultants if a
sufficient number of qualified finns (at least three) are available at competitive costs. However, if foreign firms
have expressed interest, they will not be excluded.
Prior review thresholds (Table B)
IDA financed contracts above the threshold of US$150,000 equivalent for works and US$ 100,000 for
goods respectively would be subject to IDA's prior review. Ail contracts during the first year of the project below
the thresholds, and selective contracts thereafter, will be subject to post-review. Prior IDA review will not apply to
contracts for the recruitment of consulting firms and individuals estimated to cost less than US$50,000 and
US$25,000 respectively.
