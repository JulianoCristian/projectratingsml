Lessons learned from the project: In-country\n            teams closely cooperating with the borrower and the\n            implementing agency can achieve highly satisfactory results.\n            Supervision with a strong focus on objectives leads to\n            higher degrees of achievement. Community involvement in\n            subproject identification, prioritization and design is very\n            likely to improve acceptance and sustainability. The level\n            of municipal contributions needs to be set following a prior\n            evaluation of their capacity to mobilize the required funds.\n            A strong emphasis on labor intensive approaches is not\n            always compatible with community preferences and\n            infrastructure priority needs. Improving infrastructure\n            coverage/rehabilitation requires a long-term commitment and\n            can not be achieved through a one-time intervention.\n            Improving infrastructure coverage/rehabilitation requires a\n            concomitant effort to enhance municipal finances."}, "docdt": "2005-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
