system during the period from January 1, 1980\n            to June 30, 1981. COPEL's overall program, of which the\n            project forms a part, will provide the facilities required\n            to serve the expected loads in COPEL's service area\n            (the state of Parana), mostly related to industrial growth.\n            The program will also make public service electricity\n            available to about 45,000 new low-income urban consumers and\n            in connecting about 50,000 new rural consumers. The project\n            includes the following: (i) construction of about 810\n            circuit-kilometers of subtransmission lines at 230 KV, 138\n            KV and 69 KV and installation of about 2,120 MVA of\n            additional transformer capacity; (ii) construction of about\n            2,250 circuit-kilometers of distribution lines at 34.5 KV\n            and lower voltages, and about 590 circuit-kilometers of\n            feeders, and installation of about 410 MVA of additional\n            transformer capacity, for the connection of about 415,000\n            new consumers; (iii) modernization and enlargement of\n            laboratories and acquisition of maintenance and operation\n            equipment; and about 245 man-months of consultants'\n            services for preparation of bidding documents and equipment\n            fabrication inspections."}, "docdt": "1979-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
