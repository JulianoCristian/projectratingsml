Some lessons learned included:\n            when the project was initiated, very little was known about\n            the extent of the damage to the infrastructure or the status\n            and trajectory of the security situation. This uncertainty\n            was the principal driver of both the cost overruns and the\n            project delays. The costs increased because more repairs\n            than expected were needed to rehabilitate the hydropower\n            facility and because there was significant added security\n            cost. Some of the security factors should have been\n            considered up front, such as the cost of demining and\n            certification, but others were unexpected. The initial\n            understanding was that the security situation would\n            continually improve so there was never an agreement about\n            how to manage or pay for security. By the time things got\n            worse and provision of security was necessary, Kredit fuer\n            Wiederaufbau (KfW) had to meet Voith Siemens' demands,\n            with little room for negotiation since there was no\n            reference price or competitive bidding process. At that\n            point, the only options were to reach a common understanding\n            regarding the cost or not complete the project."}, "docdt": "2009-09-28T00:00:00Z"}
