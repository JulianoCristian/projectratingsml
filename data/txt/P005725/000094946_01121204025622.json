{"cdata!": "Project outcome is rated as satisfactory\n            because it achieved most of its major relevant objectives\n            with only few shortcomings, project achievements are likely\n            to be sustained, and the net present value of economic flows\n            are positive at a discount rate of 10 percent. Both World\n            Bank and Borrower performances are judged satisfactory.\n            Lessons learned include the following: Forest research must\n            be designed as an integral part of project activities to\n            ensure coherence between priorities of the research team,\n            administration, and end-users. For results to be meaningful,\n            research must be demand-driven and responsive to the needs\n            of end-users. Integrating research into the overall project\n            also creates stronger links between the operational agency\n            and the research institutes, which results in a research\n            program consistent with sector development needs, Technical\n            solutions that are simple and easy are likely to be adopted\n            and accepted more easily. Decentralization of project\n            management functions can lead to more efficient project\n            implementation. Also, it allows for capacity building to\n            benefit a larger number of people. A computerized monitoring\n            and evaluation system must be developed for the regions to\n            minimize multiple and manual handling of data and minimize\n            errors. The use of a participatory approach in an\n            inexperienced agency requires extensive capacity building,\n            and should include techniques for knowledge sharing,\n            consensus building, and conflict resolution mechanisms."}, "docdt": "2001-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
