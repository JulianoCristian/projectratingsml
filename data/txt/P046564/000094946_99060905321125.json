The objective of\n            the project is to alleviate chronic poverty for the absolute\n            poor living in remote and inaccessible villages of Gansu and\n            Qinghai Provinces and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Each\n            of the three areas has created a separate plan dealing with\n            resettlement and compensation. In Inner Mongolia, there are\n            no foreseen problems in borrowing land for the\n            infrastructure construction component (rural roads). Within\n            the Gansu province, 9,552 people will be affected among 28\n            townships. The Qinghai project will include voluntary\n            resettlement for 57,775 people in the region, although the\n            impact of land acquisition and land use change on the sparse\n            local population is small with no housing, wells, fences, or\n            other fixed assets affected."}, "docdt": "1999-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
