The Terms of Reference required that the Panel\n            investigate whether the Bank made violations with respect to\n            the design and appraisal of the project: BP 17.50\n            (Disclosure of Information); OD 4.01 (Environmental\n            Assessment); OD 4.20 (Indigenous Peoples); OD 4.30\n            (Involuntary Resettlement); OP 4.09 (Pest Management); OP/BP\n            4.37 (Safety of Dams): OP/BP 12.10 (Retroactive Financing);\n            and OP/BP 10.00 (Investment Lending-Identification to the\n            Board Presentation). This report concludes that Management\n            is substantially in compliance with the provisions of Annex\n            B of OD 4.00 (Environmental Policy for Dam and Reservoir\n            Projects), and those provisions stated above concerning\n            Safety of Dams, Investment Lending: Identification, and\n            Retroactive Financing. However, the Bank is in apparent\n            violation of several provisions of OD 4.01, OD 4.20, OD\n            4.30, OP 4.09, OP 10.00 (Investment Lending: Identification\n            to Board Presentation), and BP 17.50 (Disclosure of Information)."}, "docdt": "2000-04-28T00:00:00Z"}
