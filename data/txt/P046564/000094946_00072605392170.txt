About the Panel
The Inspection Panel was created in September 1993 by the Board of Executive
3           Directors of the World Bank to serve as an independent mechanism to ensure
accountability in Bank operations with respect to its policies and procedures. The
Inspection Panel is an instrument for groups of two or more private citizens who
I           believe that they or their interests have been or could be harmed by Bank-financed
activities to present their concerns through a Request for Inspection. In short, the
|           Panel provides a link between the Bank and the people who are likely to be affected by
the projects it finances.
I           Members of the Panel are selected "on the basis of their ability to deal thoroughly and
fairly with the request brought to them, their integrity and their independence from the
Bank's Management, and their exposure to developmental issues and to living
conditions in developing countries."' The three-member Panel is empowered, subject
to Board approval, to investigate problems that are alleged to have arisen as a result
of the Bank having ignored its own operating policies and procedures.
I          Processing Requests
After the Panel receives a Request for Inspection it is processed as follows:
I
* The Panel decides whether the Request is prima facie not barred from
Panel consideration.
I                . The Panel registers the Request-a purely administrative procedure.
* The Panel sends the Request to Bank Management, which has 21 working-
3                days to respond to the allegations of the Requesters.
* The Panel then conducts a short 21 working-day assessment to determine
the eligibility of the Requesters and the Request.
I                .  If the Panel does not recommend an investigation, and the Board of
Executive Directors accepts that recommendation, the case is considered
closed. The Board, however, may approve an investigation against the Panel's
recommendation if it so warrants.
. Three days after the Board decides on whether or not an investigation
3                should be carried out, the Panel's Report (including the Request for Inspection
and Management's Response) is publicly available at the Bank's InfoShop and
the respective Bank Country Office.
IBRD Resolution No. 93-10: IDA Resolution No. 93-6.
I
l



* If the Panel recommends an investigation, and the Board approves it, the
Panel undertakes a full investigation, which is not time-bound.
* When the Panel completes an investigation, it sends its findings and    I
conclusions on the matters alleged in the Request for Inspection to the Board
as well as to Bank Management.
* The Bank Management then has six weeks to submit its recommendations
to the Board on what actions the Bank would take in response to the Panel's
findings and conclusions.                                                 I
* The Board then takes the final decision on what should be done based on
the Panel's findings and the Bank Management's recommendations.
. Three days after the Board's decision, the Panel's Report and
Management's Recommendation are publicly available through the Bank's
InfoShop and the respective Country Office.

When the Board of Executive Directors of the World Bank decided on September 9,
1999 to ask the Inspection Panel to conduct an investigation of the Qinghai
component of the China: Western Poverty Reduction Project, the multifaceted
nature of the assignment was only dimly appreciated. The issues ranged from
seemingly mundane and simple to some of the most complex and difficult that the
Panel has encountered over the past five years of its existence.
The Panel could not have undertaken and completed the investigation without the
very kind assistance of a large number of people in Washington, D.C., Beijing,
Qinghai and elsewhere, and it wishes to acknowledge this and express its
appreciation for their cooperation and support.
The Panel wishes to thank especially the Requesters, other NGOs and individuals
for their assistance, and for the hundreds of people it met in the Project areas who
shared their hopes and aspirations and, in some cases, their homes with us.
The Bank staff involved in this Project are an exceptional group of people. Under
the Resolution establishing the Panel, the Bank and the Bank alone is the object of
this and any investigation. Even though staff members were under the spotlight,
they worked long and hard to respond to the Panel's many requests for documents
and other information and they patiently and often eloquently expressed their own
assessment of the Project in interviews. The Director and staff of the Bank's
Resident Mission China could not have been more helpful and the Panel wishes to
recognize their enterprise, hospitality and assistance throughout the investigation.
The Panel also wishes to thank the Executive Director representing China and his
office for their advice and assistance especially concerning the field visits. The
Chinese Government officials in Beijing (including those of the Ministry of Finance,
the State Ethnic Minorities Commission, and the State Council Leading Group on
Poverty Alleviation) were very helpful in assisting the Panel to place the Project in
the broader context of Chinese Government policies. Special thanks are also due to
the Qinghai Provincial Government staff in Xining, especially the Executive Vice
Governor of Qinghai, the Provincial Project Management Office and the Qinghai
Research Institute of Plateau Geography, including the social and environmental
staff, for their generous assistance and for creating a congenial atmosphere for the
Inspection Team during its visits to the Project areas.

Representatives and officials of the following embassies in Beijing deserve a special
word of gratitude for sharing with the Panel Members their views and insights:
Australian Embassy, British Embassy, Canadian Embassy, European Commission          I
Delegation, French Embassy, German Embassy, Swiss Embassy, and the U.S.
Embassy.
The Panel also wishes to thank the staff in the Beijing offices of the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Office for Project Services
(UNOPS), the Development Cooperation office for the European Commission
Delegation, Australian Development Cooperation, World Food Programme, Ford
Foundation, and other organizations who helped the Panel Team to compare this
Project with poverty alleviation projects undertaken in Qinghai Province by other
international aid donors and organizations.
The Panel wishes to express its appreciation and admiration to the members of its
own Team; our consultants Vernon Heywood, Richard Fuggle, Paul Taylor, Robert
Wade and Richard Tillman, and our Chinese, Mongol and Tibetan interpreters.
The Panel owes a debt of gratitude to Eduardo G. Abbott, Antonia M. Macedo, and
Claudio L. Vasconcelos for their expert and professional assistance during the
preparation of this Report. The Panel also wishes to thank Pamela Fraser and
Nimanthi A. Attapattu for their logistical support.
Finally, the Panel could not have completed this investigation without the kind
assistance and guidance of many people. They should share any credits given to
this work but, of course, the Inspection Panel remains solely responsible for its
findings, and conclusions.

INSPECTION PANEL'S REPORT AND FINDINGS
I                           ON THE QINGHAI PROJECT
I                             EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
|          The Qinghai Project
1.   The objective of the China: Western Poverty Reduction Project is to reduce
I          the incidence of absolute poverty in three provinces of China: the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region ("Part A"), Gansu ("Part B") and Qinghai ("Part C"), shown on
5          Map 1. This Report is concerned exclusively with "Part C," the Qinghai component of
the Project.
I          2.   When the Western Poverty Reduction Project was placed before the World
Bank in 1997, the basic design of the Qinghai component (hereinafter referred to
I          more simply as the Project) was already substantially developed. Located entirely in
Qinghai Province, the Project area comprises two parts: the so called Move-out area
to the east of Xining city, as shown on Map 1, and the Move-in area some 450
I          kilometers to the west, as shown on Map 2. The Project aims to alleviate poverty by
voluntarily resettling 57,775 poor farmers who currently practice high-altitude rain-
|          fed agriculture in five counties in Haidong Prefecture and one county in Xining City
Prefecture (Move-out area). They will be resettled into a new irrigation project in the
dryland area of the Haixi Tibetan and Mongolian Autonomous Prefecture in Dulan
I          County (Move-in area). Within the Move-in area, the Project proposes to renovate
an existing 8 m dam, and construct a new 40 m dam at Keri. It will also build a 29
|          km canal from the Xiangride river to the Keri Dam and a further 56 km canal from
the Dam to supply water to irrigate some 26,500 ha in Dulan County - all shown on
*          Map 2.
Panel Asked to Conduct Investigation
3.   The Qinghai component became the subject of public controversy in late April
1999, following the publication of an article by the Tibet Information Network. In
response to this article and a growing volume of external criticism, Bank
Management conducted an intensive internal review of environmental and social
aspects of the Qinghai Project. As a result, some "refinements" or "improvements"
I
l

were proposed. Negotiations with the Chinese Government were reopened and the
agreed modifications were presented in a revised loan package for Board approval.
4.   On June 18, 1999, the International Campaign for Tibet (ICT), a U.S. based
non-governmental organization, acting on behalf of affected people who live in the
Project area, submitted a Request for Inspection to the Panel. The Requesters
claimed that the Tibetan and Mongolian ethnic peoples would suffer potentially
irreversible harm from the Project and that this harm stemmed from Management's
failure to comply with several Bank policies and operational procedures.
5.   On June 24, 1999, the World Bank Board decided to proceed with the
financing of the Western Poverty Reduction Project. This decision came with a
caveat, however. In an unusual move, the Board agreed "that no work be done and
no funds be disbursed for the $40 million Qinghai component of the project until the
Board decides on the results of any review by the independent Inspection Panel. "
6.   On July 19, 1999, Management replied to the allegations in the Request. In
brief, it considered the Project in compliance with all relevant Bank policies except
that of the disclosure of information. Management pointed out that a number of
"refinements" had been made to the Project since public concerns had been raised
in late April. Internal reviews confirmed compliance with safeguard policies, but it
had nevertheless identified areas that would benefit from additional qualitative
strengthening during implementation.
7.   In its report to the Board on August 18, 1999, the Panel found the Request
eligible (except that the Board itself had to decide the question of external
representation by ICT of project affected people) and recommended that the
Executive Directors authorize an investigation. On September 9, 1999, the World
Bank Board of Executive Directors authorized the Panel to conduct an investigation.
The Terms of Reference required that the Panel investigate whether the Bank has
violated one or more of its operational polices and procedures with respect to the
design and appraisal of the Project: BP 17.50 (Disclosure of Information); OD 4.01
(Environmental Assessment); OD 4.20 (Indigenous Peoples); OD 4.30 (Involuntary
Resettlement); OP 4.09 (Pest Management); OP/BP 4.37 (Safety of Dams); OP/BP
12.10  (Retroactive Financing); and  OP/BP  10.00  (Investment Lending -
Identification to the Board Presentation).

8.   The Panel was assisted by a small team of senior consultants and a set of
interpreters from outside China. Between September, 1999. and January, 2000, the
I          Panel undertook a field visit of Qinghai Province and conducted interviews in
Washington, D.C., Beijing, Xining and many villages in the Project area. It also
examined relevant documents, including published and unpublished literature - a
process that continued through the third week of April, 2000.
General Compliance
Interpretation of the Bank's Policies and Procedures
9.   During the course of examining some 20 projects over the past five years, the
3          Panel has encountered certain differences in views among staff on just how the
Bank's operational policies and procedures should be applied.  In this case,
however, the Panel's interviews revealed an unusually and disturbingly wide range
of divergent and, often, opposing views. These large differences pervade all ranks of
the staff, from senior management to front-line professionals. And they apply to
3          virtually all of the major decisions required by the policies. The implications of this
for a reasonable application of the Bank's policies and procedures became a matter
of serious concern to the Panel, and ought to be of concern to the Bank generally
-          since there is no way that the policies can be applied with reasonable consistency in
the face of such wide divergences of opinion.
10.  For example, a number of staff members felt that the Bank's Operational
Directives and other policies were simply idealized policy statements, and should be
seen largely as a set of goals to be striven after. Others of equal or more senior rank
disagreed with this view. They felt that this interpretation could render the policies
3          virtually meaningless and certainly incapable of being employed as benchmarks
against which to measure compliance.
1          11.  In discussions about compliance, staff often pointed out that the policies allow
for flexibility of interpretation. The decisions made on the specific matters were thus
covered and in compliance. It was simply a matter of "judgement at Management's
sole discretion." The Management Response itself makes several claims in this
respect. Other staff argued, however, that the policies are clear enough to
|          distinguish areas that are binding from areas where some reasonable flexibility in
interpretation is called for. Read in their entirety, the Panel feels that the directives
I          cannot possibly be taken to authorize a level of "interpretation" and "flexibility" that
l
l



xv
would permit those who must follow these directives to simply override the portions
of the directives that are clearly binding.
12.   Most staff at all levels agreed that, in appraising compliance, Management
had an obligation to satisfy itself not only that the process and procedures mandated
by the policies had been followed, but also that the work under review met
professionally acceptable standards of quality. In other words, both process and
quality were essential components of compliance. Some staff, however, took the
opposite view that, while it might be appropriate to ensure professionally acceptable
standards of quality, it is not required for compliance. This 'check-list' or 'process'
approach to compliance represents a minority view but, in the Panel's judgement, it
is of concern when senior persons in the project decision-chain hold it
13.   Questions about compliance were often answered with claims of "precedent."
The Management Response itself cites "...past practice with ... a large number of
similar integrated agricultural development projects financed by the Bank in China
over the last 10 years," as a reason, for example, for assigning an environmental
Category "B" rather than "A."  Management's past experience in a country can
obviously provide the basis for a certain level of comfort that the work required by
the policies will be undertaken successfully.  In the Panel's view, it is an entirely
different matter, however, to suggest that experience and precedent can determine
what is required by the policies.
14.  Interviews with some staff were punctuated by the refrain that 'in China things
are done differently." This is echoed in the Management Response which states
that: "The level and quality of preparation and analysis for this Project were very
much in line with Bank practice in applying social and environmental policies to
projects in China in the context of its political and social systems." The Panel has
carefully examined the policies and has failed to find any grounds for the view that
precedents in a country, or a country's "social and political systems," can in any way
determine what is required by the policies.
15.  Faced with these widely divergent views among the staff, the Panel was
forced to revisit its views on and experience with Bank policies and compliance. In
the end, it returned to the approach reflected in its earlier reports. There is indeed
room for some flexibility and interpretation but, as provided in the Resolution that
established the Panel, the Operational Directives (and updated OPs, BPs, GPs, etc.)
are the primary source of Bank policy for purposes of assessing compliance.

The Qinghai Project in Space and Time
16.  The Environmental Assessment does not distinguish between short term
impacts and those that will only occur at some time in the future. This raises serious
questions about the time horizons over which the Project was evaluated.
17.  Moreover, in examining the Project documentation, the Panel found a high
level of ambiguity, uncertainty and inconsistency in the use of the term "project
area." This confusion is compounded by the fact that the documentation is poorly
I          supported by maps. (The Panel had eventually to prepare its own set of maps; i.e.
Maps 1 and 2.) As a result, it appears that significant numbers of people, including
members of minority nationalities, have been left out of the environmental and social
assessments required by Bank policy.
18.  The "project area," as interpreted in the EA and other documentation,
includes neither the commercial and service centers of Xiangride, nor several of the
townships surrounding it, including some Tibetan and Mongol villages visited by the
Inspection Team. Similarly, the "project area" does not include several villages
between Xiangride and Dulan and between Xiangride and the new towns to be
created in the irrigation site. These omissions are difficult to understand. A network
of social, commercial and political interactions clearly exists in Dulan County and in
Xiangride Township. Yet no assessment has been made of how these linkages and
interactions will be affected, for better or worse, by a Project that will completely
change the economy and demography of the County.
19.  Speaking to merchants in Xiangride, the Panel found that those who were
even partially informed about the Project were full of expectations that it would
increase their trade and commerce and that it would act as a pole of attraction for
further people and investment. The same is true of the townships adjacent to the
Xiangride prison farm. The interdependence is clear.
20.  Tibetan and Mongol village leaders in Xiangride township, whose villages lie
directly on the proposed supply-canal route to the irrigated area, told the Panel that
they had neither been officially contacted nor asked about the Project. These
|          villages will be impacted directly by the Project's physical infrastructure and
indirectly by, at the very least, a doubling of their county's population.
I



XVI1
xvii
21.  Many parts of the Move-in area have been overlooked or glossed over in the
EA and in other documentation of the Project. Little or no attention was paid to the
environmental impacts on areas other than the proposed new irrigation areas and
the Balong Soak. Compliance with OD 4.01 requires that many other areas receive
detailed consideration.
22.  An adequate environmental and social assessment would require a much
greater consideration of the effects of the Qinghai Project on nearby townships
including Xiangride and Dulan, as well as a much larger number of villages, some
visited by the Inspection Team. It would require consideration of the multiplier
effects of impacts caused by the construction of the new dam and reservoir,
irrigation system, roads, and townships with all their infrastructure; and also the
likely population increase as the nearly 60,000 resettled farmers will have growing
families and will attract more migrants, merchants, teachers, medical personnel, etc.
23.  In the Panel's view, given the letter and intent of ODs 4.01, 4.20 and 4.30, the
actual scale of the area to be impacted by the Qinghai Project, the ethnic
composition of the Project's impacted populations, the boundaries of the "project
area" were far too narrowly defined by Management. As a result, the assessments
fail to address many of the most significant social and environmental impacts of the
Project on the potentially affected populations, including those who are members of
minority nationalities. The Panel finds that this is not in compliance with these ODs.
The Consultation and Survey Method
24.  A comparison of the three populations in the Move-in area that will be
involuntarily resettled by this Project with the populations that were surveyed, is vital
to an understanding of the sampling procedures. The Involuntary Resettlement Plan
lists these impacted populations as follows: (1) 63 herder households (352 persons)
who use the land "under formal lease agreements with the townships;" (2) 289
herder households (2,411 persons) who pass twice yearly, with their herds, through
the area proposed for transformation into irrigated farmland and townships for the
resettled population; and (3) 248 households (1,237 persons) who currently farm on
the area served by an existing irrigation system, which will be integrated into the
Project's new irrigation systems.
25.  The extent to which these involuntarily resettled groups were "consulted"
through the survey method is very different. Take the second group, for example.
I
I



l
xviii
I
No survey was designed for, and no survey carried out among, the estimated 289
nomadic pastoralist households (2,411 persons) in this group, whose twice-yearly
passage through the project site with their herds will be disrupted. That is to say,
zero percent of this group was surveyed.  In stark contrast, 100 percent of the 63
herder households in the first group were surveyed. Of the 248 households (1,237
persons) in the third group, who are currently farming an irrigated area in Balong
township, and whose irrigation system will be expanded and integrated into the new
system, 80 households or 32 percent were surveyed.
26.  Thus, the largest group of persons involuntarily resettled by this Project (i.e.,
the pastoralists in the second group whose passage through the irrigation site with
their herds will be disrupted) received the least consultation, at least as measured by
the survey data. Although this group makes up 60 percent of the people and 72
percent of the households to be involuntarily resettled, none (zero percent) of this
group was surveyed, using Management's own population estimates and survey
data.
27.  Management also failed to consider weighting the surveys by ethnicity, or to
assure adequate representation in the survey sample of affected minority groups.
|          Most striking is the fact that in the entire Move-in area only three Tibetan households
were included in the survey. This is in spite of the fact that the Project occurs in a
Tibetan and Mongolian Autonomous Region, and the physical infrastructure for the
Project (its supply-canals) passes through Tibetan villages that were not included
within Management's definition of the "project area."
-          28.  Four points can be made concerning the survey in the Move-out area. First,
the questionnaires are not confidential. (All four surveys required the respondent to
I          put his or her name on the survey.) Second, from the internal evidence of the
questionnaires themselves, they must have been filled out by someone other than
the individual respondents. Third, the very limited source of information about the
subject-matter of the survey is striking; 93% of respondents indicated that they
learned of the resettlement from "government propaganda." Fourth, an examination
I          of the questions asked, and the context in which they were asked, indicates that
opinions and information gathered are probably not reliable because respondents
|          will probably think that this questionnaire could directly influence whether they get
selected for the resettlement project.
|          29.  The hazards of using the methods of consultation discussed above are even
greater in the Move-in area, because here respondents are being asked, without
I



xix
I
guarantee of confidentiality, whether they would welcome the influx of settlers. The
Bank must be aware that if there is even a perception of potential adverse effects
that could result from a truthful statement of opposition to this Bank-financed project,
then Bank staff has a responsibility to guarantee confidentiality of the respondent.
This responsibility derives from the requirements for "full and informed" consultation
in ODs 4.20 (esp. par. 8), 4.30, and 4.01, since full and informed consultation is
impossible if those consulted even perceive that they could be adversely affected for
expressing their opposition to, or honest opinions about, a Bank-financed project.
30.  Though the Bank seems to have accepted these methods of consultation, the
Inspection Team found that other international organizations working in the same
Qinghai Province did not accept them.
31.  A believable guarantee of respondent confidentiality might have yielded very
different results, especially in the Move-in area. The Inspection Team's short field
visit, though it recorded many positive comments about the proposed Project, also
yielded some disturbing and dramatic examples of what can only be described as a
climate of fear, through which some individuals nevertheless managed, at great
perceived risk, to express their opposition to this Project.
32.  The Project Appraisal Document admits, as does the Management
Response, that the consultative process "was not always smooth nor did it fulfill all
best practice guidelines. At times during the social assessment process respondent
confidentiality was not fully observed, and the data gathering process was less than
ideal." Nonetheless, Management still concluded that "the will of the move-in host
population was adequately expressed."
33.  The Inspection Team obviously did not conduct a scientific sample of opinion
during its brief stay in Qinghai. Nonetheless, in the Panel's view, the expressions of
opinion it heard and the incidents it witnessed indicate the need for far greater
efforts to obtain public consultation under adequate conditions, before Management
can be said to have met the requirements for public consultation in the Operational
Directives. The mere fact that opinions expressed were so strikingly different, and
especially the fact that there was a strong perception of risk from those expressing
opposition to the Project during the Inspection Team's visit, indicates that methods
of public consultation used for this Project have so far been inadequate.

The Consideration of Project Alternatives
34.  If there is no alternative there can be no choice. The Bank's policies and
procedures leave no room for doubt as to the need for a careful and systematic
consideration of a number of different types of alternatives, including investment
alternatives, alternative sites, alternative project designs, alternative implementation
plans. The purpose of considering these alternatives is to ensure that the option
supported by the Bank will achieve the project's objectives most cost effectively,
while meeting the Bank's safeguard policies.
35.  One of the most noticeable and significant weaknesses of the assessments is
that investment and project alternatives are neither identified nor systematically
compared. For all practical purposes, the Environmental Assessment avoids
consideration of alternatives, both for poverty reduction in the Move-out areas and
for sites in the Move-in area. From the documentation, it is not possible to deduce
whether the Qinghai Project as proposed is the best way for the Bank to meet the
Project's objectives or to ensure that the Bank's safeguard policies are being
respected.
36.  Management failed to ensure that those responsible for the EA understood
their brief to include an examination of alternatives to resettlement in both the Move-
out and Move-in areas. Instead, the Panel found that they understood the main
purpose of their studies to be to assist in the optimal resettlement of around 60,000
people from the Move-out area into the Balong-Xiangride irrigation area. The same
is true of the Social Assessment. There is no systematic study of in situ alternatives
to resettlement, or of alternative resettlement sites, or of alternative development
plans for the national minorities affected within the Move-in area.
37.  Why the Bank accepted Assessments conducted in such a circumscribed and
limiting manner is unclear. Whatever the reasons, the Panel finds that the
Assessments do not make any meaningful analysis of realistic project alternatives
as required by Bank policy.
Environmental Compliance
Environmental Screening of the Qinghai Project
38.  One of the most important decisions (perhaps the most crucial) that
Management must make concerning the environmental assessment of any project is
I
I



xxi
the category of the assessment that will be undertaken. Under OD 4.01, this critical
judgement is made in the first instance by the Task Manager (now Task Team
Leader), with the concurrence of the regional environment unit. The project is
assigned to Category "A," in which case a full Environment Assessment (EA) is
required, or a Category "B," in which case a full EA is not required, but an
environmental analysis is, or a Category "C," in which case no environmental
analysis is required. An Annex E to the OD provides illustrative lists of the types of
projects best classified in Categories "A," "B" and "C." Twelve types of projects are
listed for "A," of which eight are found in the entire Western Poverty Reduction
Project and four in the Qinghai component of the Project. The four are: dams and
reservoirs, irrigation, land clearance and leveling, resettlement and all projects with
potentially major impacts on people. The OD further provides that a full EA is
required if a project is likely to have significant adverse impacts that may be
sensitive, irreversible, and diverse. A footnote explains that impacts qualify as
"sensitive" if they affect vulnerable ethnic minorities or involve involuntary
resettlement.
39.  This critical decision of the category of the EA is made at a very early stage in
the project cycle, but the OD permits a later revision of the category as new
information becomes available.   Neither the OD nor the Annex provides for
exceptions on the basis of past experience or precedent in the country in question,
or the area of the project relative to the area of the geographic or political jurisdiction
involved.
40.  The initial decision to assign a "B," taken on January 8, 1998, was made
before the Task Team Leader, or any other Bank official associated with the
decision, had an opportunity to visit the Move-in area. It was also made without
detailed maps and other basic information being available and, it would appear,
without regard to the illustrative examples of "A" projects mentioned above.
Furthermore, the assignment was made on the stated assumption that there would
be no involuntary resettlement.
41.  The first Bank official involved in the decision to visit the Project site was the
Consultant who was engaged to be responsible for the environmental impact
assessment aspects of the Project. Following his visit, on March 13, 1998, he raised
a number of issues with senior staff and recommended the re-classification of the
Qinghai component as an "A." Senior staff responded at length, citing reasons why
it should remain a "B." Management was aware of the A/B debate, but did not
I



l
xxii
intervene. The Project Concept Document meeting of April 14, 1998, in effect
confirmed a "B."
42.  The EAs for the three components of the Western Poverty Reduction Project
3          were received prior to the December, 1998 Decision Meeting. The same Consultant
who had prepared their Terms of Reference, negotiated them with the local
institutes, and overseen their implementation, also reviewed the resulting
assessments and advised the Task Team Leader that he approved them - in effect,
recommending them for clearance. Subsequently, the documentation for the entire
3          Western Poverty Reduction Project was presented to the East Asia Country Director
and Legal Department for clearance and authorization to issue an invitation to
*          negotiate.
43.  Following completion of the negotiations during the week of April 12, external
criticism of the Qinghai component of the Project erupted, starting with publication of
the Tibet Information Network (TIN) article on April 27, 1999.  This triggered an
intensive internal review of, inter alia, the environmental classification of the Project
as "B" rather than "A."
*          44.  Management decided to ask several senior experts from  the central
departments to advise on classification and compliance. One of these experts
informed the Panel that from the time that he first saw any documentation related to
I          the Qinghai Project, he had been convinced that the Project should have been
classified an "A" on at least eight grounds. He recommended that the Project be
|          immediately reclassified as "A" as preferable to further jeopardizing the Bank's
reputation by defending the category "B." Another expert agreed that the Project
should have been classified as Category "A," and told the Panel that he had advised
I          Management that it should simply acknowledge that a "well-intentioned" mistake
was made. Another expert took a slightly different view. Agreeing that if the Project
3          were to be categorized now, under OP 4.01, it would be an "A" (OD 4.01 was
applicable to this Project), he understood that the size of the Project was not out of
line with others in the China portfolio and that its categorization as a "B" was
consistent with accepted practice in the Region.
3          45.  A senior official, also with strong credentials in the field, informed the Panel
that in his view the Project was quite clearly an "A," whether under the old or new
rules. The Region, he felt, was in non-compliance, not with whether or not the
I          Project was categorized (obviously, it was), but with the A/B judgement and, in late
May, he so advised Senior Management.  Expressing understanding with the
l
l



XXIll
xxiii
position of colleagues who must contract their services to, and are paid in part out
of, project budgets, he went on to say that "Frankly, they don't want to bite the hand
that feeds them (for cross support) by taking a hardline view."
46.  After reviewing the screening process, the Panel finds that Management's   3
decision to classify the project as a "B" was not in compliance with OD 4.01.
Several components of the Project fall within the illustrative list of "A" projects in
Annex E, e.g., dams and reservoirs, irrigation, and resettlement. And the impacts
qualify as "sensitive" since vulnerable ethnic minorities are affected and involuntary
resettlement is involved.                                                      3
Environmental Assessment of the Qinghai Project
47.  Management adopted a very limited definition of "environment" in the Project
with the result that the Assessment fails to analyze the full range of Project effects.
The Assessment also fails completely to place the Project in proper time frames. As
noted above, the spatial boundaries of the Move-out and Move-in areas are defined
narrowly, or not at all, with the result that whole communities and populations,  I
whose lives will be impacted by the project, have been left out of the Environmental
and Social Assessments.                                                         U
48.  Concerning the Move-out areas, the EA and other Project documentation are
moot with respect to both the plans and levels of financing for improving the living
conditions of those remaining behind. There is also a lack of documentation on the
social and economic implications for a village of "moving out" a significant proportion  3
of their most productive and economically active population. This voluntary
resettlement could have major, long-lasting, and irreversible social impacts.
Considerably more detailed analysis of the social and environmental problems of the  I
Move-out villages and of how these will be addressed by the Project are required in
order to comply with OD 4.01.                                                   3
49.  In May/June 1999, following the outbreak of public concern, Management
tried to compensate for this by requiring a study to evaluate the environmental and
social impacts of the Voluntary Settlement Implementation Plan. This study (which
is to recommend measures to enhance the environmental sustainability and the    |
living conditions of the people in the Move-out counties) is to be undertaken not later
than three years after the implementation of the Plan has commenced. Undertaking
an environmental and social assessment three years after the commencement of    I
resettlement is a bit late, not only in terms of the policies, but also in terms of any
l



l
xxiv
l
elemental understanding of the purposes of such assessments. Within the social
arena, this is comparable to requiring that the safety of a proposed dam should be
studied within three years after it has been built!
3          50.  As to the Move-in area, the proposed in-migration to Dulan County will more
than double its population. The proposed new towns will each have populations five
times as large as Xiangride, the nearest established town to the main irrigation site.
This will lead to further induced development, on which OD 4.01 lays great stress.
The dam, irrigation and resettlement parts of the Qinghai Project are treated as
3          though they were to take place in a regional vacuum. The potential impact of this
development on the network of social, commercial and political interactions that
exists in Dulan County and Xiangride Township has not been considered. There is
no indication of how these communities and their populations will be affected, for
better or worse, by the Project. Without this assessment, the Bank's policy goal of
|          enhancing Project benefits has no substance or meaning.
51.  The EA and other Project documents fail to consider the appropriateness of
implanting large-scale irrigated agriculture in this Region. It does not examine its
suitability or viability in comparison with the traditional forms of land use, including
3      -  agropastoralism,  sedentary  pastoralism, semi-sedentary  pastoralism  (semi-
nomadism), and migratory pastoralism involving the herding of sheep and other
animals. There appears simply to be an assumption that irrigated agriculture is "a
good thing" without consideration of alternatives and relative costs.
3          52.  The EA is uninformative about the layout of the new towns and villages, their
infrastructure, and the facilities such as water, heat and light that will be provided for
the settlers. It is silent on what methods the new towns and villages will use to
J          manage and dispose of their wastes. Similarly, the EA is virtually silent on the
impacts of the emissions and wastes on the areas surrounding and downstream
3          from the two new towns (with initial populations nearing 30,000), and villages.
Contrary to OD 4.01, the Bank's Terms of Reference for the EA did not call for any
such assessment.
53.  The standard of maps, charts and references is inadequate. They do not
provide a satisfactory record of the settlements, infrastructure and land use in the
areas that will be affected by the Project. The Qinghai Project involves a total
transformation of the vegetation of some of the Project areas, a substantial impact
3          on others during the construction phases, and a substantial impact on areas that are
adjacent to or downstream of the construction areas. Management should therefore
l
l



xxv
have required a proper vegetation survey and map. The Assessment provides no
description whatsoever of the vegetation in the Move-out area and an inadequate
description of the vegetation in the Move-in area. Attention had been drawn by an
FAO consultant to the urgent need for a detailed soil survey and land classification
in connection with the irrigation scheme, but the recommended map (at a scale of  l
1:10,000) had not been completed at the time of the Panel's visit.
54.  The information on the biodiversity of the area is very sketchy and
inadequate. It does not incorporate an assessment of the diversity encountered with
regard to distribution, frequency/rarity and conservation status. While an exhaustive  3
inventory of the biodiversity would not be expected, it would have been appropriate
to search the literature and to reference studies (including lists) as these are not
lacking in China.
55.  Extensive exploitation of oil, natural gas and minerals is carried out in parts of  3
the Qaidam basin and test drillings have been undertaken near the Project area. No
mention is made in the EA of the general economic importance of oil and minerals in
the Province, or its possible effects on the Project areas, or of any drilling activities
in the Region.
56.  The Panel finds that the Environmental Assessment of the Qinghai Project is
not in compliance with Bank policies as set out in OD 4.01.                      3
Dam Safety, Pest Management and Natural Habitats                                 3
57.  While the design and location of the proposed Keri Dam appears to be in
compliance with OP/BP 4.37 and Annex B of OD 4.00, there is no reference to the
seismicity of the Project area and the fact that two earthquakes of magnitude 7+
(equivalent to the 1999 Turkish (Ismit) earthquakes), occurred in Dulan County in
1937 and 1963. An assessment of the risk to the nearby Keri irrigated area should
the dam fail (as a result of an earthquake) should be undertaken in the near future.
58.  The use of pesticides forms part of the implementation phase. No Bank
funds will be used for the procurement of pesticides, as these will be provided by the
borrower as counterpart funds for the Project and, as such, acquisition and use of
pesticides is, therefore, an integral part of the Project. No detailed comments can be
made on the subject, as the exact nature of pest management proposals is not     I
known. In the Panel's view, the lack of pest management plans is a violation of OP
I



l
xxvi
4.09. However, assurances were given to the Inspection Team that an integrated
3          pest management programme would be undertaken for the Qinghai Project.
59.  The increasing pace and scale of habitat conversion in the Qinghai-Tibetan
|          Plateau requires a broader view to be taken of the fate of the various ecosystems in
the region, not just those in or adjacent to the Project area.
60.  Given the scale of absolute habitat conversion in the Project area, involving
19,000 ha of land that will be irrigated, and construction developments such as the
3          dam, canals, townships, villages and roads - all adding up to an estimated 21,444 ha
- it cannot be asserted with confidence that critical natural habitats will not be lost.
The necessary baseline information is not available in the Environmental
Assessment. The Panel is therefore of the view that the Project is in contravention of
the Bank's policy, OP 4.04, in regard to the significant conversion of critical natural
I          habitats.
Social Compliance
The Qinghai Project and Indigenous Peoples
61.  OD 4.20 is quite clear about Bank policy concerning the preparation of an
Indigenous Peoples Development Plan.  Paragraph 13 states that: "For an
investment project that affects indigenous peoples, the borrower should prepare an
indigenous peoples development plan that is consistent with the Bank's policy. Any
3          project that affects indigenous peoples is expected to include components or
provisions that incorporate such a plan..."
62.  Management acknowledges that an Indigenous Peoples Development Plan
(IPDP) is required for the Qinghai Project. It asserts, however, that the Project as a
3          whole constitutes the IPDP because a majority of the Project's beneficiaries are
minorities. This assertion hinges on an interpretation of the last sentence of
paragraph 13 quoted above; i.e., "... When the bulk of the direct project beneficiares
*          are indigenous people, the Bank's concerns would be addressed by the project itself
and the provisions of this OD would thus apply to the project in its entirety. "
63.  In the Panel's view, Management's interpretation of this one sentence of
paragraph 13 of OD 4.20 cannot be accepted. In the case of this Project, it is
I          inconsistent with other parts of the OD and especially inconsistent with the objective
of Bank policy towards indigenous people, which is "...to ensure that the
l
I



xxvii
development process fosters full respect for their dignity, human rights, and cultural
uniqueness..." and to "ensure that indigenous peoples do not suffer adverse effects
during the development process..., and that they receive culturally compatible social
and economic benefits. "
64.  The Inspection Team's conversations with villagers inside the narrow "project
area," as defined by Management, uncovered a positive attitude towards the idea of
separate IPDPs for each of the minorities. When the Panel visited project-affected
towns near Xiangride, and Tibetan villages along the proposed supply-canal for the
project-all left out of the "project area' as defined by Management-it received a
similarly positive response to self-standing IPDPs for each of the ethnic groups.
Although the Team's visit was short, it is satisfied that some, if not all, of the ethnic
minorities in the Move-in area would welcome the opportunity to participate in the
development of separate IPDPs.
65.  The "indigenous peoples, " or national minorities, in the Move-in area, the Hui,
Mongol, Tibetan, Tu and Salar, are very different from each other, in their "cultural
uniqueness" as well as their "local patterns of social organization, religious beliefs,
and resource use." Retroactively lumping together these very different cultures into
a single one-plan-fits-all IPDP, whether that is the "project in its entirety," or a single
IPDP for the whole of the Move-in area, effectively denies these very different ethnic
groups, especially the numerically weakest and most vulnerable, an opportunity to
participate in a process that would ensure that their minority cultural traditions are
taken into account in the overall design of the Project.  No number of add-on
indigenous-culture-boosting activities (bilingual schools, Islamic religious sites,
Tibetan pharmacological centers, corridors for nomadic herders) can override the
fact that the initial Project design is flawed by this failure to recognize, from the
outset, the cultural uniqueness of the separate ethnic minorities involved. The Panel
finds that a serious attempt to prepare separate, free-standing IPDPs for each of the
national minorities in the Move-out area is required to bring the Project in
compliance with OD 4.20.
66.  OD 4.20 also stipulates the process and procedures to be followed in
developing an IPDP within the context of the Bank's "project cycle," i.e.,
identification, preparation, appraisal, negotiations, and presentation to the Board.
After reviewing the actual processing of this Project, the Panel finds that
Management's decisions on Indigenous Peoples during the identification,
preparation and appraisal were not in compliance with the process and procedures
mandated by paragraphs 16-18 of OD 4.20. The Panel finds that the Project as a
l
l



l
xxviii
whole does not constitute the IPDP required by OD 4.20, and that separate, free-
I          standing IPDPs are required to bring the Project into compliance with OD 4.20.
|          Involuntary Resettlement
67.  The Qinghai Project involves two types of resettlement, voluntary and
involuntary, and, in assessing compliance, a clear distinction must be made between
the two, since OD 4.30 only applies to involuntary resettlement.
68.  Management contends that the nearly 60,000 migrants from the Move-out
area are "voluntary" resettlers and therefore not covered by OD 4.30.  In
Management's view, OD 4.30 applies only to the 4,000 individuals in the Move-in
area considered to be "involuntarily" affected.  And, in its view, an adequate
Involuntary Resettlement Plan has been prepared to cover them. The elements that
now make up this Plan were originally included within the Voluntary Settlement
Implementation Plan (VSIP).  Later, however, following the outbreak of public
concern, those provisions in the VSIP relating to involuntary resettlement were
revised and brought together as a separate annex to the VSIP.
69.  During its discussions with people in the Move-out area, the Team was able
to confirm that they felt they had a choice whether they could move or not, and most
*          of those interviewed wanted to move to Haixi Prefecture. Although it is difficult to
say whether the choice was an informed one in many instances, OD 4.30 does not
|          give clear guidance on the quality of full and informed choice that is needed to
consider a resettlement as "voluntary." The Panel thus accepts Management's
contention that OD 4.30 does not apply to the migrants from the Move-out area.
70.  OD 4.30 applies to those people who are displaced or adversely affected by
3          the Project. As noted repeatedly, Management's narrow definition of the boundaries
of the Project area resulted in many people and communities affected by the Project
being left out of the assessments. This appears to be true of the population of
I          persons who will be displaced by the Project which is likely to be larger than that
accounted for in Project documents.  In the Panel's view, the Project is not in
compliance with OD 4.30.
71.  Paragraph 4 of OD 4.30 requires the development of a plan that will assist
3          involuntarily resettled persons with their move, and will provide fair compensation for
their loss (whether they lose the land itself, or the use of the land, or other
I
l



xxix
productive resources).  The method of compensation chosen for the herders who
are to be involuntarily resettled is "land-for-land."  Adequate baseline data on
pastoralism, including the data on land use and inheritance that would allow a
proper assessment of the compensation offered, are unfortunately lacking for this
Project. Although envisaged by the OD, it appears that this work was not done.  |
Without the results of such work, it is difficult to assess the adequacy of the
compensation offered, not only for the Panel but also, in the first instance, for
Management. Indeed, it is difficult to understand how the OD's policy objectives can
be achieved without this information.
72.  For all of the above reasons, and others discussed in the Report, the Panel
finds that the Project's current Involuntary Resettlement Plan is not in compliance
with the requirements of Bank policy as set out in OD 4.30.
Disclosure of Information                                                      3
73.  The timely disclosure of information on evolving projects is designed to
provide opportunities for comment on and improvement of Bank projects. When a   I
project is under consideration, Bank policy requires that a Project Information
Document (PID) be released on it. The PID is to be made available at the Bank's  1
Infoshop at the Project Concept Document (PCD) stage. The very short PID for the
Western Poverty Reduction Project bears the same date as the PCD, March 25.
1998. It makes one reference to "minorities" or "minority nationalities", saying in
passing that China's current "absolute poor" comprise "largely minority nationalities."
There is no mention of minorities in the Qinghai component of the Project. Rather,  I
the beneficiaries are defined only in terms of their poverty and their precarious future
in the absence of the Project.                                                  5
74.  The Bank's policy expects that this initial PID will be updated and expanded
periodically as project preparation proceeds. In any event, it is required to be  3
revised before formal project appraisal. This was not done. If changes are then
made, a final version of the PID is prepared. A first revision of the PID was made
available at the Bank's Infoshop on May 4, 1999, nearly four months after the   I
Appraisal Mission of January 26, 1999.
75.  Following the TIN article, the Public Information Document (PID) was revised
a second time and released on June 1, 1999. The June version contained a long,
11-page annex on "Social Aspects" of the Project. This revision is the first official  I
public document on the Project that contains a description of the Social Assessment
I
1



xxx
preparation, the selection of beneficiaries, measures for land acquisition and
compensation, and measures for protecting minority rights.
76.  In its Response to the Request for Inspection, Management agrees that there
were shortcomings in the timeliness with which the required documents were sent to
the Infoshop. The EA and the Involuntary Resettlement Plan were not sent to the
Board of Executive Directors and the Infoshop until June, 1999. As Management
admits, the Qinghai Project is not in compliance with BP 17.50. And the Panel so
finds.
Investment Lending and Retroactive Financing
77.  The September 9, 1999 decision of the Board of the Executive Directors
asked the Panel to look into compliance by Management with the provisions of
OP/BP 10.00 on "Investment Lending: Identification to Board Presentation" and
OP/BP 12.10 on "Retroactive Financing."
78.  The Panel is satisfied that the Project is consistent with the Articles of
Agreement and the CAS and is anchored in country policy/sector analysis, as
provided in OP/BP 10.00. This Report shows, however, a number of instances
where the Panel feels that operational policies and procedures were not followed,
casting doubt as to whether the Project, as it stands, is the best alternative to
contribute to poverty reduction and sustainable economic growth, and, thus,
economically justified, as required in the same policy.
79.  In the Panel's view, the Project is in compliance with OP/BP 12.10 on
Retroactive Financing.

Chapter 1
China: Western Poverty Reduction Project in
Qinghai Province
1.    The objective of the China: Western Poverty Reduction Project is to reduce the
incidence of absolute poverty in remote and inaccessible villages of three provinces
I            of China: the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region ("Part A"), Gansu ("Part B") and
Qinghai ("Part C"), shown on Map 1.' According to Bank Management, it will assist a
total of about 1.7 million people in all three locations increase their incomes and
productivity in both farm and off-farm activities. It will also improve their health and
education services, water supply, the availability of electricity, and the quality of roads
used to bring local goods to market.
2.    This Report is concerned exclusively with Part C, the Qinghai component of
the project, located entirely in Qinghai Province. As explained below, it was this
component only that was the subject of both the Request for Inspection by the
|            International Campaign for Tibet (ICT)2 representing the affected people and, later,
the World Bank Board of Executive Director's decision to ask the Panel to undertake
an investigation.3
3.    Qinghai Province is located in western China, as can be seen on Map 1. It
|           borders Xinjiang on the northwest, Gansu to the north and east, Sichuan to the
southeast, and Xizang (the Tibet Autonomous Region) to the west and southwest.4 It
1 It is the sixth World Bank assisted poverty reduction program in China, following projects in the
Southwest, in the Gansu-Hexi Corridor, in the Qinba Mountains, in Shanxi and in the Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region.

is a large and, as the Team discovered, stunningly beautiful province covering one-
thirteenth of China. It is the source of both the Yellow and Yangtze rivers although
much of the province's drainage is internal to either the Qaidam Basin in the west or
to Qinghai salt lake, also known as Koko Nor, in the center - the largest lake in
China.

mountainous areas of five counties in Haidong Prefecture and one county in Xining
City Prefecture. They will be resettled into a new irrigation project in the dryland area
of the Haixi Tibetan and Mongolian Autonomous Prefecture in Dulan County. Within
the Move-in area, the Project proposes to renovate an existing 8 m dam, and
construct a new 40 m dam at Keri. It will also build a 29 km canal from the Xiangride
River to the Keri Dam and a further 56 km canal from the Dam to supply water to
irrigate some 26,500 ha, all shown on Map 2.
5.   According to Management, the object is to benefit both those remaining behind
in the Move-out area and those migrating to the Move-in area. Management expects
those remaining in the Move-out area to benefit as a result of reduced population and
livestock pressure on scarce land and other resources and from investments in land
rehabilitation. Improvements in infrastructure are also foreseen. Those moving to
Dulan County in Haixi Prefecture would benefit from start-up costs for resettlement
and from user rights to irrigated land for cultivation and grazing. They will be taught
how to grow crops using irrigation and how to manage their farms. Schools are
planned in the Move-in area that reflect the migrant population's ethnic and language
backgrounds, as well as vocational and adult education services. Twenty-three clinics
with trained health care workers are also planned to serve the health needs of the
Move-in area.

Chapter 2
Inspection Panel Asked to Conduct Investigation
6.    The Western Poverty Reduction Project became active in the Bank's China
portfolio in January 1997, although preliminary work on the Keri Dam began in 1989
I            and significant background work on the concept underlying the project as a whole
began early in the 1990s.6 The Project was appraised in January 1999 and it
became the subject of public controversy in late April 1999, following the publication
I~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
of an article by the Tibet Information Network.7
l
2.1   Background to the Investigation
7.    On June 18, 1999, the International Campaign for Tibet (ICT), a U.S. based
non-governmental organization, acting on behalf of affected people who live in the
Project area, submitted a Request for Inspection to the Panel.8 The Requesters
claimed that approval and implementation of the Project would affect the lives and
livelihoods of Tibetan and Mongolian ethnic peoples who would suffer potentially
irreversible harm.9 More specifically, they maintained that the resettlement of the new
migrants would directly and adversely impact 4,000 local people and the carrying
capacity of their area. The move would also impact indirectly on the entire county
and risk escalating ethnic tensions and conflicts over resources.
8.    The Requesters alleged a failure to comply with the Bank's policy on
Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20), and a number of other policy failures. They claimed
that Management failed to comply with the Bank's policy on  Environmental
Assessment (OD 4.01), citing the decision to categorize the Project as a Category "B"

for environmental screening instead of the more rigorous Category "A". They claimed
that the Bank failed to prepare an adequate involuntary resettlement plan for the
4,000 people living in the Move-in area (OD 4.30). They alleged that the conversion
of a natural habitat to irrigated agriculture, canals, roads and housing, would lead to a
potential loss of wildlife and wildlife habitat (OP/BP 4.04). They claimed that the  3
Bank failed to apply its pest management control policy (OP 4.09) and they raised
questions about a possible failure to follow dam safety policies (OP/BP 4.37).  In
addition, they claimed that Management failed to disclose the Environmental    I
Assessment, Resettlement, and Voluntary Resettlement Plans until just before the
Project was to be considered by the Bank's Board of Executive Directors (BP 17.50).  3
Finally, they claimed that these failures by Management to comply with Bank policies
and procedures would " ...undermine the integrity of the entire project... and ...
constitute a serious threat to the ethnic minorities in the area and the fragile  I
ecosystem in which they live. "10
9.   In response to external criticism beginning in late April, Bank Management
conducted an intensive internal review of the environmental and social aspects of the
Qinghai Project. As a result, some "refinements" or "improvements" were proposed.  I
Negotiations with the Chinese Government were reopened and the agreed
modifications were presented in a revised loan package for Board approval.     3
10.  On June 24, 1999, the World Bank Board decided to finance the equivalent of  I
US$ 160 million of the US$ 311 million required for the entire West China Poverty
Reduction Project, $100 million in concessional funds through an IDA Credit (No.  3

$50 million is intended to benefit 674,000 people in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region, $70 million to benefit 930,000 people in Gansu. The balance of $40 million is  I
provided to benefit people in Qinghai, including the 57,750 who are being resettled
from the Move-out area, the 110,000 who are staying, and the 4,000 who live in and
around the Move-in area.
11.  This Loan and Credit approval came with a caveat, however. The Bank
reported that the Executive Directors," .".in an unusual move, agreed that no work be
done and no funds be disbursed for the $40 million Qinghai component of the project

12.   On July 19, 1999, Management replied to the allegations in the Request,
I           addressing a number of concerns relating to the potential adverse impact of the
movement of a large number of non-Tibetan and non-Mongol populations into the
Move-in area.  It considered the Project in compliance with OD 4.20 on Indigenous
Peoples since during the preparation of the Project it claimed that "...the substantive
objectives of the OD should be addressed by the project itself and the provisions of
I           the OD would thus apply to the project in its entirety."'3  Management did recognize,
however, "...that some of the project's qualitative aspects regarding ethnic minorities
|           could have been better anticipated and addressed in loan documentation."14
Management also considered that it was in full compliance with OD 4.01 on
Environmental Assessment, since whether to assign the Project to Category "A" or
I           "B" was, in its opinion, a matter of 'judgment."15 It also felt that it was in compliance
with OP 4.04 on Natural Habitats, OP 4.37 on Safety of Dams, and OP 12.10 on
3           Retroactive Financing.  It stated that it had been consistent with OD 10.00 on
standards for quality at entry and in broad consistency with policies on Pest
Management in OP 4.09 and BP 4.01. On disclosure of information, Management
ffi         agreed that there was "a shortcoming in the timeliness" with which the Environmental
Assessment Report and Resettlement Action Plan were sent to the Bank's Infoshop
in Washington, DC "...relative to Management guidance to staff in this regard."16
13.   Management also pointed out that a number of "refinements" had been made
to the Project as presented to the Board since public concerns had been raised in
late April. Although Management's internal reviews confirmed compliance with
safeguard policies, it had "...identified areas that would benefit from additional
qualitative strengthening  during  implementation."   A  small team  of senior
management staff had visited Qinghai Province to make an  "...independent
assessment of the situation and the efficacy of the plan," an outline of additional

reopened.                                                                           |
14.  Some of the "refinements" agreed and included in supplemental letters to the
Loan and Credit agreements included: a) assurances that there will be no change in  3
the administrative status of the Haixi Mongol and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture; b)
strengthening the Pilot Program whereby 200 households will be settled on 300
hectares of land as a field test of the social and environmental aspects of the Project;
c) adding a Pre-Pilot phase to ensure adequate preparation of the Pilot Program and
to update the previous work on environmental and social issues through evaluation of  |
existing multi-ethnic settlements adjacent to the Project area; and d) making
additional investments in social services in both the move-out and move-in areas for
people  beyond  the  specific  Project boundaries.17    Finally,  Management        I
welcomed"...the opportunity to have its actions reviewed independently by the
Inspection Panel. "                                                                3
15.   On August 18, 1999, the Panel submitted its Report on the eligibility of the
Request and the Requesters and its recommendation on the Request for Inspection.
It concluded that the Request met all eligibility criteria required under the Resolution
establishing the Panel, except that the Board itself had to decide on whether external
representation was appropriate. It also concluded that the Request for Inspection
and the Management Response to it contained"...a wide range of conflicting |
assertions and interpretations about issues, the underlying assumptions, the facts,
compliance and harm."  It therefore recommended that the Executive Directors
authorize an investigation. 18

16.  On September 9, 1999, the Board of Executive Directors authorized the
independent Inspection Panel to conduct an investigation into the Project. The     I
memorandum containing the decision, taken on a non-objection basis, states:
"On August 24, 1999, Executive Directors received a memorandum  from  the          |
Chairman of the Inspection Panel entitled 'Request for Inspection: China: Western
Poverty Project (Credit No. 3255-CHA and Loan No. 4501-CHA) - Panel Report and

Recommendation'. In this memorandum, the Chairman requested (i) agreement of
Executive Directors that 'appropriate representation is not locally available' for
I             purposes of eligibility of the requesters under paragraph 12 of Resolution 93- 10 and
of Resolution No. IDA 93 -6 (Inspection Panel Resolution); and (ii) Executive
I             Directors' approval of the recommendation that the Board authorise an investigation
by the Panel into the matters alleged in the Request for Inspection.
Board determination of the issue of eligibility of the requesters will require
X             obtaining and considering additional information and the careful analysis of a number
of important issues. This process is likely to delay investigation by the Panel.
3             Consequently, in order to expedite Panel investigation, it is proposed that, pursuant
to paragraph 12 of the Inspection Panel Resolution, the Executive Directors, acting
as a Board, instruct the Panel to conduct an investigation into whether the Bank has
I             violated one or more of the following operational policies and procedures of the Bank,
with respect to the design and appraisal of the Western Poverty Reduction Project

outside China. The Bank's Resident Mission China staff also generously assisted
with Chinese-language interpretation, at the Team's request. In Beijing, the Team
J             met with Resident Mission China staff and consultants on this Project both before and
after visiting Qinghai. It met with Chinese government officials at the Ministry of
3             Finance, the State Ethnic Minorities Commission, State Council Leading Group on
Poverty Alleviation, and other offices. It met with ambassadors and senior officials
from a number of countries to obtain various perspectives on the Project. And it met
|             with the Beijing staff of other donor agencies or foreign aid missions who have been
involved in quite different poverty alleviation efforts in Qinghai. These include
Australian Aid, the World Food Programme, the European Union, and the United
Nations Development Programme.
1            21.      Traveling to Xining, the capital of Qinghai Province, the Team divided into
groups to more effectively examine different issues. The Panel members met with
the Executive Vice Governor and his staff both before and after visiting the Move-out
and Move-in areas.  Together with members of the Team, they had extensive
meetings with the Provincial Project Management Office, especially for briefings on
i            the social assessment by the Qinghai Research Institute of Plateau Geography; and
a formal meeting with scholars and faculty at the Qinghai Ethnic Minorities Research
Institute/University.
22.   The Team visited several villages in the Move-out areas (Map 1).29 They then
3            spent a day driving some 450 kilometers on the Xining to Lhasa Road to Dulan, the
Dulan county seat in Haixi Prefecture, near the Move-in area (Map 2). From Dulan,
the Team visited Tibetan, Mongol, and Han villagers in or near the proposed project
site and in Xiangride township, as well as Mongol herders encamped at the irrigation
site. Follow-up meetings with government officials and private citizens continued
5            after returning by road to Xining.

(Arshnu [=A'shinu] township) in Hualong county; Daheigou village (Donxia township) in Huangyuan

23   These site visits in the Move-out and Move-in areas, as well as meetings with
government officials involved in the Qinghai Project, were extremely important for
assessing formal and substantive compliance with Bank policies and procedures.    I
They allowed the Team to witness first-hand the urgent need for and importance of
poverty alleviation programs in the Move-out areas. The Panel does not question   |
that: the urgent need for poverty alleviation was clearly evident. And meetings with
other donor agencies (see Acknowledgements) provided  evidence  of the
effectiveness of various alternative in situ strategies for poverty alleviation in Qinghai.  I
The site visits also enabled the Team to witness the overall climate in which
consultation with the affected people was conducted in both the Move-out and Move-
in areas, and the range of local opinion toward many aspects of the proposed Project.

24.    The Board's decision of September 9, 1999 instructing the Panel to conduct
an investigation of the Project is quite clear about the focus of the investigation. The
Panel is to determine a... whether the Bank has violated one or more of the following
operational policies and procedures of the Bank, with respect to the design and
appraisal of the ... Project ... ' In other words, the Panel is to determine whether, in
the design and appraisal of the Project, Management complied with the Bank's own

the Panel.3'
1            25.    During the course of examining some 20 projects over the past five years, the
Panel has gained much experience in determining how the Bank's operational
I_           policies and procedures should be applied.  The Board recently completed an
eighteen-month review of the Panel during which some Board and Panel members
had extensive opportunities to share their views on this. When the Board took its
decision following the review, the Panel expected no significant questions in this
regard. The Panel's interviews over the past few months, however, have revealed an
I            unusually and disturbingly wide range of divergent, and even opposing, views among
staff on how the operational policies and procedures should be applied. Some
differences are, of course, to be expected. But the Panel found the differences in
staff interpretation of the ODs and how they are to be applied so significant that it
raises serious questions about the ability of Management to apply them with any
|           reasonable degree of consistency.

26.   In view of this, the Panel feels it desirable to begin this Report with a brief
discussion of the Bank's safeguard policies and procedures, how they evolved, their
importance, and how the Panel understands them in relation to the question of
compliance.
3.1   Evolution of Bank's Policies and Procedures: Safeguards                     I
27.    Since the early 1970s, the World Bank has been a leader in the development  I
of what are now called 'safeguard policies.' In 1971, the Bank required that impact
on the environment be considered in project appraisal but no specific mechanisms  I
were stipulated.  In 1975, it issued voluntary Guidelines on Environmental
Developments of Projects.  In 1984, the Operational Manual Statement on
Environmental Aspects of Bank Work was adopted. In 1989, Operational Directive    I
4.00, Annex A, mandated environmental assessments for all Bank projects but did
not specify detailed procedures. Two years later, in October 1991, this was revised
and issued as OD 4.01 Environmental Assessment. It set out the procedures to be
followed by the Bank in some considerable detail. The Directive itself consisted of six
pages followed by 12 pages of Annexes which give detailed instructions with respect  |
to matters such as potential issues for an assessment, the outline of an EA report,
and environmental mitigation plan and environmental screening.32 This OD remained
in force until January 1999. In other words, it was in force during the design and
preparation of the Qinghai Project. In 1999, OD 4.01 was recast and released as the
suite OP/BPIGP 4.01 Environmental Assessment, which now frames the Bank's        3
approach to environmental assessment in terms of Operational Policies (OP), Bank
Procedures (BP) and Good Practice (GP).                                          l
28.     The evolution of the Bank's environmental policies ran parallel to the
development of safeguard policies in other related areas. As far back as 1982, the
Bank issued Operational Manual Statement (OMS) 2.34 on Tribal People in Bank-
financed Projects, the purpose of which was to protect the interests of relatively
isolated and culturally distinct indigenous groups in Bank-financed development
interventions. It was replaced in 1991 with OD 4.20 on Indigenous Peoples.
29.    In 1980 the Bank issued OMS 2.33 on "Social Issues Associated with
Involuntary Resettlement in Bank-Financed Projects."  This was complemented in
1986 with Operation Policy Note (OPN) 10.08 on "Operations Policy Issues in the  I
Treatment of Involuntary Resettlement in Bank-Financed Projects." Both were
32 IBRD/IDA, Operational Directive 4.01 on Environmental Assessments (October 1991) [hereinafter  I
OD 4.01].

replaced in 1990 with OD 4.30 on Involuntary Resettlement. This OD broadened the
treatment of resettlement issues beyond hydropower andi irrigation projects to all
types of investment projects.
30.    In the early 1990s the Bank began a process of converting Operational
Directives, Memoranda, Notes etc. into a new format that distinguished between
policies, procedures and practices. According to Management, this development did
I          not signify a change of Bank policy. Rather, it was designed to clarify what are Bank
policies (OPs), what is Bank "procedure" (BPs), both mandatory "rules," and what is
international best practice (GPs). It was also designed to streamline the procedures
for more effective implementation by Bank staff. In his new book on the Inspection
Panel, Shihata comments on this as follows: "Some ODs were seen to be at times
I          too detailed or reflecting what should be sought and not necessarily what could be
done in practice. The limits of flexibility in the application of the ODs were not always
clear either, especially those written before their drafters were aware of the
controversy regarding the nature of these documents. Differences on this issue and
the desire of the Bank's Management to streamline and simplify the Bank's business
I          practices lead, after an informal discussion by the Executive Directors, to the
Management's decision in late 1992 to gradually replace the ODs by OPs and BPs,
which would be binding on the staff, as well as by Good Practices (GPs), which would
disseminate knowledge and indicate successful examples without being binding.
This is the process that came to be known in the Bank practice as conversion.'3
31.    The adoption of OP/GP on Forestry in September 1993 reflected the shift,
distinguishing between Operational Policies and Good Practice. The adoption in
September 1994 of an OP/BP 10.04 on Economic Evaluation of Investment
Operations reflected the Bank Procedure category. In October 1994, OP/BP/GP 4.02
|          on Environmental Action Plans divided what was previously one OD into three
separate statements. This triumvirate was continued in September 1995, with the
adoption of OP/BP/GP 4.04 on Natural Habitats. This replaced OPN 11.02 on
Wildlands.  In September 1996 OP/GP (no BP) 4.36 on Safety of Dams was
adopted. In December 1998 an OP on Pest Management replaced a 1996 version of
the same. This OP had replaced old OD 4.03 on Agricultural Pest Management.
32.    Bank policies and directives leave no doubt whatsoever that environmental
I          assessments must be undertaken for all Bank projects classified as "A" or "B." The
situation is not as clear-cut with respect to the need for social assessments.

However, several World Bank operational directives require or imply the use of social
assessment, including  those on  Environmental Assessment (paragraph  3),
Indigenous Peoples (paragraphs 14 and  15), and  Involuntary Resettlement       I
(paragraph 11). Since these policy statements do not specify the methods and
procedures that should be implemented  in undertaking the required social
assessments, the professional competence of the social scientists involved becomes
of paramount importance, as does the Bank's obligation to provide guidance.
33.   Throughout the 1990s, the World Bank has played a leading international role
in promoting sound procedures for project assessment.  With ODs 4.01 on
Environmental Assessment in place, and later 4.30 on Involuntary Resettlement and
4.20 on Indigenous Peoples, the Bank is widely regarded as being in the forefront of
international attempts to use environmental and social policies to ensure the   U
sustainability of development projects. It has gained an enviable reputation for sound
environmental assessment procedures among environmental professionals.  Its
performance in overseeing environmental assessments for Bank funded projects, to
ensure that they meet the standards it has set and promoted, is watched closely by
both environmental scientists and organizations interested in sustainability.
3.2    Wide Divergence of Views on Interpretation/Application of ODs
34.   In earlier cases, the Panel noted a certain differnce of views among staff on
just how the Bank's operational policies and procedures should be applied. In this
case, however, the nature and range of these divergences, and their implications for
a reasonable application of the Bank's policies and procedures, became a matter of
serious concern. These differences pervade all ranks of the staff, from senior
management to front-line professionals. And they apply to virtually all of the major
decisions required by the policies. This ought to be of concern to the Bank generally
since there is no way that the policies can be applied with reasonable consistency in
the face of such wide divergences of opinion. A few general examples of these
differences will be provided here and the Panel will return to them later as required
when dealing with specific issues.
35.    Certain staff members felt that the Bank's Operational Directives and other
policies were simply idealized policy statements, and should be seen largely as a set
of goals to be striven after.  According to this view, very little, if anything, is
mandatory. What would be more important is the overall trend in the Bank, which
should work toward the achievement of these goals. In the meantime, one may have
to accept what might appear to be failures in achieving the sometimes high standards
I

I                                                                                  20
embodied in the policies. Others of equal or more senior rank disagreed with this
view, feeling that this interpretation could render the policies virtually meaningless
I          and certainly incapable of being employed as benchmarks against which to measure
compliance.
36.    In discussions about compliance, staff often pointed out that the policies
allow for flexibility of interpretation and they asserted that the decisions made on the
I          specific issues in question were thus covered and in compliance. It was simply a
maiter of  "judgement at Management's sole discretion."  The Management
3          Response itself makes several claims in this respect.  For example, after citing
preambulatory phrasing in OD 4.01 on Environmental Assessment that suggests the
need for "flexibility," the Response argues that this project was correctly assigned to
environmental screening Category "B," rather than the more stringent Category "A."
37.   It is of course true that the texts of the policies do allow for some flexibility of
interpretation. They must do so in order to allow professionals to make decisions
best suited to a range of projects. Yet, as other staff argued, and as will be
3          emphasized throughout this report, the policies are clear enough to distinguish areas
that are binding from areas where general guidelines call for some reasonable
interpretation and flexibility.  Read in their entirety, the Panel feels that the
directives cannot possibly be taken to authorize a level of "interpretation" and
"flexibility" that would permit those who must follow these directives to simply
|          override the portions of the directives that are clearly binding.
38.    Most staff at all levels agreed that, in appraising compliance, Management
I          had an obligation to satisfy itself not only that the process and procedures mandated
by the policies had been followed, but also that the work under review met
professionally acceptable standards of quality. A senior official put it clearly when he
told the Panel that the Management has a duty to ensure that our minimum standards
are adhered to, and it has a duty to ensure that the quality of the project meets the
standard that the Bank expects. In other words, both process and quality were
essential components of compliance.
39.    Some staff, however, took an entirely different view. Recalling that the OD
4.01  on Environmental Assessment mandates a process through which an
I          assessment should move from  inception to final appraisal and sign-off, they
maintained, for example, that even a one-page environmental assessment of a major
project could be in compliance if it passed the desks of, and was checked off by, the
appropriate persons at the appropriate times in the decision process. While it might
I
I



l
21
be desireable to ensure professionally acceptable standards of quality, it is not
required for compliance.  This 'check-list' or 'process' approach to compliance
represents a minority view but, in the Panel's view, it is of concern when it is held by
senior persons in the project decision-chain.
40.    A starting point for some staff was the Bank's goal that "ownership" of the
development process should reside within the borrowing country. In their view, this
led necessarily to trade-offs in several areas, including the application of the Bank's
safeguard policies.   By this reasoning, occasionally inadequate social and
environmental assessments are a cost of encouraging government staff and
consultants to move toward greater understanding of Bank policies, and greater
compliance, as they take over and come to "own" the development process. As a
result of that "ownership," the safeguard policies could eventually be internalized and
applied to the much larger number of development projects within the country that are
not funded by the Bank. These views were sometimes presented to the Panel as
general perspectives on local capacity-building for social and environmental
assessments of development projects.
41.    Others, accepting the broad goal of "ownership" and recognizing that Bank-
financed projects may represent only a small percentage of development projects in a
country, came to a very different conclusion. In their view, this meant that Bank-
financed projects should take on an added significance and have an example-setting
role within the country's development process. It would be well within the Bank's
mission, and consistent with the Bank's policies, for Bank-financed projects to
emphasize and insist upon the best possible practice within the safeguards. The
extra time and effort this would require from Bank staff would add to, rather than
subtract from, in-country capacity-building for development. This becomes even
more important if the Bank's safeguard practices are being held up as models for
development projects elsewhere in the country and the world. This view is especially
skeptical of the notion that "ownership" of "poor practice" constitutes a stepping-stone
toward "better practice" later on. In the Panel's view, to accept what otherwise
would be seen as inadequate assessment seems especially patronizing in
developing countries whose scientists are clearly capable of world-class
contributions in every area where they are provided the opportunity. And, in
the meantime, it leaves those countries saddled with the social and
environmental costs of inadequate assessments.
42.     Often, in interviews with Bank staff and consultants, questions about
compliance were answered with claims of "precedent."  Precedents from other
I
1



l
22
approved projects in China, or from other social and environmental assessments
within China, were cited as evidence that Bank policies and procedures were
followed in this case as well. The Management Response itself cites "...past practice
with ... a large number of similar integrated agricultural development projects
financed by the Bank in China over the last 10 years," as a reason for assigning an
environmental Category "B" rather than "A."34 Management's past experience in a
country is obviously important. It can provide the basis for a certain level of
comfort that the work that is required by the policies will be undertaken
successfully.  It is an entirely different matter, however, to suggest that
experience and precedent can determine what is required by the policies.
43.    Interviews with some staff were punctuated by the refrain that "in China
things are done differently," and that what may not be accepted elsewhere as
compliance had always been accepted for China.  This refrain echoed the
Management Response where, on page 1, Management states that: "The level and
quality of preparation and analysis for this Project were very much in line with Bank
practice in applying social and environmental policies to projects in China in the
context of its political and social systems." This, too, seems to be a very long reach.
The Panel has carefully examined the policies and has failed to find any
grounds for the view that precedents in a country, or a country's "political and
social systems," can in any way determine what is required by the policies.
44.    Faced with these widely divergent views among the staff about the Bank
policies and compliance, the Panel was forced to ask itself a number of questions.
What are the limits of flexibility and interpretation allowed by these policies? Does
compliance involve obligations regarding both process and quality? What would be
the consequences of making exceptions to what is otherwise required by the policies,
based on precedents within a country? What would be the consequences of
interpreting what is required by the policies in light of a country's "political and social
systems"?
45.   In the end, the Panel returned to the approach to compliance reflected in its
earlier reports. There is room for some flexibility and interpretation but, in the
Panel's view, the Operational Directives (and updated OPs, BPs, GPs, etc.) are
the primary source of Bank policy for purposes of assessing compliance.
Shihata is instructive in this regard. As Senior Vice President and General Counsel

of the World Bank in 1994, he wrote: "However, exceptions which are not authorized
by the text of the OD must be kept to a minimum, if the ODs are to serve their
purpose and if the Bank is to avoid undue differentiation among its borrowers. After  I
all, the ODs are not meant to be 'marching orders' for a specific operation but a
'general operational code' which is written to apply in different situations and allows
for the differentiation and exceptions deemed acceptable at the time of its issuance.
While not all the standards provided for in the ODs are binding (it depends on the
wording of each standard), those stated in binding terms create a duty for the staff to  I
exert their best efforts to achieve them.'05

Chapter 4
The Qinghai Project in Space and Time
46.    A clear understanding of the spatial and temporal parameters of a project
being studied is fundamental to its proper evaluation and assessment.36 There is a
need to know what areas are involved and are likely to experience environmental,
social and economic impacts, and the time frame within which these impacts occur.
With that knowledge, it is possible to determine the scope of any assessments to be
undertaken and later to review them using the same space and time scales.
47.    OD 4.01 is clear on this, and while ODs 4.20 and 4.30 are less direct, they do
provide clear guidance. OD 4.01 calls for a "Concise description of the project's
geographic, ecological, social, and  temporal context. including  any  off-site
investments that may be required by the project ...." This is to be based on an
"Assessment of the dimensions of the study area and description of relevant physical,
biological, and socioeconomic conditions, including any changes anticipated before
the project commences. Current and proposed development activities within the
project area (but not directly connected to the project) should also be taken into
account."37 OD 4.01 also points out that "The classification of each proposed project
depends on the type, location, sensitivity, and scale of the proposed project, as well
as the nature and magnitude of its proposed impacts."38
48.   The requirement that project boundaries be defined to include the impacted
population seems also to be a requirement of OD 4.20, insofar as the impacted
population may consist of indigenous peoples. This is implied by OD 4.20's stated
central objective: "to ensure that indigenous peoples do not suffer adverse effects
during the development process, particularly from Bank-financed projects, and that
they receive culturally compatible social and economic benefits"39 Clearly, the Bank
cannot "ensure" that a population will not suffer adverse social or environmental
effects from a project unless it properly determines the boundaries within which the
project's social and environmental effects occur.

49.    Within the text of OD 4.01, of course, many social dimensions are included.
The "Checklist of Potential Issues for an EA" includes "Induced Development and
Other Sociocultural Aspects'40 And within the checklist of issues that should be         I
assessed, it cross-references with other relevant Bank policies including, inter alia,
the ODs on Involuntary Resettlement and Indigenous Peoples.
4.1     Ambiguous and Narrow Definition of the Project Area                              I
50.    In examining the Qinghai Project, the Panel found a high level of ambiguity,
uncertainty and inconsistency in the use of the term "project area" and in the extent to  3
which the Move-out and Move-in areas are analyzed and treated in the Project
documentation. There is no explicit statement in the documentation of either the
space or time scales used in the evaluation of the Project.  The documentation           I
recognizes two geographical areas, the Move-out areas in the hill country around
Xining, and the Move-in areas in Dulan County 450 kilometers to the west of Xining in    3
the Qaidam  Basin. The precise spatial dimensions being considered in both the
Move-out and Move-in areas are not defined.
51.    While the stated rationale for the Qinghai Project claims significant potential
net benefits for people in both the Move-in and Move-out areas, the assessments          !
focus almost exclusively on the Move-in areas. Moreover, both the documentation on
the Move-in area and discussions in the field reveal considerable confusion as to
what constitutes the "project area" in which the expected impacts will accrue.  In       i
some contexts "the project" is confined to the six areas to be irrigated, or even to the
main area to be irrigated at Xiangride-Balong (see Map 2), and excludes adjacent         3
infrastructure. In others, it is confined to the irrigated land plus new infrastructure --
but excludes the water diversion works. In general, it excludes a number of small
and larger settlements, including Mongol and Tibetan minority settlements visited by     3
the Panel, that will clearly be impacted by the Project. As a result, it appears that
significant numbers of people, including members of minority nationalities,
have been left out of the environmental and social assessments required by               I
Bank policy.41
40 See OD 4.01, supra note 32, at Annex A (h).
41 On page 108 of the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), Management draws a distinction between
the immediate 'move-in' area, or 'project specific' area, and the 'project townships' and 'Dulan county',
but the discussion implies that the Project will mpact only on people in the 'move-in' townships of
Zongjia and Balong. On this basis, Management can state that "The immediate 'move-in' area
currently has no Tibetans at all" and claim that "The Project as currently planned will thus introduce a
Tibetan presence in the area as they will make up nearly 6 percent of the population." Going beyond  I
the immediate Move-in area to the two townships of Zongjia and Balong, (which the PAD calls the
'immediate project area'), Management states that they "yield a pre-project Mongol majority (about 55

I                                                                                            26
4.2     Unclear Time Horizons for Project Evaluation
52.     There is also a serious question about the time horizons over which the
Project has been evaluated. They are not the same as the F'roject construction period
3            but they are not stated. The Environmental Assessment does not distinguish between
short term impacts and those that will only occur at some time in the future. Similarly,
when impacts are judged to be negative (-) or double negative (--) or +, ++, or +++,
I            no statement is given as to whether such judgement is relative to a one, five or
twenty-five year time horizon.42 It is thus impossible for anyone reviewing the EA to
3            assess whether or not the projected impacts are based on reasonable time frames.
In short, in the Panel's view, the EA fails completely to place the project in
proper time frames for informed decisions to be taken.43  This is a serious
I           shortcoming  that significantly  reduces  the  value  of the  Environmental
Assessment.
1            4.3    Documentation Poorly Supported by Maps and References
3            53.    The confusion the Panel encountered over what is and what is not included in
the definition of the 'project area' is no doubt compounded by the fact that the
documentation is very poorly supported by maps. Those maps that were in the
documentation were of a very small scale. Most lacked scale lines and all omitted
latitude and longitude or other co-ordinates. Even detailed 1:50000 maps of the
3            irrigated areas that were provided to the Inspection Team  on the day it visited the
main irrigation area of Xiangride-Balong did not provide grid references or latitude
and longitude, so that exact positions on the map could be determined. It is thus
very  difficult, if not impossible, for anyone  reading  the  Environmental
Assessment to gain a clear and unambiguous view of the locational aspects of
3           the Project from the information provided. This applies to both the Move-out
and Move-in areas.
1            percent) of the area's population of 5,736. Among these are 276 Tibetan herders who bring their
animals to pasture in the Kunlun Mountains.... After the settlement is completed, Han and Hui would
be the predominant nationalities in the project townships, followed by smaller numbers of the Tu,
Salar, Tibetans, and Mongols." Later in the same section, Management acknowledges that the ethnic
mix is a function of "the territorial unit considered" as part of the project area. See IDA/IRDB, Project
Appraisal Document on a Proposed Loan of US$60 million and a Proposed Credit of SDR 73.8 million
(US$100 million equivalent) to the People's Republic of China for the Westem Poverty Reduction
Project, Report No: 1 8982-CHA (1 June 1999) [hereinafter Project Appraisal Document or "PAD").

meaningless, as all values are the same. QINGHAI INSTITUTE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE,

54.    The FAO Consultant who made an independent assessment of the suitability
of the land for irrigation in October 1998, drew attention to the urgent need for a
detailed soil survey and land classification."  He recommended the preparation of a
soil map or land classification map at a final scale of 1:10,000. Following an inquiry,
Management informed the Panel on January 11, 2000 that the map had not been
completed.  It had been initially delayed due to severe winter weather conditions and
then further delayed "due to the intensive questioning and discussions regarding the           I
project that started end of April, 1999."45 Given the crucial importance of knowing the
extent of irrigable land available for the Project, it is surprising that Management did       3
not pursue the completion of this map with greater diligence.

55.   Some of the maps of the Move-in area that were provided to the Inspection
Team were found to be of doubtful value since they omitted many settlements clearly
within the orbit of influence of the Project. As a consequence, the Inspection Team
spent a great deal of time trying to locate particular sites or features, sometimes
unsuccessfully as the following two examples will illustrate.

56.  In order to get a somewhat clearer picture of the geography of the Move-in
area, just prior to its visit the Team was provided with a hand-drawn sketch map
showing all of the villages and townships in the area. The Panel wishes to record its
3          appreciation for the last-minute effort that went into its creation, but even this map
proved deficient in that during its visit the Panel "found" several villages that were not
on it. It is fair to say that Bank officials themselves were not aware of the existence of
these villages although they are clearly within the orbit of the Project
I                                 ..
Figure 3. Panel Member (in cap) meeting with Qinghai provincial
officials to find the "missing" Mongol villages in Xiangjia Township.
1          57.  On October 15, 1999, for example, the Team was informed that there were
several Mongol villages on the southeastern edge of Xiangride town, in a township
referred to as Xiangjia, and that there were approximately 3,000 people in the
*          township, 80 percent of them Mongol and 20 percent Han. (This was subsequently
revised to 4,972 people, 2,576 of whom were Mongols.) It was decided that a part of
3          the Inspection Team would visit one of the villages identified as a Mongol village,
called Tuanjie. On arrival, however, the Team discovered that they were in a Han and
not a Mongol village. Attempts to visit other Mongol villages in the area proved
I          fruitless. When the Team reassembled, explanations were sought and at least three
mutually contradictory accounts were given. The Team finally asked for a written list
3|         of all of the villages in the Township, Mongol and Han, and their populations. This
was provided and, before returning to Xining, the Team asked that the villages on the
l
l



l
29
list be shown on the sketch map that was still evolving. When this arrived following
the Panel's return to Washington, the Team was surprised to note that almost all the
villages were shown to be located not on the south eastern edge of Xiangride town,
but on a line directly north of the irrigation site (see Map 2). If correct, this would
potentially bring an additional 4,972  people, including 2,576 Mongols, into the
"immediate move-in area", to use the term employed by Management in the PAD.
But it does not explain the whereabouts of the Mongols who, on the morning of
October 15, the Panel was assured lived in several villages southeast of Xiangride.
58.   Overall, the  standard  of maps, charts and  references provided  in the
assessments is quite unacceptable for a project of this nature. They do not provide a
complete record of the settlements, infrastructure and land use in the areas that will
be affected by the Qinghai Project. There is also no ethnolinguistic map, showing the
locations of minority populations. Given the poor map coverage of the area, the
Team eventually had to prepare its own set of maps indicating, as far as it could
ascertain, all the areas, localities, Project sites, roads, townships, villages, rivers and
key topographic features of this multi-faceted and complex project. (Maps 1 and 2).
59. An assessment of the potential impacts and a delimitation of boundaries should
have  been  among  the  initial topics of study  in order to  properly  scope the
Environmental and Social Assessments required by Bank policies.  This report
obviously cannot substitute for such studies (which have yet to be carried out).
However, in paragraph 73 below, it notes  several areas that will potentially be
impacted by this Project that should have been included within those assessments.46
These are discussed more fully in Chapter 8.
46 In its Request for Inspection, the International Campaign for Tibet (ICT) raised this issue but the
discussion was restricted (unnecessarily, from the perspective of compliance with the ODs) to the
question of whether ICT had standing to request an inspection since there were no Tibetans living in
the most restrictively defined "immediate project area" (i.e., the proposed irrigation and new township
area, see Map 2). Arguing that a much larger number of ethnic Tibetans in Dulan County would be  I
impacted by the project, ICT proposed that Dulan County in its entirety be considered the project area,
due to the importance of local government for infrastructure, funding and access to services.
"Residence in Dulan County is sufficient to establish proximity to the project area and to assure that
anyone in the county will be affected by the project," the Request asserts. Yet, the boundary of the  I
impacted population may not be coterminus with any political boundary, such as a County. The
impacts of a project, and the time requirements for those impacts to be felt, can be estimated broadly
by comparison with similar projects elsewhere. see RABEL J. BUROGE, (ed.), A conceptual approach to  I
socialimpactassessment(revised ed. Middleton), Wisconsin: Social Ecology Press (1998).

4.3.1 The Move-out Area
60.  A too-narrow or confused definition of the Project area can result, and in this
case has resulted, in people and communities that will be impacted being left out of
the Assessments of the Project. In this regard, the Panel was struck by the failure of
both the Social and the Environmental Assessments to attempt to measure, or even
to address, the impacts of this Project in the Move-out area. The Move-out areas
involve 57,775 migrants from households in 448 villages in 48 townships in 5
counties in Haidong Prefecture and one county in Xining City Prefecture. They
should be addressed in both Assessments.
61.   Management maintains that the requirements of OD 4.30 (Involuntary
Resettlement) do not apply to the Move-out area because the resettlement is
voluntary. However, the requirements of OD 4.20 (Indigenous Peoples) do apply
because many of those left behind in the Move-out area are minority nationalities,
including Mongols, Tibetans, Salar, and Hue. The potential adverse impacts on them
will need to be addressed as a matter of Bank policy. Management's presumption
seems to have been that the non-migrating minority populations left behind will not
suffer any adverse impacts. This may or may not be the case. Testing it requires
more than an assumption; it requires an assessment.
4.3.2 The Move-in Area
62.  The failure to properly define the boundaries of the Project in the Move-in area
also has potentially serious consequences. People and communities that will be
impacted by the Project have been left out of the Assessments because they were
left out of the Bank's definition of the 'project area'. Moreover, some aspects of the
Project have not been assessed at all. The documentation on the Move-in area, for
example, is virtually silent on the Project's relationship to the regional economy and
its spatial networks and appears to include no systematic analysis of the relationship
of the Project to pastoral land use in the eastern Qaidam Basin.
4.3.2.1 The Project Area and the Spatial Urban Network,
63.  The documentation fails to situate the Move-in area within a realistic regional
context. A network of social, commercial and political interactions clearly exists in
Dulan County and in Xiangride Township. Yet no assessment is made of how these
linkages and interactions will be affected, for better or worse, by a project that will
greatly change the economy and demography of the County.
l



l
31         3
64.   The "project area," as interpreted in the EA and other documentation, includes
neither the commercial and service center of Xiangride, nor several of the villages
surrounding it, including some Tibetan and Mongol villages visited by the Inspection
Team. Similarly, the "project area" does not include several villages between
Xiangride and Dulan and between Xiangride and the new towns to be created in the
irrigation site. These omissions are difficult to understand.
65.   The new  Towns of Dongba and Tawen ("A" and "B" on Map 2), with
populations projected at 22,938 and 26,814 inhabitants will be considerably larger
than the existing towns in the resettlement area.47  They will have a significant
influence on the economies, trading patterns and socio-political influence of the
existing service centers like Xiangride, with a population of 9,621 in 1996; Xiangjia,   i
4,835, and Balong, 3,696.48 The most elementary principles of Town and Regional
Planning suggest that this should have been a major factor in defining the boundaries    I
of the Project area, but it was not considered.
66.   Xiangride is the locus of the transport services, banking and commercial           I
services, medical, health and education services for the entire Project area. People
in Balong and Zongjia townships, which are in the narrow 'project area' accepted by
the Bank, speak of Xiangride town routinely as the place they must go for most of
their locally-based services. Speaking to merchants in Xiangride, the Team found
that those who were even  partially informed about the Project were full of              I
expectations that it would increase their trade and commerce, and that it would act as
a pole of attraction for further people and investment. The interdependence is clear.    5
67.   The same is true of the townships adjacent to the Xiangride prison farm. On
October 15, 1999, standing beside the large canal on the edge of the farm, the Team      I
was informed by a senior Chinese official that the canal supplied water from the
Xiangride River to irrigate some 80,000 mu of land on the prison farm as well as
some 80,000 mu of land immediately adjacent to and south of the farm occupied by

Voluntary Migration Ressetlement (15 April 1999) [hereinafter "Voluntary Settlement Plan" or "VSIP"]
Table 9-1 at p. 64. It should, however, be notec that the Inspection Team has been unable to obtain  I
detailed information on the structure and relationships between "Natural Villages", "Administrative
Villages" and "New Towns" in the resettlement area. It is thus possible that the populations of the new
towns themselves may be less than the numbers suggest, due to much of the population being  I
dispersed amongst villages near to, or at some distance from, the towns

some 20,000 "free" farmers.49 There were no physical connections between the
Project and  this system, the  official stated. And, he  insisted, there would  be
X             absolutely no economic interactions of any kind between the prison farm  and the
Project. All of the produce of the prison farm, he stated, mostly wheat, is absorbed
3             by the prison farm system.50
I                                                                                 -SD  :        :

officials in front of the main avenue to the   Water will be diverted from this canal to irri-ate the
prison farm near Xiangride, Dulan County.  Proposed Project's Xiaoxiatan Irrigation Sub-district.
68.   Economic relationships between the Project and the townships occupied by
the "free" farmers are a different matter, however. The Project will bring in nearly
60,000 people to the new irrigation area in Balong township, 40 kilometers to the
|             west northwest. These people would be dependent on outside farms and merchants
for much of their food, supplies and other services, certainly during the initial
1             49 The free farmers, as they were characterized by the Chinese Senior Official, live mainly in two towns
visited by the Panel, Xingyuan and Xiachaikai.
50 The Bank has sought and received assurances that no prison labor would be used on the Project
and Supplementary Letter 4 states that: ".....Qinghai's Respective Part of the Project will not benefit
U             any prison farm or other prison facility in Qinghai, and no such farms or facilities or organizations
affiliated with such farms and facilities will participate in any activities under Qinghai's Respective Part
of the Project .... no goods, works or services procured under Qinghai's Respective Part of the Project
I             will be provided by any such farm or facility or organization, or using any labor associated with any
such farm or facility or organization..." See Supplemental Letter No. 4 (signed 30 December 1999).
Supplemental Letter No. 4 was partially reproduced in the Management Response as Annex 11. The
above-mentioned quotation, however, was not reproduced in the Management Response. See IDA,
Management Response, supra note 11, Annex 12, at p. 87-89.

development period, and the "free" farmers, the senior official told the Panel, naturally
looked forward to supplying a part of this new demand. They also looked forward to
gaining some of the longer term benefits that the economic development the Project    I
would bring. Yet, these townships are not considered within the 'project area' as
defined by Management. 
69.   The Bank's assistance in assessing the environmental effects of induced
development is also envisaged by OD 4.01.  It states that "Secondary growth of
settlements and infrastructure, often referred to as "induced development" or
"boomtown" effects, can have major indirect environmental impacts, which relatively   |
weak local governments may have difficulty addressing."51

Townships, with large initial and ongoing investments to build an irrigation system    |
and the two new Towns of Dongba and Tawen ("A" and "B" on Map 2), of 22,938 and
26,814 people respectively, will represent a significant addition to the regional
economy and its interdependent spatial urban network. Standard economic and

benefit-cost analysis of a project normally considers the multiplier effects of this type
of intervention and its longer term impact on the region in question.
4.3.2.2 The Project Area and the Environmental Assessment
71.   The Environmental Assessment notes that the Project involves the Town of
Xiangride and the "five" villages (sic), which it lists as: Xiangjia, Balong, Zongjia and
Gaoli.52 Nowhere, however, does it clearly identify all the areas that are covered by
the Assessment, nor how those areas relate to the area that will be affected by the
Project. The sketch map provided in the Management Response indicates the Move-
in Areas in red as Balong, Keri, Xiaoxiatan, Hatu and Yikegaoli. But the January,
1999 Voluntary Resettlement Policy Framework and Action Plan states that there will
be six irrigation areas (Balong, Qingshuie, Hatu, Keri, Yikegaoli and Xiaoiatan) and 4
townships (i.e., the two new towns and the existing Balong and Zongjia townships
3           which will be expanded). In discussions with Bank and Chinese officials from the
PMO and the Plateau Institute, the "project area" was frequently equated with the
main area to be irrigated at Balong.3  And, as noted earlier, the PAD seems to
equate it with the two Move-in townships of Balong and Zongjia.54
3           72.   Beyond this confusion, it is clear that a very narrow approach was taken to the
definition of the "project area" and that little or no attention was paid to the
environmental impacts on areas other than the proposed new irrigation areas and the
I           Balong Soak. The possible environmental impacts of the influx of nearly 60,000
people on the wider region is simply not addressed: it is, for example, inconceivable
{           that such a large population of migrants will not regularly visit the areas adjacent to
the new settlements and exploit their plant and animal resources for fodder, hunting
and so on. Management, it must be noted, recognized this in the period following the
1           Request for Inspection.  In Annex 14 of its Response, it provides the Terms of
Reference for a series of supplementary environmental studies to be undertaken to
address some of these issues including impacts on surrounding natural habitats
during the now-planned "Pre-Pilot Phase" of the Project.55
52 See Environmental Assessment, supra note 42, at p.22. "Goali," used here in the Environmental
Assessment is a synonym for Yikegaoli used elsewhere and on Map 2.
53 As a result of the Panel's inquiries, an irrigation map was provided in October, 1999, from which an
I           early draft of Map 2 was produced. Then, in January, 2000, the RMC provided the Panel with the
outlines and locations of the six irrigation districts now shown on the map. Final information on the
location of the canals was provided, in response to further inquiries, in March, 2000. This information
is presented in Map 2.
54 See PAD supra note 41, at p. 108.
55 See Management Response, supra note 12, at p. 96-108, Annex 14.

73.  Many parts of the Move-in areas have been overlooked or glossed over
in the EA and in other documentation of the Project; consequently many
potential environmental effects have not been systematically analyzed. In the
Panel's view, compliance with OD 4.01 requires that these areas receive         I
detailed consideration. The environmental effects of the canal from the Xiangride
River to the Keri dam, the Keri dam itself, and the canal from the Keri dam to the
irrigation area need to be assessed. Similarly, the effects of the proposed new  I
township areas, and the administrative villages to be located within the main irrigated
area, and their associated infrastructure such as public utilities and roads, must be
considered. The effects on the Xiangride River downstream to the salt lakes need to
be assessed, as do the effects on the Keri Dam area, the six irrigation areas, the
Balong Soak and other marshlands, and on the desert, semi-desert and low scrub  I
areas in the vicinity of the irrigation area and the new townships. The effects on the
existing townships that are to be expanded through resettlement (Balong and     3
Zongjia) and the other existing townships, especially Xiangride town and surrounding
villages need also to be evaluated.

74.  The EA does not give any clear idea of where the nearly 60,000 people will be
located within the project areas, whether their villages will be located within the
irrigation areas or outside them, where the penned land for animal husbandry will be  3
located, how the villages will be clustered (if at all), and how many and what kinds of
people will be housed in the new Towns. Some of the numerical data can be

obtained from the Involuntary Resettlement Plan56 but the only locational information
the Inspection Team has been able to ascertain is given in the irrigation drawing
I           provided by the Hydrology and Power Research Institute on the day it visited the
irrigation site.
4.3.2.3     The Project Area and the Social Assessment
75.   Within the Move-in area, the Management Response distinguishes the
"immediate project area" (i.e., the "proposed area of irrigation and new townships")
|          from a wider region around it, known as the "project site." It recognizes that the
Project "will likely have a wider demographic and social impact beyond the immediate
i          project area.",7 since it will immediately double Dulan County's official population.58
76.   The March 1999 Social Assessment notes that discussions were held with
local government officials and leaders in this broader impacted area, beyond the
Project site. Still, it makes clear that in the Move-in area, the methods of actual
public consultation used to fulfill the consultation requirements of Bank policy (that is,
the surveys and the focus group meetings) were limited to the three directly impacted
groups:
1                 (1)   the 63 herder households (352 persons) having formal leasehold
rights (on file in the lands registry of Dulan County) in the "immediate project
3                 area";
(2)   a sample of the estimated 289 herder households (2,411 persons) who
_                 pass through the area proposed for transformation into irrigated farmland and
townships for the resettled population; and
(3)   a sample of the 248 households (1,237 persons) who currently farm on
the area served by an existing irrigation system, which will be integrated into
the Project's new irrigation systems.
3           77.   The figure of 2,411 herders was Management's estimate of the number of
herders who would cross the proposed irrigation area approximately twice each year.
56 See QINGHAI PROVINCIAL PMO, Involuntary Resettlement Plan, RP-OC115, Vol. 2 (May 1999).
57 Management Response, supra note 12, at p. 7.
58 This recognition, it must be noted, came very late, evolving between the beginning of public
concern in late April and the submission of the Response on July 19, 1999.
I



l
37
Management agrees that these people must also be considered involuntarily
resettled under the terms of OD 4.30.59
78.   Management makes no  claim  to  have  carried  out equivalent public
consultation with the wider population impacted outside the "project site" in the Move-  I
in area. Tibetan and Mongol village leaders in Xiangride township, whose villages lie
directly on the proposed supply-canal route to the irrigated area, told the Inspection
Team that they had neither been officially contacted nor asked about the Project.      I
These villages will be impacted directly by the Project's physical infrastructure, and
indirectly by a doubling of their county's population. Yet village leaders did not know  3
important details about the Project such as whether settlers would number a few
thousand or tens of thousands. They had learned about the project only by hearsay
or, in one case, from a report broadcast on a shared community television.
79.   As noted earlier, OD 4.20's stated central objective is  "to ensure that
indigenous peoples do not suffer adverse effects during the development process,
particularly from Bank-financed projects, and that they receive culturally compatible
social and economic benefits" (OD 4.20 par. 6).  Thus, it is simply not within         I
Management's prerogative to define the Project in a very limited way (the "immediate
project area') for purposes of fulfilling this OD, since that does not ensure against
adverse impacts on indigenous populations who live and work beyond the "immediate
project area." 
80.   A full social assessment would require a much greater consideration of the
effects of the Qinghai Project on nearby Towns including Xiangride and Dulan, as
well as a much larger number of villages, some visited by the Inspection Team. It
would require consideration of the multiplier effects of impacts caused by the
construction of the new dam and reservoir, irrigation system, roads, and townships     5
with all their infrastructure; and also the likely population increase as the nearly
60,000 resettled farmers will have growing families and will attract more migrants,
merchants, teachers, medical personnel, etc. Simple models for population growth
and for expected changes in trading patterns would be useful. The sources of this
growing population's food (for people and livestock) and firewood or other fuels       |
should be determined. A full social assessment is not simply a matter of applying
59The Directive specifies that "compensation should be provided to ... pastoralists who may have
usufruct or customary rights to the land or other resources taken for the project. The absence of legal
title to land by such groups should not be a bar to compensation." See, IBRD/IDA, Operational
Directive 4.30 on Involuntary Resettlement (June 1990) [hereinafter OD 4.30] at ß 3(e).

good practice in Social Impact Assessment.  The requirements for a proper
assessment are emphasized here because a proper assessment would also
I          determine the proper boundaries of the impacted population. That information, in
turn, would affect the application of the Operational Directives for Indigenous People
|          and Involuntary Resettlement. Indeed, one of the central questions of both Social
and Environmental Assessment is to determine the boundaries of a project's
*          expected impacts.
81.  In the Panel's view, given the letter and intent of ODs 4.01, 4.20 and 4.30,
the size of the area that will be impacted by the Qinghai Project, the ethnic
composition of the Project's impacted populations and the boundaries of the
"project area" were far too narrowly defined by Management. As a result, the
I          Assessments fail to address many significant social and environmental
impacts of the Project, including impacts on potentially affected members of
minority nationalities. The Panel finds that, in this regard, Management failed
to comply with the provisions of these ODs.

Chapter 5
The Consultation and Survey Method.
1           82.   The previous chapter demonstrates that there is a much larger impacted
population in the Move-in area than Management recognized for purposes of
I           consultation. This chapter assesses the methodology of the consultation and survey
methods used among the more restricted population consulted as part of the
preparations for the project.
83.   Management has emphatically argued that the design of this project meets the
consultation requirements of OD 4.20 on Indigenous Peoples, OD 4.30 on Involuntary
Resettlement, and OD 4.01 on Environmental Assessment.60 In its Response,
Management states: "Consultation was carried out by means of questionnaires with
members of the indigenous population at large, through meetings involving their
leaders and religious notables, and by bringing into the consultation process grass-
roots organizations in the project areas. The consultation process was based on
'informed participation' of the project's direct stakeholders. Consultation tasks were
supported by an information campaign carried out by means of mass media, posters,
I           pamphlets, and direct communication [in] both out-migration and in-migration areas.
The extensive and varied opinions expressed by the participants in the consultation
I           process indicate that the information provided was broad enough to allow  the
expression of judgements on the potential effects of the project, and on the remedial
activities needed to counter balance the project's potential negative impacts.
iStakeholders were able to criticize aspects of the project and to provide their inputs to
the design of mitigating measures." 61
84.   Some of the information needed for this assessment includes the Chinese-
language questionnaires administered in the survey and the raw  survey data
compilations.62  It is perhaps worth noting that, even though these surveys form the

62 These compilations of the survey data were kindly sent by Resident Mission China to the Inspection
I           Panel after a follow-up inquiry of January 18, 2000. Annexes 2 to 5 include the questionnaires used in
all four surveys undertaken; raw data has been provided for the survey in the Move-out area (Annex 2)

primary record of the 'full and informed' participation on the part of the impacted
population, copies of the questionnaires had apparently never been requested by
those responsible within the Bank for reviewing or clearing the Project in relation to itsI
safeguard policies. The questionnaires and the raw data compilations were checked
by Bank staff in Beijing (though not included in material sent to Washington for the
clearance procedures). The Management Response states (p. 13): "Careful cross-
checking of this data by Bank staff (including review of the raw data) strengthened
the judgement of Bank experts that the key social issues involved in the Project hadI
been raised by the SA [Social Assessment]. 63",
85.  During its field visit, the Inspection Team tried to obtain copies of brochures,
pamphlets or other materials distributed in the Move-out areas. Some villagers
remembered seeing pamphlets and posters but said they no longer had any toI
provide. In February 2000, the Resident Mission in China kindly translated and made
available their file copy of the brochure describing the Project.I
86.  The Panel's field visit, meetings with villagers, interviews with officials, and
examination of the survey questionnaires and information materials, all raised several
concerns about the adequacy of the consultation process.6   This chapter begins
with a discussion of the adequacy of the survey's sampling procedure. It then turnsI
to the survey method and other related stakeholder consultation procedures in the
Move-out and the Move-in areas.I
5.1   The Sampling Procedures
87.  According to the raw data compilations, 2,058 households were surveyed, of 
which 1,458 were in the Move-out area and 600 were in the Move-in area.
Documents or interviewers who refer to the '4,000 persons surveyed" in the Move-in3
area, etc., are referring to the size of the population sampled, not the number of
surveys.I
88.  It is worthwhile first to compare the three populations in the Move-in area that
will involuntarily be resettled by this Project with the populations that were surveyed.
This is vital to an understanding of the sampling procedures.
Panel does not have complete raw data for the first and second surveys of the Mongol herders

89.  The Bank's publicly available "Involuntary Resettlement Plan," dated May,
1999, for this Project states that most of the land to be developed for the proposed
I          irrigation system is "arid, uninhabited, and largely unutilized." 65 It acknowledges,
however, that "in terms of involuntary resettlement-related issues and impacts, ...
development or expansion of settlements is expected to adversely affect some 4,000
persons (600 households) from Balong and Zongjia townships." The Plan lists these
impacted populations as follows, "....[b]ased on a census and survey of affected
areas":
(1) 63 herder households (352 persons) who use the land "under formal lease
agreements with the townships;"
1                (2) 289 herder households (2,411 persons) who pass twice yearly, with their
herds, through the area proposed for transformation into irrigated farmland and
3                townships for the resettled population;
(3) 248 households (1,237 persons) who currently farm on the area served by
I                an existing irrigation system, which will be integrated into the Project's new
irrigation systems.
1          90.  The sum  of these three groups, then, provides a total Project-impacted
population of exactly 600 households, and exactly 4,000 persons - thus exactly equal
to the estimated population. In other words, the careful enumeration of these groups
leads to a surprisingly round set of figures: 600 households, having 4,000 persons.
There is little doubt that the 63 herder households (352 persons) were carefully
surveyed (the name of each household head, and size of his family, is listed in
Project documents). Another survey (Annex 5) was given to a sample of only 80 of
|          the 248 mostly Han and Hui farmer households using the affected irrigation systems
in Balong and Xinglong townships. But, population statistics on residents of these
townships were undoubtedly available, so there is no reason to mistrust the figures of
248 households (1,237 persons) in this category.  It is likely that considerable
flexibility exists in defining which herders pass through the region (group 2), so
|          figures of 289 households (or 2,411 persons) are probably estimates producing the
round figures of 600 households and 4,000 persons in total. As noted below, this
group's size was almost certainly estimated since no survey was taken of them.

91.   Thus it is already apparent that the extent to which these involuntarily resettled
groups were "consulted" through the survey method is very different. Take the
second group, for example. No survey was designed for, and no survey carried out            I
among, the (presumably estimated) 289 nomadic pastoralist households (2,411
persons) in this group, whose twice-yearly passage through the project site with their
herds will be disrupted. In other words, zero percent of this group was surveyed.
The failure to survey this group  is especially striking  since Management
recognizes that these people need to be involuntarily resettled, and that the               I
provisions of OD 4.30 for full and informed consultation, compensation, etc.,
therefore, need to be fulfilled.66                                                          3
92.   In stark contrast to the fact that zero percent of the herders passing through
the Project's proposed irrigation areas were surveyed, 100 percent of the 63 herder
households in the first group were surveyed. In fact, examination of the survey data
and interviews with those responsible for the survey indicate many were surveyed            |
twice. The first time was in September, 1998, when the initial survey shown in Annex
3 was carried out at the request of a consultant engaged by the Task Team Leader to
help prepare the Social Assessment.  Only 31 herder families were found and                 I
interviewed in this first survey (Annex 3). Nevertheless, as a result of this first survey,
it was realized that a passageway through the irrigation area would be needed for the
transhumant pastoralists. It was also realized that a more complete survey would be
needed of all those having leasehold rights within the 'project area' and, later, a
second survey (shown in Annex 4) was carried out.67
93.   Of the 248 households (1,237 persons) in the third group, who are currently
farming an irrigated area in Balong township, and whose irrigation system  will be
expanded and integrated into the new system, 80 households or 32 percent were
surveyed. They were surveyed using a questionnaire that is much longer and more              3
detailed than any provided for the Mongol herders (Annex 5). Of the 80 households
66 See OD 4.30, supra note 59 in fine, at ßß 3 (c) (d), 5 (b), 8 and 9.
67 A consultant involved in the September, 1998 survey noted that this later second survey might not
have been carried out among exactly the same people. The second survey set out to locate the
herders who were officially leasing the land to be taken over for the Project. The first survey just tried
to find herders who happened to be on that land, but did not directly ask about leasehold rights. This
second survey (Annex 3-c) must have been preceded by town meetings and discussions, since it  I
requires answers to such detailed questions as the size of the herder's leased area (measured in mu)
that the Project will occupy. To have an exact answer, as was shown in the sample survey provided,
would have required a project engineer to designate the project boundaries, relative to the  I
leaseholder's boundaries. The boundaries of the proposed irrigation area would be invisible to the
pastoralist, and the boundaries of the leaseholder's claim invisible to the project engineer.

surveyed, 57 are Han (71 percent of those surveyed), 17 are Hui (21 percent), 3 are
Tibetan (4 percent), and 3 are Tu (4 percent).
94.   From these numbers, one can conclude that the largest group of persons
I           involuntarily resettled by this project (i.e., the pastoralists in the second group whose
passage through the irrigation site with their herds will be disrupted) received the
least consultation, at least as measured by the survey data. Although this group
I           makes up 60 percent of the people and 72 percent of the households to be
involuntarily resettled, none (zero percent) of this group was surveyed, using
Management's own population estimates and survey data.

Project s land, used by 248 households ( 1,237 persons) for farming, is served by an
existing irrigation system. This land will be integrated into the rew imigation
systems to be developed as part of the Project
95.    One can also conclude that Management failed to consider weighting the
I          surveys by ethnicity, or to assure adequate representation in the survey sample of
affected minority groups.  This relates to the earlier discussion in Chapter 4 about
the boundaries of the project-impacted area. Most striking is the fact that in the
*          entire Move-in area only three Tibetan households were included in the survey
(used here as a proxy measure of public consultation). This is in spite of the
3          fact that the Project occurs in a Tibetan and Mongolian Autonomous Region,
and the physical infrastructure for the Project (its supply-canal) passes
l

through Tibetan villages that were not included within Management's definition
of the "project area."68                                                            l
96.    Of course, one could respond that consultation included many meetings and
discussions besides the survey, therefore the survey data should not be used as a
proxy measure for overall public consultation.  Yet in effect, the Management
Response does imply that the surveys are good proxies for the overall public
consultation when it repeatedly makes claims about the will of the population in the  I
Move-in area based upon these surveys. Consider, for example, the claims in Annex
9 of the Management Response that "... a large majority of respondents (97 percent)
felt that the project would take adequate steps to mitigate any negative impacts."69
97.    Given the fact that these issues relate directly to potential inter-ethnic conflict,  |
knowing the overall 9 percent figure for those opposing the influx of migrants (or the
97 percent figure for those who feel the Project will adequately mitigate negative 3
impacts) is less useful than knowing how representative the sample is of the
impacted population, and how freely honest responses could be given. Based on the
survey methods used and the restricted sampling procedure, one cannot necessarily   J
extrapolate these responses to (all) "the local communities" as implied here in the
Response.                                                                           I
98.     The above comments refer to the surveys described in the Social
Assessment (March 1999), the "Involuntary Resettlement Plan" (dated May 1999),      1
and referenced in the Management Response (July 19, 1999). On October 6, 1999,
during the Inspection Team's visit to Beijing, an undated document entitled "Notes on  3
the Social Assessment for the Qinghai Component, WPRP" was distributed to the
Inspection Team by the Resident Mission China. This document provides population
figures for areas surrounding the Project location, including what it calls the "broader  |
project affected area consisting of five townships" (that is, the restrictively defined
project area of Balong and Zongjia, along with a broader area consisting of Xiangjia,
Gouli, and Xiangride). The estimated population of this five-township area is given as
24,210, of whom 49 percent are Han, 24 percent are Mongol, and 12 percent are
Tibetan. Hui, Sala, and Tu collectively make up 15 percent of this population but they
are not broken down by ethnicity in the document. "After reviewing the baseline
information, " the Notes state, "the project SA proceeded further with a sample survey
of those living in the five township area."                                         1

99.    This new survey, not previously reported in other documents, totaled 239
I          households, representing five percent of the estimated total resident population of the
five-township area. This survey, which included 59 Tibetan households in 6 villages
|          within the 5 townships, did not use questionnaires. "The survey was carried out by
.... a Mongol (who) can speak Tibetan; and consisted of foujr other members. It also
received local assistance from county, townships, and villages in the field.... The
X          group carried out the survey through village group meetings and household
interviews. "70
100.   Raw data for this survey has not been obtained and, in any event, would be
difficult to compile or check since the survey consisted of meetings at which
I          information on the project was provided and opinions elicited and then written down.
From the document distributed, it appears that the Bank has asked a government
I          institute directly involved in the Project to carry out an opinion survey about the
Project. In eliciting opinions about the Project, however, the Bank should be very
cautious since (a) respondent confidentiality was not being guaranteed and (b) there
if         is an obvious potential conflict of interest when an institute that will directly benefit
from a project is asked to carry out an open-ended opinion survey about the project
from which it will benefit. This leads to a more general discussion of the adequacy of
the survey method and consultation procedures used for this Project.
5.2    The Survey Method: Move-out area.
X          101.    The Social Assessment states that 100 percent of the survey forms
distributed were returned, filled out "in valid fashion." The Project Appraisal Document
admits, as does the Management Response, that the consultative process "was not
n          always smooth nor did it fulfill all best practice guidelines. At times during the social
assessment process respondent confidentiality was not fully observed, and the data
gathering process was less than ideal."71 Nonetheless, Management still concluded
that "the will of the move-in host population was adequately expressed."72
|I         102.   The Panel's inquiries in Qinghai Province indicated that the questionnaires
were frequently filled out by or in the presence of government officials. In fact, the
government research institute that prepared the Social Assessment made no attempt

to provide confidentiality, since the name of each household head was on each
form .7
103.   During the Inspection Team's visit to the Move-out areas, it met many people
who stated (often using a vocabulary that, according to our interpreters, was unlikely          l
to have been a villager's spontaneous choice of words) that they were desperately
poor, wanted to move to Dulan County, and hoped they would be selected soon to
move. Many remembered being surveyed, after hearing about the Project at village                I
meetings. Some had heard of, or had seen, a brochure about the Project, but none of
these    brochures    were    available   in   the    villages    we    visited.                3

104.    Though these farmers' memories may have been selective, they vividly
remembered the promise of high-yielding, irrigated land with electricity and schools            3
and hospitals. Most were not informed, however, of the desert conditions, poor saline
In fact, the four sample questionnaires provided to the Panel, and shown in Annex 3 of this report,  I
were copies of filled-in questionnaires with names and responses from four individual respondent
households. Annex 3 provides English translations only of the survey questions, not those individual
responses or the respondent's names. The Panel wishes to thank the Resident Mission China staff for  9
checking our translations of the questionnaires.

soil, and other difficulties they might encounter in the Move-in area. They knew that it
was flat and given the steep and rugged terrain on which they now farmed, that had a
I          strong appeal. It also became clear that they had not been offered or asked about
alternative means of development other than resettlement in a distant location. In
short, the "consultation" seemed to them to offer two alternatives: either resettle in
Dulan County, or stay where they were and get nothing. None could tell us of any
other development plans for their villages except resettlement elsewhere. They also
felt that, if accepted for resettlement, they could return within two years if they
decided they did not want to stay in the new location.
105.  As can be seen from the survey questions for the Move-out area in Annex 2,
this questionnaire mixes three very different kinds of questions. First, there are
questions that ask for the respondent's opinion about the Project. Second, there are
those that ask whether the respondent's household would like to participate.
(Effectively, answering "yes," on a non-confidential questionnaire would be the only
appropriate response for a farmer wishing to keep open the option of applying for
resettlement). And, third, there are those apparently designed to gather information
*          for deciding which of those applying should be selected.
106.   The first kind of question could best be addressed in a separate survey and
one that guaranteed respondent confidentiality.  The second and third kinds of
question could be considered to constitute a supplement to the application form for
I          the Project (although they also inquire why some people choose not to participate,
questions that should also be found in a survey that guaranteed respondent
confidentiality). The third set of questions actually includes some detailed questions
(e.g. concerning the precise degree of slope of the household's farmland) that may
require measurement or estimation by the surveyor, not the respondent.74
107.   Resettlement was the only development alternative respondents knew was
being offered. They were told they could return within two years if they did not like
I          the new irrigated land (with its hospitals, electricity, schools, etc.). It thus makes
good sense for any farmer who wants to keep his options open to 'apply' for this
program by saying he wishes to participate. (Clearly, this in turn implies that the
same farmer should say he has a favorable opinion of the Project.)
I          108.   From the perspective of its visit to the Move-out area, the Panel has no
reason to dispute the assertion in the Management Response that these are
74 See, e.g., Question 41 in Annex 2.
l
l



l
48
"desperately poor people in the six move-out counties, anxious for a new chance to
improve their living standards."75 Yet, the Panel has a very different view of the next
sentence of the Response which states, as evidence of this desperate poverty, that  I
"Applications for out-migration have exceeded places in the new villages many
times."76 The large number of applications seems just as likely to reflect applicants'  3
understanding that there is still a long time before selection will be made, that if
selected one can later decline to migrate, and that a person who does resettle in
Haixi still has two years to change his mind and return. Furthermore, given the   I
vagaries of the selection process (from the farmer's point of view), and the long time
before selection might take place, the details of the resettlement program can all be
reconsidered and thought over carefully when and if the applicant is selected.
109.  In summary, four points can be made concerning the methods of applying the  I
survey in the Move-out area. First, as mentioned above, the questionnaires are not
confidential. All four surveys required the respondent to put his name on the survey.  3
110.   Second, from the internal evidence of the questionnaires themselves, they
must have been filled out by someone other than by the individual respondents.
More than 25% of the respondents in the Move-out area indicated they were "illiterate
or semiliterate'.77 It is unlikely that non-literate villagers had their surveys filled out by
their literate friends or family members. If 1,458 respondents fill out a standardized
survey individually, at least one of them would normally be expected to have skipped
at least one question (accidentally or intentionally), or contradicted himself within a  I
series of related questions. This did not occur.
111. The tracks of the well-trained surveyor are especially visible in the responses
to questions like numbers 11 and 12.

112.  In this example, no one who is not willing to move can think of more than one
reason for that fact; nor can he think of any reasons for wanting to move. Similarly,
every person who admits he or she is willing to move also has only one reason for
being so willing, and cannot think of any reason not to move. This result would be
3          virtually impossible to obtain in a freely distributed and individually filled-out opinion
survey.
1          113.   The third point to be made about the survey is the very limited sources of
information about the subject-matter of the survey. It is striking: 93% of respondents
I-        indicated that they learned of the resettlement from "government propaganda."78
114.   Fourth, an examination of the questions asked, and the context in which they
were asked, indicates that opinions and information gathered are likely not reliable
because respondents will probably think that this questionnaire could directly
|          influence whether they get selected for the resettlement project. Impoverished
farmers, who are being offered no other poverty alleviation program (besides
resettlement in Haixi Prefecture), and who have incomplete knowledge of this
I          proposed resettlement program, know that even if they apply they can change their
minds later (should they be accepted). As mentioned above, they may also know
3         that the final selection of applicants might not be made for several years. Those who
want to keep open the option of migrating, or whose application is pending, cannot
answer this survey with information that states they might wish to stay, or with
I          information that reduces their chance of being selected. For all these reasons, a
respondent's indication of willingness to (conditionally) participate in the resettlement

project, marked on this survey form filled out by or in the presence of officials, may
only be evidence of the respondent's practical good judgement in how official survey
forms should publicly be filled out.  It is not necessarily direct evidence of his  I
desperate poverty. It may serve only as indirect evidence of his desire to resettle.
I
5.3    The Survey Method: Move-in area.
115.   Turning now to the Move-in areas, the hazards of using the methods of
consultation discussed above are even greater, because respondents are being
asked, without guarantee of confidentiality, whether they would welcome the influx of
settlers. The Request for Inspection lists allegations that expressions of disapproval
of Han Chinese settlement in traditionally Tibetan-populated areas have been treated
as "counter-revolutionary." The Request alleges that such kinds of activities would
have been relabeled as actions "endangering state security" under the Criminal Code
of 1997. It also cites sections of the code describing criminal behavior with phrases
like "damaging national ethnic unity," "attempting to eliminate the unity of the
nationalities," and "creating ethnic disputes," etc., and it cites recent convictions in
Haixi Prefecture in the Move-in area. While the Panel does not endorse or express
any opinion about these allegations, it notes that they were not disputed, or even
directly addressed, in the Management Response.                                  3
116.  The Management must bear in mind that if there is even a perception of
potential adverse effects that could result from  a truthful statement of
opposition to this Bank-financed project, then Bank staff has a responsibility to
guarantee confidentiality of the respondent. This responsibility derives from at  j
least two sources.  First, OD 4.20 requires that efforts be made to ensure that
indigenous populations suffer no adverse effects from Bank-financed development.
In this case, without a guarantee of confidentiality, an honest respondent could
already suffer adverse effects even from the Bank-financed Social Assessment that
was intended to mitigate adverse effects of a larger proposed project. Second, a  3
responsibility to guarantee respondent confidentiality is also implied by the
requirements for "full and informed" consultation in OD 4.20 (esp. par. 8), 4.30, and
4.01, since full and informed consultation is impossible if those consulted even  U
perceive that they could be prosecuted for expressing their opposition to, or honest
opinions about, a Bank-financed project.                                          |
117.  The Bank's Project Appraisal Document admits that not only questionnaire-
based surveys of this kind, but even qualitative approaches "often compromise     I
respondent confidentiality. This is a common weakness in assessment techniques

carried out in China ... usually offset in the initial data gathering stage through the use
of structured interviews. "79 Yet, in the case of the Qinghai Project, even the
I          structured interviews were not confidential. Those remembered by the villagers with
whom the Panel spoke consisted of village meetings with officials present.

I          118.   Though the Bank seems to have accepted these methods of consultation as
an inevitable as well as "common weakness" of Chinese assessment techniques, the
I          Inspection Team found that other organizations working in the same province did not
accept these methods. Representatives of the Food and Agriculture Organization of
the United Nations (FAO) handled this problem by simply insisting, as a requirement
of FAO assistance, that their representatives be allowed to carry out independent,
confidential village surveys and, the Panel was informed, those conditions were
|          accepted. This was confirmed by a senior Bank official who had formerly done
fieldwork in Qinghai for the FAO. The Bank official informed the Panel that when
local officials indicated that they expected to aftend the interviews with villagers, they
were simply told that it was FAO procedure that all such interviews had to be
confidential. As a result, the official was allowed to interview villagers with other FAO
I          staff and their own interpreter, while local officials stayed away. The Panel also
interviewed an academic researcher who did long-term ethnographic research among
Han resettlers in nearby Gansu province. She was also able to carry out surveys, as
well as more in-depth interviews guaranteeing respondent confidentiality. She also
emphasized that data obtained from village meetings and questionnaires often differ

I
a

significantly from data gathered from more in-depth or long-term studies where a
bond of trust had developed implying confidentiality in use of the information.
119.  A believable guarantee of respondent confidentiality might have yielded very
different results, especially in the Move-in area. The Inspection Team's short field3
visit, though it recorded many positive comments about the proposed Project, also
yielded some disturbing and dramatic examples of what can only be described as a
climate of fear, through which some individuals nevertheless managed, at greatI
perceived risk, to express their opposition to this Project.
120.  Team members often asked to visit sites without prior notification, or changed 
itinerary without advance notice, in order to interview Project-affected persons in a
more open manner. In addition, some Team members often disengaged themselvesI
from the group in the evenings, in order to interview more people about their opinions
of the Project. They found disturbing evidence that many people were clearly afraid
to talk about the Project-, and many of those who were willing to talk about the Project
were strongly opposed to it. During these interviews, those who opposed the Project
clearly felt threatened and asked that their identity be kept secret.
121.  The Team's attempts to solicit information without officials was sometimes
unsuccessful. In many cases in towns within the Move-in area, people met on the
streets were friendly and open until the Team member mentioned that he was with
the Inspection Panel investigating the proposed Project. At that point, many becameI
quite concerned, said they had to leave immediately, or brusquely said they could not
talk. A friendly, talkative, and interested group of people gathered at Xining's Institute
of Tibetan Medicine dispersed immediately, with obvious fright, upon hearing why
some of the Team members were present. Several people met in this way did ask
(through the Team's interpreter) to meet elsewhere, not openly. In some cases,3
these meetings were successful and at other times they had to be cancelled.
Interestingly, at some meetings people expressing strong negative opinions about the
Project in private had been present at earlier, tape-recorded public meetings where
the Project was praised.
122.    Generally, in small villages, people quickly learned of the size and
composition of the visiting group. In some of these cases, individuals who openly
discussed the Project in negative terms suddenly became aware that government
officials were nearby and immediately changed their demeanor. In one village, the
few Mongol herders present (most were in the fields with their herds) vocally opposedI



l
I                                                                                    53
the Project.80 They stopped speaking suddenly, then quickly left the village, when
another small group of herders walked up and started to praise the Project. Later,
X          the Team observed that the second small group of herders had walked back to talk
with a senior local official who was waiting outside the village; he was giving them
cigarettes as they waited for the Team to finish its visit to the now-deserted village.
123.   The Panel obviously did not conduct a scientific sample of opinion
during its brief stay in Qinghai. Yet, in the Panel's view, the opinions it found,
and the incidents it witnessed indicate the need for far greater efforts to obtain
public consultation under adequate conditions, before Management can be
said to have met the requirements for public consultation in the Operational
Directives. The mere fact that opinions expressed were so strikingly different,
I          and especially the fact that there was a strong perception of risk from those
expressing opposition to the Project during the Inspection Team's visit,
indicates that methods of public consultation used for this Project have so far
been inadequate.
124.   There is no indication that the fundamental problems in the survey and
consultation process used for this Project have been corrected for the new Pre-Pilot
and Pilot Phases that have been added to the plans for this Project as described in
Annex 12 of the Management Response.

Chapter 6
The Consideration of Project Alternatives
l
125.  If there is no alternative there can be no choice. This basic principle was
recognized in environmental and social assessment in the 1970s. The purpose of
undertaking these assessments is in large part to improve decisions by making
appropriate choices, so it follows that careful comparison of realistic alternatives is an
important feature of them. Without it, they are seriously flawed.
6.1    Alternatives and ODs 4.01, 4.20 and 4.30
126.  The need for alternatives to be considered is clearly recognized and spelled
out in the Bank's own policies. Paragraph 4(c) of OD 4.01 states that project-specific
EA's should normally cover: "systematic environmental comparison of alternative
investments, sites, technologies and designs." This is amplified in paragraph 2(f) of
Annex B of the OD, which states that the EA report should include the following
items: "(f) Analysis of alternatives.  Systematic comparison of the proposed
investment design, site, technology and operational alternatives in terms of their
potential environmental impacts... For each of the alternatives, the environmental
costs and benefits should be quantified to the extent possible, and economic values
should be attached where feasible. The basis for the selection of the alternative
proposed for the project design must be stated. " (Emphasis added.)
127.   To illustrate the importance of alternatives, Task 5 of the Bank's Sample
Terms of Reference (TOR) for Environmental Assessment is instructive. It states as
follows: "Describe alternatives that were examined in the course of developing the
proposed project and identify other alternatives which would achieve the same
objectives. The concept of alternatives extends to siting, design, technology
selection, construction techniques and phasing, and operating and maintenance
procedures. Compare alternatives in terms of potential environmental impacts; capital
and operating costs; suitability under local conditions; and institutional, training, and
monitoring requirements. When describing the impacts, indicate which are
irreversible or unavoidable and which can be mitigated. To the extent possible,
quantify the costs and benefits of each alternative, incorporating the estimated costs
I



55
of any associated mitigating measures. Include the alternative of not constructing the
project, in order to demonstrate environmental conditions without it. 381
128.    Both ODs 4.20 on indigenous peoples (national minorities) and 4.30 on
involuntary resettlement require the examination of specific kinds of alternatives, such  |
as those suggested for the development of separate indigenous people's
development plans for the affected  indigenous populations; or the  required
examination of alternatives to involuntary resettlement. OD 4.30 also states that      I
"Involuntary resettlement should be avoided or minimized where feasible, exploring
all viable alternative project designs."82
129.   The Bank's policies and directives simply leave no room for doubt as to the
need for a careful and systematic consideration of a number of different types of
alternatives, including investment alternatives, alternative sites, alternative project
designs, alternative implementation plans.  The purpose of considering these
alternatives is to ensure that the option supported is the one that will meet the
project's objectives most cost effectively while meeting the Bank's safeguard policies.
If alternatives are not given due consideration, the potential exists for projects to be  I
supported which do not optimize objectives, fail to meet Bank safeguard policies, and
do not deliver best value for money.
6.2     Alternatives and the Project Assessments                                       i
130.   To comply with Bank policies and procedures, therefore, both the Social and
Environmental Assessments should include a full evaluation of alternatives. One of
the most noticeable and significant weaknesses of the Assessments made available
to the Panel is that investment and project alternatives are not systematically
compared. From the documentation, it is not possible to deduce whether the Qinghai
Project as proposed is the best way for the Bank to meet the Project's objectives or to  3
ensure that the Bank's safeguard policies are being respected.

131. Thus, for all practical purposes the Environmental Assessment avoids
consideration of alternatives, both for poverty reduction in the Move-out areas and for
Move-in sites. Systematic comparison is not made of the costs and benefits of the
poverty reduction options being implemented in Qinghai by other donor agencies, for
example, those of the World Food Programme and Australian AID. Nor are the costs
and benefits of resettling rural villagers into urban areas, as advocated in the Chinese
10th Five-year programme. There is no systematic analysis of the desirability of
converting fragile arid rangelands to permanently irrigated croplands. There is no
analysis of different possible implementation alternatives to ensure that maximum
benefits accrue to the populations left behind in the Move-out villages.
132. The only analysis of alternatives that was provided to the Inspection Panel is
that contained in Annex 2 of Management Response to the Request for Inspection of
the Qinghai Project (July 19, 1999). In this Summary Analysis of Alternatives, a
single paragraph of qualitative comparisons is provided for four development
alternatives: No action; Intensification of Agriculture in the Move-out areas;
Alternative Employment Schemes in the Move-out areas; and Resettlement.83
Similarly, four possible alternative sites for resettlement are reviewed: Gonghe Basin,
East Qaidam Basin, West Qaidam Basin, and North Qaidam Basin. And for the
preferred East Qaidam Basin, five water supply options were explored using
elementary hydrological computer models.
133. During the on-site inspections in Qinghai Province, the Inspection Team
enjoyed the professional cooperation of the Chinese scientists responsible for
producing the EA. It was clear from the authors of the EA, that they understood the
main purpose of their studies to be to assist in the optimal resettlement of around
60,000 people from the Move-out area into Dulan County.
134. The Inspection Team found evidence that within the confines of the selected
resettlement area, the Environmental Assessment has contributed to three key
decisions. First, the selection of areas with soils suitable for irrigation. Second, a
reduction of the overall size of the proposed irrigation area. And, third, questioning
the carrying capacity of the proposed irrigation scheme, with the result that the
number of persons to be resettled was decreased from over 100,000 to about 60,000
persons. The Assessment also makes recommendations as to the types and extent
of monitoring that should take place should the Project be implemented to ensure that
salinization of the soil and ground water does not occur. Recommendations for

authorities and discussed with Bank staff as part of the preparation process for the Project.' See
Management Response, supra note 12, Annex 2, at p. 35-41.

ongoing monitoring of ecological parameters are also made.
135.  Although the Panel requested a copy of the Terms of Reference (TOR) for the
EA on several occasions, both in Washington and Beijing, they had not been
received at the time of completion of this Report. It would appear from the above,
however, that Bank staff failed to ensure that those responsible for the EA
understood their brief to include an examination of alternatives to resettlement, either
in the Move-out or Move-in areas.  Nor did they make clear their responsibility to
examine whether the proposed Project would in fact deliver the anticipated benefits to
those left behind in the Move-out areas.
136. With respect to the Social Assessment, it appears that it was also undertaken
to determine how  best to select and move people from  the selected Move-out
counties to the defined project area in Haixi Prefecture, where a dam and irrigation
system were to be constructed. This seems evident both from the Inspection Team's
discussions with the Bank staff responsible for the design of the Social Assessment,
and from the Assessment itself. There is no systematic study of in situ alternatives to
resettlement, or of alternative resettlement sites, or of alternative development plans
for the indigenous peoples affected within the Move-in area.
137.    A proper social assessment should ask (or at least set its more restricted
focus within a context of other studies that ask) "How can we most effectively and
sustainably alleviate poverty in Qinghai, with full social and environmental
safeguards, and full and informed participation, with the funds available?" This
Project's Social Assessment instead effectively just asks, "How can we make this
proposed, already-decided dam-building and engineering project work? How should
we select and move many tens of thousands of people from the Move-out counties in
Haidong and Xining City Prefectures to the proposed irrigation area in Haixi
Prefecture, and  involuntarily  resettle  the  pastoralists  who  are  there  now?"
Regardless of how well those responsible carried out the Social Assessment, its
effective terms of reference prevent it from considering alternatives to the Project as
already defined.84
84 The Social Assessment of this project per se would not need to address the broadest range of
questions, including the analysis of alternative strategies, if it constituted only one of many related
studies. If that were the case, the Assessments could simply cite other studies that resolve some of
the larger contextual issues and therefore justify the restricted scope of the present study.  I
Unfortunately, however, both the Environmental and Social Assessments lack references to any such
broader literature to indicate that adequate analyses of alternative strategies has been carried out, or
to indicate how this particular project efficiently fits into an overall poverty alleviation strategy, or how  I
this proposed strategy relates to the very different poverty alleviation strategies being carried out--
often in nearby areas of the same counties -- by other organisations.

138. Why Bank staff permitted the Assessments to be conducted in such a
circumscribed and limiting manner is unclear.85   Whatever the reasons, the Panel
I             finds  that  Management accepted  Assessments  that do  not make  any
meaningful analysis of realistic project alternatives as required by Bank
policy.86

85 Despite numerous requests, the Inspection Team could not be provided with a copy of the Terms of
Reference for the EA given to the Qinghai Institute for Environmental Science. It appears likely that
the Bank did not provide the Qinghai Institute with the Institutional and Advisory Support that was
needed for them to complete the EA so as to accord with OD 4.01. The failure of the EA to consider
I            alternatives must thus be attributed to a failure of the Bank to oversee the execution of the EA to
ensure that Bank safeguard policies were observed
86 The requirements for assessment of social issues within OD 4.01 (Environmental Assessments)
could have been met either by including them in the Environmental Assessment or, as in this Project,
within a separate Social Assessment. These requirements for the analysis of alternatives are in
addition to those found in ODs 4.20 and 4.30.

Chapter 7
Environmental Screening of the Qinghai Project
139. One of the most important decisions (perhaps the most crucial) that
3          Management must make concerning environmental assessment on any project is the
category of the assessment that will be undertaken.  That decision basically
determines the scoping of the Terms of Reference (TOR) of the assessment, its
|          breadth and depth, and the time and resources made available to undertake it. As
one of the Bank's senior Environmental Advisors stated in an interview:
"Categorization is arguably the most important phase of EA." It determines the
scoping and "If you get the scoping [of the terms of reference] wrong, then everything
U          goes wrong. "
140. In this Chapter, the Panel considers the screening decision that was made
from the perspective of both the process and the substance requirements of OD 4.01.
The Chapter begins with a brief discussion of the stage in the project cycle that
environment should be taken into account. It then considers the Bank's policies on
3            ,.environmental screening. And finally it looks at the decision taken in light of these
policies.
7.1   Stage in the Project Cycle
1          141. The Bank's policy on Environmental Assessment, as embodied in OD 4.01,
requires that an assessment should occur "early in the project cycle and [be] taken
into account in project selection, siting, planning and design."37  In the present
I          context, however, the "project cycle" is extremely difficult to determine. Preliminary
investigations of the suitability of the Keri Dam site started around 1989 and that of
3          the suitability of the soils in the Balong area started soon after this. In 1994, both the
National and Qinghai Poverty Reduction Plans were formulated and they provided
the framework for the present proposals. Some environmental assessment did take
I          place at these early stages and a draft EA was given to the World Bank Technical
Mission in February 1998. Ideally, substantial environmental investigations should
3          have taken place concurrently with the early investigations of the then potential dam
site and irrigation area.

142. When the Western Poverty Reduction Project was placed before the World
Bank in 1997, it is clear from the information available to the Panel that the basic
design of the Qinghai component was already fully developed. Environmental work  I
as required by OD 4.01, in line with the Terms of Reference that were provided by the
Consultant employed by the Bank, started soon after Bank acceptance of the Project  |
and, in this sense, was early in the project cycle. But it is evident that such studies
were too late to impact on the basic design of the Project and, apart from the
reduction in the number of the settlers from over 100,000 to around 60,000, only  I
minor modifications to the Project have been effected.
I
143. It seems clear from OD 4.01 that borrowers should incorporate environmental
considerations into a project early in its history and not wait to start an environmental
assessment until after the project has been submitted for Bank financing. Paragraph
3 of OD 4.01 states: "Like financial, institutional and engineering analyses, EA is part
of project preparation and is, therefore, the borrower's responsibility.  Close
integration of EA with these aspects of project preparation ensures that (a)
environmental considerations are given adequate weight in project selection, siting,
and design decisions; and (b) EAs do not delay project processing." 88
144. Some  countries  have  difficulty  financing  adequate  environmental
assessments. During interviews with Bank staff, the Panel encountered divergent and
contradictory views as to whether it is possible for borrower countries to access donor
funds to undertake environmental assessments before projects are submitted for
Bank approval. Nonetheless, paragraph 3 of OD 4.01 stands and, of course, if the
Bank is not satisfied with any assessment undertaken prior to its involvement in a  |
project, it can always require additional work.
1
7.2   Environmental Screening: OD 4.01 and Annex E
145. Under OD 4.01, the Task Manager (now Task Team Leader) takes the
screening decision, with the concurrence of the Regional Environmental Division
(RED, now a Unit).  Paragraph 17 of the OD states: "The TM should screen         I
projects/components at identification to determine the nature and extent of the
environmental work required. As a result of the screening, the TM, with the      3
concurrence of the RED, assigns the project to one of the following categories, in
accordance with Annex E: Category A: A full EA is required. Category B: Although a

full EA is not required, environmental analysis is required. Category C: No EA or
environmental analysis is required."
146. Annex E of the directive provides illustrative lists of the types of projects best
classified in Categories "A," "B," and "C." Twelve types of projects are listed for
Category A, of which eight are found in the entire Western Poverty Reduction Project
and four in the Qinghai component of the project. The four are: "(a) Dams and
I           reservoirs; ... (d) Irrigation, drainage and flood control (large scale); (e) Land clearance
and leveling; .... (i) Resettlement and all projects with potentially major impacts on
3          people 8....'9
147.   The introductory paragraph to this list states that: "A full EA is required if a
project is likely to have significant adverse impacts that may be sensitive, irreversible,
and diverse. The impacts are likely to be comprehensive, broad, sector-wide, or
precedent-setting...." A footnote explains that the term  "Sensitivity refers to issues
such as impacts that are irreversible, affect vulnerable ethnic minorities, or involve
involuntary resettlement. "
148.   Under OD 4.01, this critical decision is made at a very early stage in the
project cycle. Consequently, the OD permits a later revision of the category as new
information becomes available. In this regard, paragraph 3 states: "The EA assigned
to the project as part of the screening is based on the best judgement and information
3          available at that early stage. If the project is modified or new information becomes
available to justify reclassification, the TM should reclassify a proposed project. The
reclassification should be done with the concurrence of the RED. "
149.    Thus, the door is open for a second judgement.  During the Panel's
|          interviews, some staff took the view that when there is very little information on a
project at the time the initial decision has to be made, and a consequent high degree
3          of uncertainty, practical good sense dictated that it be assigned to the higher
category. The decision has operational implications and, if later information warrants,
it is far less difficult and more efficient to go from an "A" to a "B" rather than the
3          opposite. Moreover, a downgrading from "A" to "B" would not result in the project
being delayed and would avoid add-on costs for later studies or mitigation measures
3          that an upgrading from "B" to "A" would entail. Others disagreed. In their view, while
it may be difficult, it was not impossible to re-assign upwards if circumstances so
dictated.

150.  As mentioned in the introduction, the Western Poverty Reduction Project has
three components in three separate but adjacent provinces: Gansu, Inner Mongolia,
and Qinghai.  OD 4.01, however, does not permit the assignment of different
categories to these components. Paragraph 2 of Annex E states: "Dual categories  3
(e.g.A/C) should not be used. For instance, a relatively benign project with a single
category A component is a category A project." Thus, if it is decided that one
component, in this case Qinghai, requires a full assessment and is therefore    I
assigned a Category "A," the other two components of the Western Poverty
Reduction Project must be assigned an "A." During interviews, some staff took the  |
position that it seemed unfair to burden the entire project with the time and financial
costs of an "A" if only one component, Qinghai, may require it. In response, the
Panel can only observe that this appears to be what the framers of the OD had in  I
mind; otherwise, the OD could be amended to provide for separate categories where
a "project" is to all intents and purposes made up of three distinctly separate projects,
or where other circumstances might warrant it.
151.  Alternatively, Management could have separated the Qinghai component into  I
a distinct project, separately submitted to the Board for approval. Then the other two
components of the Western Poverty Reduction Project, Gansu and Inner Mongolia,   3
may have retained their "B" rating. In this regard, it is interesting to note that, in fact,
at the time of the Project Concept Document Review meeting, the Task Team
recommended that the project be split into the Qinghai Poverty Reduction Project and  I
the Western Poverty Reduction Project. They argued that although all three project
Provinces shared common project development objectives, the design and key
interventions of Qinghai were totally different. The requirements for goods and works
procurement for a voluntary resettlement project based on a sizable irrigation scheme
would also be different. Splitting would ease project implementation and supervision,  1
and the Qinghai project could be supervised jointly with the Gansu Hexi Corridor
Project from the China office.90 The Country Director who Chaired the PCD meeting
acknowledged the merit of splitting Qinghai. He concluded, however, that finding an
additional Board slot for China would be a problem so this decision should be
deferred to a later date.91  Later, the Task Team Leader informed the Country    1
Director that the Preparation Assistance Mission had confirmed the recommendation
to split the project in two. Trusting that the major stumbling block of finding a Board
slot might now be overcome in the interest of the project, he offered to further explain
the rationale for splitting during a briefing meeting scheduled with the Country
90 PCD Review Meeting Agenda (13 April 1998).                                    I

Director.92 Subsequently, in consideration of the overall IBRD/IDA lending program
for the year, a decision was made to retain it as a single project.
152.   On the face of it, therefore, it would seem that a straightforward reading of
3          Annex E would lead an environmental professional to classify the project an "A" if it
included more than two of the components listed in Annex E, and if one or two of the
descriptors in the preamble were found to apply. The Annex does not provide for
I          exceptions on the basis of "past experience" or "precedent" in the country in question.
Nor does it allow for exceptions on the basis of the area of the project relative to the
3          area of the geographic or political jurisdiction involved. Yet, both arguments were
advanced by Management in its July 18, 1999 Response.
l
3          7.3     Environmental Assessment Procedures: Annex D
153.    OD  4.01 also requires that certain procedures be followed for an
3          environmental assessment. Some of these have been noted above. Others are set
out mainly in paragraphs 14-16 and in Annex D.  As one would expect, they are
more detailed and stringent for a Category "A" project than a "B" or "C." An insight
into the rather detailed process as mandated by the OD may be found from
paragraph 15. It states in part: "Though EA preparation is the responsibility of the
3          borrower, the Bank's task manager (TM) assists and monitors the EA process, with
support from the RED. The borrower and the Bank should agree as early as possible
3          after issuance of the Initial Executive Project Summary (IEPS) [now PCD] on the
terms of reference (TOR) or the EA, and on the EA procedures, schedule, and
outline. This is because (a) EA preparation should form part of the overall feasibility
|          study or preparation work for the project, so that the EA 's findings can be directly
integrated into project design; (b) some EAs require substantial time for preparation
(see Annex D, paras 6-7); and (c) completion of the EA report is a prerequisite for the
*          departure of the appraisal mission. Major steps in the EA process are outlined in
Annex D. 03

7.4     The Screening Decision: Category "A" or "B"?
154.   Under OD 4.01, as noted above, the Task Manager (now Task Team Leader)
assigns the project to one of the categories, with the concurrence of the regional
environment division (now unit).  On January 8, 1998, in the Environmental Data
Sheet prepared for the Project, the Task Team Leader assigned the whole Western
China Poverty Reduction Project, including the Qinghai component, to a Category
"B."94 According to the Data Sheet, the major environmental issues then foreseen
were "salinization of shallow water table; changes in water regime below the dams;
fuel wood harvesting and overgrazing arising from  resettlement; no involuntary
resettlement." (Emphasis added.) It was assigned a "B" on the grounds that "On
balance, the project would improve the existing fragile ecology in the poor project
counties. Measures to mitigate the negative impacts are known in China and adopted
for similar projects. The EA for Qinghai will be comprehensive, focusing on the impact
of the resettlement. "95
155.   This decision was made before the Task Team  Leader, or any other Bank
official associated with the decision, had an opportunity to visit the immediate Project
site.96  It was also made without detailed maps and other basic information being
available and, it would appear, without regard to the illustrative examples of Category
"A" projects listed in Annex E of OD 4.01 .
156.    Another, presumably later but undated and unsigned, Environmental Data
Sheet appears in the Project Concept Document Package. Containing one additional
page of information, it confirms that the "B" category was assigned on January 8,
1998.     However, it offers another "Justification/Rationale  for Environmental
Category," namely that: "The EA in Qinghai will be more comprehensive [as opposed

China Western Poverty Reduction Project (25 March 1998).
96 It should be noted that the East Asian Regional Environment Unit had been created January 1,
1998, only a few days before the Environmental Data Sheet for Western was issued. Since
responsibility for environmental matters was in the process of being transferred from Washington to
Regional Offices, concurrently with the development of the Western Poverty Reduction Programme,
clear lines of accountability for environmental review and overview of this project may not yet have
been established.
97 The Panel was informed that it is common practice for a Task Team Leader to decide upon an
environmental classification more or less on his/her own and leave it until later - perhaps as late as
the PCD stage - before involving the regional environmental department in the Project.

to Inner Mongolia and Gansu] focusing on the impact of the land reclamation,
resettlement and dam construction."98
157.   A month later, in February 1998, at the Task Team Leader's request, an
environmental specialist in the East Asia Environment Unit 1'EASEN) agreed to act as
a Peer Reviewer for the project. As Peer Reviewer, he would receive project
documents and  make comments.   Normally, the team  would  include an
environmental contact person, that is the person from the regional environmental unit
who would be a member of the project team and receive support from the project
budget. In this case, since none was appointed, the Peer Reviewer became the de
facto EASEN contact person for the project, although budgeted only as peer
reviewer.
158.  The Peer Reviewer recommended that a consultant with special experience in
soils and considerable experience in working on environmentally-related problems in
China, including previous Bank experience, be employed to act as the counterpart to
the Chinese institutes working on the Environmental Assessment. The Task Team
Leader agreed and asked the Consultant to: "be responsible for the environmental
impact assessment aspects of the project in line with OD. 4.00 [sic]. His primary task
is to review the scope (TOR) of the EA and to assess the work initiated so far and the
capacities of the local Environmental Protection Bureau to carry out the work. In
particular, the EA in Qinghai requires a thorough understanding of the impact of the
storage dams and the resettlement of 100,000 in the project area.'99  According to
the Management Response, the Consultant prepared the Terms of Reference
between February 20-27, 1998. 100 At the same time, the Peer Reviewer "instructed"
the Consultant on what the key issues for the EA were, namely, the dam, soils and
land reclamation.
159.   Between February 8-28, 1998, a Technical Mission, including the Consultant,
visited all three provinces involved in the overall project in order to review the
preparatory work planned and completed by the provincial governments and give
detailed technical comments. During this mission, the Consultant received a first
draft of the EA even before he had prepared the terms of reference for it. 101 In his
note on Qinghai following the Mission, the Consultant mentioned that an

environmental report outline had also been prepared and forwarded to the National
Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) for their review and comments.
160.   Subsequently, on March 13, 1988, the Consultant raised a number of issues
with the Peer Reviewer and provided grounds for recommending the re-classification
of the Qinghai component as an "A" Category Project in terms of OD 4.01. He stated:
"In accordance with the Bank's OD 4.01 and NEPA [National Environmental
Protection Agency] guidelines, this is considered to be a category "A" project.
Specific rationale for placing it in this category include: (a) the inclusion of I new dam
(Keri Dam) and reservoir; (b) the inclusion of a relatively large new irrigation area
(approximately 25,300 ha); (c) the reclamation and new land development
(approximately 25,300 ha); and (d) the resettlement of about 100,000 people into the
project area. This signifies that it requires a full EA, which must be completed and
approved by NEPA and the Bank before approval can be given for the
commencement of project appraisal. This must include an  Environmental
Management Plan (EMP). This plan must be integrated into the overall planning
process."102 [Emphasis added.]
161.   The Consultant's report on Qinghai also contains a list of issues that the EA
should cover, and a list of some 22 main conclusions and recommendations for
further environmental and resettlement work. His report on the other two provinces,
however, reveals his agreement that they did not raise environmental issues
sufficiently "big" to warrant those components being classified as an "A".
162.  The Project Concept Document (PCD) Review Meeting was held on April 14,
1998.103 This is a key decision-point in the evolution of a Bank project. It is the first
time that the project is looked at as a whole and in some detail by a group beyond the
project team, including senior managers. Notification of the meeting and copies of
the PCD package, including the Environmental Data Sheet with the "B" classification,
was sent out for comment to 35 managers, staff and consultants in the Bank. Written
comments, distributed before the meeting, were received from 5 Peer Reviewers,
including the reviewer from the regional environmental unit (EASEN). The Project
Concept Document records the official justification for the "B" classification as follows:
"The environmental issues in Inner Mongolia and Gansu are relatively minor because
of the small scale development schemes. The project would improve the existing
fragile ecology in project counties with the introduction of environmentally sustainable
development farm technology. The EA in Qinghai will be more comprehensive

focusing on the impact of the land reclamation, resettlement and dam
construction."104
163.   Before that meeting, on April 2, 1998, the Peer Reviewer commented on the
3           A/B issue, indicating that both he and the Task Team Leader were in agreement that
it should be a "B". 105 His memorandum was copied to Management and other peer
reviewers, who were thus made aware of the A/B debate.1OE Among other things, the
Peer Reviewer felt that the lists in Annex E of OD 4.01 were simply illustrative, to be
interpreted in the context of the preamble which, in his view, gave substantive criteria
|           with  which  to  make  a  judgement,  criteria  like  "sensitive,  irreversible,
...comprehensive, ... or precedent setting."107 He argued that conditions in Qinghai
(as he understood them from project documents, and his general knowledge of China
(he has never visited the Project area), did not warrant the full environmental
assessment that a Category "A" would require. The resettlement of around 60,000
3people into a newly developed  irrigation tract is something that the Chinese
government has much experience with, so the project would not in any sense be
"precedent-setting." The environmental and human impacts of the dam-plus-reservoir
would be small, and the system as a whole small in scale compared to thousands of
other dam-plus-reservoir systems in China. The irrigation tract would yield little run-
|           off; hence impacts outside the tract would not be "comprehensive."
164.  The Peer Reviewer had other reasons for retaining a "B." One concerned the
I           dilemma imposed by paragraph 2 of Annex E which, as noted earlier, precludes dual
categories (e.g., A/B) in any one project. It was important to avoid imposing the time
|           and costs of an "A" assessment on Inner Mongolia and Gansu where, it was agreed,
they were not needed. Another was a strong reluctance to stretch the capacity of the
young local environmental institutes, and to impose an extra burden on Bank staff
who would be called upon to strengthen their product.108
l
104 Project Files (25 March 1998).
105 The situation is confused as the Peer Reviewer for the project who was based in the East Asian
Environmental Unit was prepared to take responsibility for the decision to assign the project to
category "B" status. But from the chronology of the project, it is apparent that the decision had in fact
been made before he became involved with the project.
106 The Peer Reviewer said: "Whether or not this [loss of grazing rights] justifies classifying the entire
project as "A" is, in my view, debatable. I would be inclined to call it a "B" but this is something that will
need to be discussed with the EASEN contact person." See Projec Files (2 April 1998).

165.   Potential impacts on Nature Reserves and related conservation areas were
also a factor in Peer Reviewer's judgement. In a key memorandum to the Director of
RMC, he attached notes containing his "best shot" at identifying the reserves in the
project areas. 109   He tentatively identified "eight in Gansu, four in Inner Mongolia
and none in Qinghai." (Emphasis added.) He then notes that "since I don't have a
map of the Qinghai development areas, this assessment [on the existence or not of
reserve areas in Qinghai] is, to say the least, speculative." 110 
166.   On April 7, 1998, the Consultant sent an email to the Task Team Leader
supporting the Peer Reviewer comments. Commenting on this later to the Panel, the
Consultant stated that Washington felt that the project should remain a Category "B"
largely because of "precedents in China." He "was not prepared to argue."
167.  The April 14,1998, PCD Meeting was chaired by the Director RMC and those
attending included the Bank lawyer for the project and three of the peer reviewers,
one from an NGO based in Washington. The minutes make no mention of
environmental classification.
168.   The Peer Reviewer informed the Panel that he has no further record of the
Project for the period between April 7, 1998 and December, 1998 when the EAs for
the three components arrived.  It is not recorded whether the EA procedures,
schedule and outline, as well as the TORs, were agreed between the borrower and
the Bank after issuance of the PCD (formerly IEPS) as required by paragraph 15 of
OD. 4.01. The schedule of environment assessment team activities found in the
Management Response makes no mention of these.111
169.  The EA was prepared in Chinese by the Qinghai Institute of Environmental
Science. Various drafts were issued and were presented to the missions that visited
Qinghai in 1998 and 1999. An English-language version was submitted to the Bank
in October, 1998, and the final report was issued in June, 1999,112 although still dated
October, 1998. After the English was edited, the report was sent to the InfoShop on
June 2, 1999.113
170.   The Panel was informed that the English language version of the EA is
different in structure and scope from the original Chinese version. For example, the

table of contents of Chapter 5 that the Inspection Team had translated from the
Chinese was substantially different from that of the equivalent chapter of the English-
I          language version.  Bank staff questioned on this were either unaware of the
differences or explained them on the grounds that the original contained too much
3          detail.'14
171.   The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) was ready on November 25, 1998,
and distributed to 37 people, including four peer reviewers. The Decision Meeting, to
move forward to final appraisal, was scheduled for three weeks after the Project
3          Appraisal Document itself was distributed. The Decision Meeting is the last step in
the Bank's preparation process at which there is, in principle, flexibility for making
more than marginal changes to the project design. The environmental, social and
I          legal clearances, or substantive reasons for withholding clearances, are meant to
have been received by the time of, or at, the Decision Meeting.
-          172.   The EAs for the three components of the Western Poverty Reduction Project
were received on time. They were reviewed by the Consultant (the same Consultant
3          who had prepared the Terms of Reference, negotiated them with the local institutes,
and overseen their implementation.) He advised the Task Team Leader that he
approved them - in effect, recommending them for clearance. The Task Team
Leader passed them on to the Peer Reviewer.
3          173.    The Decision Meeting was held on December 17, 1998.  Some Peer
Reviewers advised that all the environmental issues, with one exception, had been
addressed. The exception was livestock overstocking, which might cause more
erosion of already badly eroded range land in all three provinces, but especially in
Gansu and Inner Mongolia.115  In response, the Sector Manager decided to
|          downgrade the Appraisal Mission scheduled for January, 1999, to a Pre-Appraisal
Mission. During the course of the Mission, between January, 10-23, it became
evident that the livestock issue had been addressed satisfactorily, so the Manager of
a          the East Asia Rural Development Unit upgraded it to an Appraisal Mission in the field.
This kept the entire Western Poverty Reduction Project on track for Board
3          presentation before mid-1999. As required by Bank policy, the Task Team presented
the documentation for the entire Project, which included the Project Appraisal
3          Document, and draft loan, credit, and project agreements, to the East Asia Country
114 Eg., with long lists of plants and animals, although the Inspection Team felt that this was not the

Director and Legal Department for clearance and, in the case of the Legal
Department, authorization to issue an invitation to negotiate. 116
174.    The negotiations took place during the week of April 12. There were no
substantive issues to be negotiated.  The agreed Minutes of Negotiations were
signed, and the approval of the Chinese and Provincial Governments was expected
by May 10, 1999. Board presentation was anticipated for June 8th. However, shortly
after Negotiations, external criticism of the project erupted, starting with publication of
the Tibet Information Network (TIN) article on April 27th.  This caught the Bank by
surprise and triggered an intensive internal review  of, among other things, the             I
environmental classification of the project as a "B" rather than an "A."
175. Back in June, 1998, the Regional Vice President, EAPVP had issued a
memorandum  on "Compliance with Safeguard Policies," stating that "Under the
operational policy reform, the Regions will remain fully accountable and responsible         I
for ensuring compliance with safeguard policies."417 This marked a change from the
situation in the early 1990s, when the central Environment Department did have a
formal role in the clearance of Environmental Assessments of "A" projects. Since the
mid-1990s, this formal clearance role has fallen away and, by 1998, the concensus
was that clearance and accountability for compliance with the safeguard policies             |
should be vested in the region. The Vice President's memo confirmed this.118 While
this was the formal position, shortly after the appearance of the TIN article,
Management decided to ask several senior experts from the central departments to
advise on the classification and compliance.
116 As noted earlier, the regional environment unit (EASEN) had been created on January 1, 1998 and,
for much of 1997 and 1998, was in a state of reorganisation. During interviews, the Panel was
informed by several senior officials that during this period lines of responsibility were so blurred (and
some senior officials were so overloaded), that practically all but the bare minimum quality-control
procedures had fallen away.
7 He added that: "The ESSD Network Anchors (Environment, Social and Rural) in cooperation with
LEG and the Regions will be responsible for periodic [Quality Assurance Group]-type auditing of  I
representative samples of projects to identify whether they comply with Bank safeguard policies." He
added further that: "The Regions have been instructed to provide dedicated, non-fungilbe resources to
their environment and social units to strengthen their review, advisory and monitoring activities. An
adequate level of such dedicated resources is being assigned to EASEN and EASSD for assuring  I
safeguard compliance...."  See EAPVP REGIONAL VICE PRESIDENT, Memo to Director RMT
"Compliance with Safeguard Policies" (3 June 1998). Attached to it was a separate memorandum
from the Managing Directors to Operational Vice Presidents, headed "Operational Policy Reform:  I
Compliance with Safeguard Policies."

176.   One of these experts informed the Panel that from the time that he first saw
any documentation related to the Project,119 he had been convinced that the Project
I          should have been classified an "A" on at least eight grounds.  In May, he
recommended that the Project be immediately reclassified as "A" as this would be
3          preferable to further jeopardizing the Bank's reputation by defending the category "B."
177.   Another expert, also brought in for the first time at this late date, felt that the
Project should have been classified as Category "A." He advised Management, he
told the Panel, that it should simply acknowledge that a "well-intentioned" mistake
|          was made. That would do less harm to the Bank's environmental credibility, he felt,
than a futile defense of the "B" rating.
1          178.  Another expert took a slightly different view. He advised Management that if
the project were to be categorized now, under OP 4.01, it would be an "A." However,
he understood that the size of the Project was not out of line with others in the China
portfolio and that its categorization as a "B" was consistent with the accepted practice
in the Region.
179.   A senior official, also with strong credentials in the field, informed the Panel
that in his view the Project was quite clearly an "A," whether under the old or new
rules. The Region, he felt, was in non-compliance, not with whether or not the
Project was categorized (obviously, it was), but with the A/B judgement and, in late
3          May, he so advised Senior Management. Expressing understanding with the position
of colleagues who must contract their services to, and are paid in part out of, project
budgets, he went on to say that "Frankly, they don't want to bite the hand that feeds
them (for cross support) by taking a hardline view."
The Panel's Findings
180.     After reviewing  the screening  process, the  Panel finds that
Management's decision to classify the project as a Category "B" was not in
3          compliance with OD  4.01.  The justifications for a "B" offered in the
Environmental Data Sheet of January 8, 1998, and essentially confirmed by
Management at the PCD Meeting of April 14, 1998, are not in accord with the
119 I.e., after the Request for Inspection and, even then, he was shown not the full EA but only a 22
page summary.

terms and spirit of OD 4.01.120  Several components of the Project fall within
the illustrative list of Category "A" projects in Annex E, i.e., dams and
reservoirs, irrigation and resettlement. And the impacts qualify as "sensitive"      I
in that vulnerable ethnic minorities are affected and involuntary settlement is
involved.                                                                            |
181.   As noted earlier, paragraph 3 of OD 4.01 provides an open door to a second
judgement based on new information. Management was given this opportunity when
in March 1998, following a visit to the Move-in area (the first Bank official involved in
the decision to visit that area), the Consultant recommended that the Project be      3
reclassified to "A." In the Panel's view, the initial violation of OD 4.01 was
compounded when Management rejected this advice.
182.    Following the outbreak of external criticism  at the end of April, 1999,
Management had  unexpected  third opportunity to  review  the environmental           i
classification which, as just noted, it took. Again, it rejected all internal advice to the
contrary and, in its July 18, 1999, Response, chose to support the original rationale
for a "B," stating that:  "The project was assigned to environmental screening        I
Category B on the basis of (a) the overall environmental risks posed by the project;
(b) types of development interventions proposed, project location, and  the
environmental sensitivity of the area; (c) the nature and magnitude of potential
impacts and available mitigation measures; and (d) past practice with both the
classification and implementation experience of a large number of similar integrated  |
agricultural development projects financed by the Bank in China over the last 10
years. 021   For reasons set out above, the Panel finds these arguments
unconvincing, and the view that "Bank staff interpreted the policy reasonably
in ... categorizing it as category B" cannot be supported.122
183.    The Panel is also concerned about some aspects of the process when
compared with those prescribed in paragraphs 14-16 and Annex D of OD 4.01. The
initial decision to assign the project a "B" in the Environmental Decision Sheet of
January 8, 1998, was based on the very little information then available on
120 To recall the stated justifications for a "B" were: "On balance, the project would improve the existing  X
fragile ecology in the poor project counties. Measures to mitigate the negative impacts are known in
China and adopted for similar projects. The EA for Qinghai will be comprehensive, focusing on the
impact of the resettlement".                                                          I

someone's desk in Washington. 123 The officials concerned informed the Panel that
they had not yet visited the Move-in area, had no first hand experience with it, and did
e           not even have access to a "decent" map, let alone basic information on the
environmental and social characteristics of the area. Moreover, at the time, they
|           assumed there would be no involuntary resettlement and no impact on minorities.124
The Panel recognizes that, under the OD, the decision had to be taken early in the
project cycle. But it can be reviewed and revised in light of new information. The
I           initial decision might take on a different character if Management had reviewed and
revised the classification when new information and advise from the Consultant,
based on a field visit and some study, became available. But it didn't.
184. As noted earlier, the Panel was informed that it is common practice for a
project task team leader to decide on an environmental classification more or less on
his/her own, and leave it until later - perhaps as late as the Project Concept
Document (PCD) stage - for the regional environmental unit to become involved in
looking at the project, including its classification as an "A" or "B". If this is indeed
common practice, it leaves much to be desired. The official who must manage a
I           project and ensure that it goes ahead on schedule is often not in the best position to
judge whether or not serious questions relating to project safeguards should be
allowed to "interfere" with schedules and consume "precious" time and resources.
Some form of mandatory third-party review would seem desirable, at the very least.
1           185.  Management rejected the Consultant's advise to reclassify the project to an
"A" because of "precedents in China." The Management Response itself cites this as
a reason for maintaining the "B" classification rather than revising it to an "A."125 As
noted earlier, past experience in a country may provide the basis for a certain level of
comfort that the work that is required by the ODs will be undertaken successfully. But
3           there is nothing in OD 4.01 to suggest that experience and precedent can or should
be a factor in determining what is required by the OD.
186.   The Panel was informed that the Consultant was central to setting the Terms
of Reference for the EA. He also negotiated them (and the EA process) with the local
3           Qinghai Institute. He then served as the Bank's sole representative to advise and
123 See Environmental Data Sheet for Projects in the IBRD/IDA Lending Program, first draft (8 January
1998).
124 As noted earlier, the footnote to the A lists in Annex E state that: "S'ensitivity refers to issues such
as impacts that are irreversible, affect vulnerable ethnic minorities, or involve involuntary resettlement."
See OD 4.01, supra note 32, footnote 1 at Annex E.

assist the Institute throughout the preparation of the EA. Finally, he was asked to
recommend clearance of the resulting EA. In the Panel's view, if this is a common
practice, it should be seriously examined. It seems devoid of any second, let
alone third party checks to ensure the quality of the work done. It would place
anyone, however competent, in a series of judge and jury conflicts.         |

3                   The Environmental Assessment of the
5                                   Qinghai Project
187.  "The detail and sophistication of an [environmental] analysis should be
commensurate with the expected impacts," states OD 4.01 in opening the paragraph
on what a project-specific assessment should cover.126  "Detail and sophistication"
are largely determined by the Category to which a project is assigned and, among
I          other things, the categorization of the project should reflect the "expected impacts."
188.  Beyond the question of "detail and sophistication" of an analysis, however,
OD 4.01 is quite clear on what a project-specific environmental assessment should
normally cover.  It mentions six elements: "(a) existing environmental baseline
3          conditions; (b) potential environmental impacts, direct and indirect, including
opportunities for environmental enhancement; (c) systematic environmental
comparison of alternative investments, sites, technologies, and designs; (d)
I          preventive, mitigatory, and compensatory measures, generally in the form of an
environmental mitigation or management plan; (e) environmental management and
training; and () environmental monitoring. 127
189.   In the Panel's view, the Environmental Assessment for the Project fails on
several counts in respect of these elements. The following discussion begins with
"existing environmental baseline conditions." It then considers the EA's treatment of
|          "potential environmental impacts, direct and indirect, including opportunities for
environmental enhancement." The question of the EA's "systematic environmental
comparison of alternative investments, sites, technologies, and designs" has been
discussed in Chapter 6.

77  
190.  To begin with, however, it would be useful to compare the interpretation of the
term "environment" as employed in OD 4.01 with the way it appears to have been
interpreted for purposes of the Environmental Assessment of the Qinghai Project.
8.1    "Environment": A Broad or Narrow Interpretation?
191.   A well-established principle of Environmental Assessment is that the term  3
"environment" must be broadly interpreted and must include all relevant biophysical
and socio-cultural elements. This principle is well set out in OP 4.01, viz. "3. EA
takes into account the natural environment (air, water, and land); human health and
safety; social aspects (involuntary resettlement, indigenous peoples, and cultural
property); and transboundary and global environmental aspects. EA considers natural  I
and social aspects in an integrated way."
192.   Although not as clearly stated in the main text of OD 4.01, it is clear from
Annex A to OD 4.01 "Checklist of Potential Issues for an EA" that a limited definition
of the term "environment" is neither intended nor possible. Some twenty issues to be  3
covered in an EA are listed, and among these are Biological Diversity; Cultural
Properties; Indigenous Peoples; Induced Development and Other Socio-Cultural
Aspects; Land Settlement; Natural Hazards; Wetlands; and Wildlands.
193.  The EA submitted to the World Bank in October 1998 adopted a strongly       I
biophysical bias to the environment, even though biological diversity itself receives no
more than passing mention.                                                        I
194.  Neither the Environmental nor the separate Social Assessment addresses the
topic of induced development, for example. The proposed in-migration to Dulan     I
County will more than double its population and the proposed new towns will each
have populations five times as large as Xiangride, the nearest established town to the
main irrigation site. But the potential impact of this on the regional economy and on  I
existing commercial, social and political sectors and hierarchies has not been
considered. Yet, OD 4.01 lays great stress on the topic of induced development. It  |
warns that: "Secondary growth of settlements and infrastructure, often referred to as
'induced development' (i.e. through newly introduced developments) or 'boomtown'
effects, can have major indirect environmental impacts, which relatively weak local  I
governments may have difficulty addressing. "128
128 See OD 4.01, supra note 32, Annex A, at (h)

78
195.  The Panel cannot escape the conclusion that Management adopted a
very limited definition of "environment" in the Qinghai Project.  As a
consequence, the full range of project effects were not analyzed or placed
before those responsible for project related decisions.
8.2    Existing Environmental Baseline Conditions
196.  In Chapter 4, the Panel discussed the fact that both the Environmental and
Social Assessments failed to define adequately the boundaries of the Project area,
leaving out whole communities and populations whose lives will be impacted
significantly by the Project. Chapter 4 also considered the failure to define the time
I,         scales used in the evaluation of the Project. The fact that the Environmental and
Social Assessments were very poorly supported by maps was also discussed in
|          Chapter 4.
197.    Inadequate and unreliable maps are not the only problem  with the
I          documentation. No illustrations are provided in the assessment documents and this
makes it very difficult to assimilate the data presented. There are no graphs and
charts to illustrate statistical data and there is a complete lack of photographs and
diagrams to give the reader much needed understanding and perspective on the
landscape, land-use activities and present environmental problems.  Illustrative
I          materials of this kind are a necessary part of a properly documented environmental
assessment. The Project documentation fails in this regard.
1          198.   Sound scientific practice also requires that sources of scientific data be
acknowledged and referenced. The Environmental and Social Assessments are
notably lacking in references to original sources even though OD 4.01 Annex B
specifically includes these in the Outline of a Project-Specific EA Report.129 The
absence of such referencs can call the reliability of an entire assessment into
*          question. It can also lead to enormous confusion as the Inspection Team found in
trying to source lists of plant and animal species in the Project areas. The Inspection
|          Team was provided with different lists at different times with no explanation as to why
they varied and no indication of the sources of the original data, or whether there
were any endangered species involved (see below).
129 See OD 4.01, supra note 32, at ß 2 (h)(ii).

199.  The following discussion considers the description and mapping of vegetation
in the EA and its inventory of biodiversity, and then looks at its treatment of direct and
indirect impacts.
8.2.1   Description and Mapping of Vegetation                                      |
200.  The Environmental Assessment fails to provide an adequate description and
mapping of the vegetation in the Project area.  In fact, there is an assumption
throughout the EA and much of the other Project documentation that the vegetation in
the Move-in area is of no significance. Typical is the statement in the Summary Paper  |
that Management issued in June, 1999, that "The present settlement area is largely
barren of vegetation but has excellent soil. By providing water to support sustainable
farming practices, the project will increase crop production without causing harm to  U
the natural surrounds." 130
201.   The description that is given of the vegetation of the Move-in areas is quite
inadequate. The EA states that "in Xiangride and Balong it (the vegetation) is mainly
xerophytes and super-xerophytes" and it divides it into alpine, desert and saline,  I
mentioning a few component species of each, plus "Introduced vegetation" and "The
present condition of the forest". 131  No description is given of the structure,
composition and distribution of the various plant communities or associations that
occur in the region that will be impacted.
202.   In the section on The Ecosystem  Quality in the Move-in Area, the EA
comments that: "The ecosystem ... is fragile. The structure is simple, ground cover is
very sparse and the systems lack the ability of self- reestablishment if disturbed. The
vegetation is comparatively sparse and species assemblages are simple and have
low productivity. The ecosystem stability is poor and it is easily disturbed by activities  X
that result in degeneration. Thus it can be seen that once the ecological system or its
structure is damaged or destroyed, the system or its structure may change and not
easily recover."'32 No further explanations are given, no reference is made to any
experimental studies on the vegetation or its regeneration, and no further discussion
is given of the vegetation dynamics.                                                I

203.    No reference is made in the EA to any previously published vegetation or
ecological studies of the region, or of the Project areas, although several do exist.
X            While it is probable that the plant communities are widespread in the whole of the
Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, as Management suggests in its July 18, 1999 Response,
I            they are of considerable scientific interest. The GEF-funded Country Study of China's
Biodiversity notes that one of China's critical regions for biodiversity conservation
adjacent to the Project area is the Plateau and mountain region where Xinjiang,
I            Qinghai and Tibet meet. It states that: "This is one of the few remnant wilderness
areas of the world, and extremely few people enter it. It has the utmost value for
scientific research and for the development of tourism. It has been threatened by
mining and poaching activities and urgently needs protection." 133 Much the same
applies to the general Project area.

evidence to the contrary, all Move-out villages are stereotyped as being situated on
barren, highly-eroded, hill slopes. For rehabilitation of these villages to be effective, if
people are moved for resettlement, detailed vegetation mapping will be essential to  I
provide a scientific basis for the sustainable technological interventions claimed for
the Project.                                                                     I
205.   An undated and unreferenced sketch map entitled 'Ecological Status Map of
Xiangride Balong Area Agricultural Development of World Bank Loan for Western
China" is the only document with any indication of the vegetation types, and it is
totally inadequate for any proper analysis to be made.
206.   The Qinghai Project involves a total transformation of the vegetation of some
of the Project areas, a substantial impact on others during the construction phases,
and a substantial impact on areas that are adjacent to or downstream  of the
construction areas. Management should therefore have required a proper vegetation  I
survey and map.
207.  The Project also involves the large-scale implantation of irrigated farming into  3
a desert area that currently is crossed by nomadic herders during their seasonal
migrations (transhumance). It would therefore be reasonable to expect the EA to
have included a fairly detailed survey of the various vegetation types and zones and
a map of the Project areas indicating what ecosystems are going to be impacted and
what the significance of this will be for the nomadic herders. Without this base-line
information, it is impossible to judge the potential impacts on plant communities or to
plan adequate mitigation measures.                                               i
8.2.2. Inventory of Biodiversity and its Conservation Status                     I
208.  The information given in the EA on the biodiversity of the Project areas, in the
Panel's view, is very sketchy and inadequate, even though "biological diversity" is
one of the issues that OD 4.01 states should be addressed. 134 Again, there is an
assumption in the EA, and in the PCD and Management Response, that because the
area is arid and largely wasteland and desert, little biodiversity is represented. This
has not been established in the EA and, certainly for the avifauna, mammals, insects  3
and other animal groups, the lists of species presented are inadequate. In the case of
the flowering plants, a few  species are listed under the vegetation types.
134 See OD 4.01, supra note 32, Annex A (b).

Consequently, on its final day in Xining, the Inspection Team asked if there was any
further information and it obtained a longer list of some 50 species. The Team was
X           then informed that a list of about 139 species found in the irrigated area plus the
townships would be faxed to it on its return to Beijing. That list was duly received: it is
|           anonymous and entitled (in Chinese) "Plant list of the Project Area and neighboring
area in Dulan County." It contains 183 species. The species in the list have not been
checked against the 1997 International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN)
I           Red List of Threatened Plants135 to establish whether any of them  are rare,
endangered or otherwise threatened nor is any indication given of endemism.
I           209.     Table 3-1  in the EA,136 entitled "The Types, Species and Habitat
Characteristics of Wildlife in the Move-in Area," lists twelve species, including three
|           mammals, eight birds "Cygnus etc missing," and one amphibian.137 Another list of 31
species entitled "Directory of animals About Xiangride - Balong agricultural
Development Program [ ... ] in Qinghai Province," with their Class of Protection and
distribution area, was also provided. Some of these are Tibetan endemics according
to the State Environmental Protection Administration.138 The EA notes that "For the
X           species occurring outside the project area, please see Table 3-2. "39 But Table 3-2 is
labeled "Types, Distribution of Species and Habitats of Wildlife in the Project Area. "40
On inquiry, the Team was informed that in fact it was a list of birds that occurred in
Lake Koruk. The Team found it difficult, even with the additional data obtained in
Xining, which supplements that given in the EA, to gain a proper understanding of
I'          what diversity occurs in the Project areas or to make an assessment of its
distribution, frequency/rarity and conservation status.
1          210.   An exhaustive inventory of biodiversity would not be expected in an EA. It
would have been appropriate, however, to search the literature and to reference
studies that have already been undertaken, including lists (or at least a reference to
them) so that reasonable assessment of the extent, importance and uniqueness
I           (endemism) of the biodiversity, and risks to it, could be made. In the Panel's view,
Management's acceptance of the total absence of data on the biodiversity of
the Move-out areas and the inadequate level of data on the Move-in area are a
major failing in the EA.

8.3   Opportunities for Environmental Enhancement                                      5
211.  The purpose of environmental and social assessment is not only to prevent        3
negative effects but also to increase benefits to affected communities where possible.
Neither the Environmental nor Social Assessments seriously test the statements of
anticipated benefits that are made for the Qinghai Project. There is also no evidence  |
of analysis of whether the benefits of the Project could be enhanced by modifications
to the Project.                                                                        3
212.   The following discussion begins with this question of enhancement, focusing
first on existing towns in the Move-in area, second on the Move-out area, and then on
nomadic pastoralism.  Next, it briefly examines a number of direct and indirect
impacts which the EA also failed to consider, including the impacts of the supply
canal, new towns and villages, water and sewerage, energy and drilling activities.
8.3.1 Existing Towns and Villages
213.   As noted in Chapter 4, the narrow definition of the boundaries of the Qinghai    i
Project in the Move-in area resulted in a large number of people in many
communities being left out of the Assessments altogether.  The new Towns of            5
Dongba and Tawen ("A" and "B" on Map 2), with populations projected at 22,938 and
26,814 inhabitants will be considerably larger than the existing towns in the
resettlement area.141 They will have a significant influence on the economies, trading  I
patterns and socio-political influence of existing service centers like Xiangride, with its
population of 9,621 in 1996; Xiangjia, with its 4,835, and Balong, with its 3,696.142   1
214.   The interdependence of this region is demonstrable, as the Team found on
its visit. As was pointed out in Chapter 4, merchants in Xiangride who were only
partially informed of the Project expect it to significantly increase their trade and
commerce and to bring in further people and investment to the area. In discussions      |
with the officials concerned with the Social Assessment, it was conceded that
141See VSIP, supra note 47, Table 9-1 at p. 64. It should, however, be noted that the Inspection Team  I
has been unable to obtain detailed information on the structure and relationships between "Natural
Villages", "Administrative Villages" and "New Towns" in the resettlement area. It is thus possible that
the populations of the new towns themselves may be less than the numbers suggest, due to the  U
population being dispersed amongst villages near to the towns

I            the two proposed new towns could well become the major population centers in the
county, acting as poles for new migrants and investments, and that they might well
attract   tertiary   services   away   from    the    existing    smaller   towns.
Yet, the EA contains no assessment of the impact of the Qinghai Project on the
network of social, commercial and political interactions that exists in Dulan County
I            and Xiangride Township. There is no indication of how these communities and their
populations will be affected, for better or worse, by the Project.143 Without this
I            assessment, the goal of enhancing Project benefits has no substance or meaning.

215.   The EA provides no sense of how the population of the new towns (apart
from the immigrant farmers) will be supplied with food, where it will be grown during
the initial phases of development, and what effects its later production will have on  I
the local economy over the longer term. Apart from hospitals and schools, other
services will be needed, but there is no indication of how they will be provided or of
how their provision will affect the economies and livelihoods of people in the existing
towns and villages.144
216.   Like much of the rest of the EA accepted by Management, the dam, irrigation
and resettlement parts of the Qinghai Project are treated as though they were to take
place in a regional vacuum. No attempt has been made to project population growth
or to estimate how large the induced and floating population will be, or what its ethnic
mix will be. Without some sense of this, it is difficult, if not impossible, to adequately  X
plan for the "culturally sensitive" schools, clinics, markets, administrative centers,
police stations, and other services that will be needed, and to try to enhance Project
benefits to both the existing population and the new migrants. Yet, the Environmental
and Social Assessments fail to consider this.                                       1
8.3.2 The Move-Out Area
217.  The first paragraph of the Project Appraisal Document asserts that the Project
will have the following benefits: "The project would empower poor households in the
selected poor counties to raise their incomes, through increased grain and livestock  5
production sufficient to meet the basic needs of food and clothing, and in many
cases, also  generate  a  marketable  surplus  to  improve  living  standards.
Establishment of alternative income generation activities in poor rural areas,
improvement of rural infrastructure and enhanced access to basic social services
such as health and education would also increase the living standards of poor rural  3
households. 145
218.  While these are without doubt appropriate and laudable aims and every effort
must be made to achieve them, it is unfortunate that no indication is given as to how
they are going to be achieved - particularly in the Move-out areas. The Project     3
documentation and budget provisions are explicit with respect to the resettlement
areas, but are moot with respect to both the plans and levels of financing for
improving the living conditions of those remaining behind in the Move-out areas.
144 See VSIP, supra note 47. Table 9-3 on p. 65 lists a series of items such as coal store, drug store,  l
restaurant, grain management office, hotel, local police station etc.

219.   The Project documentation suggests that the rural poor in the Move-out
areas will also gain access to electricity and to domestic water from the Project. But
details of how this will be achieved are lacking in the documentation. Significant
3          detail for both plans and budget is provided for the resettlement area but no detail is
provided for the Move-out areas. From the inquiries made in the Move-out villages
visited by the Inspection Team, it was apparent that those villagers interviewed by the
ffI        Team had not been consulted on their priorities for upgrading of social services and
had no expectation that such services were to be provided.
220.   There is also a complete lack of documentation on the social and economic
implications for a village "moving out" a significant proportion of their most productive
I          and economically active population. While the overall poverty alleviation plan for the
Move-out area does refer to infrastructural improvements, the actual positive or
negative effects of removing these selected farmers from the Move-out area have not
yet been examined.  The assumption is made that the reduction in population
numbers will almost automatically generate greater lebensraum and a better quality
of life for villagers remaining in the Move-out villages. But the rationale for this
assumption is tenuous and nowhere is it analyzed critically.
1          221.   The assumption that the people remaining behind in the Move-out areas will
have access to more arable land has also not been tested. Statements are made
that this will be so. But it is also claimed that some presently arable though marginal
land will be removed from production and forested to reduce soil erosion. The
question of what net balance of additional land will be available for production is not
addressed. Nor is the question of how the distribution of that land will result in net
positive gains for the remaining farmers.
222.  In the Move-out villages visited by the Inspection Team, it was clear that, in
most instances, a village would not move in its entirety. Most households interviewed
expected some of their active members to resettle, and others to remain. All
expected to continue having access to their arable lands. In the villages visited there
|          seemed to be no appreciation of the fact that the intent of resettlement is to reduce
the number of mu in the Move-out villages that is at present available for agriculture
in order to reforest steep eroded hill slopes.
223. The EA does not describe or analyze the environmental characteristics of the
Move-out areas at all. The scale of analysis is coarse and does not indicate the real
differences that exist between villages. The impression is created that the area is
I



87
homogeneous and that all villages are uniform with respect to the problems they face.
Although the Inspection Team visited a relatively small number of the villages in the
Move-out area, it was clear that this is not so. On the contrary, substantial differences  I
were found between the villages seen in terms of living conditions, housing, soil
erosion, crops grown, facilities available, proximity to schools, distance to urban   5
facilities, etc. Considerably more detailed analysis of the social and
environmental problems of the Move-out villages and of how these will be
addressed by the Project are required in order to comply with OD 4.01.

224.   Management recognizes this, at least implicitly. In Annex 11 of its July 18,
1999 Response, Management refers to the "Supplemental Letters to the Legal
Agreements" that it agreed with the Government of China before Board presentation,
and signed on December 30, 1999.  In paragraph 7, it states that "Not later that 3
years after the commencement of the Qinghai Voluntary Settlement Implementation       I
Plan, Qinghai will carry out a study ... to evaluate the environmental and social

impacts of the ... Plan ... and to recommend measures to enhance the environmental
sustainability of, and the living conditions of the people in these counties. ,,,.146 While
I           this is welcome, the Panel would observe that undertaking an environmental and
social assessment three years after the commencement of the Project is a bit late,
not only in terms of the ODs, but also in terms of any elemental understanding of the
purposes of environmental and social assessments. This voluntary resettlement
project could have major, long-lasting, and irreversible social impacts. Normally, one
I           does not propose to undertake these assessments three years after a project has
started (unless it is to test earlier findings based on new information or unexpected
|           developments); one undertakes them in advance to inform the location and design of
a project and, indeed, whether to proceed with it at all. Within the social arena, this is
comparable to requiring that the safety of a proposed darn should be studied within
three years after it has been built!
8.3.3   Nomadic Pastoralism as an Appropriate Land Use
3           225.   Pastoralism represents the main economy of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau but
has been subject to major change in recent decades through government
interventions aimed at modernizing or fundamentally changing the pastoral way of
life.147 Yet, the EA and other Project documents fail to consider the appropriateness
of implanting large-scale irrigated agriculture in this region.  The EA does not
examine its suitability or viability in comparison with the traditional forms of land use,
including agropastoralism, sedentary pastoralism, semi-sedentary pastoralism (semi-
nomadism), and migratory pastoralism  involving the herding of sheep and other
animals. There appears simply to be an assumption that irrigated agriculture is 'a
good thing' without consideration of alternatives and relative costs.
226.   The Chinese Academy of Sciences has published a five-volume study on
sustainable development on the Qinghai Tibetan Plateau and a considerable
literature has been published on patterns of land use, grassland degradation,
conversion of grazing land into cropland, carrying capacity and optimal intensity of
|           grazing, possible recovery strategies and related topics.148 Moreover, there is a large

from various forms of environmental degradation in China'China Environment. This contains extensive
I



89
body of literature that identifies nomadic pastoralism as practised in the Qinghai-
Tibetan Plateau as a unique human ecological adaptation.  While one would not
expect a review of this literature in the EA, it would be appropriate for the issues        I
raised in this literature to be considered as they are highly relevant to the land use
and agro-economic development that is at the heart of this Project. At a minimum, a
systematic comparison should have been made between the advantages and
disadvantages of the area being converted to irrigation farming as opposed to
enhancing its potential for nomadic herding.
8.4   Potential Environmental Impacts
8.4.1  The Supply Canals
227.  The 29 km canal from the Xiangride river to the Keri Dam and the 56 km
supply canal from  the Dam  to the irrigation area, traverse areas of grassland,
halophytic scrub, wasteland and semi-desert that are crossed by nomadic herders
and their flocks. Both the canals themselves and the disturbance caused by their
construction will have important environmental impacts. Because of their width and
depth (they will be concrete lined, trapezoidal, some 2.5 meters wide and two meters
deep), they constitute a serious barrier for humans and most animals, including
sheep, camels and horses. Without adequate crossing points, the canals will also
restrict the movement of settlers between  villages and  between  villages and              |
administrative centers. To allow herders and others to cross the canal, crossings are
planned at certain intervals along the length of the canal. In addition, five 50 to 70 m    3
wide transit corridors (so-called pastoral passages) will be provided for herders: three
of these will be within the irrigated areas.149 These transit corridors would, apparently,
be fenced and narrow into a funnel where they cross over the canal. PMO officials           3
informed the Inspection Team in the field that there are 289 herder families and 2,411
I
references to relevant literature. See, also, Land Resources Production Capability and Population
Supporting Capacity in China. People's University Press, 1991 and see Grassland degradation in
Tibetan regions of China - possible recovery strategies, a report by the uS Embassy, Beijing (1996).
See Web Page at http://www.usembassy-china.orQ.cn/enQlsh/sandtfinal3.htm.
149 The figures given for the width of these corridors varies in different project documents. In the  J
Management Response a discussion is given of the concern that the land in the transit corridors may
not be able to withstand heavy foot and animal traffic and the question of the appropriate width of the
corridors is raised. It is states that 'Based on the current analysis, the preferred solution to the problem  I
will be to increase the design width for the corridors to about 100 meters." See Management
Response, supra note 12, at p. 67.

people affected and 110,000 sheep units involved.150 It will take one week for all the
animals in a herd to pass through the corridor so that the grazing pressure on the
I           vegetation in the corridors and the effect of trampling on the soil are factors that need
to be considered.

228 In discussions with the hydraulic engineer and other PMO offcials it became
evident that Management had not required a feasibility study about the adequacy and
effectiveness of the proposed crossings, the transit corridors, and the provision of
facilities for sheep to be watered when they come down off the mountain.
3       ~~Furthermore, no assessment had been made of the risks involved in allowing large
numbers of animals to pass through a major irrigated area from which they are
separated only by some form of fencing (no details are provided). On questioning
PMO officers in the field, it was clear that Management had given little thought to the
logistics of such crossings. In fact, no consideration had been given to how the herds
* evientthawould be funneled through the irrigated area nor what provision would be made for
water for the herds that pass through the transit corridors.  In its Response of July
118, 1999 to the Request for Inspection, Management states that the issue of the
A "sheep unit" is a measure used by the PMO to indicate the grazing equivalent of one sheep.
Thus the effect of any animal's grazing can be compared to that of other animals by converting to
sheep units.

8.4.2   New Towns and Villages                                                       3
229.   The EA is uninformative about the layout of the new towns and villages, their
infrastructure, and the facilities such as water, heat and light that will be provided for
the settlers. In fact, the EA pays little attention to the way in which the settlers will
live, other than in terms of the agriculture and forestry in which they will engage..
230.   The EA is silent on what methods the new towns and villages will use to
manage and dispose of their wastes. Similarly, the EA is virtually silent on the
impacts of the emissions and wastes on the areas surrounding and downstream from
the new towns and villages. To its surprise, the Team found out during the interviews 3
that the Terms of Reference for the EA did not call for any such assessment. When
asked if it was normal for an EA to ignore the environmental impacts of new towns
with populations around 30,000, let alone new villages, the Consultant said "No." Nor  |
is it in line with the requirements of OD 4.01.
8.4.3  Energy                                                                        I
231.  All of the descriptions provided of the climate of Dulan County make mention   5
of the high altitude (over 3000 m), the bitterly cold winter conditions (mean
temperature 4 C, winter minimum minus 26 C, summer maximum 32 C), the low
rainfall (about 250mm), and the strong westerly winds. There is no natural tree
growth and only a 100-day frost-free period for agriculture. In some years, blizzards
cause serious loss of livestock. Living conditions are very harsh. The EA of a Project  3
to move about 60,000 migrants into this climate might be expected to give the fullest
consideration to their sources of energy and the problems they might face. 152       1
232.   During the first two years of the Project, it is estimated that some 20,000 tons
of coal will be needed each year, but no provision for this essential expenditure 3
appears to have been made in the Project documentation available to the Inspection
151 See Management Response. supra note 12, at p. 67.
152Although the VSIP outlines the energy problems that the migrants might face, the document does  I
not suggest any practical long-term solutions other than provision of solar cookers, firewood saving
stoves, and marsh gas ponds. See VSIP, supra note 47, Section 13 at p. 80-86.

Team. After the first two years, the supply of coal is to be reduced and settlers are
expected to use straw as their main source of heat energy.153
233.   An electrical power supply will be provided from DLulan Township. The Team
|            was informed that power would be transferred from  the 110 KV power line at
Xiangride Town to two substations at the two new townships via 126 kilometers of
35KV and 211 kilometers of 10 KV power lines. In addition, 1,238 kilometers of 220
I            V and 380 V distribution lines would be constructed. This would be financed by the
Bank, matched by government counterpart funds.154
l            234.   While power will be supplied, the EA and other documentation are, at the
least, unclear about its use by the new residents to supply their needs. The Project
Appraisal Document states: "To meet similar requirements (power requirements for
households, agro-processing, other light industries and mining) in the voluntary
resettlement areas in Qinghai, power would be drawn from the proposed 110 kV line
at Xiangride Town. 155

235.    Inquiries by the Inspection Team, however, revealed that the extent of
electricity provision would be two electric light bulbs for poorer households and four
electric light bulbs for those that are comparatively better-off. No power points will be  I
provided for heating or for domestic appliances.  Regardless of the merits, or
otherwise, of this type of electrification, the environmental and social assessments
should have examined the implications. The resettlement area has little biomass
suitable for fuel. Crops residue and animal dung will not be available for heating until
after the settlement is well established. Yet the settlers are expected somehow to     I
heat their homes. At a minimum, the potential advantages as well as the cost
implications of electric heating should have been examined.

9.1   Dam Safety (OP/BP 4.37)
238. The proposed construction of the Keri Dam appears to be in overall
compliance with OP/BP 4.37 and Annex B of OD 4.00. It is an off-river regulating
I          reservoir which will have a maximum wall height of 40 m. The location has been well
chosen and the design has been assessed by a team of independent experts (from
3          the Qinghai Provincial Water Conservancy Institute), as required under OP/BP 4.37
and Annex B of OD 4.00.

239.   The environmental impacts on the area to be converted for building the dam
are real in terms of loss of 127 ha of sparsely covered semi-desert ecosystem, plus
associated land impacted by the construction process, but it is highly unlikely that any
unique biodiversity will be lost or adversely affected.
240.   One significant and worrying omission from the documentation, however, is a
lack of reference to the seismicity of the Project area, and to the fact that two
earthquakes of magnitude 7+, equivalent to the 1999 Turkish (Izmit) earthquakes,
occurred in Dulan County in 1937 and in 1963.'58 Although the main Balong irrigation
settlement is far from the Keri Dam, this is not true for the Keri irrigation sub-district.
An assessment of the risk to the Keri irrigated area should the dam fail due to an
earthquake should be undertaken in the near future.
9.2    Pest Management (OP 4.09)
241.  The use of pesticides forms part of the implementation phase and no detailed
comments can therefore be made on this as the exact nature of the pest
management proposals are unknown.  In general it may be accepted that the
extemely harsh and cold winters of the Project area will prevent most agricultural
pests from getting out of control. The PAD and the Management Response make it
clear that no Bank funds will be used for the procurement of pesticides, but these will
be prcvided by the borrower as counterpart funds for the Project and must therefore
be interpreted as part of a Bank-funded project.
242.   The statement in the Management Response (p.75) that there are "no
reasons to believe that these [pesticides] will represent any off-site risk to animals or
humans" is difficult to accept. A risk always exists and there are several well-
documented cases of massive damage being caused to wildlife, especially birds,
through the field application of pesticides.
243.    During the Inspection Team's visit to China, the problem  of increasing
population of the differenct pika species (Ochotona spp.) over grazed areas was
discussed with Chinese officials. With an increase in rodent numbers, burrows
proliferate and the resultant penetration of water into the sub-soil enhances erosion
and leads to the "black-beach" phenomenon affecting considerable areas of the

Qinghai and Tibetan Plateau. The fact that increased human settlement on the
Qinghai-Tibetan plateau carries with it a concomitant need for rodent control at high
altitudes was impressed upon the Inspection Team.
1           244.    Although assurances were given to the Inspection Team  that an
integrated pest management programme would be undertaken for the Qinghai
project no details of such a program were provided. The Panel, therefore, is
not satisfied that Management is in full compliance with these policies.

9.3    The Conservation of Natural Habitats (OP 4.04)
245.   The conservation of natural habitats (i.e. areas where the ecosystem's
biological communities are formed largely by native plant and animal species)159 like
other measures that protect and enhance the environment:, is regarded by the Bank
as essential for long-term sustainable development. This is the subject of the Bank's
OP 4.04 on Natural Habitats.
246.   In paragraph 4, OP 4.04 states that: "The Bank does not support projects

at Annex A, Definitions.

98
that, in the Bank's opinion, involve the significant conversion or degradation[.. ] of
critical natural habitats." And paragraph 5 makes it clear that the Bank does not
support significant conversion of natural habitats where there are feasible
alternatives. It states: "The Bank does not support projects involving the significant
conversion of natural habitats unless there are no feasible alternatives for the project
and its siting, and comprehensive analysis demonstrates that overall benefits from
the project substantially outweigh the environmental costs. If the environmental
assessment[..] indicates that a project would significantly convert or degrade natural  I
habitats, the project includes mitigation measures acceptable to the Bank."
247.   The EA dismisses the ecosystems of the region as "primitive and inefficient"
and considers that the Project will lead to a great improvement in the overall
ecosystem.160 This view was reflected in the Panel's interviews with several officials  I
who felt that arid zone and desert ecosystems have less importance than, say,
forested systems.
248.  In its Response, Management rejects claims that the Bank is in contravention
of its policy on the grounds of the limited geographical context and the scale of the  i
Project compared with the wide distribution of the ecosystems concerned.161
According to Management, these ecosystems are not considered to be facing a
significant threat from agricultural or other developments in Qinghai or China as a
whole.
249.  This raises the issue of how one determines what is "significant conversion,"
there being no quantitative measure. This may need to be judged on a case-by-case
basis but, if so, there is a presumption that whatever judgement is made has to be
scientifically based and credible. In practice, there are some working rules of thumb,
such as in the old policy,162 where the threshold, at least for absolute conversions,
was suggested to be about 100 square kilometers or 10,000 hectares. The Panel was
informed that the biodiversity experts in the Bank lean more toward 5,000 hectares if
it is a very large ecosystem to begin with, or in relative terms, if it is more than one
percent.
250.   The 19,000 ha of land that will be irrigated is spread over a total area of c.
250,000 ha is only part of the picture. To this must be added the other farmland
developments (the dam, canals, townships, villages, roads, construction sites, power

lines, etc.), which bring the total to 21,444 ha.163 Moreover, it would be naive to
suppose that the bringing of nearly 60,000 people into the area would not have
serious effects on the habitats and wildlife adjacent to the various project areas.
|          251.   The increasing pace and scale of habitat conversion in the Qinghai-Tibetan
Plateau requires a broader view to be taken of the fate of the various ecosystems in
the Region, not just those in or adjacent to the Project area.
252.   The Management Response considered that as a consequence of the
considerations noted above "there was no reason to believe that the affected areas
were critical for rare, vulnerable, migratory or endangered species." This may be true
of plant species. Given the poor knowledge of the other groups of organisms in the
area, however, and the almost total lack of information on population sizes and
dynamics except for some birds and mammals (no data on these aspects are
provided in the EA), it cannot be asserted with confidence for species in these other
groups.
253.   In fact, the International Crane Foundation, which has worked in China in
cooperation with the Government since 1979, has informed the Panel that "We have
every reason to believe that Black-necked Cranes nest in the wetlands that will be
impacted by the Qinghai resettlement project. Because this area is so sparsely
populated, however, and until now there were no concerms about threats, there is
minimal information on cranes. The only information currently available is from two
scientific expeditions that passed briefly through the area during fall 1979. Black-
necked cranes were observed and local informants told scientists that they bred in
the wetlands. One of the expeditions reported over 600 Black-necked Cranes; given
the time of the year, we would suggest that these birds were probably either staging
in the area just prior to their southward migration, or were migrating through the
area.  Given the paucity of information and the potential for wetland degradation if
the World Bank decides to go forward with the Dulan County project, we believe that
it is critical that a baseline study on Black-necked Cranes be conducted."164
254.   The Panel is of the view that the Project is in contravention of the
Bank's policy, OP 4.04, in regard to the significant conversion of critical natural
habitats.

Chapter 10
The Qinghai Project and Indigenous Peoples
l
255.   In stating the objective of Bank policy toward indigenous peoples, OD 4.20
could hardly be clearer. It says that: "The Bank's broad objective towards indigenous
people, as for all the people in its member countries, is to ensure that the
development process fosters full respect for their dignity, human rights, and cultural
uniqueness. More specifically, the objective at the center of this directive is to ensure
that indigenous peoples do not suffer adverse effects during the development
process, particularly from Bank-financed projects, and that they receive culturally
compatible social and economic benefits."'65
256.  While clear in letter and spirit, the achievement of this objective requires an
agreed understanding of what constitutes an "indigenous people" in any given
situation. OD 4.20 recognizes that this is not always easy or clear-cut. It allows
Management some flexibility in deciding what groups will be considered "indigenous"
in any given project and it provides a number of guidelines to assist them.
257.    First, it provides a general definition of the terrns "indigenous peoples,"
"indigenous ethnic minorities," "tribal groups," and "scheduled tribes." These terms,
it says, which all fall under the broad term "indigenous peoples, ...describe social
groups with a social and cultural identity distinct from the dominant society that
makes them vulnerable to being disadvantaged in the development process. ...,166
258.  Second, it points out that the constitutions, statutes, and relevant legislation
within the country concerned may include "specific definitional clauses and legal
frameworks that provide a preliminary basis for identifying indigenous peoples. 167
259.   Third, recognizing that "...no single definition can capture their diversity," it
cites a number of characteristics of "indigenous people." They are  "...commonly
among the poorest segments of a population. They engage in economic activities that
range from shifting agriculture in or near forests to wage labor or even small-scale
market-oriented activities. Indigenous peoples can be identified in particular

geographical areas by the presence in varying degrees of the following
characteristics: (a) a close attachment to ancestral territories and to the natural
resources in these areas; (b) self-identification and identification by others as      I
members of a distinct cultural group; (c) an indigenous language, often different from
the national language; (d) presence of customary social and political institutions; and
(e) primarily subsistence-oriented production. 168

l
260.   Finally, while allowing judgment in determining the populations to which the
policy applies, OD 4.20 urges Task Managers (now Task Team Leaders) to " ............................... make 
use of specialized anthropological and sociological experts throughout the project
Cycle."069
261.   Management considers that OD 4.20 applies to anyone who is a member of
an officially recognized "national minority." Citing the above-mentioned paragraphs,  
the Management Response notes that: "In all such Chinese documents, the nationala
minorities are recognized as peoples distinct from the "Han" majority (92 percent of
the population), enjoying special legal and administrative protections. In the context
of this Project, it is iaportant to note that following this approach, not only Mongols
and Tibetans come under the safeguard umbrella of the OD, but also the Hui, Salar,

and Tu peoples. A judgement as to the degree of adherence to the OD must include
the impacts of the Project on all such indigenous peoples."1;∞
262.    Though much advocacy as well as anthropological literature on indigenous
3           peoples has concentrated on the Americas, a considerable body of recent literature
also assesses the concept of "indigenous peoples" within the Asian context.171 The
Team explored some of these definitional issues in interviews with Chinese
I           government officials in China, as well as with World Bank staff and consultants, and
invited academic experts.
10.1 Indigenous Peoples in the Move-Out Area
3           263.   The Panel inquired in detail about the status of officially recognized minority
group members who no longer speak their indigenous language or practice their
indigenous religion. This includes many households in the Move-out area that are
officially registered as "Tibetan." During its visit to the Move-out area, the Team met
some of these families and found that they had effectively been assimilated in the
culture and society of their Han neighbors in the same villages.
i           264.   During its discussions with officials and experts, the Team was informed of
*many reasons why these "assimilated" households might maintain their official
registration as minority ethnic group members. As members of a national minority,
3           for example, they are exempt from the one-child-per-family limit. They are eligible for
preferential admission to some schools and for preferential hiring practices.  In
addition, there are historically many examples of people and families who lose the
language and cultural tradition with which they identify and the next generation
regains it.  (And, of course, there are historically many examples of people who
|           assimilate permanently with the majority culture.)

265. Treating fully assimilated minorities as "Tibetans," or as other national
minorities, might be questioned by some.172  It would appear, however, that there is
effectively no better method for judging "indigenous" status for purposes of OD 4.20                  I
than to equate "indigenous peoples" with "national minority" status as enshrined in
the constitution of the People's Republic of China.173                                                3

266.    Management points out that the majority of beneficiaries from the Move-out
areas are also indigenous peoples (Hui, Salar, and Tu as well as Tibetan and|
Mongol), and thus they are covered by the same OD 4.20.'174  This is an important
172 Some Tibetans with whom the Team discussed these issues in Qinghai, for example, said they did  
not consider such people Tibetan. Late one night, when one member of the Team visited one of
Xining's university dormitories to meet with Tibetan students (alone except for his interpreter), the  
students said they did not consider such families to be "Tibetan" at all. The Team member recounted  
his visit to poor Tibetan households in Haidong Prefecture in the Move-out area who no longer spoke
Tibetan or practiced any Tibetan traditions and who said they wanted to resettle in Dulan County. One
Tibetan student (using "Tulan, " the Tibetan word for Dulan) asserted: 'What you just saw in Haidong  
is the future of Tulan, if the World Bank funds this project'  It was impossible to measure how accurate
or widespread these sentiments might be.
173 For Bank-financed projects, the 55 national minorities officially recognised by the Chinese   
P4 vernment are considered "indigenous peoples" for purposes of application of OD 4.20.

point with crucial consequences. It means that the overall Voluntary Resettlement
Plan itself (insofar as it applies to national minorities in the Move-out areas) must also
I           be examined for compliance with the Indigenous Peoples policy. (See Chapter 11)
It also means that Management should have prepared an adequate Indigenous
3           Peoples Development Plan (IPDP) not only for the minorities in the Move-in area, but
also for the voluntary resettlers coming from Haidong and Xining City Prefectures.
3        ~~~Figure 20. Monks pravin- at the Temple in Chahamao Village, Xiangride Township, Dulan Country.
1       ~~10.2  The Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP)
3       ~~267.  OD 4.20 is quite clear about Bank policy concerning the preparation of an
Indigenous Peoples Development Plan.   Paragraph  113 states that: "For an
investment project that affects indigenous peoples, the borrower should prepare an
I      ~ ~indigenous peoples development plan that is consistent with the Bank's policy. Any
project that affects indigenous peoples is expected to include components or
3lprovisions that incorporate such a plan. When the bulk of the direct project

indigenous peoples. The decision not to have a separate IPDP did not result in a failure to address
issues related to indigenous peoples,- on the contrary, a more thorough approach has been to design
the whole Project in accordance with OD 4;20

beneficiaries are indigenous people, the Bank's concerns would be addressed by the
project itself and the provisions of this OD would thus apply to the project in its
entirety."                                                                           1
268.   The prerequisites for an IPDP are dealt with in paragraph 14, which begins    3
with the statement that: "The key step in project design is the preparation of a
culturally appropriate development plan based on full consideration of the options
preferred by the indigenous people affected by the project. "1 75
269.    Other prerequisites mentioned in paragraph 14 include studies that "... |
should make all efforts to anticipate adverse trends likely to be induced by the project
and develop the means to avoid or mitigate harm." In addition, " Local patterns of
social organization, religious beliefs, and resource use should be taken into account  I
in the plan's design." Moreover, "Successful planning for indigenous peoples
frequently requires long lead times, as well as arrangements for extended follow-    I
up. "i 76
270.  In addition to the prerequisites for an IPDP, the OD sets out nine components  |
of a plan including "baseline data," "land tenure," and "strategy for local
participation."177  It also sets out the process to be followed in developing a plan
within the framework of the Bank's "project cycle," including identification,
preparation, and appraisal.178  Each of these will be considered in turn.  First,
however, the Panel will examine the central question posed by Management's           I
interpretation of paragraph 13: Does the Qinghai Project as a whole constitute the
Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP) required by OD 4.20?                      3
10.3 The Project as an IPDP
271.   Management acknowledges that an Indigenous Peoples Development Plan
(IPDP) is required for the Qinghai Project. It asserts, however, that the Project as a
whole constitutes the IPDP because a majority of the Project's beneficiaries are
minorities.  This assertion hinges on an interpretation of the last sentence of
paragraph 13 quoted above; i.e., "... When the bulk of the direct project beneficiares  3
are indigenous people, the Bank's concerns would be addressed by the project itself
and the provisions of this OD would thus apply to the project in its entirety. "

107
272.   Citing this paragraph, Management contends that "...The OD provides for a
judgment to be made regarding whether or not a self-standing IPDP would be
adequate for a particular project in light of its unique circumstances or whether an
3           IPDP approach should be integrated into the whole project."179
273.   Management's interpretation of this paragraph requires that careful attention
be paid to exactly how the "bulk of the direct project beneficiaries" are counted.
Management contends that in the overall "project area," the majority of intended
beneficiaries (58 percent of those in the Move-out area and 78 percent of those in the
Move-in area) are indigenous peoples.180 Note that these figures assume that the
displaced pastoralists in the Move-in area are all "beneficiaries" of the Project. In
I           fact, of course, they are not. Rather, they are adversely affected by the Project.
Their so-called "benefits" are merely mitigating compensation for their involuntary
displacement.  Management's "Involuntary Resettlement Plan" itself, dated May
1999, describes the Project's effects in the Move-in area in terms of "adverse"
impacts on the population. Thus while the Management Response, dated July 1999,
I           consistently describes the displaced pastoralists as "beneficiaries" of the Project, the
"Involuntary Resettlement Plan" of May 1999 treats them as persons who are
"adversely impacted." It notes, for example, that "About 19,000 hectares ... will be
developed for general irrigation works. Almost all of this larnd is arid, uninhabited, and
largely unutilized. In terms of involuntary resettlement-related issues and impacts,
3           however, development or expansion of settlements is expected to adversely affect
some 4, 000 persons (600 households) from Balong and Zongjia townships. "181
1           274.   Of course, even if the displaced pastoralists were to be counted among the
"adversely affected" rather than the "beneficiaries," Management's interpretation
5           could still apply since ethnic minority resettlers from the Move-out area would still
outnumber the ethnic minority pastoralists in the Move-in area. A senior World Bank
expert on indigenous peoples provided the Panel with a forceful summary of this
interpretation of the OD.  Pointing to Management's figure of roughly 60,000
resettlers from the Move-out area, and roughly 4,000 indigenous people in the Move-
179 See Management Response, supra note 12, at p. 10.
I           180 See Management Response, supra note 12, at p. 10,also Annex 6, Table A.6-1. The Inspection
Team was informed that, in the Move-out area, 33,118 of them of are minority nationalities and that
accounts for 56.67 percent in the Move-out area. In the Move-in area with a total population of 4,600,
3,114 of them are minority nationalities. Add those two together, you are talking about 36,000 minority
g eople accounting for 60 percent in the whole area.

in area, the expert concluded rhetorically: "So, in other words, if you wipe out a
whole culture because it is only composed of 4,000, that legitimizes the 60,000."
275.   Having acknowledged that OD 4.20 applies to the Move-out area as well as
the Move-in area, Management contends that the IPDP approach has been               3
integrated into the entire Project. However, as a result of Management's choice not to
develop self-standing IPDPs for the different minority groups, the cultural uniqueness
and needs of some groups, especially those in the Move-in area, seem inadequately   I
to have been addressed. Management essentially contends that since there are
many more indigenous farmers among the nearly 60,000 voluntary resettlers from the
Move-out area than there are indigenous nomadic pastoralists in the Move-in area,
the overall majority of the Project's "beneficiaries" are indigenous. By this reasoning,
even if all the indigenous people in the Move-in area (estimated by Management to   I
number 4,000) are considered adversely affected, the Project's indigenous
beneficiaries from the Move-out area still outnumber them.182                       I
276. The danger in this approach is that a Bank-financed project could legitimately
overwhelm the hopes and aspirations of an indigenous population, so long as the
project benefits a larger population of some other indigenous people. And the
"project in its entirety" could constitute the "Indigenous Peoples Development Plan"  I
(IPDP) required by the OD since "the bulk of the direct project beneficiaries" would be
indigenous people. The Panel is strongly of the view that this interpretation of
the last sentence of paragraph 13 was never intended and should not be              i
allowed to stand.
277.   The Panel has another problem with this interpretation as applied to the     I
Qinghai Project. Management's figures for the indigenous population, and for the
project-affected population, depend on an extremely narrow and deeply flawed        3
definition of the Project's boundaries. The boundaries used by Management serve to
highlight the fact that they can be defined in a way that effectively determines the
balance between those who benefit and those who are adversely affected by a
project. In this case, Management's narrow definition of the Project's boundaries
potentially subsumes the rights and cultural uniqueness of the most vulnerable ethnic  |
minorities, in favor of other ethnic minorities who outnumber them as a direct result of
the way in which the boundaries are defined.
182 Though the Management Response often refers to the involuntary resettled persons in the Move-in
area as "beneficiaries," the "Involuntary Resettlement Plan" refers to them as "adversely affected."  I
Certainly, the majority of their "benefits" from the Project consist of the compensation provided for its
adverse effects.

278. After discussing this in Chapter 4, the Panel pointed out that compliance
required that the spatial boundaries of the Project be corrected to include all the
population directly impacted by the Project, rather than restricting them largely to the
3          proposed irrigation site.  If this were done, the overall figures for impacted
populations would shift towards the population in the Move-in area. And, among this
larger population, it would increase the overall percentage of those who have the
I          status of "indigenous people" as well as the number of those who could be
considered adversely impacted by the Project.

County).
279. In the Panel's view, there is a related problem with the population figures in the
Move-out area. Management has stated that the number of applicants from the
|          Move-out areas greatly outnumber the spaces available for resettlers. Nobody, as
yet, has been definitely selected to move and the Panel was informed that in due
course selections will be made in accordance with a process yet to be determined.
*          When the Panel visited the Move-out areas, most of the village people with whom it
spoke understood this.  Thus, while national minorities may make up a high
3          percentage of the total applicants for resettlement, the eventual percentage of
national minorities could be revised downward if a higher percentage of Han migrants
I



l
110
get selected, or if a higher percentage of Han choose to move and minorities choose
to stay. Given the fact that "applicant" status is based on a survey which effectively
encourages farmers to keep their options open by applying for resettlement, as                I
discussed in Chapter 5, it is possible that many farmers will not actually choose to
move; or they might move and then exercise the option to return. Since Han families           3
often arrived later than other ethnic groups in the Han-minority areas of Haidong or
Xining City Prefecture, and were consequently left with the worst land to farm, the
percentage of Han who eventually choose to resettle could be higher than the current          I
percentage of Han among the applicants would indicate. In other words, the figures
in the Project documents on the ethnic mix of settlers from the Move-out area could           I
change significantly.
280.    In the Panel's view, Management's interpretation of this one sentence of
paragraph 13 of OD 4.20, cannot be accepted. It is inconsistent with other parts of
the OD  and especially inconsistent with the objective of Bank policy towards                 3
indigenous people, which is "...to ensure that the development process fosters full
respect for their dignity, human rights, and cultural uniqueness... " and to "ensure that
indigenous peoples do not suffer adverse effects during the development process...,           I
and that they receive culturally compatible social and economic benefits."183  The
Panel therefore finds that the Project as a whole does not constitute the IPDP                3
required by OD 4.20, and that separate, free-standing IPDPs are required to
bring the Project into compliance with OD 4.20.184
10.4  A Separate IPDP for Each Minority
281.   The Bank's overall intent in giving special attention to "indigenous peoples"
derives from the fact that they have a cultural identity and social status that make           |
"them  vulnerable to being disadvantaged in the development process."185  The
183 See OD 4.20, supra note 39, at ß 6.                                                        1
184 The Panel would also note that if Management's interpretation of this OD were allowed to stand, it
would carry the potential for serious harm to indigenous minority groups affected by other Bank-
financed projects. One senior Bank official, writing on this Project, expressed concern that documents  .,
should not refer to precedents elsewhere because it could raise the question of compliance in those
prior projects:"The fact that we didn't prepare any IPDPs in past projects opens the possibility that all
past projects in similar areas were not in compliance with Bank policy" Nonetheless, Management
states that this interpretation is "in line with the approach adopted for comparable projects in China  I
and other countries in which the majority of beneficiaries are indigenous peoples"-- a footnote (15)
explains, "Projects in India and Indonesia in particular.' The Response also lists the Southwest
Poverty Reduction Project (1995 launch), the Gansu-Hexi Corridor project (1996), and the Tarim Basin  3
11 project (1998). See Management Response, supra note 12 at p. 11, footnote 14.

"indigenous peoples," or national minorities, in the Move-in area, the Hui, Mongol,
Tibetan, Tu and  Salar, are very different from  each  other, in their "cultural
I            uniqueness" as well as their "local patterns of social organization, religious beliefs,
and resource use."186  In the Qinghai Project, however, Management has effectively
and retroactively lumped together these very different cultures into a single "one-plan-
fits-all" IPDP; that is, the "project in its entirety."187  As just noted, in this IPDP,
majority numbers from  the Move-out area (i.e., the "bulk of the direct project
I            beneficiaries') can override the rights and aspirations of the ethnic minorities among
the minorities in the Move-in area. The application of this interpretation of the OD
I

County, about whether separate development plans for each ethnic group would have been preferred.
can easily serve to increase the vulnerability of the most vulnerable cultural and
ethnic groups, and  increase their chances of "...being disadvantaged in the
development process. "
282. The March 1999 Social Assessment for Qinghai also stresses the importance
of recognizing the cultural differences among the minorities. It points out that
"Minority herdsmen do not like to see relocated migrants move-in, but they can be
relieved of their worries through taking proper measures, e.g. strengthening public
security and management."  It also raises the risk of ethnic conflict and, in particular

harm to Tibetan interests. "The ethnic minorities in the project area include the
Tibetans, the Mongols, and the Hui, the Tu, and the Sala people. If the issue of
ethnic groups [is] not given sufficient attention, and not handled properly, it will trigger  I
off contradictions and damage the image of the government, affect the
socioeconomic development in the move-in areas, and produce negative impact.    3
Therefore great importance should be attached to this issue, and all-round
consideration should be given. In particular, the interests of the local Mongol and
Tibetan people must not be impaired. Pay particular attention to current sensitive
issues, such as public security, establishment of the channels for grazing and fair
distribution. These issues need to be consulted and handled in time. Build the
move-in areas into ones where people of different nationalities can live in harmony
and prosper side by side. " [Emphasis added].                                   I
283. Later, in the June, 1999 PAD, following the outbreak of public concern,
Management claimed that these issues had been accomodated in the Project design  U
in general, the Local Beneficiary Plan, the VSIP and the RAP.
284.   Ethnic minorities in the Move-in area (as well as those from the Move-out  I
area) will have major changes to their subsistence systems: the resettled farmers will
shift from dryland to irrigated agriculture; pastoralists in the Move-in area will switch  3
to mixed agriculture and pastoralism. OD 4.20 requires that "Development activities
... support production systems that are well adapted to the needs and environment of
indigenous peoples, and ... help production systems under stress to attain      I
sustainable levels. "88 This is not something that can be imposed. It requires an
open-ended process of extensive consultation with and full participation by the people
concerned.
285.   The form of "consultation" which Management employed essentially treated  |
each of the different ethnic communities in the Move-out area in the same way. In no
case did "consultation" involve bringing people from the same ethnic group together
to help envision a development plan for their own minority group.
286.    Village meetings and surveys provided opportunities to gather specific  3
suggestions from members of different ethnic minorities in the Move-in area. As a
result, some specific modifications and allowances were made within the Project
design for separate residential areas, for example, or local-language teaching in
schools, diverse religious structures, and corridors through the irrigation site for the

nomadic pastoralists. Some of these modifications, however, came very late in the
planning cycle, long after the resettlement-and-irrigation strategy and locations had
I           been decided. They occurred after Management had decided that the different ethnic
groups, many speaking unrelated languages, would be lumped together for purposes
3           of satisfying OD 4.20's requirements for an Indigenous People's Development Plan.
287.   Bundling these groups together in a single IPDP, whether that is the "project
I           in its entirety," or a single IPDP for the whole of the Move-in area, effectively denies
these very different ethnic groups, especially the numerically weakest and most
I           vulnerable, an opportunity to participate in a process that would ensure that their
minority cultural traditions are taken into account in the overall design of the Project.
No number of add-on indigenous-culture-boosting activities (bilingual schools, Islamic
I           religious sites, Tibetan pharmacological centers, corridors for nomadic herders) can
override the fact that the initial Project design is flawed by this failure to recognize,
3           from the outset, the cultural uniqueness of the separate ethnic minorities involved.
288.   During its visit to the Move-in area, the Team raised the question of separate
I           plans with some of the people it met, especially the Tibetans and Mongols. None
was aware of the fact that Bank policy allowed for their participation in the design of
separate IPDPs to ensure that they did not suffer adverse effects from the Project
and, indeed, that they received  "...culturally compatible social and economic
benefits." 189 When asked if they would like to have participated in such a process,
I           and if they thought other members of their ethnic minority would have cooperated, the
answer was almost invariably "yes."
1           289.  In one village, Tibetan residents felt strongly that it would have been a good
idea to bring Tibetans together to discuss the Project. They stated that following
1           1987, the year when their village was populated by mostly Han and Hue farmers
moving from Haidong prefecture, Tibetan pastoralists who formerly used the land
were scattered into mountainous areas so they are no longer present in the nearby
region.190 They expressed regret that their children were no longer learning Tibetan
in this now largely Han-speaking village, and said they hoped that the larger number
189 This adds a somewhat different perspective to Management's assertion that: "The Project design
reflects the Mongol herders' preferences for mitigation and compensation measures. The Project
allows households to establish permanent housing and to gain access to desired services, while some
family members continue seasonal migration patterns. This reflects a semi-nomadic lifestyle
increasingly common in Qinghai and other pastoralist areas of Central Asia. See Management
Response, supra note 12, at p. 8.
190 They provided the Panel with a rough estimate of 200 Tibetan pastoralists from this one village who
had to move to other pastureland as a result of the Han and Hui settlerrent.

of Tibetans among settlers from Haidong might help revive the Tibetan language
because bilingual schools were part of the project. (They were unaware that many
Tibetans in the Move-out areas also no longer speak Tibetan.) Nevertheless, some

Figure 23. Inspection Team visiting Mongolian-language school at DulanI
opposed the Project on the grounds that they considered this land still "Tibetan and  i
Mongol" land. By contrast, Hui farmers in the same village told the Panel that they
did not feel it was necessary to have a plan for Hui that was separate from the plan
for the Han farmers with whom they now live in the village.
290.    In another instance involving a large nomadic Mongol family, the Team     3
asked various family members whether they would liked to have had separate
meetings among Mongols to develop plans specifically for their own ethnic group.
They thought this would have been a very good idea, and volunteered several
improvements that they would have suggested. First, they insisted that not every part
of the Project needed to be designed for particular ethnic groups, giving clinics and  3
hospitals as examples of something that people of all ethnic groups could freely
share. But they especially wanted Mongol schools, and mentioned that their religious
practices were close to those of Tibetans but very different from those of most
settlers. Interestingly, they said it would have been very good if they could just get a
little farmland somewhere, not even in the same place where they were now, and still  |
have some good pasture for their herds.

revealed that some components of this Project (such as Tibetan pharmacological
centers or other indigenous health-care providers), which were added retroctively
following the April, 1999 outbreak of public concern, might not be the same ones
considered highest priority by local people. Though added later as local-culture-
1      ~~enhancing components, they may not have been the ones local people would have
suggested if given the opportunity. The Mongol herders' remarks about wanting
some farmland somewhere, along with some good pastureland, seem to contrast with
the stark choice that the Project had offered them: either get arid pastureland
elsewhere or take the irrigated farm plot at a ratio of 1 to 1 1.4 equivalency. Politely,
I      ~~deferentially, and in response to a direct question abouJt developing a separate
Mongol IPDP, these pastoralists seemed to ask whether they might instead get some
combination of winter-pasturage and irrigated farmland. Of course, summer pasture
I     ~~range is still open to all; but winter pasturage is in short supply. Perhaps this option
(not offered in Project documents) would have allowed them to more easily maintain
3      ~~their nomadic pastoral life with a buffer of agriculture, rather than face the stark
choice between being a full-time Project farmer or a full-time pastoralist.  The

purpose of developing self-standing IPDPs for each ethnic group, as envisioned in
OD 4.20, is precisely to carefully and methodically elicit, record, and assess these
kinds of statements, which the Inspection Team received within the first hour of its   I
visit to the site of the proposed irrigation-works.
292.    These remarks were recorded within the "project area," as defined by
Management. As noted earlier, the Panel feels that the boundaries of the Project
area were so narrowly defined that many affected people and communities were left      I
out of the Assessments. When the Inspection Team visited project-affected towns
near Xiangride, and Tibetan villages along the proposed supply-canal for the project,  |
all left out of the "project area" as defined by Management, it received a similarly
positive response to self-standing IPDPs for each of the ethnic groups. Although the
Panel's visit was short, it is satisfied that some, if not all, of the ethnic minorities in the  I
Move-in area would welcome the opportunity to participate in the development of
separate IPDPs.
293.    The Panel finds that a serious attempt to prepare separate, free-
standing IPDPs for each of the national minorities in the Move-out area is             I
required to bring the Project in to compliance with OD 4.20.191
10.5  Process Compliance                                                               I
294.   OD 4.20 does more than describe the Bank policies concerning indigenous         |
peoples. It also stipulates the process and procedures to be followed in developing
an IPDP within the context of the Banks "project cycle," identification, preparation,
appraisal, negotiations, and presentation to the Board.192  It does this in four short
paragraphs, three of which apply to the Qinghai Project at its current stage of
development; paragraph 16 on identification, paragraph 17 on preparation, and          I
paragraph 18 on appraisal.
10.5.1  Identification                                                                  I
295.   This is the first stage of the Bank's "project cycle," during which projects are  |
identified that "have a high priority, that appear suitable for Bank support, and that the
191 These separate, self-standing IPDPs should at least attempt to support existing production systems  I
that are under stress, since those production systems are often integral to the cultures of the minorities
who are most vulnerable in the development process. See OD 4.20, supra note 39, at paragraph 14
9. It also covers implementation, supervision and evaluation, although the Qinghai Project has not
reached that stage.

Bank, the government, and the borrower are interested in considering."193 If such a
project involves indigenous peoples, the OD  insists upon early and extensive
*           investigations into their numbers, location and status. Paragraph 16 is quite clear on
this. It states in part that "During project identification, the borrower should be
3           informed of the Bank's policy for indigenous peoples. The approximate number of
potentially affected people and their location should be determined and shown on
maps of the project area. The legal status of any affected groups should also be
discussed.... "
296.   The same paragraph requires that Task Team Leaders " ... should also initiate
anthropological studies necessary to identify local needs and preferences..." and
that, in consultation with the REDs, Task Team Leaders ". should signal indigenous
I           peoples issues and the overall project strategy in the Initial Executive Project
Summary (IEPS)." This refers to the "Initial Executive Project Summary." It was later
superseded by the "Project Concept Document" (PCD), which is prepared for review
at the PCD Meeting.194
5           297.     During November and  December of 1997, the Task Team  member
responsible for social assessment reviewed the socio-economic data then available.
Prior to the February Technical Mission, the Task Team  Leader provided him with
Terms of References which called upon him to review the "design framework for the
irrigation component in Qinghai." In doing so, he was to "review the status of the
Social Assessment of the proposed project, including the beneficiary assessment and
the role of beneficiaries in project preparation particularly, the minority nationalities.
a           (OD 4.20)." '95
298.   As noted earlier in Chapter 7, the Project Concept Document Meeting is a
3           key decision point in the evolution of a Bank project. It is the first time that the project
is looked at as a whole and in some detail by a group beyond the project team,
including managers. The Project Concept Document was sent out for comment on
I           March 25, 1998. It states that, "The leading social issue for the (Western Poverty
Reduction) project is the voluntary resettlement of 100,000 poor people in central
193 See WARREN C. BAUM, The Project Cycle, Washington DC: IBRD, 9t" Ed. (1996).
194 The designation of documents that must be prepared by the time of the IEPS (=PCD) is also
referenced in Annex D par. 1 of OD 4.01 on Environmental Assessments. The change from IEPS to
~PCD format was codified in a memorandum (Subject: "Simplified Project documentation," dated 31
July 1997) from Director, Operations Policy and Strategy, to: "Staff Recipients of the Operational
Manual." Projects for which processing had already begun before August 1 could continue under the
old documentation. Nevertheless, the OD's requirements for the IEPS are (since 1997) requirements

Qinghai, comprising diverse nationalities including Han and minority nationalities
comprising Mongolian, Tibetan, Hui and Sala." 196 And it instructed "The project
preparation teams ... pay particular attention to the diverse minority populations and    I
religious groups." The document stresses that the project must comply with the
Bank's Indigenous Peoples policy. The Project Preparation Plan states that field          |
surveys and interviews will be carried out by "sociologists fluent in local dialects."
The Plan output would be reviewed by Management in September, 1998.                       I
299.   The PCD is not clear on whether the preparation was to include minorities in
the Move-in area. It appears not because it states that, "involuntary resettlement        |
does not appear to be a significant issue, although the possibility cannot be ruled
out..." Perhaps for this reason, there is no indication of the "... approximate number
of potentially affected people..." no indication of their location "...on maps of the     I
project area, " and no discussion of the "... legal status of any affected groups.... " This
required work had not been undertaken.197
300.   On April 6, 1999, an EASSD social scientist was asked to review the PCD
but, in the event, did not present any written comments. The Legal Department's
member of the Task Team did comment, however. In a note to Management, Legal
warned that the PCD refers to the existence of national minorities affected by the
project and stressed the need for compliance with OD 4.20 on Indigenous Peoples. It
pointed to three options for achieving this: (1) through the design of the Project, or (2)
through the Voluntary and Involuntary Resettlement Plans, or (3) through a separate       I
Plan. The result would need to be reviewed by EASSD  and LEGEA.198  Her
comments were distributed widely as an attachment to the Agenda for the PCD               I
meeting .199 
301.   The PCD Meeting was held on April 14, 1999, about 15 months after project          3
preparation began on the Bank side. Chaired by the Director, RMC, it was attended
by 12 people, including the Task Team Leader and the Legal Counsel. Although the          X

197 The Bank's rules call for each project to have a Project Information Document (PID) made available
at the Bank's Public Information Center at the Project Concept Document stage. The PID for the
Western Poverty Reduction Project is dated March 25, 1998. As is required, it is very short (six
pages). It makes one reference to "minorities" or "minority nationalities", saying in passing that China's  I
current "absolute poor" comprise "largely minority nationalities". It makes no mention of any minorities
(including Tibetans) in the Project. Rather, the beneficiaries are defined only in terms of their poverty
and precarious future in the absence of the project.                                      I

10.5.2 Preparation
302.   After a project has been incorporated in the Bank's program, it enters the
preparation phase and an extensive period of close collaboration between the Bank
I           and the eventual borrower begins. "Formal responsibility for preparation rests with
the borrower. ... But experience has shown that the Bank must have an active role ...
making sure that borrowers with the capacity and resources to prepare projects
themselves understand the Bank's requirements and standards... "200
|1          303.   If indigenous peoples are involved, OD 4.20 is clear about what needs to be
done during the preparation phase. It states that, "If it is agreed in the IEPS (or PCD)
meeting that special action is needed, the indigenous peoples development plan or
project component should be developed during project preparation  Q∞'  As
mentioned above, however, the PCD meeting minutes record no "special action" nor
discussion of the three possible approaches to indigenous peoples suggested by
ILegal Counsel.
1           304.   Given a perceived need to act, both paragraphs 16 and 17 set out the types
of preparation needed. Paragraph 17 says that, "As necessary, the Bank should
3           assist the borrower in preparing terms of reference and should provide specialized
technical assistance (see para. 12).202 Early involvement of anthropologists and local
NGOs with expertise in matters related to indigenous peoples is a useful way to
identify   mechanisms  for  effective  participation   and  local  development
opportunities."203  The Task Team  included an anthropologist on the staff of the
I           Resident Mission China, though he did not benefit from the support of a designated
"peer reviewer."  Indeed, unlike the environmental aspects, a peer reviewer was
never appointed for the social aspects.
200 See WARREN BAUM, supra note 193.
201 See OD 4.20, supra note 39, at ß 17.
202 The paragraph 12 of the OD 4.20 states: "Technical assistance to develop the borrower's abilities to
address issues on indigenous peoples can be provided by the Bank. 7echnical assistance is normally
given within the context of project preparation, but technical assistance may also be needed to
I           strengthen the relevant govemment institutions or to support development initiatives taken by
indigenous people themselves. " See OD 4.20, supra note 39 at paragraph 12.
203 Paragraph 17 of OD 4.20 concludes: "In a project that involves the land rights of indigenous
I           peoples, the Bank should work with the borrower to clarify the steps needed for putting land tenure on
a regular footing as early as possible, since land disputes frequently lead to delays in executing
measures that are contingent on proper land titles... " See OD 4.20 supra note 39 at paragraph 17.

305.   On May 11, 1998, the Task Team Leader (TTL) distributed the Terms of
Reference (TOR) for each member of the forthcoming "Preparation Assistance
Mission". The TOR for the anthropologist called on him to "... focus on the scope of
the assessments to ensure that the issues related to gender, participation and     3
minority nationalities are fully addressed." He was also to: "i) assess the extent of
stakeholder participation in preparation...; ii) ensure that the social assessments
reflect the expectations, aspirations and concerns of the target project participants  I
and minority nationalities in particular; and iii) ensure that the social assessments
include mitigating measures against potential adverse outcomes of the project on
minority nationalities." Again, it is not clear whether the required "focus" was limited
to minorities in the Move-out area. The TOR did go on to state, however, that,
together with the resettlement specialist on the mission, he was to "review the    I
preparation being made in the move-out areas with particular focus on minority
nationality issues."204                                                            |
306.   Although EASSD did not provide written comments before the PCD meeting,
following the meeting the Task Team  Leader requested comments from a senior
expert in the EASSD Unit most familiar with Indigenous Peoples' issues, who had
worked in Qinghai on one occasion in an earlier career. In a note entitled "The issue
of OD 4.20 [Indigenous Peoples! and its kid leather glove treatment in China," she
highlighted two main issues.205 "Since this is a poverty alleviation project, " she said, "
with highly specific targeted interventions, it could be argued... that the entire project |
will be beneficial to the ethnic minority nationality peoples. The wrinkle in here is that
the Han are in many of the poorest villages in Qinghai and minorities in a Tibetan
area. In this case these populations are formed of people displaced during the
cultural revolution and sent to rehabilitate themselves or to form part of forced labor
gangs. These deserve special attention. In addition, of course, the issue of culturally  |
appropriate interventions is critical to define in a Tibetan context." (Emphasis added.)
307.   "The issue of "voluntary" resettlement," she went on, " has a long story
behind it in Qinghai already. I would recommend that the history of the policy of
"voluntary" resettlement be looked into and to proceed with more than usual caution  |
on this because there are different dimensions that have strong Political ramifications.
(Emphasis added.) I seem to recall that many of the people are not willing to move
out of the area in spite of the desperate need for income improvement. In this region,
the whole issue of community-managed grazing rights is intrinsic to their way of life

and this dimension has to be examined together with the entire resettlement
3          package."
308.   Then, she added: "The preparation process for this project should strive to
3           carefully document the following: The nature of the socio-cultural analyses as well as
the economic analysis of households and communities; the specific ways in which
these analyses contribute to the project's design and to the definition of culturally
appropriate strateqies for different populations and ethnic groups; (emphasis added)
the kind, manner and extent of the information, consultation, and participation
3          process as it evolves during the course of project preparation. If these areas are all
carefully documented and integrated into the desiqn of the proiect, there should in
principle be no Problem or cquestion of compliance with OD 4.20. '206 (Emphasis
added.)
a-         309.    The mention of "Tibetan" in the first paragraph quoted is the first time in
Project documents, one and a half years after the Project entered the Bank's
portfolio, that attention is drawn to sensitivities in this area, though the note does not
I           make clear what the sensitivities are. And mention of "Tibetan" is preceded by
mention of the plight of the Han Chinese in the region, who find themselves to be
"minorities in a Tibetan area" and therefore deserving of "special attention." Similarly,
the memo urged caution on "voluntary" resettlement because "there are different
dimensions that have strong political ramifications," but does not indicate what these
political ramifications are and how they might be responded to operationally. Thus,
the Task Team was alerted to a sensitive minority issue which was further considered
in the Social Assessment. But, as discussed more fully below, there is no record that
Management addressed these specific concerns.
1           310.   A 13-member Project Preparation Mission visited Qinghai in late May (May
24-30). The Mission's Aide Memoire refers to minorities generally and identifies the
existence of Tibetans in the Move-in area. It criticizes the fact that the draft voluntary
settlement plan and other documents don't mention the fact that local Mongolian and
Tibetan herdsmen in the Move-in area have legal use rights to grassland, and the fact
|          that no plan has been prepared to deal with their potential loss. "Because the impact
on the native herdsmen is a critical social issue for the project," it states, "it is urgently
required that the PMO cooperate with local authorities [to] conduct [a] comprehensive
investigation of the herdsmen's realistic situation, including accurate census of
people to be affected, their grassland to be requisitioned, and their willingness and

feelings of the change; and make a detailed plan for acceptable arrangement of the
herdsmen with their consultation. ,,207 The Aide Memoire goes on to propose that the
herdsmen in the Balong part of the Move-in area be treated as "target beneficiaries,"     I
claiming that this is in line with OD 4.20. It is interesting to note that at this stage,
some eighteen months after the Project entered the Bank's portfolio, Management           I
still views the herdsmen whose grasslands "are to be requisitioned" as beneficiaries
rather than as adversely affected people.                                                 I
311.   The next paragraph comments on "The attitude of the move-in area towards
new comers." It states that "The local government officials and herders welcome the
78, 000 project target people come to the Balong area. This point is a key point of the
project." The quality  of the  consultation  process from  which  this statement
presumably derives has been discussed in Chapter 5.
312.    The Aide Memoire also recognized that the "Voluntary Settlement Action            |
Plan" for the Move-out area needed to be further developed to define culturally
appropriate strategies for different populations and ethnic groups. "In view of the
large number of minority nationalities (58.21% of the total population to resettle), this  I
section [of the Voluntary Settlement Action Plan] should be developed as a special
annex of minority nationality/local beneficiary participatory development, combining
the social and economic investigation and the participatory approach above-
mentioned". 208 It also notes that community leaders in seven Move-out counties felt
that " the establishment of the townships in the move-in area should be maintained        3
as [in] the original move-out areas, and adjust them among the natural villages for
instance, the similar nationalities should be arranged in one place or mulit-
nationalities can [be] arranged together." Again, it must be noted, the focus is on
minority settlers from the Move-out area.
313.   Following her comments on May 14, 1998, the EASSD Social Expert heard
nothing more until September, 1998, when she was asked to brief an anthropologist
about to leave on the Pre-Appraisal Mission. She asked the Task Team Leader to
see the Terms of Reference for the Social Assessment and the completed product,

the Preparation Assistance Mission (24-30 May 1998).
208 Id. supra note 207, at p. 17. On this proposal to develop the Voluntary Settlement Action Plan as a
special annex of minority nationality/beneficiary participatory development "combining the social and
economic investigation and the participatory approach", a Bank social scientist knowledgeable with the
situation comments, "There is either a conceptual (honest) confusion, or an attempt to ease a
potentially troublesome situation by mixing the two issues of minorities and participation. The  I
assumption being that if there is 'participation' then the minority issue might just be dealt with
automatically. This is finessing the intention and spirit of OD 4.20.

and asked to be kept informed about the preparation of the Project. 209 She reminded
him that "..... the most problematic and therefore the most critical assessment is the
I           one for Qinghai because of the two safeguard polices you should watch out for: OD
4.20 and OD. 4.30." The Task Team Leader replied almost immediately stating that:
|           'Appraisal is scheduled for first week of January 1999. I plan to issue the PAD
[Project Appraisal Document] and other related docs by end of Nov. The timetable for
the different milestones is tight, allowing the time allowed by Bank Service Standard. !
I           trust that the SA [Social Assessment1 review would not require additional review
time." (Emphasis added) 210
314.   The Pre-Appraisal Mission, involving five members of the staff and seven
consultants, visited Qinghai between October 17-24. The Aide Memoire noted that a
I           pilot voluntary settlement scheme should be implemented. In referring to the revised
"Village Settlement Plan" it is apparent that it included people from both Move-out
and Move-in areas. It "is designed for 61,775 (57,775 from eastern Qinghai's
selected poor counties, move-out counties; and 4000 herders and poor farmers living
in and outside the project area) poor people on 321,600 mu or 21,440 ha in five
I           irrigation sites of the project area."  The Mission considered that the "[Village
Settlement Plan] is well prepared and has benefited immensely from the experience
of Hexi Corridor Project in Gansu."2'1  In his Back-to-Office report on the Pre-
appraisal Mission, the Task Team  Leader says,  "The rmission has achieved its
objectives and the project would be ready for appraisal in January 1999." 212
315.   Shortly afterwards, the Social Unit's Senior Expert informed the Task Team
Leader, Regional Management and Acting Chief of the Social Unit, that she had
reviewed the Social Assessments for two of the three project components. While
acknowledging that the Social Assessment document was of higher quality than
|           others reviewed in the past, she also pointed to areas "that must be clarified and
corrected...  While it is asserted that the assessments are based on extensive
interviews and stakeholder participation," she said, " there are no specific data from
these presented in the text that would permit an examination of the quality of the data
209 Project Files (9 September 1998).
210 Project Files (10 September 1998). During the Panel's investigation, senior staff mentioned on
several occasions that, whatever the rhetoric, the pressures on Task Team Leaders to produce their
projects and sign them off on schedule were such that they simply could not and would not allow the
I           application of safeguard policies to cause delays. Since the officials responsible for safeguards are
often a part of their team, and paid in part from the project's budget, they are not in a strong position to
argue. This expert was not paid from the project's budget.

and the adequacy of the analysis. It would constitute an improvement in the social
assessment if the aggregate data from these interviews (by administrative entity as
well as by ethnic group) could be made available as annexes to the social           I
assessment."213 As for future comments, as this was her last day in the East Asia
Social Development Unit, she added that "The PAD ... will be issued after I have left
... [and] will have to be reviewed and cleared by another member of the EASSD team.
The Social Assessments will be kept in our files."                                 I
10.5.3 Appraisal
316.   As a project takes shape and studies near completion, it is scheduled for
appraisal. This step marks the culmination of the preparatory work.214 It is one of the
most, if not the most, critical milestones in the development of a project. It is during  I
appraisal that Management undertakes a comprehensive review of all aspects of the
project and lays the foundation for implementing it. Management establishes that the
required preparations have been undertaken, that Bank safeguard and other policies
have been properly applied, that the work is of a satisfactory quality, and that the
elements needed for project execution are in place and agreed upon. Appraisal is    I
solely the Bank's responsibility and manifests itself in a decision meeting, a "final"
appraisal, and sign off leading to negotiations.                                    I
317. When a project involves indigenous peoples, or national minorities, OD 4.20
sets out what Management must attend to during Appraisal. Paragraph 18 states       3
clearly that, "The plan for the development component for indigenous peoples should
be submitted to the Bank along with the project's overall feasibility report, prior to
project appraisal." Moreover, it charges Management with assuring the quality of the
plan, stating that, 'Appraisal should assess the adequacy of the plan, the suitability of
policies and legal frameworks, the capabilities of the agencies charged with
implementing the plan, and the adequacy of the allocated technical, financial, and
social resources. Appraisal teams should be satisfied that indigenous people have   |
participated meaningfully in the development of the plan as described in para. 14(a)
(also see para. 15(d).215 It is particularly important to appraise proposals for
regularizing land access and use.

215 The nature of the consultations with, and meaningful participation by, the minorities in both the
Move-in and Move-out areas is discussed in Chapter 5.

318.   The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) was ready in late November, 1998,
and the Decision Meeting [to move forward to appraisal] was scheduled for three
I          weeks after the PAD itself was distributed. The Decision Meeting for the entire
Western Poverty Reduction Project, including the Qinghai component, was held on
f          December 17, 1998. This Decision Meeting is crucial. It is the last step in the Bank's
preparation process at which there is, in principle, flexibility for making more than
marginal changes to the project design.  The environmental, social, and legal
I          clearances should either have been received by this date, or substantive reasons
should have been provided indicating why clearance should be withheld.
319.   Reflecting the approach taken in project preparation, the PAD continues to
treat the 4000 local herders and farmers in the Move-in area as beneficiaries of the
I          Project on the same footing as the nearly 60,000 settlers from the Move-out area. It
categorizes the host population in the Move-in area in three groups: "The largest is
3          the nomadic and sedentary herders of Mongolian and Tibetan ethnic groups... The
second ... is the agricultural community of voluntary migrants in the 1980s, ... The
third one is composed of mainly Han farmers who settled voluntarily. "
320.   The PAD also shows that there were significant differences in the approach
to minorities in the Inner Mongolia and Gansu components of the overall project, as
compared with those in the Qinghai component. In Inner Mongolia, where minority
nationalities account for about 14.5 percent of the total population in project areas,
|          Mongolians form the overwhelming majority of the minority nationalities. Here, "The
SA study ... focused on Mongolian nationality, making special research on the
Mongolian social organization, economic foundation, productive pattems, household
livelihoods, as well as their education in Mongolian, their folk customs and religious
beliefs.... In consultation with and participation of herders/farmers, the SA specifically
I          suggested several farm household development models based on animal husbandry
and grassland rehabilitation, which are particularly designed for minority herders in
X          line with their ways of life." In Gansu, where the percentage of minority nationalities
in the project areas is comparatively lower (5.5 percent), and predominantly Hui in
Zhangjiachuan county, six typical villages from three townships in the county were
selected " to make detailed village investigations and villager consultations, so as to
design appropriate sub-projects to be undertaken compatibly with Hui socio-cultural
context... The SA in Gansu also conducted special village development planning
among Hui villages, to develop models based on their preferences." In Qinghai, in
contrast, the Panel has found no evidence that special research of a similar nature
I          was carried out for any specific minority nationality.
II



l
126        3
321.   Coming to compliance with Bank policies, the PAD states in the required
section that "The project is in compliance with i) OD 4.20 on indigenous people with
the adoption of a Voluntary Settlement Implementation Plan, designed for        X
predominantly minority nationalities in Qinghai based on a detailed Social
Assessment, and for Gansu and Inner Mongolia a project design, which reflects the
concerns of minority nationalities as reported in the Social Assessment; ii) OD 4.30
on involuntary resettlement involving 63 households surrendering their leased land
for reclamation...,2'6                                                          I
322.   Thus, the PAD states that compliance with OD 4.20 is through adoption of  |
the VSIP designed for predominantly national minorities in Qinghai "based on a
detailed Social Assessment."  This suggests that, at this point in time, November,
1998, Management considered that these two documents which deal with indigenous  I
peoples issues, taken together, effectively constituted the required IPDP.
323.   It is also important to note that this was before the Decision Meeting in
December, before the 'final' negotiations in early April, 1999, and before the outbreak
of public concern in late April. As will be seen below, during its post-April review, the  I
PAD, including this key paragraph on compliance, was significantly revised. During
this period, Management also changed its approach to the IPDP, claiming that, not
the above two documents, but the "project as a whole" constituted the required IPDP.
324.   When the Voluntary Settlement Implementation Plan (VSIP) for Qinghai      1
arrived in mid-November, the Senior EASSD Social Expert referred to above was no
longer there. In consequence, the VSIP, including the RAP, were reviewed by a new  I
expert who had just joined the Unit.  Among other things, he queried the
"voluntariness" of the resettlement in Qinghai, given that the Bank's OD 4.30 on
resettlement applies, strictly speaking, only to involuntary resettlement.  Being  U
assured by the Task Team Leader that it was indeed voluntary under the Bank's
definition, he advised the Task Team  Leader that, "Document A [the Voluntary
Settlement Implementation Plan] is satisfactory and I have no comments to make."217
325.    In line with normal practice, the EASSD expert drafted a clearance
memorandum for the EASSD Unit Manager to sign. The memorandum concluded,
"EASSD [East Asia Socially Sustainable Development] is pleased to provide
clearance for the project to proceed to appraisal. However, the project appraisal
cannot be considered complete until the documents (b) and (c) above [the
216 See PAD (1st Version), supra note 41, at p. 42.

Implementation Plans for Land Acquisition and Relevant Compensation, for the other
two provincial components] are endorsed and found satisfactory by the Bank."2'8 It
X          was duly signed, just before the Decision Meeting, and sent by the Sector Manager,
EASSD to the Sector Manager, EASHN.
326.   The Legal Department comments on the PAD were also received the day
before the Decision Meeting. They warned that mention of the prison farm should be
I          limited to purely factual matters. "You might want to explain," the note stated, "why
the existence of a nearby prison farm could be controversial.... Has the Bank team
truly been able to ascertain that the project won't benefit the prison farm in any way?
Or are we relying on confirmations from the local government?"219 The note made no
mention of minority populations or environment.
327.   The Legal Department also prepared the draft Project Agreement between
the Bank and the three Project Provinces (PP), Schedule 2 (B) of which states that
"Each Project Province shall take all measures necessary to ensure that all persons
affected by the Project fully participate in its [design and] (sic) implementation and
I          receive social and economic benefits from its Respective Part of the Project that are
compatible with their cultural preferences. To this end, each Project Province shall
carry out its Respective Part of the Project in accordance with its Respective Local
Beneficiaries Participation Action Plan." This section in the Project Agreement was
also expanded with specifics for the Qinghai project during the post-April 1999
5          review.220
328.   The Decision Meeting took place on December 17, 1998.  Chaired by the
Manager of the East Asia Rural Development Unit, the East Asia Socially Sustainable
Development Unit was again not represented.221 As mentioned in Chapter 7, the
Environment Peer Reviewer felt that all issues but one had been addressed. The
exception was that of potential livestock overstocking. The Sector Manager of the
East Asia Rural Development Unit decided therefore to downgrade the Appraisal
Mission scheduled for January 1999, to a Pre-Appraisal mission. During the course
of the Mission, between January 10-23, it became evident that the livestock issue had
I          been addressed satisfactorily, so the Sector Manager upgraded it to an Appraisal
Mission in the field. This kept the project on track for Board presentation before mid-
1999.

10.5.4  Negotiations                                                                  |
329.   The negotiations began on April 12, in Washington. It seemed that there were
no substantive issues outstanding at that time. The negotiations had been scheduled
to last a working week, but were substantively over in three and a half days. The draft
Agreements were then revised and the Minutes of Negotiations signed by both
sides.222 This then was the Project intended for Board approval.
330.    After the outbreak of external criticism  that focused on the impact of       |
proposed Project on minority nationalities, at least three different approaches to
justifying compliance with OD 4.20 appear in the documents.                           |
331.    The final clearance required before a project is presented to the Bank's
Board of Executive Directors is from the Statutory Committee. Among others, the
Vice-President and General Counsel must sign the Statutory Commiftee report. After
Governmental approval of the negotiated legal agreements was received, Legal
Counsel sent the report on May 17, 1999 to the General Counsel for signature with
an explanatory cover note. It noted that the Project involves indigenous people in all
three provinces for which indigenous people development plans (known as Local I
Beneficiaries  Participation  Action  Plans)  have  been  prepared  and  will be
implemented under the Project (PA, Schedule 2, Part B. 1).                            3
332.   In fact, as noted earlier, separate IPDPs had not been prepared. A few days
later after discussion with the Social Development Unit (SDR) and EASES, the Legal    |
Department and SDR proposed another approach to bring the Project into
compliance with OD 4.20. "This approach would basically be to establish that the
ethnic minorities concerned are beneficiaries of the project, and as such no
indigenous peoples development plan is needed. However, as stipulated under the
OD, the Bank's concerns under those circumstances would have to be addressed by
the project itself, and the provisions of the OD would need to be applied to the project
in its entirety. The question ... to address is whether this is being done under this
project, and if the answer is no, how can this be done. ,223
l
222 Following the negotiations, the Task Team Leader returned to his office in the Middle East and
North Africa region. On his desk was a message from the Tibet Information Network in London, asking
him to ring back. He did. The interview ended with him being informed that an article was planned for  X
Tibet Information Network's newsletter.

333.  As noted, this is the approach that was finally adopted. Following significant
revisions, the statement on compliance for Qinghai in the June 1, 1999 Project
1          Appraisal Document was changed to read the same as it had for Gansu and Inner
Mongolia in the November PAD, i.e.: "The project is in compliance with ... OD 4.20
3          Indigenous People with a project design that reflects the concerns of minority
nationalities as reported in the Social Assessments." On the other hand, the revised
Project Information Document (PID) -- released to the public in June - is inconsistent
*          with that statement in that it repeats the November 28 compliance rationale. It says
the "The Project also addresses the provisions of OD 4.20, Indigenous People by
5          adoption of the VSIP, designed for predominantly minority nationalities in Qinghai,
based on a detailed Social Assessment. "
334.  In an interview with the Panel, a senior Bank expert on indigenous peoples
expressed the opinion that the May 1999 Involuntary Resettlement Plan might serve
as an adequate (albeit absolutely minimum) IPDP. The expert was of the view that a
separate IPDP is required primarily when indigenous peoples are adversely affected.
The Management Response counts the indigenous population of the Move-in area
I          among the Project's "beneficiaries," rather than treating them as adversely affected.
However, the Involuntary Resettlement Plan accepts that the indigenous people in
the Move-in area are adversely impacted by the Project and therefore require
mitigation under the requirements of OD 4.30 as well as an IPDP under the
provisions of OD 4.20. Under these circumstances, the expert felt that the separate
3          "Involuntary Resettlement Plan" might both constitute an acceptable IPDP and fulfill
the requirements of OD 4.20.
I          The Panel's Findings
1          335.   As just noted, Management decided that the "project as a whole" was the
required IPPD during its post-April, 1999 review and revisions. Treating the project as
a whole and, ergo, the project documents as a whole, as the IPDP, has presented the
Panel with somewhat of a dilemma. Even more so when one realizes that the totality
of the project documents grew significantly after April, 1999, and that Management
|          reflected this larger body of documents in its Response to the Request for Inspection.
336.   The steady increase in the totality of documents which pretend to constitute
the IPDP presents some problems in assessing compliance. For example, the
process outlined in paragraphs 16-18 of OD 4.20 implies that IPDPs should be
assessed at time of Appraisal. The same is true of the PAD, VSIP, RAP, etc. In
addition, if it is asserted that all project documentation constitutes the IPDP, then all
l



130
project documentation should be disclosed in order to elicit full public consultation
and proper input into the IPDP itself. There is not, per se, a disclosure requirement of
any kind in OD 4.20 (unlike, for example, the requirement in OD 4.30 that the          I
Resettlement Action Plan be disclosed). However, paragraph 14 (c) of OD 4.20 does
state that local organizations and NGOs, among others, should be involved in the
development of the IPDPs.224 Local organizations, NGOs and other institutions can
hardly provide their expertise and skills for development of an evolving IPDP unless
the documents that constitute that IPDP are disclosed to them. Thus, even without a    I
specific disclosure requirement, there is an implied requirement to make this
information available to relevant institutions if, indeed, all of the documentation    1
together somehow constitutes the required IPDP.
337.   Another problem with retroactively viewing the Project as a whole and, ergo,    I
the totality of project documents, as the IPDP, is that many documents required for
an IPDP, according to OD 4.20, are still not available.  Some simply cannot be         3
prepared at this late stage because they could not benefit from the consultations and
participation required to inform them. Too many of the basic decisions have been
taken. For example, as noted earlier, paragraph 14 sets out the prerequisites of a     I
successful development plan for indigenous peoples. Paragraph 14 (a) says that
"The key step in project design is the preparation of a culturally appropriate         I
development plan based on full consideration of the options preferred by the
indigenous neople affected by the proiect. (Emphasis added.) Obviously, in this
case, the basic structure of the proposed irrigation and development project was        |
decided prior to any public consultation; it was neither based upon, nor did it
adequately  inquire  about let alone  consider, options  preferred  by  minority        I
nationalities. Paragraph 14 (b) calls for studies to be made "... to anticipate adverse
trends likely to be induced by the project and develop the means to avoid or mitigate
harm." As spelled out in Chapter 4, the project area was so narrowly defined that it    I
left out large numbers of settlements and people who would be directly affected by
the Project.  As a result, the assessments failed to address many of the most
significant social and environmental impacts, among them  the effects of induced
development and other trends which could adversely affect minorities in the Move-in
area.                                                                                   I
224 See OD 4.20, supra note 39, at ß 14 (c):"The institutions responsible for government interaction
with indigenous peoples should possess the social, technical, and legal skills needed for carrying out
the proposed development activities. Implementation arrangements should be kept simple. They  9
should normally involve appropriate existing institutions, local organizations, and nongovernment
organizations (NGOs) with expertise in matters relating to indigenous peoples."



3                                                                                 131
338.   Project files also show that the Involuntary Resettlement Plan was produced
in May, 1999, though the data derives primarily from material within a section of the
J          Implementation Plan for Voluntary Settlement. Additional negotiations with the
borrower were also undertaken during this period. A so-called "pre-pilot" phase was
I          added, although the Panel has been unable to find any official reference to "pre-pilot"
phases in its search of Bank procedures. In any event, it is difficult to understand
how the effects of tiny pilot and pre-pilot resettlement populations in an irrigated patch
I          (or patches) can test the potential effects of the full-scale project in several key areas
that should be covered by an adequate IPDP. Two examples of many: the effects of
5          induced development and the effects on nomadic pastoralists.
339.   Finally, the Panel wishes to call special attention to the procedures under
which a new member of the EASSD Unit, with no background in China and no
knowledge of Qinghai, ended up with the responsibility for recommending final
clearance of the social components of the Project. In the Panel's view, this should be
a matter of general concern.225  It is true that the EASSD was in the process of
reorganization and recruitment at the time. Nonetheless, it is asking too much of any
I          expert, regardless of his or her professional competence. And, as in the case of
environmental screening, discussed in Chapter 7, it was unnecessary. The Bank has
several social experts, some with well-earned global reputations in the field of
indigenous peoples, who could have offered advice and assistance, had the
organization been able to take advantage of their presence. Some were brought in
3          after the late April outbreak of public concern, but that was much too late, long after
the clearances required by the OD 4.20 had been given.
1          340. After reviewing the above, the Panel finds that Management's decisions
concerning identification, preparation and appraisal were not in compliance
I          with the process and procedures mandated by paragraphs 16-18 of OD 4.20.
The reasons for this finding are clearly set out above.
10.7 Status of Haixi Autonomous Prefecture
341.   Concern has been expressed about whether the Mongolian and Tibetan
Autonomous status of Haixi prefecture would remain viable after this transfer of non-
I          Mongol and non-Tibetan settlers may reduce indigenous populations to less than
one-quarter of the total population. There is obviously no Bank policy on the status of
1          225 The expert joined the Bank as a consultant on resettlement issues just two months earlier, with a
background in anthropology in Southeast Asia.

sub-national boundaries in any member country. However, the autonomous status of
this Prefecture might be relevant to OD 4.20 because its loss would constitute an
"adverse effect" of the Project on minority nationalities. In this regard, the Request        I
for Inspection raised two issues: (1) "cultural dilution," and whether that should be
considered an adverse impact; and (2) the status of Haixi autonomous prefecture. 226          3
342.   At the sub-prefectural level, the closer one gets to the irrigation site, the
greater the "diluting" effects of the in-migration of settlers from elsewhere, especially
if one focuses on the Tibetan and Mongol populations for whom the autonomous
status of this prefecture was created. In Dulan County (the affected county within the        3
prefecture), Tibetan and Mongol ethnic composition decreases from 36.8% before
settlement to 20.7% after settlement. In the Project townships themselves (including
the Han and Hue-populated irrigated farming areas), Tibetan and Mongol ethnic                 I
composition decreases from 59.5% before the settlement to 10.8% after the
settlement. Finally, at the Project site itself (the current dryland pasturage as well as
the irrigated plots scheduled for upgrading and integration into the Project's irrigation
system), the Mongol population will drastically decrease from 69.9%  to just 4.5%,.
The  small Tibetan  population  at the  Project site  itself will slightly  increase          I
proportionally as a result of the settlement, from 3.5% to 5.8% of the total. From
these figures it is clear that the "diluting" effects of the settlement will be more          |
strongly felt the more closely one gets to the irrigation site itself.
343.  One of the specific adverse effects mentioned in the Request for Inspection             3
was the possible change in the autonomous status of Haixi Prefecture. During an
interview with staff of the National Minorities Institute in Xining, the Inspection Team
asked about the possible loss of autonomous status and were assured that it would
not happen. Specifically, the question was answered by noting that the population of
the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region was now  only 16%  Mongolian but its                    5
autonomous status had not changed. It might be mentioned, however, that Dreyer's
(1997) summary of China's policy toward ethnic minorities notes that territorial              3
226 The Request states "ICT and other experts have concerns as to whether the Mongolian and
Tibetan Autonomous status of Haixi prefecture will remain viable after this Bank-financed population  I
transfer has reduced indigenous populations to less than one quarter of the total population. The
Bank's Summary Paper asserts that it has received a written guarantee from "Qinghai Province" that
the autonomous status of Haixi would not be effected by the significant change in demographics
brought about by the project. According to the ICT, however, this guarantee cannot be relied upon as  I
it was not issued by the proper authority. It is the National People's Congress and State Council who
have the ultimate authority in designating autonomous status. A guarantee from a different political
entity, such as Qinghai Province, would be meaningless. In Dulan County itself Tibetans and Mongols  I
together would be outnumbered by Hui, raising further concerns about the future of Mongol and
Tibetan autonomous status within the county itself." See supra note 3, at pp. 5-6.

adjustments, and adjustments in autonomous status, have historically been made as
China's minorities policies have changed through time. For example, she notes that
I          in 1968 "a portion of Inner Mongolia that contained a large Han majority was
transferred to a contiguous province.  And at least one minority autonomous
I          prefecture in Yunnan was abolished. 227 However, she notes that during the 1 970s, in
a period of liberalized policy toward minorities, China also made territorial
adjustments that were beneficial to minorities: "The portion of the Inner Mongolian
I          Autonomous Region that had been detached during the Cultural Revolution was
returned. An autonomous prefecture that had been abolished during the Cultural
5fi        Revolution was revived, and several new autonomous areas were created. The
autonomous township system, defunct since the Great Leap Forward, was re-
created. A fifty-fifth nationality, the Jinuo, was officially recognized. ,228
344. Among the Project refinements added after negotiations were re-opened with
I          the Government of China, one of the draft Supplemental Letters to the Legal
Agreements addresses this point. Like the other Supplemental Letters, this one
(Annex 6) was signed on December 30, 1999 as a representation related to the
5          making of the loan and credit for this Project. Unlike the other Supplemental Letters,
however, which were signed by representatives of provincial authorities, this Letter
I          was, according to Management, signed by a representative of the national (not
provincial) government. The text reads, in part: "The Borrower hereby represents to
the Association and to the Bank that the implementation of Qinghai's Respective Part
of the Project, including the Qinghai Voluntary Settlement Implementation Plan, will
not affect the status of Qinghai's Haixi Prefecture as a Mongolian and Tibetan
Autonomous Prefecture, and that Haixi Prefecture will continue to maintain this status
even after the Qinghai Settlement Beneficiaries move into the Qinghai Settlement
Area. The Association and the Bank may rely upon this representation in making the
Credit and the Loan for the Project.",229
345. This Supplemental Letter does not state for how long this status will be
maintained after the Bank-financed resettlement takes place and does not address
changes in autonomous status that might result fromi any additional internal
I          population movements indirectly resulting from the Project.
3          346. As provided in paragraph 15 of the Resolution that established the Panel, the
Chairman of the Inspection Panel requested on March 28, 2000 a legal opinion from
227 See J. T. DREYER, supra note 171, at pp. 351-392.

the Vice President and General Counsel on the nature and enforceability of the
representations contained in this Supplemental letter. The General Counsel issued a
legal opinion dated April 19, 2000, where he states that: 'As a legal matter, the  I
Representations constitute a statement by the Borrower of fact or an interpretation of
Chinese law. They confirm that, as a matter of Chinese law, the implementation of
the Project, including population transfers, will not, in and by itself, alter the status of
Haixi Prefecture as a Mongolian and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture.   The
Representations further state that the Bank and Association may rely upon this   I
interpretation of Chinese law in making the Loan and Credit."
347. More Specifically he adds that: "Should the interpretation of Chinese law prove
to have been wrong, the Representations would provide a legal basis for the Bank
and the Association to exercise their respective suspension remedies under the   I
provisions of the applicable General Conditions. Pursuant to these provisions, the
Bank (or Association) may suspend the right of the Borrower to withdraw the Loan (or  3
Credit) proceeds if "a representation made by the Borrower in or pursuant to the
[Loan Agreement] [Development Credit Agreement], or any statement furnished in
connection therewith, and intended to be relied upon by the [Bank] [Association] in  I
making the [Loan][Credit], shall have been incorrect in any material respect." The
Representations were provided as a statement furnished in connection with the Loan  I
Agreement and Development Credit Agreement, and were explicitly intended to be
relied upon by the Bank in making the loan and the Association in making the Credit.
If, as a matter of law, Haixi Prefecture were to lose its status as an autonomous  |
prefecture as a result of the Project, the Representations, which addressed
specifically this status, would have been incorrect in material and significant respect.  I
We are therefore satisfied that the representations provide an adequate basis to
suspend disbursements and cancel unwithdrawn credit and loan proceeds in the
event the Representations prove to have been incorrect in their assessment of the
status of Haixi Prefecture as an autonomous prefecture." He concludes that: "The
Management Response to the Request for Inspection therefore correctly states that '
[T]he Supplemental letters to the Legal Agreements... agreed with the Chinese
authorities introduced a number of refinements to the Project, including:...
[A]ssurances from the Borrower that the administrative status of the Haixi Mongol  3
and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture will remain unchanged [as a result of the
project]." Finally, he notes that "The Representations discussed above are to be
distinguished, however, from a [contractual undertaking] of the Borrower that the  I
status of Haixi Prefecture will not be altered under any circumstances for reasons that
are unrelated to the implementation of the Project. Such a contractual undertaking  |

was neither sought nor obtained. No statement has been made in the Management
Response to the effect that such a commitment has been sought or obtained."

Chapter 1 1
Involuntary Resettlement
349.  "Development projects that displace people involuntarily generally give rise to
severe economic, social, and environmental problems: production systems are
dismantled; productive assets and income sources are lost; people are relocated to
environments where their productive skills may be less applicable and the
competition for resources greater; community structures and social networks are
weakened; kin groups are dispersed; and cultural identity, traditional authority, and
the potential for mutual help are diminished. Involuntary resettlement may cause
severe long-term hardship, impoverishment, and environmental damage unless
appropriate measures are carefully planned and carried out.L230
350.   The Bank's OD 4.30 on Involuntary Resettlement opens with this stark
appreciation of the impact that development projects can have on the people who are
involuntarily displaced by them. Given this, the OD states that the first objective of
the Bank's resettlement policy is "to ensure that the population displaced by a project
receives benefits from it. 231
351.  The OD goes on immediately to add that:  "Involuntary resettlement is an
integral part of project design and should be dealt with from the earliest stages of
project preparation."232 It then spells out a number of policy considerations to be
factored into project design.  The first two of these are that: "(a) Involuntary
resettlement should be avoided or minimized where feasible, exploring all viable
alternative project designs.. .[and] (b) Where displacement is unavoidable,
resettlement plans should be developed. All Involuntary resettlement should be
conceived and executed as development programs, with resettlers provided sufficient
investment resources and opportunities to share in project benefits.233 ...Particular
attention should be paid to the needs of the poorest groups to be resettled. 234
230 See OD 4.30, supra note 59, at ß 2.
231 See OD 4.30, supra note 59, at ß 3.
232 See OD 4.30, supra note 59 at ß 3 and 28.
233 Specifically, subparagraph (b) goes on to state that "Displaced persons should be (i) compensated
for their losses at full replacement cost prior to the actual move; (ii) assisted with the move and
supported during the transition period in the resettlement site; and (iii) assisted in their efforts to



l
137
352.   The Qinghai Project involves two types of resettlement, voluntary and
involuntary, and, in assessing compliance, a clear distinction must be made between
the two, since OD 4.30 only applies to involuntary resettlement. This Chapter begins
with a brief discussion of the "voluntary" vs. "involuntary" nature of the resettlement,
focussing initially on the Move-out area. Turning to the Move-in area, the Chapter
questions whether the number of people identified by Management to be involuntarily
resettled is correct. It then examines the adequacy of the compensation offered to  I
those who were identified and discussed the content of the Involuntary Resettlement
Plan. It concludes with a discussion of Process Compliance.
11.1   Voluntary and Involuntary Resettlement: Move-out Area                      |
353.  Management contends that the nearly 60,000 migrants from the Move-out
area are "voluntary" resettlers and therefore not covered by OD 4.30.  In
Management's view, OD 4.30 applies only to the 4,000 individuals in the Move-in
area considered to be "involuntarily" affected.  And, in its view, an adequate    I
Involuntary Resettlement Plan has been prepared to cover them. The elements
that now make up this Plan were originally included within the January, 1999
"Voluntary Resettlement Policy Framework and Action Plan" and the April, 1999
"Report on Implementation Plan for Voluntary Migration Resettlement". (VSIP).
Later, however, following the late April outbreak of public concern, those provisions  I
in the VSIP relating to involuntary resettlement were revised and brought together
as a separate annex to the VSIP.
354.  During its discussions with people in the Move-out area, the Team was able to
confirm that they felt they had a choice whether they could move or not, and most
interviewed wanted to move to Haixi Prefecture. When asked to describe the Move-
in area, many described it as fertile with irrigation water, and having schools,
hospitals, electricity, and other improvements. Most were not informed, however, of
the desert climate, poor soils, danger of salinization, and the long start-up time
needed before farms would be functioning in the new irrigation areas. Also, when
asked, most did not recall being offered any other alternative to improve their
condition except for the chance to become a migrant to Haixi. Yet, when pressed on
whether they had the choice of staying or leaving, they agreed they had the choice.
improve their former living standards, income earning capacity, and production levels, or at least to  3
restore them." See OD 4.30, supra note 59, at ß 3.
See OD 4.30, supra note 59, at ß 3.



l
138
355.   It is difficult to say whether the choice was arn informed one in many
instances. In any event, OD 4.30 does not give clear guidance on the quality of full
and informed choice that is needed to consider a resettlement as "voluntary." An
*            English translation of a brochure that had been distributed to farmers describing the
Project includes one 3-point section on "Risks in Resettlement Areas." Its entire text
reads as follows: "1) After moving in, if there is an insufficient supply of fuel, the
I            resettlers might be forced to cut the windbreaks and sand consolidation vegetation in
the surrounding areas. This may lead to soil desertification in the cutting areas; 2) If
farmland shelter belts or windbreaks are not adequately delveloped into a system in a
timely manner or are destroyed, it will cause soil desertification or will result in a
reduction of crop yield in the development area; 3)  The accidental break down of
I            the water supply systems and/or irrigation facilities will result in a reduction in
agricultural, forestry and livestock production, thus affect the incomes of the
resettlers. " The text concludes with the note that "The abovte risks can be avoided by
taking certain engineering or other preventive measures. 235
356.  Most of the farmers interviewed by the Team understood that they could move
back within the first two years. This is important when considering whether the
resettlement is "voluntary." The VSIP, however, appears to raise an obstacle to their
return.  It states that those who do return would have to repay their government
subsidy of 850 yuan, and this might be difficult for a poor migrant. The "Notice to
3            Resettlers" clarifies the VSIP in this regard, however.  It states that these direct
subsidies may be repaid "in cost or in kind."236 If the resettler decides to move back,
the subsidy will be repaid from the added value of the housing constructed in the
Move-in area, which will be distributed to others.237 The Panel is satisfied that it is
possible for a resettler to rescind his decision to resettle within the first two years,
|           with the families of the resettlers continuing to farm  their land during a transition
period. This supports Management's contention that the choice to resettle from the
235 QINGHAI PROVINCIAL PMO, undated, "Notice to Resettlers (Guide for Resettlement Applicants)", at
Section 9, Risks in Resettlement Areas.
236 It provides: 850 yuan per person, including 240 yuan relocation fee, 500 yuan house construction
fee, and 110 yuan fuel fee. These are in addition to the health check-up and subsidies for food and
accommodation during the move; including first-year production costs for seeds, fertilizers and
agrochemicals as well as exemption from the Land Contracting Fee in the first two years, and some
agricultural taxes.
I              See QINGHAI PROVINCIAL PMO, supra note 235, at Section 10, point 12: "In case the resettlers
decide to move back to their original homes due to certain reasons such as their being unable to adapt
to the living or production conditions in the move-in area, the govemment will not impose any form of
penalty or punishment. All the expenses incurred from moving back will be bome by the resettlers
themselves. The govemment resettlement subsidies for those people shall be repaid from their
valuated housing properties in the move-in area, and redistributed to other settlers.

Move-out area is a voluntary one.238  Thus, the Panel accepts Management's view
that OD 4.30 does not apply to the migrants from the Move-out area. 3
11.2 Size of the Involuntarily Resettled Population: Move-in Area
357.   OD 4.30 applies to those people adversely affected by the Project either
because of their physical displacement from  their habitat or place of work or                I
business, or because their livelihood is adversely affected by the Project in the event
that they are not being physically displaced. It includes affected people with legal 3
rights, under domestic law, to the asset being taken and/or affected by the Project, as
well as those having only physical possession  of such  assets.   This applies
regardless of the fact that such possession is deemed to be illegal under the pertinent       I
domestic legislation.239
358.  In Chapter 4, the Panel found that the boundaries of the 'project area' were far
too narrowly defined by Management, with the result that some people affected by
the Project, including some who belong to minority nationalities, have been left out of       I
the social and environmental assessments of the Project. It seems very likely that
the population of persons who will be displaced by the Project is larger than that
accounted  for in  Project documents.   There  are  several reasons  for this.
359.   According to the Involuntary Resettlement Plan, the population of affected             i
Mongol transhumant pastoralists who will be displaced by the irrigation system
numbers 2,411 persons in 289 herder households.  Based on population figures
recently provided to the Panel, however, it appears that the population of Mongol
238 The Panel would add one caveat, however. During its short visit to the Move-out area it did
stumble upon one case of involuntary resettlement among some families in one Move-out village,
Daheigou, which borders on a local nature reserve. A senior Chinese official informed the Panel that a
high priority had been given to moving the entire village so that the nature reserve could be expanded.
At the same time, some villagers informed the Panel that certain families would have chosen to stay in  
Daheigou rather than move to Haixi, because they did not have adequate labor in the family to begin a
new farm in Haixi. Nevertheless, they decided to move since they could not maintain a viable village
on their own. If this information is correct, the provisions of OD 4.30 should be applied to the
involuntary resettlement from this village.
239 In view of paragraphs 3 (e) 11, 14 (c) and 15 of OD 4.30 the term "displacement" has been
interpreted by the Legal Department and applied in Bank practice to partial loss of assets, loss or
drastic reduction of productive assets or other means of livelihood. Memo from 1. Newport to H. Vergin,  I

herders currently taking their animals twice yearly through the proposed irrigation site
is significantly larger than the 2,411 persons cited above.240
360.  In fact, during the Inspection Team's visit to the Project area, information was
3           provided by Qinghai provincial authorities (not previously available in Project
documents) on the locations of several Mongol villages along the northern periphery
of the proposed irrigation areas (see Map 2). These villages have (according to
I           figures these authorities provided) a total population of 1,827 persons.241   The
Inspection Team also requested and later received additional information on
3           populations of nomadic Mongol pastoralists in other nearby villages, one of which
(Kuxuetu) had been visited by the Inspection Team. Within these villages, "2,396
Mongols out of the 2,576 [total Mongol population] are engaged  in livestock
9           production."242 Many of these villages would be well within seasonal "herding
distance" for pastoralists. These new documents, obtained during a brief visit to the
area, indicate a nearby Mongol pastoralist (or at least livestock-producing) population
of 4,223 persons.
361.  The May 1999 Involuntary Resettlement Plan makes no provision for anyone
being displaced by the construction of the main supply canal for the irrigation system.
This is because a policy framework for potential involuntary resettlement due to civil
works and construction had already been developed and the exact location of the
supply canal had not been determined. This canal involves a 29 km route from the
a           Xiangride river to the Keri Dam  and a further 56 km route from the Dam to the
irrigation site, all shown on Map 2.  It passes through Han, Tibetan, and other
villages. When the Inspection Team  visited these villages, leaders did not know
exactly where it would pass, but wherever it does pass, it can hardly avoid affecting
landholdings or land usufruct rights along the route.
362.   Unfortunately, the Panel was not made aware of the existence of the
Xiaoxiatan Irrigation Sub-District of the Project, just north of the prison farm, prior to
I           its visit to Qinghai.243 Hence, the Inspection Team did not visit it. The documentation
available to the Panel does not indicate whether or not this Sub-District, whose

supply canal will be linked to and fed by the supply canal that serves the prison farm
(see Map 2), affects any existing residents, farmers or herders.
363.  The Environmental Assessment (EA) did not assess the downstream effects
of damming the Xiangride river and diverting the water to irrigation uses. On the face
of it, this could have major impacts on the seasonal drainage areas northwest of the
Project site, which lead into a wetland used by migratory wildlife and also by many
pastoralists. There is no indication that the effects of this diversion on the nomadic
pastoral economy was taken into account in determining the number of people
affected or the level of compensation offered under the terms of OD 4.30.244 Without
an assessment of the downstream effects of the Project, it would have been difficult
to do so.
364.   This Report cannot substitute for the studies that should have been
undertaken either to determine the proper boundaries of the Project, and hence the
numbers of people affected or displaced, or to assess the full range of effects on
them.  However, it seems that the Project displaces a larger population than
that included in the Involuntary Resettlement Plan, and thus it is not in
compliance with OD 4.30.
11.3 Compensation for the Involuntarily Displaced
365.   Paragraph 4 of OD 4.30 requires the development of a plan that will assist
involuntarily resettled persons with their move, and will provide fair compensation for
their loss (whether they lose the land itself, or the use of the land, or other productive
resources). It states in part that ". . . Displaced persons should be (i) compensated for
their losses at full replacement cost prior to the actual move; (ii) assisted with the
move and supported during the transition period in the resettlement site; and
(iii) assisted in their efforts to improve their former living standards, income earning
capacity, and production levels, or at least to restore them. Particular attention should
be paid to the needs of the poorest groups to be resettled."
366.  Referring to the 63 herder households with leasehold rights in the proposed
irrigation area, the May 1999 Involuntary Resettlement Plan indicates that the herders
244                                                                                    l
See OD 4.30, supra note 59, at ß 3 (e): "Land, housing, infrastructure, and other compensation
should be provided to the adversely affected population, indigenous groups, ethnic minorities, and
pastoralists who may have usufruct or customary rights to the land or other resources taken for the
project. The absence of legal title to land by such groups should not be a bar to compensation."
l



l
142
will lose "... 17% of their contracted pastures and only 2.5% of the available pastures."
Of these two figures, the important one is the 17 percent of their contracted pastures.
Only winter-spring pasture is contracted and, in the life of a nomadic herder, access
to winter-spring pastureland is the overriding constraint on his operation. Summer
pastures are vast in size, including high-altitude slopes. The critical time when food
is scarce and herds must be fed is in winter and early spring.
367.   The method of compensation chosen for the herders who are to be
involuntarily resettled is "land-for-land."  Herders may receive other pastureland in
compensation for the land they lose, or they may receive irrigated land. If they
choose the latter, they receive one hectare of irrigated land for every 11 .4 hectares of
contracted grazing land they now have. The Involuntary Resettlement Plan (point 6)
explains that: "Each member of the affected 63 herder households will be provided a
30-year lease for irrigated land to replace their leased grazing lands, which they can
use for growing either grain or forage crops. The quantity of replacement land is
based on the conservative assumption that irrigated land is 11.4 times more
productive than unimproved and rain-fed pastureland. "7245
368.  This ratio of 1:11.4 is extraordinarily precise, considering that no scientific
basis is given for it, nor is it clear whether the productivity referred to is based on
biomass produced or some other measure. In any case, many factors will determine
relative productivity, including what crop is cultivated in the irrigated land, the quality
of that crop's germ plasm, and the skill of the farmer. Furthermore, the quality and
type of pastureland observed in the Move-in area varies conrsiderably.
369.  Apparently, all of the herders have chosen to accept allocations of irrigated
land, rather than receive compensating pastureland. In the Panel's view, neither
choice seems to offer adequate compensation when considered against the Bank's
policy just noted above.
370.   Concerning  pastureland  (presumably, winter-spring  pastureland), the
Inspection Team was unable to determine exactly what pastureland might have been
offered, or where it would have been located.  Nonetheless, it is difficult to
understand how an offer of equivalent winter-spring pastureland could have been a
viable one. Some 352 persons in 63 herder households stand to lose a part of the
land that is proposed for the irrigation site itself, which is currently leased to them as
winter-spring pasturage. Had the herders in this area accepted the offer of
245 See INVOLUNTARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN, supra note 56, at Point 6.
l
l



l
143
pastureland elsewhere equal to the portion of their land taken over for the irrigation
site, they presumably would still have maintained their rights to that portion of their
land not taken over for the site.246 Since winter-spring pastureland adjacent to the  I
irrigation site is fully allocated, the only equivalent land that herders might have been
offered would probably have been some considerable distance away.  If so,
accepting such land in compensation could have required some of them to split their
herds between two winter-spring grazing grounds. Also, Project documents do not
address the important question of whether still other pastoralists would have to be  I
displaced (and thus also compensated) for these involuntarily resettled pastoralists to
have been offered new winter-spring pasturage elsewhere.                            3
371.  The offer of equivalent winter-spring pastureland elsewhere does not seem in
itself to provide adequate recompense for the nomadic pastoralists with leasehold
rights in this area, and indeed it seems that none has yet chosen it. Instead, all seem
to have chosen the only other option they were given -- that is, to receive a plot of  |
irrigated land. Under the exchange, a herder receives a plot of irrigated land 1/11.4
the size (that is, 8.77% as large as) his formerly contracted grazing land; i.e., his
winter-spring pasture. This is in addition to a house plot, which will be in a village site  I
together with other herders.
372.  Adequate baseline data on pastoralism, including the data on land use and
inheritance that would allow a proper assessment of the compensation offered, are
unfortunately lacking for this Project. OD 4.30 does encourage a careful review of  3
existing land tenure and transfer systems.  Under the heading "Land Tenure,
Acquisition, and Transfer," paragraph 17 states that: "Resettlement plans should
review the main land tenure and transfer systems, including common property and
nontitle-based usufruct systems governed by locally recognized land allocation
mechanisms. The objective is to treat customary and formal rights as equally as     3
possible in devising compensation rules and procedures. The plan should address
the issues raised by the different tenure systems found in a project area, including (a)
the compensation eligibility of land-dependent populations; (b) the valuation
procedures applicable to different tenure types; and (c) the grievance procedures
available for disputes over land acquisition. Plans should contain provisions for
conducting land surveys and regularizing land tenure in the earliest stages of project
development. Planning should also anticipate the approximate time needed to
acquire and transfer land."247
246 In addition, they might have other reasons to stay in the Project area, such as access to locally  3
available products, their family and personal contacts, and other reasons of a similar nature.

373.   Although envisaged by the OD, it appears that this work was not done.
Without the results of this work, it is difficult to assess the adequacy of the
compensation offered, not only for the Panel but also, in the first instance, for
3           Management. Indeed, it is difficult to understand how the OD's policy objectives can
be achieved without this information.  According to objective 3(b), for example,
"Displaced persons should be (iii) assisted in their efforts to improve their former
I           living standards, income eaming capacity, and production levels, or at least restore
them."248 To achieve this, one requires a clear understanding of their "former living
3           standards, income earning capacity, and production levels. "
374.  No studies are cited in the Project documentation to show that a hectare of
irrigated land has 11.4 times greater productivity than "unirnproved" land but, even if
this is accurate as a measure of forage output, several other factors need to be
considered. Management is endorsing the provision of cornpensation for the loss of
one productive system of great antiquity in this region with access to another new
and very different productive system. A simple measure of comparative productive
I           potential from irrigated and unimproved pasture, however, cannot fully compensate
for the changes and losses the pastoralist may incur.
U           375.  Winter-spring and summer pasture, for example, also allowed herders access
to medicinal and other "crops" besides fodder; access to these is reduced when the
3           pastoralist becomes sedentary. This should be factored into the determination of fair
compensation. Though plants of special importance to herders may disappear first,
the environmental degradation of pastureland nearest the Project could have a more
serious impact on their future lives. In fact, this is listed among the "risks" of the
Project mentioned in the Guide for Resettlement Applicants distributed in the Move-
|           out area cited earlier.249  It is also listed by Wu as a common impact of programs that
settle nomadic pastoralists.250 Payment for loss of an important productive resource
currently available to these pastoralists is not included in the compensation package
offered to them.

376.   During its visit to existing irrigation sites, the Team was informed that farmers
must accept a regular reallocation of their holdings of irrigated plots, usually
downwards, to accommodate any increase in population that may have occurred in               I
the interval. If this is the case in this Project, the former pastoralist could lose some
of the farmland after the expiration of his leases from the government. He could thus        3
also lose the traditional rights of inheritance that he might have had if he had
remained a pastoralist. Studies of systems of traditional inheritance in this area (with
their own system of enforcement and sharing among families) do not appear to have            I
been required by the Bank, although the OD calls for it. They should be studied and
if it is found that there is a loss of long-term family security inherent in this switch to  3
sedentary agriculture, that should also be considered in arriving at fair compensation.
377.  Similarly, the existing social organization with its system of "insurance" based       I
on family ties will also be modified, possibly reducing intrafamily support in times of
illness or crisis. Wu's 1998 case study of changing agropastoral systems on the
Qinghai Plateau is particularly insightful here. He notes that one of the most obvious
negative effects of changing from a highly mobile herding system to a semi-sedentary
way of life is the breakdown of social structures which previously served as a form of       I
social security within herding communities.251  This "insurance" system  within the
nomadic pastoral society should be studied and, if it is found that it will be disrupted,
that should also be factored into compensation.
378.   There are other factors to be considered as well. Dryland pastoralists, for           3
example, may get less water per hectare, but the water is free. Even though (like
other resettlers) irrigated plot-holders may receive irrigation water free in the first 2
years, they will later be charged for the water; this added cost is not calculated in the
1:11.4 land-for-land compensation formula offered.
379.   No information is given on taxation of the land currently used by pastoralists.
It may be effectively untaxed. The irrigated plot, however, is subject to taxation. The
251 Wu's discussion hints at other forms of cultural loss that can also ensue, which would be difficult to
set a price upon for compensation. For example: "Government thinking is perhaps that it can help  |
secure food and water supplies for pastoralists through settlement in order to improve the output of
pastoral products. However, this oversimplifies the diversity of the real situation and undoubtedly
neglects some of the diversity in pastoral societies. A nomadic economy requires different strategies
for short-term productivity and longer-term insurance. Moreover, pastoralists also use their animals to  I
acquire prestige and influence in their societies and for other purposes. All of these are not strictly
justifiable on economic grounds alone. A nomadic society works as an entirety in response to
changes in the environment and the availability of resources. Every attempt in which only part of a  2
system is changed will lead to an imbalance in the whole system." See Wu NING, supra note 250, at
p. 125.

lease is for 30 years, and is exempt from taxes only in the first 3 years. This may be
a new cost to the pastoralists who receive the plots and the Panel found no evidence
that this has been taken into account in determining the compensation package.
1          380.  Unlike the resettlers from the Move-out area, who mnay return to their homes
within the first two years, the pastoralists who join the Project will no longer have
homes to which they can return, should they change their minds. Perhaps they too
should be given a similar option or be compensated for the lack of it.

U          381.  Finally, at the time of the Team's visit to the irrigation site, many questions
remained unanswered about the corridors planned to allow the pastoralists to pass
3          their herds through the irrigation site on their twice yearly transhumant migrations
between winter-spring and summer-autumn pastures. Note that all 63 herder
households having leasehold rights in the Project's irrigation area, as well as the 248
herder households who pass through the area twice yearly, have been offered
irrigated plots. If pastoralists try to maintain a herding "option" for some security
|          against a breakdown of the irrigation system, or a bad year on the irrigated plot, a
properly functioning system of corridors through which herds can pass will be
essential. The adequacy of this key component of the compensation package had
not been thought through at the time of the Inspection Team's visit to Qinghai and
252~~~~~~~~~~~~~~5
cannot be assessed from Project documents.25

382.  Admittedly, nomadic groups in this region have never been fully self-sufficient,
and have always depended upon sedentary agricultural groups and on trade. The     I
Management Response notes that this transformation continues a trend in which
pastoralists have become settled agriculturists. Wu's study of pastoralism on the  3
Qinghai Plateau emphasizes that this trend is not purely spontaneous, but is largely
the result of centrally planned development strategies. He states that: "For some
decades, highland development strategies in China were not related to the motives  I
and aims of the pastoralists. Interventions focussed on modemising or fundamentally
transforming the pastoral way of life. Individual pastoralists have sought to cope with  3
pressures of intervention by such adaptive mechanisms as labour migration, increase
in herd size, diversification of pastoral production, and the pursuit of education [ . .. 
The present crisis derives from unsustainable 'modernisation' such as the pressure  3
to absorb pastoralists into the non-pastoral economy (settlement programmes, wage
policies favouring migrant labour, forced commercialisation, a relative drop in the  3
value of pastoral products) and measures that directly deprive pastoralists of their
former share in economic and political life (the expansion of farming, restocking
programmes, and the destruction of traditional systems of land tenure). The result of  I
these powerful forces is that pastoralism is increasingly being relegated to people too
old to change, lacking the skills needed to leave, or too far away from centres of
power for anyone yet to care. " 253
383.   In any event, the presence or absence of the trend mentioned by            |
Management, and the disputed causes of it, are hardly relevant from the perspective
of OD  4.30, since these nomadic pastoralists are not yet in fact settled         3
agriculturalists. It is their current productive system and resource-use that are being
displaced by the Project and that is what must be compensated.
11.4 Contents of the Involuntary Resettlement Plan                                3
384.  Under the heading of "Plan Content," OD 4.30 sets out the topics that "should
normally" be covered in an involuntary resettlement plan. Paragraph 5 states that:
'The content and level of detail of resettlement plans, which will vary with
circumstances, especially the magnitude of resettlement, should normally include a
statement of objectives and policies, an executive summary, and provision for the
following: (a) organizational responsibilities (para. 6); (b) community participation and
253 See Wu NING, supra note 251, at p.120.

148
integration with host populations (paras. 7-10); (c) socioeconomic survey (para. I 1);
(d) legal framework (para. 12); (e) alternative sites and selection (para. 13); (f)
valuation of and compensation for lost assets (paras. 14-16); (g) land tenure,
acquisition, and transfer (para. 17); (h) access to training, employment, and credit
(para. 18); (i) shelter, infrastructure, and social services (para. 19); () environmental
protection and management (para. 20); and (k) implementation schedule, monitoring,
and evaluation (paras. 21-22)." Paragraph 5 concludes that: "Cost estimates should
be prepared for these activities, and they should be budgeted and scheduled in
coordination with the physical works of the main investment project. ,254
385.  The brief 7-page May 1999 "Involuntary Resettlement Plan" does not address
points (a), (c), (e), (h), or (j) at all; and, as may be expected in a document of this
size, it provides only a very cursory review of all other points. Yet, the ODs preceding
paragraph 4 states that: "Where large-scale population displacement is unavoidable,
a detailed resettlement plan, timetable, and budget is required. ,255
386.   The 7-page  "Involuntary  Resettlement Plan" is presented  to fulfill this
requirement. As noted earlier, some of the elements that now make up this Plan
were originally included within earlier versions of the Voluntary Settlement
Implementation Plan (VSIP). Later, following the late April, 1999 outbreak of public
concern, those provisions in the VSIP relating to involuntary resettlement were
revised and brought together as a separate document.
387.  This 7-page document does not include a budget or a timetable. The absence
of a timetable may well be reasonable given the nature of the process. The Plan
argues understandably that the Voluntary Settlement Implementation Plan will
essentially determine the pace at which the involuntary resettlement plan
proceeds.256
254 See OD 4.30, supra note 59, at ß 5.
I            255 See OD 4.30, supra note 59, at ß 4.
256 Specifically, it states that "The Qinghai VSIP is highly complex and calls for detailed planning and
phasing of a multitude of activities. [...] The technical and logistical complexities of the VSIP will be
tested through a small pilot program to settle about 200 families in one village. The pilot program
JI... [will] not intefere with current land use patterns of the herders or farmers living in the area, nor will it
result in loss of their shelter, productive assets or access to pastures. Irrigation will be through use of
ground water and [...] pumps [ ... ] to avoid [ .. ] developing major irrigation works during the pilot phase.
_.[ ] Because no resettlement-related activities are to be undertaken until pilot program results are
evaluated, it is impossible at present to provide a timetable." See INVOLUNTARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN,

388.  OD 4.30 suggests that much greater attention should have been paid to
community participation, even if the population to be involuntarily resettled were not
mostly minority nationalities.257  It also calls for baseline data on the social and
cultural institutions of the resettlers and their new hosts.258 It might be noted that the
documentation required to develop an IPDP, as required by OD 4.20 (and cross-     3
referenced with OD 4.30), would have also involved much greater public consultation
with the Mongol and other herders.
11.5 Process Compliance
389.   OD 4.30 not only describes the policies to be followed in dealing with
involuntary resettlement. It also stipulates the process and procedures to be followed
in developing an involuntary resettlement plan within the context of the Bank's project  I
cycle: identification, preparation, appraisal, negotiations and presentation to the
Board.
390.  This section of OD 4.30 begins at paragraph 27, which states that "the
Regional Vice President should be kept informed of major resettlement issues and
his guidance sought where necessary. The Regional Environment Division, the Legal
Department, and settlement specialists in Sector Policy and Research should be    3
consulted or included as necessary in peer reviews on involuntary resettlement
issues throughout the project cycle."                                             1
11.5.1 Post-Project Identification Stage
391.  Prior to the Technical Mission of February, 1998, the Task Team Leader
asked the resettlement specialist to review the status of the Social Assessment being
conducted. He was also asked to review the "design framework for the irrigation   |
component in Qinghai.. .[and to] provide guidance to the Qinghai RAP preparation
team." And he was asked to "... ensure that the RAP will comply with the Bank's
guidelines...'259
392.  Subsequently, the March 1998 Project Concept Document (PCD) mentioned       |
that "involuntary resettlement does not appear to be a significant issue, although the
possibility cannot be ruled out until final alignments for rural roads, pipelines and
power lines, and location of rural enterprises have been established. There may be

however, a potential issue of compensation for loss of grazing rights, particularly with
respect to the irrigation area and the Keri reservoir site in Qinghai. A report would be
prepared on this issue.260 OD 4.30 is not ticked off as policy to be complied with in
the compliance section (E-8).
393.   Commenting on the PCD, the Legal Department raised the possibility that
there might also be some involuntary resettlement of the host population in Dulan
County because sites would have to be prepared for the incoming settlers. It asked
for this to be clarified and then advised on the two possible approaches in OD 4.30
for dealing with involuntary resettlement: (a) if a sector approach is adopted, a
resettlement framework laying out the principles and procedures to be applied when
developing a RAP for a given subproject would need to be developed before
appraisal, and reviewed by EASSD  and LEGEA; (b) if a standard investment
approach is adopted, the full RAP for the entire operation will need to be prepared
before appraisal. The PCD minutes do not record discussion of these issues. 261
11.5.2 Preparation
394.   Paragraph 29 of OD 4.30 requires that during project preparation "the
feasibility of resettlement must be established, a strategy agreed upon, the
resettlement plan drafted and budget estimates prepared. The full costs of the
resettlement should be identified and included in the total cost of the main investment
project, regardless of financing source.... "
395.   In  May  1998, the  Preparation  Assistance  Mission  recognized  that
compensation for loss of land by Mongolian and Tibetan herdsmen in the Move-in
area was not addressed in the "Voluntary Settlement Action Plan." It called for a
detailed plan and an acceptable arrangement to be made in consultation with the
herdsmen. At the same time, however, Project documents state that they are to be
treated as " target beneficiaries" of the Project because they would be resettled in a
village.262
260 See Project Concept Document, supra note 193, at p.14. The PCD goes on to add that "Detailed
I           land acquisition plans would be prepared by the PPs, setting out in each case the quantity and quality
of the land, the number of villages and people affected, the compensation methods and
implementation procedures. In order to minimize the adverse effects caused by land acquisition, a
26monitoring mechanism and consultation with the affected people would be established."

396.   In November, 1998, at the Pre-Appraisal Stage, the Bank and borrower
agreed there should be a pilot for the voluntary resettlement. A detailed plan was
prepared for about 200 migrants to be implemented immediately after Appraisal,
scheduled for January 1999. 263 The East Asia Social Unit, (EASSD) felt, however,
that this timing might be premature. 264 Shortly after, as noted earlier, and prior to the
December, 1998 Decision Meeting, a new member of the EASSD staff, having been
told that all resettlement was voluntary, found the Voluntary Resettlement Plan for
Qinghai adequate for Appraisal. He did not review the PAD or SA.
397.  It should here be noted that OD 4.30 cross-references with OD 4.20 on
Indigenous Peoples and vice-versa, so the two Directives are formally linked.265
These cross-references indicate that a review of compliance for either OD requires a
review of compliance with the other, at least in any project that involves both
involuntary resettlement and indigenous people, as the Qinghai Project does. This
formal linkage between the ODs was apparently not recognized by the Social Expert
charged with assessing the Project's compliance with OD 4.30 prior to the Decision
Meeting in December 1998. Only resettlement issues were addressed in this review
in November 1998. Yet, this cross-reference indicates that the IPDP required by OD
4.20 should have also been reviewed, at least for purposes of assessing the
adequacy of proposed compensation. Of course, a self-standing IPDP did not exist.
11.5.3 Appraisal
398.  Paragraph. 30 of OD 4.30 requires that "a time-bound resettlement plan and
budget that conforms to Bank policy is a condition of appraisal for projects involving
resettlement, except for sector investment loans... "
399.  The November, 1998, draft Project Appraisal Document (PAD) states that the
Project is in compliance with "OD 4.30 on involuntary resettlement involving 63
households surrendering their leased land for reclamation. ,266

264 Project Files (13 November 1998).

265 Specifically, footnote 2 of OD 4.20 states: "Displacement of indigenous people can be particularly
damaging, and special efforts should be made to avoid it. See OD 4.30, Involuntary Resettlement, for  I
additional policy guidance on resettlement issues involving indigenous people." Similarly, paragraph 3
(e) of OD 4.30 requires that compensation be provided for "usufruct or customary rights to the land or
other resources taken for the project." including compensation to indigenous peoples. See OD 4.20,  I

400.  At times, the PAD refers to the 4,000 herders in the Move-in area as voluntary
settlers; at other times, it refers to them as "negatively affected in the absence of
mitigation measures."167    Reviewing both the PAD and the VSIP, the Legal
Department pointed out these inconsistencies, advising that those who are negatively
affected should be treated as involuntary resettlers. Observing that this is discussed
in the VSIP, the Department stated that this was not adequate for the RAP because it
contains no explanation of the principles of compensation or what the herdsmen are
to be given that meets these principles.  It reminded the Region that RAPs
acceptable to the Bank had to be prepared for each of the PPs and that the PAD
should reflect this.268 Turning then to the question of possible resettlement for any
sub-projects that were to be prepared in the future, the Department reminded the
Region that a "resettlement framework" had not yet been prepared for Qinghai.69
401.  At the December 16, 1998, Decision meeting on the PAD, the Task Team
described the 3 categories of herders/farmers in and around the proposed settlement
area. "Only 63 herder households leasing grazing land would surrender part of their
current land in exchange for irrigated pasture under the project. The second group of
248 households living [in an abandoned irrigation system] would benefit from the
project's irrigation system. For the third group of 289 herder households, the project
design has incorporated two passages for their animals and would continue to cross
through project area and they would also be eligible for leasing irrigated land." The
meeting decided that the Task Team would (a) confirm whether the planned
compensation for the 63 households was in accordance with OD 4.30 and (b) ensure
that the VSIP and PAD are fully consistent. 270
402.  In January 1999, prior to formal Appraisal, the social expert on the Task Team
reviewed the VSIP and RAP. The January, 1999 "Voluntary Resettlement Policy
Framework and Action Plan" is a brief document, three pages in all (excluding a set
of tables) that does not separate out voluntary from involuntary resettlement.271 The
Legal Department reviewed the Plan and advised that several involuntary
resettlement aspects needed to be included or clarified in a revised version being
prepared for Negotiations.  First, recognizing that the separate "resettlement
framework" which was prepared for the future rural subprojects also applied to
facilities to be built in the settlement sites, she concluded that it could be viewed as

"constituting the principles of compensation for the 4,000 involuntarily resettled
people as well."  But this would need to be made clear at Negotiations. Second, the
plan didn't make clear that 289 households will have protected passageways through
the new site so their herds can reach grazing sites. Third, there is no explanation as
to why the 248 households were to get less farmland than the voluntary migrant                   3
settlers.272
11.5.4  Negotiations                                                                             I
403.   Paragraph 30 of OD 4.30 requires that "At negotiations, the borrower and the              3
Bank should agree on the resettlement plan. The borrower's obligation to carry it out
should be reflected in the legal documents.  Other necessary resettlement actions
must be covenanted. The [PAD] and the Memorandum and Recommendation of the                       I
President should summarize the plan and state that it meets Bank policy
requirements."                                                                                   I
404.   In March, 1999, the project documents were sent to the Country Director and
Legal Department for review  and  clearance  for negotiations.   The Appraisal
Completion Note conveying the documents states that a final report on voluntary and
involuntary resettlement will be brought to the Negotiations and that it will reflect
2733
comments made and queries raised at the December Appraisal Decision meeting.273
405.   Negotiations took place from  April 12 to 16, 1999. The documentation                     I
package did not include a separate and adequate Involuntary Resettlement Plan.
Sections of the VSIP seem  to have constituted the RAP that was part of the Project               3
intended for Board approval until external criticism erupted at the end of April,
1999 274
272 Project Files (11 March 1999).
273 Later on March 16, the Legal Department issued its authorization to negotiate and cleared the draft  3
loan, credit and project documents.
274 The revised VSIP, dated April 15, 1999 and entitled "Report on Implementation Plan for Voluntary
Migration Resettlement", contained three short attachments on involuntary resettlement. Attachment I
is called "Compensation Plan for 63 herders in Moving-in area." Three pages long (including a table  I
on the situation of the herders), it contained no details about implementation arrangements, timetables
and monitoring. As noted earlier Bank policy requires this as a condition of Appraisal. Attachment II
entitled "Policy Framework for Resettlement and Land Acquisition," also three pages long, covered
possible involuntary resettlement and land acquisition that might arise as a result of the project
financing new irrigation systems, roads, water supply, schools, health centers, and rural enterprises in
the Qaidam Basin. Attachment IlIl, called "Outline for Resettlement Action Plan," two pages long, dealt
with involuntary resettlement arising out of civil works. Other aspects of involuntary resettlement are in  I
the main body of the report, in particular paragraph 10, which deals with "Compensatory Settlement
Plan Move-in Area."

406.  The final clearance required before a project is presented to the Bank's Board
I          of Executive Directors is from the Statutory Committee. The Statutory Committee's
Report to the President was prepared on May 17, 1999.
407.  After intensive internal review, a separate "Involuntary Resettlement Plan" for
Qinghai was produced in May 1999. The Plan states that is impossible at present to
U          provide a resettlement timetable because no resettlement-related activities are to be
undertaken until pilot program results are evaluated. This condition is reflected in the
I          revised Qinghai Project Agreement. The Bank's Central Social Development
Department (SDV) considered that the revised plan was a considerable improvement
and appeared to meet key policy requirements.275
405   A full resettlement plan was not thought necessary since the economic and
3          physical impact is minimal. The timing and cost of resettlernent was to be contingent
on other project activities and integrated into the larger VSIP.
1          406 The June 1999 version of the PAD states the Project is in compliance with OD
4.30.276 The Project Information Document, updated in June, 1999, explains that "A
Voluntary Settlement Implementation Plan (VSIP) was prepared for Qinghai . . . in
accordance with OD 4.30 Involuntary Resettlement."277
3          The Panel's Findings
407 By failing to have produced the required (that is, an adequate) Involuntary
Resettlement Plan, and also failing to have produced adequate Indigenous Peoples
Development Plans for the impacted ethnic groups, Management has missed an
3          opportunity to help develop good social and environmental science in Qinghai
Province. These studies would also have been an opportunity to gather potentially
important information about the economy as well as the cultural and social life of the
*          nomadic pastoralists of the Qinghai Plateau, as well as the other minority nationalities
impacted by the Qinghai Project. Much of that information should have come from a
3          serious attempt to incorporate the perspectives of those who will be impacted by this
Project into the fundamental design of the Project itself.

408 The Panel finds that the Project's current Involuntary Resettlement Plan is
not in compliance with the requirements of Bank policy as set out in OD 4.30.
The reasons have been dealt with above, among them the inadequate basis for  I
compensation, the form and quality of the consultation,278 the failure to
adequately  consider project alternatives279  and  the  narrowly  defined  3
boundaries of the "project area," which appear to displace a larger population
than included in the Plan. Moreover, no separate involuntary resettlement plan
was prepared before appraisal, as required.

X                    Disclosure of Information and Other Policies
12.1   Disclosure of Information
3          410. The timely disclosure of information on evolving projects is designed to provide
opportunities for comment on and improvement of Bank projects.  The Bank's
Disclosure Policy is eloquent on this point. Introducing it in January 1994, the then
President Lewis T. Preston said: "...The sharing of information is essential for
effective and  sustainable development: it stimulates debate  and broadens
I          understanding of development issues, and it facilitates coordination among the many
parties involved in development. It serves to strengthen public support for efforts to
improve the lives of people in developing countries..." The policy statement itself
notes that: "..... Dissemination of information to local groups affected by the projects
supported by the Bank, including nongovernmental organizations, particularly as it
5          will facilitate the participation of those groups in Bank-financed projects, is essential
for the effective implementation and sustainability of the projects." Later, the policy
3          statement adds that ". . ,there is a presumption in favor of disclosure"
3          12.1.1. The Project Information Document
411. When a project is under consideration, Bank policy requires that a Project
Information Document (PID) be released on it. Introduced in 1994, it "...is designed
to make project information available to interested parties while a project is still under
3          preparation. The PID provides a brief (initially two-page) factual summary of the main
elements of the evolving project..."
412. The PID is to be made available at the Bank's Public Information Center (now
the Infoshop) at the Project Concept Document (PCD) stage. And, in fact, the PID for
5          the Western Poverty Reduction Project bears the same date as the PCD, March 25,
1998. It makes one reference to "minorities" or "minority nationalities", saying in
passing that China's current "absolute poor" comprise "largely minority nationalities."
I          There is no mention in the PID of minorities in the Qinghai component of the Project.
Rather, the beneficiaries are defined mainly in terms of their poverty and their
3          precarious future in the absence of the project.
l
l



157         3
12.1.2. The Revised Project Information Document
413.  The Bank's policy expects that this initial PID will be updated and expanded        |
periodically as project preparation proceeds. In any event, it is required to be revised
before formal project appraisal. This was not done.  If further changes are then
made, a new version of the PID is prepared.280
414.  In this instance, a first revision of the PID was made available at the Bank's      |
Infoshop on May 4, 1999, nearly four months after the Appraisal Mission of January
26, 1999.  This first revision is 15 pages long.  It contains only one mention of         3
minorities. In defining the "absolute poor" in an all-China context, it says that: "The
absolute poor, comprising largely minority nationalities, reside in mostly remote and
inaccessible upland areas with poor natural resource endowments and high                  I
population pressure." Other than this, it defined the affected people in the overall
project simply in terms of their poverty.
415. Following the TIN article281, the Public Information Document (PID) was
revised a second time and released on June 1, 1999. The June version contained a
long, 11 page annex on "Social Aspects" of the project. This revision is the first
official public document on the project that contains a description of the Social
Assessment preparation, the selection of beneficiaries, measures for land acquisition
and compensation, and measures for protecting minority rights. It also tries to
answer, at least implicitly, some of the criticisms that were then being advanced         I
concerning the effect of the project on minorities.
12.1.3 Environment-Related Documents
416.  Bank  Policy  17.50  on  Disclosure  of Information  states  that  `[The]
environmental data sheets prepared as quarterly updates in the Monthly Operational
Summary for all projects in the IBRD/IDA lending program are transmitted to the PlC       I
[or Infoshop], through which interested parties may obtain them." This was not done.
280 See IBRD/IDA, Bank Policy 17.50 on Disclosure of Operational Information (September 1993)
[hereinafter BP 17.50] at ß 4: "As an investment project develops, Bank staff update the PID and send  3
the update to the [Public Information Center], through which interested parties may obtain it. For all
operations, the PID is updated before the Bank's formal project appraisal; for operations in which
major changes are made after appraisal, a final revision of the PID is prepared following appraisal."
See, also, IBRD/IDA, China Western Poverty Reduction Project: Project Information Document, Report  I
No. PID6960 (1 June1999) [hereinafter "PID'].

417. Although BP 17.50 refers only to the timely disclosure of Environmental
Assessments and Analysis, an OPR Memorandum  issued on December 2, 1993,
I            reminded staff that, for purposes of disclosure, these docurnents "should, whenever
relevant, incorporate resettlement plans and indigenous peoples development
plans. ,282 Concerning  Environmental Analysis, the Bank's Policy states that: "If the
environmental analysis for an IDA-funded Category B project results in a separate
report, (a) before the Bank proceeds to appraisal, the separate report must be made
I            available in the borrowing country at some public place accessible to affected groups
and local NGOs and must be submitted to the Bank; and (b) once the separate report
is released locally and officially received by the Bank, it is sent to the PIC, through
which interested parties may obtain it. 283 The same OPR Memorandum provides that
"for a Bank or IDA Category "B" project, the environmental analysis is attached (not
summarized in an Annex) to the PID. "
3            418.  While the policy is clear, the actual rules are not. The EAs should be publicly
available in the borrowing country and received by the Bank before the start of project
appraisal.284  The timing of their release through the InfoShop, however, is to be
I            made some time "after it has been released locally and officially submitted to the
Bank. "
419.  In its Response to the Request for Inspection, Management agrees that there
were shortcomings in the timeliness with which the required documents were sent to
i            the Infoshop. The draft Environmental Assessment on the Qinghai Project was sent
to the Bank, evaluated by Bank staff, and made public in the Project area at
provincial, prefectural, and county levels in November 1998. An updated version of
the EA and the Voluntary Settlement Implementation Plan (VSIP) were presented to
the pre-appraisal mission in January, 1999. According to Management, the EA, the
3            VSIP and the Involuntary Resettlement Plan were not sent to the Board of Executive
Directors and the Infoshop until June 2, 1999.285
3            282 See Acting Director, OPR, Memo to Staff Recipients of the Operational Manual (2 December 1993).
The last paragraph of this Memorandum states that "These modifications to the Bank's disclosure
procedures will be incorporated into BP 17.50, Disclosure of Operational Information, when it is
X            revised and re-issued."
283 See BP 17.50, supra note 280, at ß 13.
284 This, at least, is the spirit of BP 17.50, though the text is not precise for the so-called IDA-B
projects. Senior Staff have stated that, while the disclosure requirements for "IDA-B" are not clear, the
spirit of the policy-though not the letter-would call for 60 days, if not 120 days disclosure before
Board approval, or the same as for category A projects. This requirement was clearly not met.
285 Several Washington-based NGOs, however, have officially stated to the Panel that as of June 8,
1999, only an "incomplete" set of documents was available to the public through the InfoShop.
According to them, this set included an environmental assessment and a five-page "involuntary
resettlement plan" that was not a plan but "simply a recitation of what the requirements of policy are.
l



l
159        3
420. It must be added that the lack of timely disclosure of information about this
particular Project seems rather unusual. During its interviews, the Panel confirmed  a
that overall the Bank has tried to move beyond the minimum disclosure requirements.
It often now sends documents and reports to NGOs in draft form before they are     3
released, and holds informational meetings with NGOs for reviews of upcoming
projects. Open disclosure, of course, does not necessarily guarantee that there will
be greater agreement with Bank projects. Interested parties may continue to oppose
projects, but still projects are often better as a result of their input.
421. As noted in its policy, the Bank has found that timely disclosure, and the
opportunity for public comment, can substantively improve a project and will help
assure that social and environmental safeguard policies are followed. A reading of  I
the Management Response reveals that the design of the Qinghai Project has been
improved, and its social and environmental safeguards have been strengthened, as a
result of the publicity and controversy surrounding it since April 1999, and the
consequent added attention given to the Project by the Bank's many qualified staff.
Perhaps if public disclosure had occurred in a more timely fashion, the project could  I
have been re-thought or improved without the level of controversy that it has
attracted.                                                                         3
422. Thus, as Management admits, the Qinghai Project is not in compliance
with BP 17.05. And the Panel so finds.                                             I
12.2 Investment Lending and Retroactive Financing
423. The September 9, 1999 decision of the Board of Executive Directors asked the
Panel to look into compliance by Bank Management with the provisions of O-P./B.P.
10.00 on "Investment Lending: Identification to Board Presentation" and O.P./B.P.
12.10 on "Retroactive Financing."                                                  I

environment, and enhance the effectiveness of their public and private sectors. To
I          achieve these goals, the Bank and Borrower need to ensure the quality of projects at
entry. "
425. While the O.P. establishes the criteria each investment project must meet to
obtain Bank financing, the B.P. establishes a series of processing procedures aimed
U          at assuring that these criteria are met. Since its issuance in June, 1994, B.P. 10.00
has been amended several times, principally by the provisions of a memorandum
entitled "Simplification of Business Processes: Bankwide Guidelines for Major
Operational Products" issued to staff by the Managing Directors in June 1996286 and
by  Operational Memorandum "Simplified Project Documentation" dated July 31,
1997.
1          426. The criteria established by O.P. 10.00 provides that each project must (a) be
consistent with the Bank's Articles of Agreement, operational policies in force, the
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), and be anchored in country policy/sector
analysis; and reflect lessons learned from the Bank's experience; (b) be economically
justified; and (c) contribute to poverty reduction and sustainable economic growth.
1          427. While the Panel is satisfied that the Project is consistent with the Articles
of Agreement and the CAS and is anchored in country policylsector analysis,
3          this Report shows a number of instances where the Panel feels that operational
policies and procedures were not followed, casting doubt as to whether the
Project, as it stands, is the best alternative to contribute to poverty reduction
and sustainable economic growth, and, thus, economically justified.
3          428. As to the procedural steps provided by B.P. 10.00, as amended, there is no
doubt that there was formal compliance with these requirements, but the substance
of certain steps (e.g., the clearance process of the social aspects) could have been
handled better.
|          12.2.2 Retroactive Financing.
429. Paragraph 1 of O.P./B.P. 12.10 provides that retroactive financing is allowed
I          "in exceptional circumstances to facilitate the prompt execution of Bank-financed
operations." The policy provides that up to ten percent of the total Loan or Credit can

161       £
be made available to cover payments made for up to twelve months before the date
of Loan/Credit signature, as may be agreed by Management and the Borrower.
430. The Requesters feared that the pilot phase of the Project, entailing early
resettlement of people to the "project area," could have already started even before  |
the Board approved the financing for the Project on June 24, 1999. In fact, at the
Pre-Appraisal stage in October 1998, the Bank and the Chinese Government agreed
that a pilot phase would begin immediately after Appraisal (scheduled for January,  I
1999) and that it would be covered by retroactive financing. However, the Panel did
not find any evidence of actual advance Project implementation and notes that
Management in Paragraph 2.9 of the Response describes a series of conditions to be
met by the Borrower prior to disbursements for the Qinghai component. These
conditions are set forth in the legal documents for this Project.
431. Thus, in the Panel's view, the Project is in compliance with OP/BP 12.10.  3

Request for Legal Opinion
I                    Reference is made to the Loan Agreement between the People's Republic of China
(the Borrower) and the Bank, and the Development Credit Agreement between the Borrower
U             and the Association, both dated December 30, 1999. for the above-captioned Project, to the
Memorandum dated August 24. 1999 from the Inspection Panel to the Board, regarding the
Request for Inspection of the Project (INSP/R99-6), and to your memorandum dated March
I              28, 2000 requesting a legal opinion as to whether the representations contained in Letter No.
5. dated December 30. 1999 from the Borrower to the Bank and Association, relating to this
Project, constitute a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of the Borrower, and relevant
I              authorities in the Borrower's territory. Specifically. the represenitations (the "Representations")
to which you refer state as follows:
I"The Borrower hereby represents to the Association and to the Bank that the
implementation of Qinghai's Respective Part of the Project, including the Qinghai
Voluntary Settlement Implementation Plan, will not affect the status of Qinghai's
1                    Haixi Prefecture as a Mongolian and Tibetan Autononmous Prefecture, and that Haixi
Prefecture will continue to maintain this status even after the Qinghai Settlement
Beneficiaries move into the Qinghai Settlement Area. The Association and the Bank
may rely upon this representation in making the Credit and the Loan for the Project."
(Emphasis added.)
a                    As noted in your memorandum, your request for a legal opinion stems from concerns
expressed about the project as to whether "the status of Haixi Prefecture as a Mongolian and
|             Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture will remain viable after [thej Bank financed population
transfer [under the project] has reduced indigenous populations to less than one quarter of the
total population." (emphasis added).'

*       August 24, 1999 from the Inspection Panel to the Board. Request for Inspection: China: Western Poverty
Project (Credit No. 3255-CHA; and Loan No. 450 I-CHA) (INSP/R99-6, dated August 24,1999).



Jim MacNeill                            -2-                               April 19.2000
As a legal nmatter, the Representations constitute a statement by the Borrower of fact or
an interpretation of Chinese law. They confirm  that, as a matter of Chinese law, the
implementation of the Project, including population transfers. will not, in and by itself, alter  I
the status of Hlaixi Prefecture as a Mongolian and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. The
Representations further state that the Bank and Association may rely upon this interpretation
of Chinese law in making the Loan and Credit.
Although the Bank was not required to independently verify the accuracy of the
Representations, the Bank nevertheless reviewed the relevant legislation and obtained the       I
advice of legal experts. as well as legal officials of the Borrower. This review and advice
revealed that the principal sources of Chinese law relevant to the status of autonomous areas
are the Constitution of the People's Republic of China (the "Constitution") and the Law of the
People's Republic of China on Regional National Autonomy (iLRNA').
Based upon such advice, we understand as follows:                                        X
The Constitution provides that all nationalities in the People's Republic of China are
equal and that discrimination against and oppression of any nationality is prohibited.2 Both the
Constitution and the LRNA provide that regional autonomy is practiced in areas where people
of minority nationalities live in concentrated communities.3 Neither the Constitution nor the
LRNA indicates a precise level required for an area to become eligible for treatment as an
autonomous prefecture. nor does either provide that having been conferred such status, an
autonomous prefecture would lose this status if the percentage of the minority population       I
dropped below some certain level.
Under the LRNA. any minority nationality, large or small. may apply to establish         I
an autonomous area., if its members live in a concentrated community.4  In granting this
status. consideration is given to the local conditions of the minority nationality. including,
inter alia, historical background.)  The Chinese Commission on Minority Affairs (the
"Commission") explained that this provision means that if the minority nationality has
historical ties with a particular area, it is more likely to be granted such status.            3
The LRNA goes on to state that '[O]nce defined, the boundaries of a national
autonomous area may not be altered without authorization."6 Indeed, if an alteration in status
is found to be necessary. specific procedures must be followed before any such alteration
could be proposed. These include a proposal by the relevant department of the state organ of
the next higher level (in this case the province), which may be submitted to the State Council  3
for approval only after full consultation with the organ of self

government of the national autonomous area (in this case the prefectural government).7
Moreover, the Commission advised the Bank that in practice. once an area has been conferred
I           autonomous status, this status has only rarely been changed. In each case in which the
autonomous status was changed. it involved a request by the autonomous area to be upgraded
to a municipality (which is not eligible to be treated as an autonomous area) or a request by the
Il          minority nationality for the entire community to be moved to another area.8 Thus. the
Commission advised that mere changes in numbers or concentration of the minority
5           nationality living in the area do not trigger the loss of status as an autonomous area.
The advice provided to the Bank clearly confirmed that, as a matter of Chinese law, the
implementation ol the Project. including resulting population transfers. will not. in anal hi
itself have any legal effect on the status of Haixi Prefecture as a Mongolian and Tibetan
Autonomous Prefecture. and that Haixi Prefecture will continue to maintain this status even
3           after the Qinghai Settlement Beneficiaries move into the Qinghai Settlement Area. We are
satisfled with the advice provided to it on this point of interpretationi of Chinese law. Further.
we are satisfied that the Representations could be. and were. validly made by the Borrower
3           and may be relied upon by the Bank in making the Loan and by the Association in making the
Credit.
Should the interpretation of Chinese law prove to have been wrong. the
Representations would provide a legal basis for the Bank and the Association to exercise their
respective suspension remedies under the provisions of the applicable General Conditions.
3           Pursuant to these provisions, the Bank (or Association) may suspend the right of the Borrower
to withdraw the Loan (or Credit) proceeds if 'a representation made by the Borrower in or
pursuant to the [Loan Agreement] [Development Credit Agreement], or any statement
I           furnished in connection therewith, and intended to be relied upon by the [Bank] [Association]
in making the [Loan] [Credit], shall have been incorrect in any material respect.'9 The
Representations were provided as a statement furnished in connection with the Loan
1           Agreement and Development Credit Agreement, and were explicitly intended to be relied
upon by the Bank in making the loan and the Association in making the Credit.  If. as a
matter of law, Haixi Prefecture were to lose its status as an autonomous prefecture as a result
I           of the Project, the Representations. which addressed specifically this status. would have been
incorrect in a material and significant respect.

Jim MacNeill                             -4-                                April 19. 2000
We are therefore satisfied that the Representations provide an adequate basis to suspend
dishursements and  cancel unwithdrawn  credit and  loan  proceeds in the event the
Representations prove to have been incorrect in their assessment of the status of Haixi           I
Prefecture as an autonomous prefecture.
The Management Response to the Request for Inspection therefore correctly states that      |
"[T]he Supplemental letters to the Legal Agreements... agreed with the Chinese authorities
introduced a number of refinements to the Project, including: ... [A]ssurances from  the
Borrower that the administrative status of the Haixi Mongol and Tibetan Autonomous
Prefecture will remain unchanged as a result of the Project. '
The Representations discussed above are to be distinguished. however. from  a              I
contractual undertaking of the Borrower that the status of Haixi Prefecture will not be altered
under any circumstances for reasons that are unrelated to the implementation of the Project.      3
Such a contractual undertaking was neither sought nor obtained. No statement has been made
in the Management Response to the effect that such a commitment has been sought or
obtained.                                                                                         3
