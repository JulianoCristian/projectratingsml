The management\n            has decided to hold off on releasing money for the project\n            until the completion and review of several studies dealing\n            with social and environmental aspects of the project. The\n            management recognizes that greater rigor in the application\n            of safeguard standards should have been ensured in light of\n            the circumstances of the Project. They recommend that: a) a\n            deeper level of environmental analysis should be conducted,\n            including switching the project to an \"A\"\n            classification; b) additional consultations with affected\n            people be undertaken with attention to confidentiality and\n            integrity; and c) a separate Indigenous Peoples Development\n            Plan be prepared and mad available. The recommendations\n            differ from the Inspection Panels requests in the areas of:\n            analysis of alternatives; an overarching development plan;\n            and the carrying out of literature reviews and ecology and\n            biodiversity studies.
