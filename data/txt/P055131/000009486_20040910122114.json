Among the lessons\n            learned are the following:  1) lending can be a powerful\n            instrument even for countries that do not need Bank's\n            financing for immediate balance of payments or budget\n            purposes; 2) An ambitious, complex, and demanding agenda (as\n            in the case of SAC-II) seeking to accomplish extensive\n            behavioral changes in a transition economy in a short period\n            of time necessitates a trusting partnership between the Bank\n            team and the Government's counterparts on the one hand;\n            and on the other, consistency of advice and coordination of\n            efforts amongst multilateral agencies and bilateral donorsl;\n            3) Government ownership of policy reforms is a dynamic\n            concept; it can reinforce itself or dwindle over time also\n            frequent Bank-country dialogue with the continuity and\n            dedication of a well-coordinated country team throughout the\n            tenure of the program helps to reinforce the\n            Government's commitment; and 4) Programmatic assistance\n            (as contemplated by the PRSP process) should not be viewed\n            just as medium-term and time-bound external support.\n            Adjustment operations can play a crucial integrative role in\n            paving the way for sector projects in achieving the\n            necessary high-level decisions and providing the appropriate\n            legal and strategic policy framework."}, "docdt": "2004-09-01T00:00:00Z"}
