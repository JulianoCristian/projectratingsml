significant intensification of the\n            Government of Azerbaijan's reform efforts over the past\n            two years and is intended to bolster and deepen those\n            efforts. The credit aims to enhance the Govenrment's\n            ability to manage Azaerbaijan's natural resource boom\n            efficiently, and to stimulate balanced economic growth, job\n            creation, and poverty reduction. This SAC II credit is\n            expected to bolster reforms that clearly define the role of\n            the state and at the same time eliminate impediments to\n            growth and employment in the non-oil sectors. The reform\n            program, supported by the SAC II credit will: 1) improve\n            transparency and accountability in public financial\n            management, including the establishment of the supreme audit\n            institution; 2) strengthen the tracking of poverty-reducing\n            public expenditures, and monitoring of their impact on\n            poverty; 3) improve strategic priority setting and\n            transparency of medium-term public expenditure and\n            investment programs; 4) introduce transparency and financial\n            discipline in the energy sector, including fiscalization of\n            quasi-fiscal activities; 5) reduce conflicts of interest and\n            corruption in the business environment, including regulation\n            enforcement, separation of regulatory and commercial\n            functions, and tax and customs; 6) improve transparency,\n            financial discipline, and competition in the banking sector;\n            and 7) improve the privatization process. The credit will be\n            disbursed in two equal tranches."}, "docdt": "2002-02-13T00:00:00Z"}
