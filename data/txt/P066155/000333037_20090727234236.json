Administration Modernization Project (TAMP II) for Russian\n            Federation were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: high-level Government and Federal Tax\n            Service (FTS) ownership of the project and tax\n            administration reforms remained consistently high.\n            Importantly, technical-level ownership and change management\n            within the FTS was embedded through thematic working groups\n            in Ministry of Taxes and Fees (MinTax) and then the FTS.\n            These working groups penetrated very deep into the operating\n            levels of the tax administration and provided strong\n            continuity even through wrenching organizational\n            restructurings and changes in MinTax and FTS leadership. The\n            working groups also functioned, contrary to conventional\n            wisdom which sometimes doubts the efficacy of such change\n            agents internal to an organization, as key channels to\n            introduce and sustain incremental institutional change,\n            modernized business processes, and related automation. It\n            appears that the high organizational pride and esprit de\n            corps so manifest across the entire FTS contributed\n            significantly to this achievement. The importance of the\n            thematic working groups in keeping the banners of ownership,\n            change management and incremental reforms flying through\n            difficult times cannot be over-estimated."}, "docdt": "2009-05-29T00:00:00Z"}
