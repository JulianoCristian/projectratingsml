The project constituted a successful\n            demonstration of an improved way of supporting scientific\n            research in a cost effective manner and in ways that\n            strengthened Chile's National Innovation System.\n            Lessons learned include the following. Even limited\n            investment, distributed based on transparent and objective\n            selection procedures, has a high impact on performance and\n            productivity of an science and technology system. Autonomy\n            in spending resources and diminished bureaucratic burdens\n            improve the effectiveness of investment in advanced\n            scientific research. Chile has the conditions for catching\n            up in terms of human capital formation by rapidly expanding\n            further training opportunities for the most advances\n            students. The quality of training can be improved with\n            incremental investments that allow the best senior\n            researchers to devote themselves full time to their\n            professional responsibilities. Cohesive government\n            performance is a key element to project success as\n            transparency in communications between government players,\n            the continuity in funding and the coherence of science\n            technology and innovation policy are of critical importance.\n            Favorable entry conditions contribute to successful project outcomes."}, "docdt": "2002-12-18T00:00:00Z"}
