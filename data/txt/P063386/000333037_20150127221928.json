But with many top\n            researchers emigrating for opportunities abroad, poor\n            countries are struggling to support local talent, and\n            prevent the so-called brain-drain that undermines their\n            research efforts. The World Bank and the Chilean government\n            partnered in 1999 to launch the Millennium Science\n            Initiative (MSI), which aims to boost Chile\u0092s science and\n            technology sector by supporting local scientists and\n            investing in new research. With MSI help, more than a dozen\n            first-rate research centers have been established and many\n            of the country\u0092s top scientists have received grants through\n            an established fund administered by an international\n            committee of selected scientists. MSI research grants so far\n            have been awarded to 160 Chilean senior scientists, enabling\n            them to compete with international peers. Benefits have\n            trickled down to students as well. These scientists are\n            responsible for training half of the country\u0092s graduate\n            students in science and engineering, and 47 doctorates have\n            been awarded since MSI\u0092s inception. Additionally, 252\n            graduate and undergraduate students, funded through other\n            sources, are associated with MSI as researchers. Results\n            have spilled over beyond Chile\u0092s borders: 18 doctoral and\n            postdoctoral students from neighboring countries have\n            received MSI fellowships. Building on the program\u0092s success,\n            in May 2003, the World Bank approved a second $25.3 million\n            loan to strengthen the project."}, "docdt": "2004-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
