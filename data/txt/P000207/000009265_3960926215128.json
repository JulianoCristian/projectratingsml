the economy towards a path with more\n            reliance on market forces and a greater outward orientation.\n            The measures to be supported by the proposed credit will\n            strengthen the ongoing policy reforms aimed at: (a)\n            strengthening incentives for efficient resource allocation,\n            increased private investment and exports, and greater\n            efficiency of the coffee sub-sector; (b) increasing public\n            savings and improving public expenditure management; (c)\n            reforming the public enterprise sector; and (d) improving\n            agricultural productivity and sector management. The\n            measures will also address new policy areas to accelerate\n            the supply response to the new market-oriented incentive\n            structure, notably; (e) liberalization of the labor market,\n            (f) deregulation of the financial sector; and (g)\n            preparation and implementation of targeted actions to\n            address pressing poverty issues."}, "docdt": "1988-05-11T00:00:00Z"}
