INTRODUCTION
Position - general and partcular description
The motorway Rijeka - Zagreb is a part of the intemational road route E-65, which
is connected to the road routes E-59, E-70 and E-71 near Zagreb and thus
became one of the main road connections of the Adriatc coast with the Middle and
North Europe and is included into the Project of Trans-European route "North-
South". In the Croatian road network this road represents a connection between
Zagreb. the capital and economic and traffic center of Croatia,v ia Karlovac to
Rjeka, the main transit port of the Croatian part of the Adriatic sea.
Following this route a part of the motorway has already been constructed from
Orehovica to Kikovica, 10.5 km, from Zagreb to Karlovac, 40.1 km and a semi-
motorway Kikovica - Ottrovica, 7.9 km.
By construction of the remaining section of this road between Ogtrovica and
Karlovac, the traffic connection from the Croatian seaside with the Middle Europe
would be considerably improved, and the distance between Rijeka and Zagreb
reduced to 147.1 km.
This Study comprises the motorway section from km 32+389.51 to km
49+239.28 from Vrata to Kupjak in length of 16.85 km.
The basic characteristics of this section is passage through a distinctly karst area,
and waters from this area gravitate to the river Kupa, i.e. the Black-sea river-basin.
This section is a continuation of the section Ostrovica - Vrata The route follows the
railway line Rijeka - Zagreb on the westem side till the tunnel "Lu&ce", where it
passes under the railway line, goes by the places Delnice and Dedin and
eventually ends next to the main road M-12 nearby the village Kupjak.
TECHNICAL AND TRAFFIC DATA OF THE MOTORWAY
In respect to the configuration of soil the motorway route passes through, the level
is very ragged and ranges between + 4 % and - 4 %. The route is in ground plan
well extended with minimum radius of horizontal curves R = 700 m, except for
parts between km 33 and 35 as well as km 43 and 45, where due to configuration
of soil, minimal ground plan elements were applied.
In this sector the route passes several mountains and valleys and, consequently,
numerous structures shall have to be built.
..



The expected traffic is analyzed in a feasibility study made by G I Zagreb (Building
)             construction institue) in 1990.
Design traffic load at 'Ie end of the planning period in the year 2014 is as follows:
AADT
Average annual                        TYPE OF VEHICLE
dailytraffic %
4                                Domestic       Foreign    Buses       Lorries
passenger     passenger
cars          cars
*            14.996              9.042          3.020      522         2.412
100%                60.3 %         20.1%       3.5 %      16.1%
Traffic requirements till the year 2014 as per traffic analyses, can be satisfied by a
-4           dual carriageway road with an additional lane for slow vehicles on slopes. This is
the reason why this motorway is planned to be constructed in two phases.
4            In the first phase a semi-motorway shall be constructed with an additional lane for
slow vehicles on slopes and with al the interchanges and two level crossings.
After the planned period, when required, the second carriageway shall be
constructed (second phase). Consequently, in the end this shall be a two lane dual
carriageway road in each direction with a stopping lane i.e. an additional lane for
slow vehicles.

of
Professional commission for evaluation of studies
on environmental influences of motorways and main roads for:
.-' ! -                   The Study on Environmental influence of
Motorway Kailovac - Rijeka
Sector Vrata - Kupiak
made by IPZ (In2injerski projektni zavod) Zagreb, Petrinjska 7 in January 1991,
4       -  under number C-5607/1-2.
1.  Upon its meeting held on March 22, 1991, the professional commission
decided that the subject Study can be put to public debate.
2.  The public debate was proclaimed in the"Novi list" (New Gazette) of Rijeka
and lasted from April 27 to May 27, 1991.
Two public debates were held in the town hall of the county district Delnice,
on May 8 and May 23, 1991.
*               I)During the entire duration of th-e debate, each party concerned had the
opportunity of insight into the necessary documents, made available in the
Department for town planning, construction, communal and housing
*               operations of the county Delnice.
-,          3.  In the course of the debate.the authors of the Study have answered to the
raised quesbons and comments, and some written comments were received
-'              as well.
The written comments received in the course of the debate were sorted
according to issues and answered by the Study authors.
4.  After having considered all the comments and suggestions it has been
decided that the Study on environmental influences of the motorway
Karlovac - Rijeka, section Kupjak be accepted.

5.  Remarks and conclusions:
a)  The subject Study has been made in accordance with the Law on
regional planning and environment arrangement and with the By-law on
elaboration of the Studies on environmental influences.
b)  The motorway Rijeka - Zagreb is located in the corridor of the
international road E-65, and according to the Decision on main roads
(Official Gazette No. 39/84) it has been determined as the road M-1 2-
and comprises the following route:
Croatian-Hungarian state border-Gorican-(akovec-Vara-din-Zagreb-
Karlovac-Rijeka-Rupe-Kozina-Slovene-Italian state border.
c)  Sector Vrata - Kupjak of the motorway Rijeka - Zagreb in its entire
length is located in the region of the county distiict Delnice. The length
of the subject section is 17,46 km.
d)  The suggested motorway route Zagreb - Rijeka, sector Vrata - Kupjak
is in compliance with the comidor of this route foreseen in the Regional
plan of Croatia and county district Delnice.
e)  More significant and the most obvious influences are those that cause
changes of the purpose of wood land and arable land, as well as
physical and aesthetic environmental changes.
These influences comprise as follows:
- decrease of the forest area for approx 35 ha
- decrease of plow-fields and meadows for approx. 30 ha
f)   Water management parameters of the region
a                     In its entire length the route passes through a distinctly karst area with
numerous dolinas (funnel-shaped depressions in limestone) and
underground streams that belong to the Black-Sea river-basin.
The route passes through the third zone of sanitary protection of
potable water-springs, and only shortly near Delnice encroaches into
the second zone of sanitary protection.
Due to a possible influence of the road to the qualitative change of
underground waters used for drinking, it is necessary to eliminate this
influence by protective technical measures applied in the course of
construction and exploitation of the road.
g)  Meteorological and climatic parameters of the region
This region abounds in precipitation. In the route region 150 1Isq.m of
precipitation in one day is possible, and nearby Vrata as much as 200
Ilsq .m., and the precipitation in this region is one of the most intensive in
'a



Croatia. For this reason it is important to pay special attention to
construction ct installations for water drainage from the carriageway.
The main problems in this region are caused by snow in winter. Total
height of snow near Delnice amounts to approximately 100 cm.
h) Flora and fauna
Throughout its almost entire length the route passes through the woods
of reed, hop'hombeam and fir-trees.
This region abounds in fauna, specially game. Out of 43 species of
mammels and birds that dwell the hunting-grounds in Croatia, 31
species dwell in Gorski kotar. Due to the severe climate in Gorski kotar,
the game frequently migrates to climatically more favourable regions.
Besides, mating, constant search for food and water forces animals to
pass the road corridor.
i) Regional potentials
The suggested route of the motorway Rijeka - Karlovac is in
compliance with the corridor foreseen for this road in previous regional
plans.
The motorway passes through some parts and sites that are registered
as valuable landscapes or are protected as water management
resources. They comprise the park forest Golubinjak, river source
ULanka and wildlife refuge Petehovec.
No other cultural or histotical places subject to protection on any basis
are registered in the motorway corridor.
Through the subject region, specially nearby the places Vrata and
Delnice, many transmission lines pass. The motorway also crosses the
Adriatic oil pipeline (JANAF) twice.
Air quality
It is known from the past experience that the woods on the road route,
as well as other parts of Gorski kotar are much affected by emission of
harmful substances from the atmosphere (influence of highly
developed industries in the Western Europe, acid rains).
Taking into consideration that the traffic load for 1990 amounted only to
AADT (Average Annual Daily Traffic) = approx. 5.500 vehicles/day,
i.e. the design traffic load ior the year 2D14 amounts to AADT =
approx. 15.000 v/day, and also in view of technical improvements of
vehicles and the use of unleaded petrol, the influence of the motorway
to people and flora now and in future when the motorway reaches the
maximum designed traffic, shall be acceptable, due to the fact that the
increase of traffic shall be accompanied by technical improvements on
vehicles.



Some former researches show us that the concentration of harmful
gases alongside motorways depend upon traffic load and the distance
from the carriageway margin. For the above stated traffic load the lead
concentration on the distance over 35 m from the carriageway margin
shall, at the end of the planned period and according to German
technical literature, be less than 0.002 mgkc.m. of air.
k)  Noise level
The motorway route mainly passes through uninhabited areas and,
thus, the influence of noise is negligable, except for the parts near
villages Vrata and Zalesina
By comparison of the computed equivalent noise level with the
maximum allowed noise, it has been established that the noise level
shall exceed the allowed limit nearby these villages.
-u
6.  Protective measures
-n
6.1  Water management parameters
-'                    For the purposes of protection of waters and in compliance with the
Water management development plan, the water from the carriageway
shall be drained through water-tight sewers, via special devices
(separators, lagoons") and finally released to the tested and
approved underground places.
Separation of oily substances and sedimentation of large particles
takes place in separators. The water from separators is drained into the
ground or, if required, into special "lagoons" lined with clay where water
is kept for approximately 15 days. Here further sedimentation and
neutralization of harmful substances takes place and afterwards the
water is released through a drainage system underground. The areas
above the reception drainage system shall be planted with special
plants capable of absorbing the residue harmful substances from the
water.
Upon construction and exploitation of the motorway the influences to
surface and underground waters shall be regulated in accordance with
the decisions of local authorities on water protection, i.e. adequate
regulations (Law on waters, By-law on sanitary protection of potable
waters).
It is expected that, with the foreseen protective measures and the
appropriate maintenance of the drainage system, the quality of
underground waters shall not be affected.
During the exploitation of the road, it is necessary to monitor'functioning
of the drainage system and establish regular quality control of the
purified waste water from the carriageway, and also establish the
system of observation of underground waters in the zones of infiltration
p                    of purified waste waters from the carriageway. Due to insufficient
:r



experience with the suggested system of water protection on the
motorway, as well as to the fact that the waters from the motorway
after having been treated gravitates to the potable water springs, the
Investor shall, by agreement with the local authorities in Delnice, in the
course of motorway construction, take part in construction of a substitute
water supply system based on expliotation of Omiadinsko jezero
(Youth lake).
In this way. the absolute protection of potable water from further
contamination from the motorway and other roads in the region shall be
obtained, because the lake is situated on a higher level than the
motorway and other roads.
Upon possible incident situations on the motorway (overthrow of a tank
truck, etc.), contamination of underground waters may occur and thus
cause disturbance in water supply. This calls for a special by-law which
would regulate measures of emergencyintervention, accordirg to which
the maintenance service would sanify such contaminaffons.
-u
6.2  Meteorological and climatc parameters
Snow drifts are expected in some parts of this section, specially in
shallow cuts from the tunnel "Dedin' fill the end of the section. This shall
be avoided by construction of snow-guards. The dimensions and
positions of snow-guards shall be determined in practce.
In the course of exploitation of the motorway constant monitoring of
weather conditions is required, as well as timely maintenance and
removal of snowfall from the carriageway.
U
6.3  Floraand fauna
The wood margins resulted from culting through the woods for the
motorway construction shall be biologically sanified by planting of
adequate plants which shall decrease negative influences of felling, as
well as lessen the penetration of exhaust gases into the depths of
woods.
Along the parts of the motorway that pass through plow-fields it is
necessary to plant such hedges that shali decrease the penetration of
* .                   harmful substances from exhaust gases into the fertile soil. The ldnd of
the hedge, its density, height, etc., shall be determined by technical
documentation for constuction of the motorway.
Pursuant to the requirements of organizations responsible for the game
in the region, the places for passage of aminals have been
determined, and it has been decided that undisturbed migrations of the
game in search for food and water shall be made possible.
It is necessary to put up safety fences on either side of the entire length
of the motorway route. The height and type of safety fence shall be
determined in accordance with the kind of the game and with the height



of snowfall (,1.80 to 2.40 m). Since the standard safety fence
represents no obstacle for brown bear (experience from the motorway
Vrhnika - Postojna in Slovenia), it is necessary to place off-standard
fence on places of possible passage of bears, which shall prevent
their entrance into the fenced motorway area.
6.4  Regional potentials
All the traffic and utility installations which the planned motorway-
crosses, shall be put into the previous functional condition.
During elaboration of working drawings special attention shall be paid to
forming of all the parts of the road, choice of materials and aesthetic
fitting into the environment.
Alongside the whole section biological improvement of sanitary
conditions is obligatory. Consequently, all the cuts, embankments, fills
and division surfaces shall be stabilized not only by technical measures
but also by adequate planting with autochtonous plants.
It is extremely important that the surplus material be overhauled to
waste areas to be defined in cooperation with professional services of
social and political community (abandoned mine pits, rocky grounds),
and adequately arranged.
6.5 Air quality
The inevitable influence of air pollution alongside the motorway shall be
diminished by the previously mentioned measures for protection of
flora, i.e. by planting of hedges and special kinds of trees for protection
of newly formed wood margins, as well as by introduction of unleaded
petrol and other technological improvements on vehicles, which has
already been determined as a policy and regulations in the Western
European counties.
Upon elaboration of technical documentation for the route sections in
tunnels it is necessary to make thorough calculations of possible
concentration of harmful substances in the air, and accordingly apply
protective measures by natral or artficia ventilation.
6.6  Noise level
In the course of elaboration of technical documeritatioi ;t is necessary to
make detailed calculation of the noise level in the settlements alongside
the motorway, based on technical parameters of the route and the traffic
load. By application of the most optimal technical solutions, the noise
level shall be reduced to a minimum.
Upon putting the motorway into operation, check measurements of
noise levels shall be performed, and, if necessary, adequate protection
from its harmful influence applied by building of aesthetically shaped
barriers against the noise spreading.
