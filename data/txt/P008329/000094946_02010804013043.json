The main lessons address issues as\n            follows. The strategy for addressing the uneconomic motorway\n            program, was successful due to the patient approach taken by\n            the Bank, who - not until the newly elected Parliament\n            approved a more disciplined roads program - chose an\n            intensified dialogue through sector work, and discussion on\n            a proposed Bank guarantee for the Zagreb-Gorican Motorway.\n            Nonetheless, further continuous dialogue over major sector\n            issues will still be required. Given the country's\n            economic transition, it is worth mentioning that the\n            competitive approach of the commercialized/privatized\n            construction industry, was conducive to an estimated cost\n            reduction of ten percent, enhanced by current management\n            practices, and technical and economic criteria, that\n            improved budgetary allocations. However, the Government\n            should focus on the economic evaluation, and rationalization\n            of the motorway program, as well as expediting land\n            expropriation which could delay works. Finally, accession to\n            the European Union plays an accelerating role in\n            institutional reforms, thus road user charges, traffic\n            safety, and pavement standards are issues to be addressed."}, "docdt": "2001-12-13T00:00:00Z"}
