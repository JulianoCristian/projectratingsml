sector with special emphasis\n            on the main road network and Croatian Road Authority (HC).\n            The Government and HC will adopt policies and implement\n            measures to: 1) maintain the road vehicle fuel tax on at\n            least its present level in real terms; 2) reduce the\n            Government's budgetary support to Croatian Railways\n            (HZ); 3) design and implement a road traffic safety program;\n            4) reduce lead content in vehicle emissions and ensure wide\n            availability of unleaded fuel at a price equal to or less\n            than that of leaded gasoline; and 5) continue the separation\n            of civil works contractors from HC and pursue further\n            implementation of the Pavement Management System (PMS).\n            Investments will include: 1) a three-year time slice of\n            HC's road expenditure program directed at repairing war\n            damage, reducing the deterioration of the network and making\n            investments to complete projects that accommodate changes in\n            transport demand; 2) technical assistance and studies for:\n            HZ restructuring, traffic safety, implementation of PMS, and\n            Rijeka port master plan; and 3) training for HC technical\n            personnel in modernization road maintenance techniques,\n            including pavement and bridge management systems."}, "docdt": "1995-03-15T00:00:00Z"}
