a housing sector policy\n            component, in which the Government has provided a Sector\n            Policy Declaration which spells out its medium-term strategy\n            for the sector and specifies measures it will take to\n            address important sector issues; (c) a FOVI credit\n            component, in which the project will help fund a share of\n            FOVI's lending program for houses with a selling price\n            of not greater than 130 multiples of the monthly minimun\n            wage; and (d) a studies component, which will include\n            studies to develop a new wage index to adjust payments on\n            FOVI mortgages, create a a secondary mortgage market, and to\n            develop a plan improve housing market information."}, "docdt":
