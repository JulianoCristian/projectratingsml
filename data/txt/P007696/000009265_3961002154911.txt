ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO BICO NACIONL Dl OBiAS Y SRVICIOS PUBLICOS 8.N.C.
FOR A HOsUNG MAR1ET DiVgLOP MNT PROJIECT
1.   The following memorandum and recomendation on a proposed loan to Banco
Maclonal de Obras y Servicios Publicoo S.N.C. (BANOBRAS) ith the guarantee of the
United Mexican States for US$450 million equivalent is submitted for your approval.
The proposed loan vould be repaid over 15 years, including 5 years grace.
2.   Backaround. Demand for housing in Mexico Is expected to increase
substantially in the coming years due mainly to rapid growth of new family
formations coupled with accelerated urbanization. The low-income households which
account for the bulk of the new demand have been traditionally excluded from home
financing by comercial banks which linit their mortgage lending to upper-income
buyers. Until 19893 the Goverrment of Mexico (CON) required commercial banks to
lend a fixed minimum proportion of their deposits for housing at subsidized terms.
Although these constraints have been removed, and comercial banks have begun
recently to expand their voluntary mortgage lending, limited long-term resources and
concerns about credit risks, make them unwilling to lend to lower income homebuyers
without financing from FOVI, a special trust fund of the Central Bank.
3.   With the 1989 liberalization of the financial system, which included the
elimination of all interest rate controls and mandatory lending requirements and the
reprivatization of commercial banks, and with the continued success of Mexico's
economic reform program, the GON expects banks to extend the term structure of their
liabilities, and to expand their long-term lenditg for housing and other purposes.
The GON has been redefining its role and housing strategy to stimulate increased
private participation in the housing market. In particular, the GON strategy seeks
to create a more supportive regulatory and legal framework at the state and
municipal levels within vhlch the private sector (builders and lenders) can expand
investment in housing reaching increasingly lower income households, while tha
public sector can focus its resources on the poorest segments of the housing market
which can not be attended to alone by the private sector.
4.   Several important issues limit the efficiency and competitiveness of the
overall housint market, and discourage private builders and financiers from
penetrating the lower Income segment of the market. These issues are: (i)
unnecessary, cumbersome and non-transparent state and local regulations and permit-
approval procedures which drive up housing costs; (ii) shortages of urbanized land
for low-cost housing construction due mainly to laws that prohibited the sale of
public (d ido) land to the private sector and to the lack of effective financing
mechanisms for the Installation of basic infrastructure on public and private lands;
(iiI) imndequate lending terms and allocation criteria of public housing finance
agencies (particularly two large worker's pensions funds) which offer subsidized
mortgages; (iv) inadequate resources, and a lack of full integration of the housing
finance system with the rest of the financial markets; and (v) an absence of
consistent and reliable market information about housing production ad finance.
5.   Recently, the CON has initiated measures to address many of the above-
mentioned issues. In 1989, FOVI introduced a public auction system which awards its
mortgage financing to builders which offer the higbest bids (and which, tn turn,
make such financing available, through commercial banks, to qualifying homebuyers
for new home purchases). Besides being an efficient and fair way to allocate
funding, this system also favors states and municipalities with the lowest
regulatory burdens, by permitting developers in those areas to bid more for, and
thus to obtain more readily, POVI fund.. Additionally, the auction system allows
1OVI to capture economie benefits (rents) that are derived from its mortgage
financing terms through market-determined "premiums", and successful bidders are
likely to rocover such 'premiums" by msarking up the sale price of the houses. POVI
has also begun Identifying regulatory bottlenecks at the state and local levels and
designing mechanisms to reduce those bottlenecks. In 1990, FOVI began to sign



-2-
agreements with states which set out specific targets for reasonable housing
development and building standards, time limits for approving permits, and a
schedule to lower overall bureaucratic costs. While these deregulation agreements
are not legally binding, in practice they carry considerable weight as th;y are
cosigned by the Minister of Finance and Public Credit, the state's governor and
FOVI's Director General. To monitor the deregulation process, FOVI has begun to
survey private builders to determine regulatory costs on a state-by-state basis for
FOVI-financed projects. More recontly, the GOH has implemented important reforms on
two issues that the Bank and the CON had previously identified as impeding sector
development. In January 1992, the Mexican Congress approved a Constitutional
amendment to allow the transfer of ejid land to private owners which will' address
urban land market constraints. And, in February 1992, the Congress passed new
legislation that reforms the country's compulsory pension and worker's housing
funds. Under the new law, the wQrker's housing fund will be converted from a
construction agency to a housing bank" with streamlined and transparent lending
procedures and a mandate to become financially self-sufficient. The proposed
project would further develop and reinforce the implementation of the above-
uentioned measures and mechanisms.
6.    Prosect Objectives.  In addition to expanding the supply of finance for low-
cost housing to be built by private developers, the project's main objectives are to
support the G0M in: (i) removing regulatory barriers in order to lover housing costs
and to encourage private commercial banks to increase lending for housing,
especially at the loer income end of the market; (i_) broadening and deepening the
housing policy dialogue to Include inter alia the expansion and liberalization of
the urban land market, the cost recovery and operational performance of the quasi-
public pension funds' housing programs, and the further integration of the housing
finance market with the overall financial system; (iii) improving POVI's mortgage
instrument and onlending mechanism so as to stimulate commercial bank interest -
lending for low-cost housing; and (iv) improving irformation on the housing market.
7.   Proiect Description. The project would have four broad components, as
followts (a) Reaulatory Reform Comuonent. The project would assist in further
developing and supporting ongoing FOVI measures to encourage state and local
governments to reduce their regulatory burden on housing. As state and local
government are largely autonomous from the national government, the project would
rely heavily on market forces (FOVI auctions) reinforced by public pressures created
by the dissemination of Information on regulatory costs and on government
deregulation commitments to key housing market participants (e.g., developers,
banks, and homebuyers) to induce the states and municipalities to change their
regulatory frameworks.  (b) Nousina Sector Pollcv Comnonept. Under this rApV-iet
the G0M has provided a Sector Policy Declaration which spolls out its medium-term
strategy for the sector and specifies measures i1 will take to address important
housing sector issues (see para. 4). (c) FOVI .Qedit Line Com=onent. The project
would help fund a share of JOVI's 1992-96 lendina program for low-cost housing units
with a selling price of no greater than 130 multiples of the minismu wage (US$17,000
equivalent), targeted to households earning less than 5 multiples of the minimum
wage (US$650 equivalent). The proposed loan would finance exclusively about 282 of
FOVI's future lending program, estimated to cost US$1,594 million equivalent. (d)
Studies I= MIonea. The project would also include studies on the creation of a
secondary mortgage market, on the development of a new index for adjusting payments
on POVI mortgages, and on a development plan to improve housing mariet information.
The cost of this component, estimated at US$100,000, would be financed by 1O01.
8.    Project Financinp.  The Bank loan of US$450 million would finance about 282 of
the total project costs. The remaining project costs would be financed by POVI
(US$984 million; 622), and by homebuyers' downpayments (US$160 million, 102). A
breakdown of costs and financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Bank funds would be
disbursed for up to 602 of the loan aount  lent by FOVI to the commercial banks for
mortgage loans for houses with a selling price of not greater than 130 MWe.  To
provide adequate time for the deregulation mechanisms to be implemented and show



-3-
results, the Bank and the GOM have sgreed to limits on cumulative loan
disbursements, spread over a four year period.  Housing eligible for Bank financing
would meet the criteria mentioned in para. 7 (ce) above. Retroactive financing of up
to US$5.0 millicn for eligible exponditures incurred since April 22, 1992 has been
agreed. Disbursements are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Gre-p operations in Mexico are given in
Schedules O! and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 10475-HE, dated May
26, 199#, is also attached.
9.    P1 Oct 120lem921SUMn   POVI would be responsible for coordinating overall
proiect implementation, including the monitoring of the deregulation program and the
Sector Policy Declaration, and for the execution of the credit line and the studies
components. The COM, primarily through the Ministry of Urban Development (SEDUE),
would be responsible for providing input to lOVI on sector development and for
ensuring that satisfactory action is taken to achieve the objectives of the Sector
Policy Declaration. The Bank and the Government would use the annual and mid-term
reviews (para. 13) to monitor project implementation against key indicators and
performance targets. IBID funds would be transferred from BANOBRAS to the Central
Bank (POVI) at a rate of interest equal to the Government's Treasury bill rate.
Private builders would construct houses and sell them in the -zarket at their own
risk. The commercial banks would be responsible for mortgage loan approvals,
collecting downpayments and mortgage payments from the homebuyer, and debt servicing
to FOVI. They would bear the default risk on the mortgage loans and would charge
the homebuy.rs a one-time upfront loan origination fee and commissions on monthly
payments, both of which would be market determined. In addition, depending on the
FOVI house type financed, the commercial banks would be paid by POVI a fee of 2Z or
32 anuually on the outstanding loan balance. FOVI funds would be lent to homebuyers
at the banking system's average cost of term funds (CPP), plus the one-time upfront
fee and the monthly commissions. FOVI's income would be derived from the auction
premiums paid by developers and the mortgage repayments from commercial banka at CPP
less the fee of 22 or 3S depending on the FOVI house type. These arrangements
result in lending terms to the homebuyer that are aligned to market conditions, and
allow FOVI to cover its funding ad overhead costs. The Government would assume the
foreign exchange and interest rate risk on the proposed Bank loan. While the
project vould not provide housing construction financing--this is generally done by
commercial banks with their own resources at a market rate of interest--homebuilders
typically vould not build houses for lower income buyers (like those that occupy the
FOVI houses) without prior commitment req'rding the awailability of mortgage
financing for the purchase of such housing.
10.  Pro1ect Sustainabilit-v. Project sustainability would be measured in terms of
the future willingness of private homebuilders and mortgage lenders to expand their
investment in hous5ng in general and low-income housing in particular. Thus, to
stimulate the part;cipation of the private sector in housing, the project has been
designed to remove impediments that currently constrain housing market development.
Also, the project vwould assist POVI in encouraging private developers to build
houses affordable to low-income households, which would then be financed by banks
eventually with their on resources.
11.  Lesons from Previous Bank Involvement. The project draws upon the lessons
learned by the Bank through its housing operations both in Mexico and on a world-
wide basis. Foremost among these lessons is the need for the Bank to assist
governments in redefining regulatory frameworks, pricing policies and policies
affecting the housing finance sector, so that the private sector can play an
expanded rol in addressing housing problems. The proposed project would be the
first large-scale Bank operation in the housing sector that incorporates the above-
mentioned lesson, which was a key recommendation in the Bank*a 1990 Urban Policy
Paper.
12.  Rationale for Bank Tnvolvement. The proposed project conforms to the broad
country strategy of assisting the Government in fostering private sector



-4-
development, In broadening the opportunities for the lses privileged, and in
expanding investment In urban Infrastructure. The proposed project grows vut of
extenaive Bank experience with Meaico's housing sector, Including two succassful
projects with FONHAPO, the GCK's low-income housing fund, and a successful first
loan to FOVI for US$300 million, approved in 1988 and now fully-disbursed. Tne POVI
loan supported measures to allow banks to achieve full cost recovery on their
mortgage loans.  In connection with this loan, the GOQ provided the Bank a housing
sector policy statement, which has been surpassed by subsequent reforms that have
been implemented and which h- been substantially updated under the proposed project
(para. 7 (b)). Because POVI as taken the lead in prvmoting the deregulation of the
housing sector, and in influencing developers and banks through the provision of
mortgage finance, POV  is viewed as the GOC's financial intermediary most suited to
pursue many of the future sector reforms. IBRD support, under the proposed project,
for a line of credit through FOVT is justified on the basis that during the next
several years even after the commercial banks have become fully privatized they are
likely to continue to concentrate their mortgage lending on the upper- and middle-
income segments of the market, which are moro profitable and perceived to be less
risky, and will be reluctant to lend much for low-incoma housing. Thus, there is a
ueed for woVn resources, which will serve to expand the supply of financing for
lower-priced houses, and help to attract the commercial banks to this segment of the
market, thus promoting their understanding, interest and involvement in it.
Continued Bank involvement In the sector is particularly Important, as the momentum
for deregulation and reform within Mexico is strong and the need to develop a more
effective market-based housing finance system, which can reach a wider segment of
the population, is growing.
13    Actions Aareed. During negotiations agreement was reached that FOVI would:
(a) assign funds to private developers exclusively through its auction system; (b)
promote, sign and monitor deregulation agreements with at least 22 (out of 32)
states by June 30, 1994; (c) carry out annual nationvide surveys of regulatory costs
for housing projects which it has financed, and publish the results by March 31 of
each year, in a form and publication satisfactory to the Bank; (d) carry out studies
on the creation of a secondary mortgage market, on the development of a new index to
adjust payments on FOVI mortgages, and on information needs for housing finnee and
production under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank and In accordance with
agreed tMietables and reach asreement on Implementation of appropriate actions; (e)
carry out jointly with the Bank and the 0O01, by June 30 of each year, an annual
review, as vall as a mid-term review, by June 30, 1994, of the progress made In
achieving the project's objectives and execute to the satisfaction of the Bank plans
of action agreed during the annual (and mid-term) progress reviews; (f) provide the
Bank, annually, information to asssess whether the housing sector regulatory
environment in each state is "favorable" or "unfavorable" for housing development,
and inform the Bank of the proportion of POVI financing made available through the
POVI auction for housing in each state since loan signing; and (g) at the mid-term
review, the Bank would make, for each state, a regulatory environment assessment.
If, as a result of this assessment, the Bank determines that more than 401 of POVI
financing (since loan signing) was assigned to developers in states assessed by the
Bank as having an "unfavorable" regulatory environment, then POVI would prepare and
implement an action plan, satisfactory to the Bank, to Improve the means used to
encourage housing sector deregulation In those states deemed to have an
uvnfavorable- regulatory environment. At negotiations, the GON also confirmed its
c6mmitment to carry out its Housing Sector Policy Declaration, the progress of which
would be evaluated at the annual and mid-term reviews, with particular attention
given to: (i) the deregulatiou program, (ii) the liberalization and expansion of the
urban land market, (iII) FOVI measures to channel the majority of its financing to
lower income households, to induce banks and developers to expand investment in low-
cost housing, -td to remain financially self-sufficient, and (iv) the results of the
reforms to the pensio funds' housing programs. If the GOM is taking actions during
project execution which are inconsistent with the Housing Sector Policy Declaration,
then the Bank could suspend loa disbursoments. A condition of effectiveness would
be a subsidiary loan agreemw- t between POVI and BANOBIAS, satisfactory to the Bank,



-s -
for the transfer of loan proceeds to POVT. An event of default would be the
abandon nt of the OVI auction system.
14. Beeilts. The project would increase the supply of affordable housing to
lower income households, especially by promoting the provision of non-traditional
housing solutions. In addition, the improvements in the efficiency of the housing
finance system and deregulation measures should be reflected in an overall reduction
in the price of housing and an increase in housing production. Furthermore, the
project studies would provide the analytical basis for Important future government
action to Improve both public and private sector participation In the housing
market, and for the integration of the housing finance system vith the overall
financial markets, which should lead to enhanced liquidity and resource mobilization
for mortgage lenders.
15.  Rwirpnmertal ImJ 8ct. The project is rated B. The federal government in
general, and most state and local governments in particular, have adequate laws,
regulatione and codes governing urban development and land use planning (which cover
the construction of housing projects) to ensure against environmental degradation.
For those few states which have not yet fully adopted the federal government's
standards for urban development and land use planning, 1OVI has begun including in
deregulation agreements it is signing with state governments (Pee para. 5) a clause
which would encourage the state to adopt the federal standards. Furthermore, while
the institutional capacities of the federal government, and of the states and
municipalities, to monitor and enforce their respective environmental protection
responsibilities need to be strengthened, the most suitable way to address this
matter Is through the Bank's dialogue and project work in urban development,
municipal strengthening aid environmental protection. As the project will offer
home financing to low- and modest-income households, mauy of today's environmental
problems derived from substandard housing conditions would be avoided in newly-
developed areas.
16. Prorram Obiective C A*etoriee. By addressing sector-wide issuee related to
regulations, the land market and the role of the public sector in housing, the
project would permit FOVI and private builders and lenders to significantly expand
the coverage of their housing programs to reach segments of the population close to
the poverty line.
17. Riska. The Government's strong commitment to sector reform is evidenced in
recent measures taken to overhaul the esido system and to make major improvements in
the operations and cost recovery of the pension funds' housing programs. There are
no specific risks with regard to the GOM's fulfillment of commitments made under the
project. Past Bank experience in Mexico's housing sector is that once a program is
agreed, implementation bas proceeded smoothly. The principal project risk is that
the market mechanisms to induce deregulation may not be fully effective, or may take
longer to have a significant Impact than envisaged under the project. To minimize
risks, the project includes limits on loan disbursements to 101 to ensure adequate
tIme for the deregulation mechanisms to be implemented and to show results.
Additionally, the project provides for annual and mid-term reviews, requiring the
Government to take remedial actions, should the pace toward achieving the project's
objectives be deemed unsatisfactory.
