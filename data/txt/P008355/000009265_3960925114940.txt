PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS
THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
(LOAN 2128-CYI
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Third Highway
Project in Cyprus, for which Loan 2128-CY in the am3unt of US$12.2 million was
approved on April 20, 1982. The loan was closed on June 30, 1989, two years
behind schedule. The project implementation included all the components
contemplatea in thn SAR and Loan Agreement plus the rehabilitation of the
Nicosia-Limassol Highway (not originally contemplated). There were two
separate cancellations of funds. The first cancelation was made effective in
the amount of US$968,633.09 as of October 20, 1989. The last disbursement was
made on December 1, 1989. On January 10, 1990 the Bank informed the Borrower
that the unclaimed balance in the amount of US$964,159.47 was being canceled
retroactively to the date of the last disbursement. The total amount of this
last cancelation was composed of US$0.4 million worth of disbursement
applications that were not received in time for processing and a balance of
US$0.56 million due to civil works execution that was delayed beyond the end
of 1989. The components contemplated in SAR for construction with KFAED
financing, were executed with upgraded design standards as justified by
revised traffic counts data.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division of the
Europe Department (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Part I and III), and the
Borrower (Part II).
Preparation of this PCR was started during the Bank's final
supervision mission of the project in October 1989, and is based, inter alia,
on the Staff Appraisal Report; the Loan Agreement; supervision reports;
correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower; and internal Bank memoranda.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS
THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
(LOAN 2128-CY)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
1. Obiectives
1.01    The objectives of this project were oriented to support the overall
transport policy objectives of the Government (para 4.01), and addressed in a
timely fashion the need to attend to the rural roads netwcrk, to help expand
the main highways network and to improve the maintenance of the existing
highway network. Also, they were realistically attainable and consistent with
the degree of technical capacity and competence of the professional staff of
MCW/PWD, who received additional training through the project.
2. ImDlementation Experience
2.01    The project had a very slow start-up period due to delays in
contractor prequalification and in preparing the civil works bidding
documents. These delays accounted for one of the two additional years,
required to complete the project. The second year was required for the
execution of the rural roads improvement program (which could not be executed
at the speed considered at appraisal) and for the rehabilitation of the
Nicosia-Limassol Highway (not initially included in the project).
2.02    Procurement continues to require too much time in Cyprus.  Other than
this drawback, project procurement wis implemented without any major problems.
Project cost estimates were reasonably accurate. The project's cost overruns
were due to the upgraded design standards with which the Limassol By-pass and
the Ypsonas-Erimi Link were constructed, which were justified.
2.03    The decision to implement the project through a project unit,
specifically created to manage the project and coordinate interventions of
diverse MCW/PWD units has proven to be a wise one.
3. Results
3.01    The project objectives of supporting regional development, improving
traffic conditions, strengthening PWD and ensuring adequate maintenance to
existing road network, were satisfactorily attained (para 6.01). The
objective of ensuring adequate maintenance for the existing highway network
began to be reached towards the end of this project and the influence of the
Fourth Highway Project in this accomplishment was substantial. The project
was successful in promoting institutional development.



- iv -
3.02    The execution of the rural road impro"ement program reached 88 percent
of the project's physical target, defined in the SAR to be "approximately
200 km" (para 6.02). All the necessary equipment (financed through the loan)
for the vehicle inspection facilities was acquired and five out of six centers
are operating. The last one (in Paphos) is expected to be opened by the end
of 1990.
3.03    All components of the project are estimated to remain economically
justified, with the project economic return reestimated to be 20% compared to
17% at appraisal (para 6.04).
3.04    In addition to physical results, the grvatest 'mpact of the prcoject
has been in the area of promoting the development of institutional capability
previously non existing, or existing at a lesser extent and in the
implementation of a rational maintenance management system (para 6.07).
4. Sustainability
4.01    The almost trouble free implementation of the ongoing Fourth Highway
Project, (as was the case of the Third) is a clear indication of the
sustainability of this project. The continued commitment of Government and
Executing Agency are essential if the benefits attained are to continue and
increase (paras 7.01).
4.02    To this effect the continued Bank presence through the follow on
Fourth Highway Project and the Transport Sector Development Project will go a
long way in supporting the institutionalization of adequate technical/economic
criteria for road investment selection and the provision of adequate
maintenance funding (para 7.03).
5. Overall Assessment
5.01    In the Region's opinion the Third Highway Project has been a
successful one.
6. Findings and Lessons
6.01    The importance of securing in a timely fashion the required land has
once more been demonstrated with the delays in constructing the vehicle
inspection station at Paphos.
6.02    The good results of this project are linked with the continued Bank
lending in the sector through "piggy-backed projects" with similar/congruent
objectives and components.
6.03    The creation of the Project Unit has proven to have been instrumental
in the project's success. The coordinating role played by the unit has been
successful and has obviated many problems that might otherwise have hindered
the project.



6.04    Project success is due to a large part to the commitment of the
Authorities to the goals of the Project.

Loan Number        : 2128-CY
RVP Unit           : EMENA Region

Sector             : Transport
Subsector          : Highways
2. Backaround
2.01    The economic growth of Cyprus (7.5 percent per annum between 1960 and
1973) was brought to a temporary halt by the events of 1974 that de facto
divided the country. After an initial drop of the GNP by some 19 percent and
a jump of the unemployment rate to nearly 25 percent, Government policy to
reactivate the economy in the area under its control proved highly successful
and the economy recovered rapidly (prasently the GNP yearly growth stands at
about 6.0% percent and full employment conditions prevail, with some labor
snortages reported).
2.02    Bank lending to Cyprus began in 1963 with loans going mostly for
infrastructure (power, sewerage, highways and ports). The events of 1974 had
substantial impact on some of the Bank-financed projects. In particular, the
construction of the Nicosia-Morphou highway (first Bank involvement in this
subsector) had to be suspended and the unutilized balance (about US$3.6
million) was transferred to the Se-cond Highway Project, which included the
construction of the new Nicosia-Limassol highway as well as traffic studies
and a training program.
2.03    In 1979, the Government requested Bank assistance for a rural road
improvement program to sustain agricultural and mineral development in the
south, improve a;cessibility to areas remote from Nicosia and Limassol, and
ensure a balanced development of the road network. The project was prepared
by the Government with the help of consultants under the Second Highway
Project.



3. Proiect Obiectives and Descrintion
3.01    Prpiect Obiectivee.  The main objectives of the project were to:
(i) support regional agricultural and mineral development in several
less accessible rural areas in southern Cyprus and to increase the
provision of social services, through the betterment of rural
roads;
(ii) improve traffic conditions to and from Limassol port and ease
congestion on Limassol town streets by construction of the
Limassol Bypass;
(iii) strengthen the operations and administration of the PWD and Inland
Transport Department, and in particular to improve their
capability to implement and monitor the proiect components, by
providing them with technical assistance, equipment and training;
and,
(iv) ensure adequate maintenance of the existing highway network.
3.02    Proiect Descriotion.  The project provided for:
(i) a three-year time slice (about 200 km) of a program fir the
improvement of priority rural roads, to be completed by end of
1986, including minor realignment where needed as well as
widening, reconstruction and strengthening of aged or deformed
pavements on existing rural roads;
(ii) construction, with supervision, of the first two lanes of a new
Limassol bypass (about 10 km) and two-lane connecting link (about
9 km) via Ypsonas to the Limassol-Paphos road. The bypass would
connect two Bank-assisted projects, namely Limassol port (Loan
1549-CY) and new Nicosia-Limassol highway (Loan 1344-CY);
(iii) provision of testing and examination equipment for use in four
vehicle inspection centers;
(iv) provision of equipment for highway maintenance needed for the
increased maintenance operations to remedy backlog ir highway
maintenance;
(v) technical assistance to help meet project objectives
(approximately 60 man-months over a three year period) by
augmenting and strengthening the existing and management
capability of PWD; and
(vi) a training program for MCW staff to be implemented through short-
term courses on technical and operational aspects at the Higher
Technical Institute of Nicosia as well as overseas.



4. Project DesOgn and Organization
4.01    The Third Highway Project was designed to support the Governments
overall transport policy objectives to support activities leading to higher
productivity and exports, by providing essential infrastructure justifiable in
the context of the present status of the island. Since Cyprus has no railway
system, highways are of critical importance. Level of motorization is
relatively high (about 24 vehicles per 100 inhabitants), and in general
traffic on the arterial routes has increased by about 7 percent per annum . er
the last years, with growth rates even higher in certain arteries and urban
areas. The road network while generally adequate, requIred improvements not
only tc satisfy traffic pattern alterations that resulted from ;he changes in
the econ-my since 1974, but also to improve access to certain remote areas not
adequately served. In this respect the rural road improvement program adds a
new dimension to the overall highway planning.
4.02    The project concept and design was appropriate and timely in order to
ensure that adequate priority was given to the new rural roads improvements
program (RRI) that might have, otherwise, taken longer to be implemented. The
construction of the Limassol By-pass was also timely in addressing the need
(created by the changed traffic patterns) to complete the main network
connection between the Nicosia-Limassol Highway (constructed under Loan 1344-
CY) and the Limass.l port as well as the by-pass extension towards Erimi.
Since the traffic growth estimates on the basis of which these two facilities
were originally designed were underestimated, the Limaesol By-pass and the
Ypsonas-Erimi Link were constructed as full four-lane facilities after
additional economic analysis proved their upgrading to be economically
justified.
4.03    The institutional goals and technical assistance scope were also
appropriate and have attained good success. In the later years of the project
progress was also achieved towards the project's road maintenance goals.
4.04    The rehabilitation of the Nicosia-Limassol Highway (financed with
proceeds of the Loan) was added to the project after Loan Agreement
modification of August 1, 1986. This project wmdification was accepted by the
Bank in order to enhance the serviceability of the island's most important
highway, which had deteriorated more rapidly than expected, primarily due to
higher than designed traffic volumes and axle loads.
4.05    The Public Works Department (PWD) of the Ministry of Communications
and Works (MCW) was responsible for the implementation of the project. In
retrospect, the selected alternative to implement the project through a
project unit,  specifically created to manage the project, coordJnate the
interventions of the diverse MCW/PWD units involved in actual project
execution and to channel the benefits of the technical assistance, has proven
to be a wise one.
5. Proiect Im*lementation
5.01    Loan Effectiveness and Proiect Start-un.  Although Loan 2128-CY became
effective relatively promptly (five months after Board date), project start-



- 4 -
up was rather slow due primarily to delays in contractor's prequalification
and preparation of bidding documents for civil works contracting.
5.02    ImDlementation Schedule.  The project was originally scheduled to be
completed by June 30, 1987, but most of the Bank-financed project components
were only completed by December 1988. The first one year closing date
extension was required due to overall project execution delays. An additional
year was required to implement the last tranche of rural roads and the
rehabilitation of the Nicosia-Limassol highway. During this second additional
year, the upgrading of the Ypsonas-Erimi link (KFAED financing) to a full
four-lane divided facility with split level intersectlons, was carried-out.
One of the vehicle inspections facilities (at Paphos) is still pending
construction due to delays in obtaining adequate land. Completion of this
facility is expected by the end of 1990. The main reasons for the initial
overall project delays were:
(a) lengthy contractor prequalification process;
(b) lengthy civil works bidding documents preparation;
(c) slow bidding process and the customary time-consuming process on the
part of the Main Tender Board in determining the successful bidder;
5.03    In addition to the obvious implementation delays that the project
encountered, the estimated project execution schedule was probably somewhat
optimistic. This was implicitly acknowledged in the SAR of the Fourth Highway
Project (appraised during the early years of implementation of the Third),
whose implementation schedule considered a six-years project execution (as
opposed to only four years for the Third).
5.04    Procurement.  Except for the already mentioned procurement delays, no
major procedural problems were encountered. Once agreement was reached
regarding the Bank's bidding procedures, procurement proceeded somewhat
faster, although the time taken at the Main Tender Board level has not
improved.
5.05    Proiect Costs.  The estimated cost of the Third Highway Project at
appraisal was about US$48.0 million. The final cost is about US$50.2 million
as shown in Table 5A in Part III. The increase in total cost of about 4
percent was due to the improved standards of construction of the Limassol By-
pass and the Erimi-Ypsonas Link. The cost increase of these standard-improved
components was partially offset by the saving attained with the reduced
construction of the RRI program (initially contemplated at 200 km. of which
only 175.7 were constructed), as well as smaller than contemplated equipment
.Costs.
5.06    Disbursements.  Estimated disbursements of the Loan 2128-CY are given
in Table 3 in Part III. Disbursements were delayed due to project start-up
delays and slow project implementation. The original closing date was June
.30, 1987; efter two extension the final closing became June 30, 1989. In
October 20,1989 the Borrower requested the cancellation of approximately
US$0.9 million not necessary for project completion.   Disbursements against
commitments were made until December 1, 1989 and an outstanding balance of



approximately US$1.0 million was cancelled retroactively to the date of the
last disbursement. The total amount of this last cancelation was composed of
US$0.4 million worth of disbursement applications that were not received in
time to be processed and a balance of US$0.56 million due to civil works
execution that was delayed beyond the end of 1989.
5.07    Loan Allocation.  The original and revised allocation and actual
disbursements for the Loan 2128-CY are shown in Table 5 Part III. The
original allocations were revised in 1986 to reflect changes in project
composition, --i.e. the inclusion of the Nicosia-Limassol Highway
rehabilitation works and the reduced amount of kilometers in RRI program.
6. Proiect Results
6.01    Proiect Objectives.  Overall, the project was successful in meeting
its principal objectives of supporting regional development through the RRI
program (although the initial project target for this component was not
reached); of improving traffic conditions to and from Limassol port and easing
congestion on Limassol town; of promoting the technical development of PWD;
and in the last years of the loan, also of improving the level of maintenance
of the existing highway network.
6.02    Physical Results.  The physical target of the RRI program was not
fully reached, only 176 km. of rural roads were improved (88 percent of the
target of about 200 km.). This nevertheless had no detrimental effect on the
project because the execution of the Fourth Highway Project (that overlapped
by more than three years with this one), also has a RRI component that has
continued to be successful. The other project target that was not attained by
closing date, namely the construction of vehicle inspection stations, will be
completed by end of 1990.
6.03    On the other hand the rehabilitation of the Nicosia-Limassol Highway
that was not contemplated in the original project design added to the benefits
obtained through the project. The decision to implement this work during the
execution of this project, appears to have been a sound one since a
postponement of the rehabilitation would have caused the reconstruction costs
to be much higher.
6.04    Economic Results.  The weighted average economic return for the
project is now estimated to be 20%, compared to 17% at appraisal, and the
project is considered economically justified.
6.05    At appraisal, the economic return for the first year of the rural
roads improvement program (56.5 km) was estimated to be 16%. A total of 175.7
km were eventually improved during 1985-89 under the program at a cost of 12.0
million Cyprus Pounds. Traffic levels on the improved roads generally ranged
from 300-3000 vpd, with one suburban section carrying about 5800 vpd. The
program is now estimated to have a weighted average economic return of 25%,
with all except one of the 25 sections having an economic return greater than
10% (Table 6B in Part III). The increase in the reeatimated economic return
is due to higher levels of traffic than were assumed at appraisal.



6.06    At appraisal, traffic on the Limassol By-pass and Ypsonas-Erimi link
was forecast to reach 4500-7000 vpd in 1985. Traffic in fact grew to 8000-
20000 vpd in 1989, due primarily to the rapid growth of tourist traffic in the
Limassol area, as well as to the growth of traffic at the port of Limassol.
It was therefore decided during project implementation to construct both road
sections to four-lane standard, rather than two-lane standard as anticipated
at appraisal. The final cost of the four-lane facilities is now estimated to
be 10.7 million Cyprus Pounds. The economic return for both sections in
reestimated to be 15%, compared to 22% eptimated at appraisal. The moderate
decrease in the estimated economic return is due to the additional cost of
constructing the facility to four lane standard. However, this reestimated
rate of return does not capture all the benefits due to the better level of
service resulting from the construction to four-lane standard.
6.07    Imoact of Prolect.  In addition to the physical results, which will
have a significant impact in the economic development of the country, the
greatest impact of this project has probably been in promoting the development
of institutional capability which was previously non existent, or existed to a
lesser extent, and in providing the technical tools and the methodology
necessary for the implementation of a rational maintenance management system
(RMMS). This system has been very successful and is fully operational. In
the preparation of the feasibility studies for the initial tranches of the RRI
program, PWD had to rely on the assistance of outside consultants; starting
with the latter tranches of this component, all the feasibility studies for
this type of work are now adequately prepared in-house.
6.08    The project has also been instrumental in promoting within PWD the
practice to approach roal investments with rational economic/technical
criteria, and in subste;.tially expanding MCW/PWD's capability to prepare, in-
house, the terms of reference and proposal-invitation documents for studies as
well as the bidding documents and technical specifications for civil works and
equipment procurement.
6.09    The greatest benefit derived from the project is the substantial
progress in institutionalization of rational criteria in the selection of road
investments and adequate road maintenance budget allocation.
7. Proiect Sustainability
7.01    As indicated, the Project has had significant benefits in the
following:
(a) drawing adequate attention to the need to improve the rural road
network and increasing the availability of funds for this purpose;
(b) strengthening PWD's technical capability
(c) increasing the coverage of the primary network with road
investments selected through adequate technical/economic criteria,
and promoting the establishment of these criteria as the only ones
used in the selection of road investments; and,



(d) promoting an increase in the budget allocated for mnaintenance of
the exiting road network and providing PWD with the necessary
tools and methodology to carry-out a rational maintenance program.
7.02    The success encountered by this project was largely due to the
Government's and the Executing Agency's commitment to the project's
objectives. The continued commitment of Government and Executing Agency are
essential if the benefits attained through this project are to continue and
increase.
7.03    The Fourth Highway Project (Loan 2684-CY) and the Transport Sector
Development Project (Loan 2906-CY) presently under implementation, share with
this project similar objectives. This extended Bank participation in the
sector and the continuity of project objectives, should have a major impact in
the institutionalization of adequate technical/economic criteria for road
investment and the provision of adequate road maintenance budget allocations.
8. Bank Performance
8.01    Through the Third Highway Project, the Bank has made positive
contributions to the physical development of the sector and to the
institutional development of the Agency in charge.
8.02    Bank performance has been satisfactory.  Project preparation was
timely and thorough. Although discussions of contractors' prequalification
and bidding documents were started well in advance of Loan Negotiations, the
delays encountered in this respect were caused by what appears to have been
difficulties on the part of the Executing Agency to adapt to the Bank's
procurement practices. However, once this obstacle was resolved project
execution developed almost problem free.
8.03    The timeliness of Bank's response to the requests made by Borrower and
Executing Agency was satisfactory as was the periodicity with which the
Supervision missions were scheduled, with the possible exception of 1989 when
only one mission could be programed. The three changes in Task Management
that the project underwent do not appear to have had any ill effects on the
project, and Task Management transition appears to have been smooth. On the
other hand, the procurement delays that this project suffered throughout its
implementation continue to exist in the ongoing projects, in spite of specific
project objectives to address this issue (Loan 2906-CY).
8.04    In retrospect the following lessons may be learnt from the experience
of this project:
(a) the contemplated implementation schedule was possibly too optimistic;
this lesson has been applied in preparing the Fourth Highway Project,
whose implementation schedule was set at BiX years (two more than this
project's);
(b) the clearly valuable impact and the benefits obtained through this
project (outside of its physical results), cannot be objectively
assessed without due regard to the influence that the other two,



ongoing projects, had in their attainment. In this regard the lesson,
once again, is the importance of the Bank's continued involvement in a
sector and the benefit accruing through "piggy-backed" projects;
(C)  the project experiencr substantiates, once again, the importance that
firm commitment to project objectives, on the part of the
Borrower/Executing Agency have for the success of a project;
(d) although the delay in constructing the vehicle inspection facility did
not have any serious detrimental effect in the project's overall
impact/benefits, it nevertheless highlights the importance that timely
land acquisition has in preventing major project delays.
9. Borrower Performance
9.01     Table 7 Part III contains the review of the compliance with Loan
Agreement covenants by the Borrower (Government) and the executing agency (PWD).
Except for the delays in producing the annual highway maintenance program
(complied with only after 1984) and in submitting the Audited Report for fiscal
year 1989, performance has been good.
9.02     Project execution was particularly problem free.  There were some delays
during project preparation and appraisal, but cooperation and support were
adequate.
9.03     The project unit was created in a timely fashion and staffed with
qualified personnel and, within the confines of its authority, performed
satisfactorily throughout. project implementation.
9.04     With the exception of the delays in increasing the budgetary road
maintenance allocations (this goal began to be attained only after 1985), the
Government's and PWD's commitment to the project's goals were very strong
throughout project implementation.
9.05     In general the time needed for the procurement process still continues
to be too long, particularly the time required by the Main Tender Board to make
its award recommendation. This remains so in spite of the procedures review that
was included and carried out under the Transport Sector Project (Loan 2906-CY).
In this regard the Executing Agency is clearly not at fault since the delay takes
place outside its area of jurisdiction.
9.06     The main lessons that can be learnt by the Borrower and the Executing
Agency from the experience of this project are:
(a) the large economic benefits derived from the RRI program, and the
importance to retairn, and hopefully increase, the in-house technical
capability to prepare and evaluate the yearly proposals for this
program; hence, the relevance of a focused and continued training
program for the technical staff;
(b) the importance of the timely acquisition of land required for project
implementation in order to prevent construction delays;



- 9 -
(c) the need to accelerate Tender Board procedures.
10. Proiect Relationship
10.01   Bank relationship with Government and PWD on the project has been
good.
11. Consulting Services
11.01   Consultant services required for the preparation of this project were
financed through the Second Highway Project (Loan 1344-CY). Similarly,
through this the Third Highway Project several studies, required for the
preparation of future projects, were financed. Table 6C of Part III presents
a summary of the studies financed through the project.
11.02   The two major studies required by the legal documents of the project
were fully implemented and have met with satisfactory results. The study to
improve rural bus service has been instrumental in the creation of new
improved companies; although the program of company creation is still under
way, it has already yielded some very tangible benefits. The study for the
preparation of a highway maintenance and rehabilitation p.ogram was also
successfully completed and the RMMS is presently fully operational with
updated road data.
12. Proiect Documentation and Data
12.01   The Loan Agreement was adequate and appropriate for achieving project
objectives. The Appraisal Report provided the Bank and the Executing Agency
with adequate information and with a useful framework for managing, monitoring
and reviewing the project implementation.

PART II
PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
The following paragraphs (Part II of the PCR) have been transcribed, without
modification from the letter of the Ministry of Pubic Works.
We refer to your letter of March 9, 1989 and the attached office
memorandum concerning the above subject, and we present herebelow Part II of
the PCR.
2.      We confirm the adequacy and accuracy of the factual information
contained in Part III of the PCR.
The missing figures in paragraph 2. Background, of Part I of tne PCR are 6%
and 2.3% for the present GNP annual growth and the present level of
unemployment respectively.
3.      The Bank's staff members have contributed significantly to the
identification, preparation, appraisal, negotiation, and
implementation/supervision of the Project by focusing attention on issues and
procedures of importance both at senior and less levels of the Administration.
This was done with tact and by exemplifying cases of action taken in similar
circumstances as set out in the Bank's guidelines. Such advice could have
been pedantic and irritating but, because of the way it was offered and the
obvious competence and experience of almost all of those who have been here,
was pertinent and helpful. The effectiveness of the relationship between the
Government and the Bank is demonstrated by current acceptance of the
importance of the following:
a)   Project appraisal and cost/benefit analysis before committing
Government to major investments. The use of such measures as economic
internal rates of return (EIRR's), net present values of benefits and
cost streams (NPV's), first year rates of return and the sensitivity
tests of results is now in general use whereas before it was not. It
is also recognised that over concentration on these measures without a
careful consideration of the issues which need to be studied and the
nature of the evaluations themselves has its own dangers. Of
particular importance is this respect would be traffic growth
estimates especially those relating to diversion of traffic and
generation of new traffic because of a proposed investment.
b)    Engagement of Consulting firms.  The disciplines insisted upon by the
Bank have ensured that consideration of technical competence is of
paramount importance in the selection of consultants. The methodology
which is now adopted for the commissioning of Consultants is that
described in the "Guidelines for the use of Consultants by World Bank
Borrowers and by The World Bank as Executive Agency". Government
personnel have gained considerable experience in all stages of the
procedures including those of invita:ion, efvaluation and awards. As a
result of the review and approval by the Bank of the proposed terms of



- 11 -
reference for projects, important modifications have been made which
have contributed to the success of the assignment.
As a result of the Bank's policy to encourage the setting up and
promote the development of domestic consulting firms, a number of
local firms have entered into association with foreign firms. This
has led to the transfer of skill to the benefit of local firms. The
experience thus gained by local firms will help them to undertake in
future assignments by themselves.
c)    The procurement of civil works is now carried out using, the Bank
Guidelines and the sample Bidding Documents used by the IBRD.
Initially valuable guidance was obtained from the World Bank through
its missions to Cyprus and directly Washington. This assistance has
helped us refine our documents to a point which, from our recent
experience, the problems that arise during post-tendering period are
minimal.
d)    Procurement of goods is now accomplished by using detailed bidding
documents which have been developed on the basis of "sample bidding
documents" which were prepared jointly by the Asian Development Bank,
the Inter-American Development Bank and the World Bank and resulting
from broad international experience. These documents have helped the
Government to award contracts to lowest evaluated bidders, and not on
price quotation alone. This has led to the securing of better quality
equipment.
e)    Road maintenance was little appreciated before the Bank's involvement
with us. The value of easier communications was already appreciated
but the methodical maintaining of the road network is now increasingly
understood. A good example of this is the experience of the Nicosia-
Limassol arterial highway. This was a road which was under-designed
at the outset, was subjected to a massive traffic growth of more than
10% per annum from its opening and suffered from a poor road pavement
resulting in the need for a partial reconstruction and replacement of
the asphaltic layers after only a few years. Observed deterioration
of road surface is now the basis for centrally programmed maintenance
effort with the newly established Maintenance Section using the Road
Maintenance Management System (RMMS) the introduction of which was the
result of a maintenance study carried out by foreign consultants.
This study was indicated by the Bank and made the Government aware
that adequate funding for maintenance was justified. The annual
allocation for road maintenance has increased in such a way so as to
remedy in phased manner the backlog in road maintenance from previous
years.
f)    The environmental inipact of road developments and construction was
particularly highlighted in the study of road access to Tillyria and
in subsequent work. The effects on flora and fauna and the changes in
land use in ecologically and socially sensitive areas was recognised.
For the first time the impacts of development on land use, water and
air quality, the landscape, soil erosion and the risk of fire damage
and the obliteration'of antiquities were noted and attempt made to



- 12 -
quantify the costS of minimising adverse effecte. Tourisn. is now an
important part of the island's economy and tourist related employment
is well over the 20,000 jobs estimated at that time. To avoid
destruction of the very environment which attracts tourist and which
should remain a national heritage is now a common awareness. Th- cost
of minimising spillage of spoiled material on mountain slopes are
increasingly considered when making contractual arrangements with
construction companies.
g)    Training of personnel in the Ministry of Communications and Works so
that they appreciate the new technologies available and their use and
limitations. Sixty MCW personnel attended overseas courses in various
professional skills whilst many others have undergone local training
at the Nicosia Higher Technical Institute.
h)   Road safety and the costs to the community of poor driver performance
and geometrically substandard roads and highway especially in view of
the growing vehicle population of the island and more intensive use of
cars, trucks and buses.
4.     Adherence to Bank guidelines and target dates during the
implementation of Projects was one of the Government's main concerns. We have
for the greater part of the project cycles matched the schedules set with the
Bank. The project duration was, however, in two cases extended by one year
due to lengthy procurement procedures. Advice from the Bank through the
various supervision missions to Cyprus and the subsequent aide-memoires were
an invaluable assistance to the Government when taking accelerated action as
necessary to avoid bottlenecks and delays.
s.     No small part of the successes of the Third Highway Project for Cyprus
has been the tactful reminding by the Bank Mission members of the importance
of proper reporting as part of the administration and management of the
projects. As a matter of self discipline we now regularly produce monthly
reports of general progress and regular reports on particular road projects.
This has helped at &'l levels of the Administration. The availability of
succinct Aide-Memoires every six months or so are invaluable.

reasonable to assume a uniform rate of implementation, which yields
50 km. of RR1 per year.
ai    Considering a total implementation time of 6 years.  If allowance is
made for the initial delay of one year, che implementation rate over an
execution time of 5 years would be 35 km. per year, that still is
substantially lower than the implicit SAR target.

Comments:
In the SAR the only direct-benefit indicator given is the number of kilometers
of rural roads to be improved. Additional direct-benefit indicators have been
obtained by direct counting and estimations made by PWD that, although cannot
be compared with the expected ones at appraisal, nevertheless give an
indication of benefits obtained through the project.

average)
Note:
The economic return for the project was reestimated using actual or estimated
final construction costs, the most recent available traffic counts, and
current vehicle operating cost estimates. Traffic counts were carried out
shortly before construction of each of the 25 sections of the rural roads
improvement program, as well as after construction for five of the rural road
sections and the Limassol By-pass and Ypsonas-Erimi link. A comparison of the
before and after rural road traffic counts revealed little change beyond what
would be expected from normal traffic growth, so that the pre-construction
counts were used in the reevaluation for the remaining rural roads, after
adjusting them to the opening date assuming and average growth rate of 4.5%
p.a. Land costs were estimated to add 20% to the cost of construction of the
Limassol By-pass and Ypsonas-Erimi link. The tax component of construction
costs is small, and was disregarded. Costs and benefits were adjusted to 1989
levels using a Cyprus construction cost index. Vehicle operating cost
(including time costs) were derived by the Public Works Department from HDM3
and TRRL data, and are considered reasonable. Roughness was generally assumed
tL be 6000 mm/km before rural road improvements, and 2000 mm/km following
improvement. Roughness was assumed to be 3500 mm/km on parallel existing
roads before construction of the Limassol By-pass and Ypsonas-Erimi link, and
1500 mm/km on the new roads. Improvements were evaluated over a 20 year
period, with future traffic assumed to grow 4.5% p.a.
Details of the calculation are shown on Annex A.
