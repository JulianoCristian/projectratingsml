THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:                Republic of Cyprus
Amount:                  US$12.2 million equivalent in various currencies
(including the capitalized front-end fee).
Terms:                   Repayment in equal installments over 15 years,
including 3 years of grace, at an interest rate of
11.6 percent per annum.
Project Description:  The main objectives of the project are to support the
economic development of less accessible areas through
the betterment of rural roads, improve traffic
conditions in the Limassol area, ensure adequate
highway maintenance, and strengthen the operations of
the PWD and Inland Transport Department. The project
would comprise: (i a program for the improvement
of up to 200 km of priority rural roads; (ii)
construction of the first two lanes of a new Limassol
bypass (about 10 kin) and a two-lane connecting link
(about 9 kin) via Ypsonas to the Limassol-Paphos road;
(iii) provision of testing and examination equipment
for use in the vehicle inspection centers to be set
up by the Government; (iv) provision of equipment
for highway maintenance; (v) technical assistance to
help meet project objectives; and (vi) a training
program for MCW staff.
Project Benefits         The improvement of the selected rural roads
and Risks:            would support the Government's agricultural and
mineral development plans, stimulate tourism
development, and help to accelerate economic
development of outlying and remote areas. The
Limassol bypass would provide an efficient economic
link between Limassol port and the new
Nicosia-Limassol highway, and help reduce growing
traffic congestion and economic losses in the town
center. The institution building components of the
project would benefit Government agencies in the
transport sector, and the vehicle inspection centers
would promote road safety on the island.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS
FOR A THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Cyprus for the equivalent of US$12.2 million to help
finance a portion of the foreign exchange costs of a third highway project.
The loan, which includes the capitalized front-end fee, would be repaid over
15 years including 3 years of grace, with interest at 11.6 percent per annum.
Parallel financing of about $8.3 million to cover the balance of the foreign
exchange costs of the project would be provided by the Kuwait Fund for Arab
Economic Development.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.       The last economic report on Cyprus (No. 2895-CY) was circulated to
the Executive Directors in June 1980. There have been two follow-up missions
in July 1981 and January 1982; their findings are reflected in this Part.
Although these missions visited all economically important areas in Cyprus and
had discussions with the Government as well as the Turkish Cypriot
authorities, it has not been possible to assess fully the economic situation
and prospects of the whole island, given the extremely limited economic data
base for northern Cyprus, which is under Turkish Cypriot control. Hence the
analysis provided in this and other Parts of this Report relates only to the
Government-controlled part in southern Cyprus. The Basic Country Data is
provided in Annex 1.
General Background
3.       The Cyprus economy grew at over 7.5 percent per annum between 1960
and 1973, despite tension between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot
communities. The major contributing factors were a competent public
administration, dynamic entrepreneurs, a high rate of investment especially in
the private sector, a rapid increase in agricultural exports contributing to a
strong overall balance of payments, and flexible fiscal and monetary policies,
which helped to stimulate growth while maintaining domestic price stability.
4.       The 1974 events brought a sudden, although temporary, end to this
long period of economic growth. Since then, the country has de facto been
divided into two parts by a ceasefire line, with increasingly less movement of
people and goods between them. The southern part under the Government's
control accounts for 64 percent of the area of the island and over 77 percent
of total population. In the northern part under Turkish Cypriot control, 23
percent of the total population live on 36 percent of the land area. About
one-third of total population was displaced by the 1974 events, with nearly
180,000 Greek Cypriots moving south, and approximately 45,000 Turkish Cypriots
moving north. Most of the displaced population has now been resettled.
UN-sponsored intercommunal talks to find a possible political solution have
been held intermittently since 1978; but prospects for agreeing on a permanent
solution remain uncertain.



- 2 -
Recent Developments and Short-term Outlook
5.        With the displacement of population and severance of sectoral
linkages in mid-1974, the GNP dropped by some 19 percent, the unemployment
rate jumped to nearly 25 percent of the labor force, and exports and imports
fell by about 55 percent in the second half of 1974. The drop in export
earnings reflected the loss from the non-exploitation of about one-half of
Cyprus's cultivated land area (which produced over 50 percent of its
agricultural exports) and the non-utilization of about two-thirds of the
island's tourist facilities.                                                                4
6.        Government policy to reactivate the economy in the area under its
control proved highly successful. The economy recovered rapidly, with GDP (in
real terms) growing annually by an average of 13.8 percent between 1975 and
1980. Since 1979, the growth rate has slowed down and was about 3.5 percent
in 1981, largely because the economy rapidly reached full capacity. The level
of unemployment decreased from over 16 percent in 1975 to about 2 percent in
1980.
7.        Despite rapid growth and employment, the rate of inflation remained
modest.  Prices rose from 7.5 percent in 1978 to 13 percent in 1980, but
declined to 10 percent in 1981. With imports representing almost 60 percent
of GDP, increases in import prices strongly influenced the level of domestic
prices. Furthermore, increased private and public consumption, and public
sector investment expenditures (including for resettlement of refugees) have
pushed up domestic demand, particularly for local products, beyond the
productive capacity of the economy since 1979. Also, the emergence of several
politically strong trade unions helped labor attain wage settlements at rates
exceeding increases in productivity.
8.        Expansionary public finance and monetary policies were the
instruments used by the Government to reactivate the economy after 1974.
However, the budget remained expansionary, even after near full employment was
reached in 1978. Overall budgetary deficits averaging about 7 percent of GDP
during 1979-81, have been financed mainly by grants and external borrowing,
and by some borrowing from the Central Bank. The Government believes that it
may be able to slow down expenditures, despite the need to grant salary
increases to civil servants whose pay was frozen until mid-1977; to continue
some refugee assistance; and to complete ongoing investment projects.
However, its attempts to reduce subsidies gradually for grain and vine
products are meeting strong resistance in Parliament. Similarly, its proposal
to permit an increase in interest rates above the 15-year old ceiling of 9
percent in line with current economic needs has not yet been accepted by
Parliament. In the circumstances, the Government has attempted to increase
revenues by changing the tax system to suit the changed economic conditions;
this has already significantly improved the tax-GDP ratio, from about 15
percent in 1978 to over 18 percent in 1981.
9.        In an effort to restrain domestic price increases, the Central Bank
initially took limited measures to restrict new loans to importers and
distributors and reduce loans by hire-purchase finance companies. But since



- 3 -
late 1979, more comprehensive measures have been taken to reduce bank
liquidity and restrain credit expansion. The effectiveness of monetary
policy, however, remains hampered by the abovementioned interest rate ceiling.
10.       The changes in the tax system and measures to restrain credit
expansion have had a significant beneficial impact on the economy. Consumer
and investment demands have softened, resulting in some decline in the
inflation rate in 1981; this triggered only a minor rise in unemployment to
about 2.5 percent at end-1981.
11.       Stimulated by expanding local demand for consumer and investment
goods, imports had increased rapidly until early 1980, causing a large
increase in the current account balance of payments deficit. However,
external capital inflows were also rising, so that the overall balance of
payments remained sound. During 1981, import growth slowed down a little as
overall growth decelerated while export growth remained strong, resulting in
improved balance of payments. Foreign exchange reserves equalled about four
months of imports at the end of 1981, a satisfactory position despite
political uncertainties. Recent trends show that further substantial
increases in exports as well as in tourism revenues can be expected. As a
result, the balance of payments situation is expected to remain healthy in the
coming years.
Medium-Term Prospects
12.       The Government has been drafting the Fourth Emergency Economic
Action Plan (1982-1986) for the area under its control. It foresees a modest,
but realistic, GDP growth rate of about 4.0 percent per year, based on a
continuing shift in development strategy toward medium-scale, higher
technology, relatively more capital-intensive investments; consolidation of
small factories into larger units, to realize economies of scale; and export
and tourism as the major engines of growth. In addition, increased emphasis
is put on the promotion of international services such as off-shore banking to
cater to Middle Eastern and North African countries.
13.       Since the total labor force is unlikely to increase by more than 1.8
percent per annum, the draft Plan targets imply an annual increase in labor
productivity of some 2.2 percent. Achievement of such an increase will
require some changes in the present structure of the economy, including
increasingly capital-intensive investments in manufacturing and agriculture,
and a progressive shift of the labor force from relatively low productivity
employment in agriculture to more productive medium and large scale
manufacturing and services.
14.       The increase in the level of public investments needed to make this
structural change will require special efforts to mobilize domestic savings.
Recognizing this need, the Government proposes to press its efforts to augment
tax revenues, and obtain early approval to adjust interest rates to a level
where they can function as effective resource mobilization and allocation
tools.



- 4 -
15.       Cyprus will also need an increasing inflow of foreign capital to
help finance the necessary restructuring of its economy. Access to long-term
concessionary bilateral and multilateral support is expected to become
increasingly limited. Consequently, despite some continuing Greek, German, UK
and Council of Europe assistance, most future public external borrowing to
cover the projected current account deficits will have to come from commercial
sources, either in the form of export or suppliers' credit, or as commercial
bank loans. Considering the continuing political uncertainties, Cyprus'
recent experience in mobilizing concessionary external resources has been
encouraging.  It successfully raised Eurodollar borrowings in late 1977 of $30
million, followed by loans of $40 million in July 1978, $10 million in
November 1978, $48 million in July 1980 and $85 million in September 1981.
The country is also beginning to attract significant export and suppliers'
credits. These forms of external borrowing are indicative of the probable
future trend.
16.       The Bank's efforts to date have been directed towards encouraging
Cyprus not only to diversify its sources of official aid, but also to use Bank
projects as catalysts to attract other external support, including cofinancing
with commercial banks. Thus, besides the cofinancing from bilateral and
multilateral sources for Bank loans approved up to 1979, commercial bank
cofinancing has been arranged in 1980, in connection with the Third Cyprus
Development Bank Project (Loan 1744-CY), and substantial suppliers' credit and
a Euro-currency loan for the Power Transmission and Distribution Project (Loan
1873-CY).
17.       Cyprus's external debt has so far remained low, because of the past
policy of financing development from internal resources and the availability
of substantial levels of foreign grant aid from Greece and the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), mainly for refugee assistance (ranging
from $36 to $59 million per year since 1974). Total long-term public debt
outstanding and disbursed was $399.8 million as of December 31, 1980. Public
debt service was about 5.6 percent of exports in 1980. However, given the
increasing future reliance on commercial financing, debt service is projected
to exceed 18 percent of goods and nonfactor services by the mid-eighties. The
Bank's share of debt outstanding and disbursed declined from 51 percent in
1975 to about 15 percent at the end of 1980, while its share in debt service
declined from 47 percent in 1975 to about 14 percent in 1980. Thus the Bank's
exposure, once quite high, has now declined to a more normal level and is
expected to continue to decline further. Given this background and the
Government's record of economic management, the country continues to be
creditworthy for Bank lending.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN CYPRUS
18.       Bank lending to Cyprus began in 1963.  As of September 30, 1981,
eighteen loans totalling $150.0 million (net of cancellations) were made; of
this, about $122.2 million was held by the Bank. The main areas of
concentration have been infrastructure (power, sewerage, highways and ports),
industry through the Cyprus Development Bank, agriculture and water resource
development. Details of Bank loans to Cyprus are given in Annex II as of
September 30, 1981.



-  5 -
19.       The events of 1974 had a substantial impact on some of the ongoing
Bank-financed projects, as well as on planned operations. In particular, the
execution of the following projects was affected: (i) the sewerage project in
Famagusta, which lay entirely in the area controlled by the Turkish Cypriots;
and (ii) the construction of the Nicosia-Morphou highway, the alignment of
which coincided with the ceasefire line. Even though the Famagusta Sewerage
i        Project was 90 percent complete when construction was interrupted, it could
not be commissioned in the absence of a political settlement, and the
undisbursed balance of the loan was eventually cancelled. In the case of the
*        Nicosia-Morphou highway, construction of which was suspended, and remains so,
after only one month of work, the unutilized balance of about $3.6 million was
transferred to the Second Highway Project. The Nicosia Sewerage Project,
which straddled the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot areas of Nicosia, was
also incomplete. However, as a result of the initiative of the UNDP and the
Bank, Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot cooperation on this matter was
engendered and a formal agreement to complete the project reached in September
1978; thereafter, based on those arrangements, and continuing cooperation
displayed by both sides in their implementation, the project has been
completed in 1980 and is now benefiting both communities. As regards planned
operations, a number of projects under study, or contemplated, before 1974,
which were intended to benefit directly both communities, could not be pursued
because of the de facto division of the island. The Bank, together with UNDP,
will continue to explore areas where cooperation appears possible, although
substantial progress may have to await a political settlement.
20.       Disbursement performance with regard to Bank operations in Cyprus is
generally satisfactory and compares favorably with experience elsewhere. The
only loans on which disbursements have been significantly slower than
anticipated relate to the Second Highway Project (Loan 1344-CY) and the
Vasilikos-Pendaskinos Project (Loan 1658-CY). This is primarily related to
difficulties faced by the contractor in the former case, and to delays in the
appointment of consultants in the latter case. The status of the ongoing
Second Highway Project is discussed in detail in para. 33. Work on the
Vasilikos-Pendaskinos Project has now picked up and is expected to proceed
smoothly.
21.       The Bank's objectives in Cyprus continue to support activities
leading to higher productivity and exports, providing essential infrastructure
justifiable in the context of the whole island; and to cooperate in attracting
long-term development capital from other sources. Within this overall
context, Bank lending has made a substantial contribution towards assisting
Cyprus to recover from the 1974 events, especially in acting as a catalyst to
mobilize long term financing from other sources. The Government recognizes
that given the relatively high per capita income in Cyprus, Bank lending has
continued so far because of the special circumstances prevailing in the
country, and can be expected to taper-off gradually in the medium-term. In
the circumstances, projects being developed for the next 2 to 3 years include
those representing innovation for the country, such as a renewable energy
production/energy conservation project and a project for integrating and
transferring scarce water resources between different basins in the country.

22.       IFC's first investment in Cyprus was in a cement company in 1972.
The company has since become a leader in the country's successful export
drive. IFC has most recently invested in an asbestos cement pipe plant, and
is currently exploring opportunities for further investment in the island. As
of September 30, 1981, gross commitments totalled $3.6 million, of which $1.3
million are still held by IFC. Details of IFC investments in Cyprus are given
in Annex ITI.
PART III - TRANSPORTATION IN CYPRUS
23.       Prior to 1974, the transportation system in Cyprus was reasonably
balanced, comprising roads, ports, airports and a limited amount of coastal
shipping. The events of 1974, culminating in the de facto division of the
island into two communal zones, resulted in significant disruptions to the
transport sector. Currently there is negligible movement between the southern
and northern parts of the island, although this situation could change
materially if and when a political settlement is reached. The description
that follows refers essentially to the Government-controlled southern part of
Cyprus.
24.       Ports and Airports:  Since the 1974 events, the Government has
undertaken a series of improvements to the existing transport system. With
the closing of Nicosia airport (now under United Nations control), the Larnaca
airport has been upgraded to accommodate medium- and long-range jet aircraft.
Another airport designed to international standards is under construction at
Paphos. Until July 1974, the main general cargo port in Cyprus was Famagusta,
which handled over 80 percent of the country's traffic. Currently Limassol
port (improved and expanded under Bank Loan 1540-CY) is primarily relied on
for general cargo, while Larnaca port 'is predominantly used for the import of
petroleum products and export of agricultural produce and cement. A new
cement export facility is under construction at Vasilikos on the south coast.
25.       Highways:  As Cyprus has no railway system, highways are of critical
importance. The present level of motorization (about 24 vehicles per 100
inhabitants) is the highest amongst developing countries along the eastern
Mediterranean. In general, traffic on the arterial routes has increased by
about 7 percent per annum over the last six years, with the growth rate being
even higher on the Nicosia-Limassol road. The highway network radiates from
the capital, Nicosia, through the hinterland to the main coastal centers of
Limassol, Larnaca and Paphos. However, of about 9,500 km of roads, only 4,300
km are paved. The main highways account for about 1,900 km, of which 1,800 km
are bitumen paved, with the remainder of the system being made up of
municipal, minor and forest roads. The road network, while generally
adequate, requires improvements not only to satisfy traffic pattern
alterations that have resulted from the changes in the economy since 1974, but
also to improve access to certain remote areas not adequately served at
present. The present project addresses requirements identified to be of high
priority.



-7-
Institutional Framework
26.       Responsibility for highway administration is shared between the
Public Works Department (PWD) of the Ministry of Communications and Works
(MCW); the District Administration under the Ministry of the Interior; the
Forestry Department under the Ministry of Agriculture; and the
Municipalities. The PWD is responsible for the main highways, the District
Administration for lower category roads, the Forestry Department for forest
roads, and the Municipalities for local streets and roads falling within their
jurisdictions. In the PWD, the office of the Chief Engineer is responsible
for planning, design, construction and maintenance of the main highways.
Under the control and supervision of the Chief Engineer, five District
Engineers carry out highway maintenance and force account construction within
their respective districts.
27.       Economic planning and project evaluation work is increasingly being
undertaken within the PWD. Under the First Highway Project (Loan 904-CY), the
Government undertook a highway planning and organization study with the
assistance of consultants. Based on the recommendations of that study, a
Planning section was set up in the office of the PWD Chief Engineer, under
whose direction planning data, particularly traffic and cost data, are
compiled and analysed. Traffic counting, which earlier had been rudimentary,
was also reorganized on a systematic and planned basis. Recently the PWD
acquired a micro-computer to facilitate traffic and transport studies.
28.       Highway design standards are satisfactory, and the PWD has adequate
facilities to carry out most design work. Peak design workloads and some
special investigations are handled by use of consultants. Major highway
construction is normally undertaken by contract. There is an adequate civil
contracting industry operating in the country. There are three major domestic
civil works contractors with experience in road construction, all of whom are
capable of handling contracts of the size of the Limassol Bypass and the rural
road improvements proposed in the project. Smaller firms act as
subcontractors to the PWD for activities such as earthworks and the supply of
materials.
29.       The quality of highway maintenance work is good.  But the quantity
of work undertaken has varied from year to year and has generally been
inadequate, because annual appropriations for maintenance have fluctuated and
been insufficient. However, the position has now improved significantly. The
Government has recognized the importance of adequate and regular funding for
maintenance, and in 1980 almost doubled the annual allocation to over C£ 1
million. This level, which has subsequently been maintained, is considered
adequate to meet current requirements. During negotiations, the Government
has agreed to maintain its highway network in accordance with accepted current
practice and to make adequate budgetary provision for this purpose. In
addition, it would make available to the Bank for review and comment its
annual maintenance work programs and budgets (Loan Agreement, Section 4.03)
before they are finalized.



30.       The Government regulates public passenger and freight transport
under the Motor Transport Regulation Law (1964) and amendments thereto. The
Law is administered by the semi-independent Licensing Authority and by the
Licensing Department in MCW. The Government controls fares and schedules for
public transport routes and approves schedules of urban and inter-urban
buses. It also exercises direct control over the import of buses, and
indirect control over trucks through regulation of entry into the road haulage
industry.  These controls and regulations are administered flexibly and
encourage competition within the transport industry. A study of vehicle
regulations was carried out by consultants under the First Highway Project;
the Government, after reviewing the consultants' recommendations, has prepared
draft legislation setting new vehicle dimensions and axle loading limits. It
is expected that the draft bill will be promulgated in 1982.
Road User Charges
31.       While the revenue from road user charges, including registration
fees, taxes and duties, is adequate in relation to the total expenditure on
construction, improvement and maintenance of the highway system, the specific
road user charges do not reflect the damage caused by different types of
vehicles. A detailed study on road user charges carried out under the First
Highway Project revealed that the taxation on certain types of vehicles,
particularly heavy trucks and buses, was inadequate to cover the costs arising
from their use of the infrastructure, and there was a substantial subsidy on
diesel oil. Under the Second Highway Project, the Government reviewed the
major recommendations of the road user charges study and approved in principle
in May 1980 the gradual elimination of the subsidy on diesel oil and the
imposition of road user charges on different types of vehicles, particularly
heavy vehicles, closely related to the road damage inflicted by them. The
price of diesel has accordingly been increased in stages and currently fully
covers producers' costs. Road user charges have also been revised, and the
Government is examining proposals for increasing and rationalizing circulation
charges for heavy commercial vehicles. A study being undertaken in this
connection is expected to be completed later this year, after which proposals
would be formulated for the Government's consideration.
Bank Involvement in the Transport Sector
32.       The proposed loan would be the fifth Bank Group operation in the
transport sector in Cyprus and the third for highways. The two port projects
financed by the Bank (Loan 628-CY and 1540-CY) provided for the development of
a new deep-water port at Limassol and for expansion of port facilities at
Limassol and Larnaca, as well as technical assistance. The First Highway
Project (Loan 904-CY) envisaged construction of the Nicosia-Morphou highway
and access roads, but construction was interrupted after only one month of
work by the events of 1974. The Bank subsequently agreed to the Government's
request for reallocation of part of the loan to the Second Highway Project.
33.       The Second Highway Project (Loan 1344-CY) included the construction
of a new Nicosia-Limassol highway, as well as feasibility and traffic studies
and a training program. Because of a serious liquidity crisis faced by the



- 9 -
contractor on the Nicosia-Limassol highway, the construction which was
expected to be completed in 1983 will now be delayed. The contract is likely
to be terminated by the Government, and under these circumstances the
Government would take over the site and arrange for rebidding. The Government
appreciates the need for urgent action, and during loan negotiations, agreed
to initiate early arrangements satisfactory to the Bank and the Kuwait Fund
for Arab Economic Development for completing the highway, which remains
economically viable despite delay and cost escalation.
34.        The only project in the Transport Sector reviewed by the Operations
Evaluation Department so far has been the First Ports Project, which was
completed in 1976. The Project Performance Audit Report (SecM78-192, dated
March 13, 1978) concluded that the physical part of the project was
implemented successfully, although some components were delayed; preparation
of a detailed project implementation schedule would have contributed to
setting more realistic target dates for the various components, including
institution building. The lessons learnt from this and other earlier projects
regarding implementation and institution building have been incorporated in
the proposed project.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Project History
35.        In 1979, the Government requested Bank assistance for a rural road
improvement program to sustain agricultural and mineral development in the
south, improve accessibility to areas remote from Nicosia and Limassol, and
ensure a balanced development of the road network. The project was thereafter
prepared by the Government, with the help of consultants under the Second
Highway Project cofinanced by the Bank and the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic
Development (KFAED). The project was appraised in October 1981. The Kuwait
Fund would provide parallel financing for the project.  Negotiations were held
in Washington in March 1982 with a Government delegation led by His Excellency
George C. Hadjicostas, Minister of Communications and Works.
Project Objectives
36.       The main objectives of the project are to:
(i)  support regional agricultural and mineral development in several
less accessible rural areas in southern Cyprus and to increase the
coverage of social services for them, through the betterment of
i                   rural roads;
(ii) improve traffic conditions to and from Limassol port and ease
congestion on Limassol town streets by construction of the Limassol
Bypass;



- 10 -
(iii)  strengthen the operations and administration of the PWD and Inland
Transport Department, and in particular to improve their capability
to implement and monitor the project components, by providing them
with technical assistance, equipment and training; and
(iv) ensure adequate maintenance of the existing highway network.
Project Description
37.       The project consists of:
(i)   a three-year slice (about 200 km) of a program for the improvement
of priority rural roads, to be completed by the end of 1986;
(ii)   construction, with supervision, of the first two lanes of a new
Limassol bypass (about 10 km) and a two-lane connecting link (about
9 km) via Ypsonas to the Limassol-Paphos road;
(iii)   provision of testing and examination equipment for use in the
vehicle inspection centers to be set up by the Government;
(iv)   provision of equipment for highway maintenance;
(v)   technical assistance to help meet project objectives; and
(vi)   a training program for MCW staff.
The project features are elaborated in the subsequent paragraphs and in a
Staff Appraisal Report (No. 3749-CY, dated April 1, 1982) entitled "Cyprus:
Staff Appraisal Report of a Third Highway Project", distributed separately to
the Executive Directors. The main features are summarized in the Loan and
Project Summary and in Annex III.
38.       Rural Road Improvement Program:  This program includes minor
realignments where needed, as well as widening, reconstruction and
strengthening of aged or deformed pavements on existing rural roads, to the
appropriate design standard to meet current and projected traffic demand. On
the basis of feasibility studies carried out by the consultants for the
Government, a program to be implemented in a given time sequence, and covering
about 200 km of rural roads, appears feasible. About 56 km of such high
priority roads to be taken up in the first year have been identified.  The
roads to be improved in the subsequent years would be selected by agreement
between the Government and the Bank or the Kuwait Fund, as appropriate, in
accordance with an agreed methodology and criteria (Loan Agreement, Section
3.06).
39.       Limassol Bypass:  The first two lanes of an eventual four-lane
divided highway of 10 km length would be constructed around Limassol, for
opening in 1985. The bypass would connect two Bank-assisted projects, namely
Limassol port (Loan 1549-CY) and the new Nicosia-Limassol highway



- 11 -
(Loan 1344-CY), and provide links into Limassol and via Ypsonas to the
existing Limassol-Paphos highway east of Erimi. Construction of the bypass
would enable through traffic, especially heavy port traffic, to be diverted
from the congested central business area of Limassol.
40.       Vehicle Testing and Examination Equipment:  Four vehicle inspection
centers entrusted with the enforcement of new vehicle regulations promoting
road safety would be constructed by the Government at Nicosia, Limassol,
Larnaca and Paphos. The equipment to be used at these centers would be
financed under the proposed loan.
41.       Technical Assistance:  Approximately 60 man-months of foreign
consultants' services are envisaged, distributed over a three-year period.
The technical assistance would be mainly for augmenting and strengthening the
existing supervision and management capability of the PWD and other Government
agencies in the transport sector. In particular, such assistance would be
utilized in highway supervision and project coordination, in refining the
program for periodic road maintenance and minor improvements of arterial
roads, and in improving traffic management and coordination of rural bus
services. Consultants would be engaged under terms of reference and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank (Loan Agreement, Section 3.02).
42.       Training:  As in the two previous highway projects, training will be
provided for PWD and Department of Inland Transport staff to ensure orderly
implementation of the project (Loan Agreement, Section 3.07). The training
will consist of short-term courses on technical and operational aspects of
road transport projects at the Higher Technical Institute of Nicosia as well
as overseas.
43.       Road Maintenance Equipment:  The proposed loan would also finance
small amounts of additional equipment needed for increased maintenance
operations to remedy the backlog from previous years in highway maintenance.
Project Costs and Financing
44.       The total project cost, including taxes and duties of about
$2.4 million, is estimated at $48.2 million equivalent. Physical
contingencies are estimated at $3.5 million and price contingencies at
$9.8 million. Of the total cost, $20.3 million would be in foreign exchange.
Construction cost estimates are based on quantities from the final engineering
t       design and on unit rates derived from cost factor inputs and from other
current construction contracts. The cost estimates for consulting services
are based on the estimated man-months required and consultants' rates
applicable to late 1981. The average man-month rate of $9,000 assumed for
consultants' services, including overheads, travel costs to home office and
local allowances, is in line with the rates prevailing in the industry. Price
escalation of the foreign exchange and local currency components of project
costs has been calculated using annual escalations of 9 percent (1981), 8.5
percent (1982) and 7.5 percent (1983-86). A 10 percent physical contingency
has been included to allow for unforeseen quantity increases.



- 12 -
45.       The foreign exchange component for construction of the Limassol
bypass is estimated to be about 50 percent if executed by a foreign contractor
not now in Cyprus, and about 35 percent if a local contractor, or a foreign
contractor already working in Cyprus, carried out the work. The lower foreign
exchange figure has been adopted for the cost estimates, since the probability
of award to a local or locally-mobilized foreign contractor is high. The
foreign exchange component for the rural road improvement program is estimated
at 40 percent. The contracts for small stretches of rural roads in scattered
locations would in all probability be awarded to local contractors, but the
share of imported bitumen in total cost is higher for road improvement works
than for new construction.
46.       The proposed Bank loan of $12.2 million would finance about 60
percent of the foreign exchange costs of the project, or about 25 percent of
the total cost. The Government has requested that the front-end fee of about
$0.2 million be financed out of the Bank loan. The balance of foreign
exchange costs of $8.3 million, or about 40 percent of the foreign exchange
component, would be met from a loan from the Kuwait Fund, on the basis of
parallel financing. The Bank and the Kuwait Fund would each finance separate,
economically self-reliant project components. The Government has confirmed
that it would finance all local costs, as well as the shortfall, if any, in
the foreign exchange component, from its own resources.
Project Implementation
47.       The PWD would be responsible for project execution and supervision
through a Project Unit to be set up under the direction of the Director, PWD.
The Project Unit would comprise three operational divisions for project road
construction, monitoring of road maintenance and technical assistance, and be
supported by an administrative and accounting division. It would be managed
full time by a Co-ordinator and would be especially responsible for preparing
the second and subsequent annual programs of rural road improvement (para.
38). Establishment of the Project Unit would be a condition of loan
effectiveness (Loan Agreement, Sections 6.01 and 3.01(b)). Works are expected
to start in late 1982/early 1983, and be completed by late 1986. After
completion of the project, the staff of the unit would be reassigned to apply
their enhanced experience within the five operational districts of the PWD.
48.       Engineering for the rural roads to be improved in the first year and
for the Limassol bypass has been completed. The subsequent years' programs of
rural road improvement will be engineered by the PWD with assistance from
consultants as required and under the overall control of the Project Unit.
Availability of the land required for the project roads is not expected to
pose any problems for timely project implementation.
Procurement
49.       For the construction works financed under the Bank loan, unit price
contracts would be awarded after international competitive bidding in
accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement".  The works would be
divided into contracts of varying size to maximize local contractor



13 
participation. Contractors would be permitted to bid for one or more
contracts according to their prequalification status. All bidding packages
for civil works estimated to cost over $1.0 million equivalent and for goods
over $100,000 equivalent would be subject to the Bank's prior review of
procurement documentation (Loan Agreement, Schedule 4).
50.       Vehicle testing equipment to be financed under the Bank loan would
*        also be purchased through international competitive bidding.  Consultants for
technical assistance would be selected in accordance with Bank guidelines.
51.       The Kuwait Fund would finance specific rural roads (about 50 km),
the Limassol bypass, and highway maintenance equipment. Procurement would
take place on the basis of international competitive bidding under the Fund's
procurement rules, as is the practice for projects financed in parallel by the
Bank with that Fund.
Disbursement
52.       Disbursements from the Loan Account will be made against standard
documentation, to the extent of 40 percent of construction expenditures on the
rural roads selected for Bank financing and 100 percent of the foreign
exchange costs of vehicle examination equipment, consultants' services and
training of MCW staff (Loan Agreement, Schedule 1).
Auditing
53.       Accounting, financial control and auditing procedures are well
established in Cyprus. The Accountant General is responsible for the
management and supervision of all accounting operations and for the receipt
and disbursement of revenues. All Government expenditures are audited and
periodically reported upon by the Auditor General, an authority entirely
independent of the Government. The Government would provide the Bank with
audited statements of expenditure on the project not later than six months
after the end of its fiscal year (Loan Agreement, Section 4.02(b)).
Project Benefits and Risks
54.       The first two highway projects financed by the Bank in Cyprus
largely involved lending for the construction or improvement of discrete road
sections on arterial routes. The focus of the present project would be the
improvement of important regional and secondary roads, with the object of
*        inducing more rapid economic development of outlying and relatively less
developed areas. In addition, the proposed Limassol Bypass would provide an
urgent economic link between the new Nicosia-Limassol highway and the expanded
and modernized Limassol port, as well as to the existing Limassol-Paphos
highway.
55.       The rural road component would provide better road connections
between several commercial growing centers, improve the accessibility of some
remote areas and stimulate tourism development. The important commodities
that would be affected by the improved rural roads and the new bypass are



- 14 -
agricultural produce including fruits and vegetables, construction materials,
timber products and general cargo. The institution building components of the
project would benefit MCW, while the proposed vehicle regulation and
inspection centers would promote road safety.
56.       Quantifiable benefits from the project would arise mainly from
avoided extra highway maintenance costs, reduced vehicle operating costs, and
savings in travel time. The average economic rate of return on the 56 km of
the rural roads to be improved in the first year is estimated at about 16
percent. The roads for inclusion in the subsequent years' programs would be
selected so as to yield rates of return of not less than 12 percent. The
economic rate of return on the Limassol bypass (with the Ypsonas-Erimi link)
is estimated at 22 percent. All the civil works components taken together
would yield a weighted average economic rate of return of about 17 percent on
the assumption that the rates of return of the subsequent years' programs of
rural road improvement would be of the same order as that of the first year's
program. Even under the assumption of a 15 percent rise in construction costs
combined with a 15 percent reduction in user benefits, the economic rate of
return for the first year's rural roads program would only be slightly reduced
to 14 percent, and that for the Limassol bypass to 18 percent, both in the
acceptable range. The project would also have substantial unquantifiable
benefits, including improved safety, environmental improvements, and greater
driving comfort.
57.       There are no major risks attached to the project.  The project
implementation and monitoring capacity of the PWD is being strengthened
through the establishment of a Project Unit and the provision of technical
consultancy where required.
58.       The project is expected to have a positive environmental impact.
The Limassol bypass, by the diversion of a substantial proportion of heavy
through traffic from the town center, would substantially reduce accident
rates, noise pollution and other attendant environmental problems within the
town.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
59.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Cyprus and the
Bank, and the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section
4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately.
60.       The establishment of a Project Unit to monitor and control project
implementation will be a special condition of effectivenss of the Bank loan
(Loan Agreement, Section 6.01). Other features of special interest are listed
in Section III of Annex III.
61.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.

PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
62.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C.  STATUS OF PROJECTS IN EXECUTION AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 1981 1/
Loan No. 960 - Paphos Irrigation Project: US$14.0 million loan of January 30,
1974. Effective Date: October 10, 1975. Closing Date: June 30, 1982.
Work has been completed on the main canal and Eastern Conveyance
System, with the Western Conveyor pipeline also essentially complete.
Construction of the Asprokremos Dam is well underway with completion expected
by the middle of 1982. Construction of the pumping stations is nearly
complete and the farm distribution system is well underway. Land
consolidation is also progressing satisfactorily and training of farmers at
the Farmers Training Center is continuing with high farmer interest and
participation.
Loan No. 1344 - Second Highway Project: US$10.0 million loan of December 31,
1976.  Effective Date: October 11, 1977.  Closing Date:  April 30, 1982.
The main construction contract was awarded in January 1979. While
the quality of construction has remained consistently good, there have been
delays in the construction schedule for various reasons, including contractual
disputes and financial problems experienced by the contractor. In view of the
contractor's serious liquidity problems, the Government is likely to terminate
the contract, and under these circumstances, the Government would make
arrangements satisfactory to the Bank and the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic
Development for the expeditious completion of the project. A decision
regarding extension of the closing date is expected to be taken shortly.
Loan No. 1483 - Pitsilia Integrated Rural Development Project: US$10.0
million loan of August 18, 1977. Effective Date: November 7, 1977. Closing
Date: June 30, 1983.
Overall implementation of project works is proceeding
satisfactorily. Construction of the Xyliatos Dam and the irrigation ponds is
underway, with about half of the ponds already completed. Health facilities
and village streets are essentially completed, and work is progressing on farm
roads, on-farm water distribution systems, and land conservation,
consolidation and rehabilitation.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

Effective Date: August 11, 1978. Closing Date: June 30, 1982.

construction of quays at Limassol has been awarded and construction work is
underway. Overall progress is satisfactory, and project completion is
expected in 1982.

Development: US$11.0 million loan of February 12, 1979. Effective Date:
July 16, 1979. Closing Date: December 31, 1985.
The project suffered initial delays due to slow progress in
appointment of consultants and recruitment of staff. Consultants have now
been selected and have begun work. A new project manager as well as
engineering staff for the project have also been recruited. Project
implementation is expected to proceed smoothly hereafter.
Loan No. 1744 - Third Cyprus Development Bank Project: US$5.0 million loan of
July 5, 1979. Effective Date: November 30, 1979. Closing Date: June 30,
1983.

appraisal and supervision capability, and project implementation continues
smoothly.
