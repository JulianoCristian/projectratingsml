WATER SUPPLY ENGINEERING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
PROJECT (CREDIT S23-SE)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This Completion Report reviews the preparation, implementation
ancd achievements of a Water Supply Engineering and Technical Assistance
Project for which Credit S23-SE was approved in April 1979 to the Republic
of Senegal. The Credit was for US$2.5 million, of which an amouzt of
US$205,194.64 was cancelled in July, 1985; it has already been fully
refinanced out of the follow-up Investment Project (Credit 1554-SE) which
was approved in March 1985 and put into effect in July 1985.
This Report was prepared by the Western Africa Regional Office on
the basis of the findings of supervision missions which visited Senegal in
1986 for the follow-up project, and a review of the President's Report,
Credit documents, supervision reports, progress reports and other documents
related to project implementation.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED), but the project was not audited by ORD staff.
Following standard procedures, OED sent copies of the draft
report to Borrower and the Executing Agency for comments. However, no
comments were received.

REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
WATER SUPPLY ENGINEERING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
PROJECT (CREDIT S23-SE)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
Credit S23-SE in the amount of US$2.5 million equivalent was the
first IDA involvement in the sector after six years of a rather difficult
dialogue between the Senegalese autborities and the Bank on the
institutional set up and allocation of responsibilities. Approved in April
1979, it was intended to finance preparatory activities to an investment
project which eventually became effective in July 1985. These activities
included reconnaissance boreholes, feasibility studies and detailed designs
for water supply in eleven secondary centers, updating of sewerage and
sanitation studies, institutional, financial and tariff studies ard
technical assistance to the Ministry of Hydraulics and the National Water
Authority (para 2.01). Although the closing date of the Credit was
extended three times, mainly to allow for financing of extensions of the
technical assistance contracts, no cost overrun in US$ was observed due in
part to the strong appreciation of the US$ vis-a-vis the CFA Franc during
project implementation.
The project was successfully executed and without any significant
changes albeit with substantial delays. It has been the vehicle for an
in-depth dialogue on major financial and institutional issues of the
sector. However, while the tariff study served as the basis for an
important reform in this field, the institutional study which was at the
center of the controversy between the Government and the Bank since the
beginning of project preparation did not lead to any substantial
modification until Bank staff heavily involved themselves, in the
definition of sector reorganization, which was finally implemented before
presentation of the follow-up of the investment project to the Board.



REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
WATER SUPPLY ENGIN3ERING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
PROJECT (CREDIT S23-SE)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The first identification mission to consider a possible Water
Supply project in Senegal dates back to February/March 1973; the
US$24.0 million equivalent Credit 1554-SE which finally financed the
"Eleven Centers Water Supply Project" was approved by the Board in March
1985 and bacame effective in July 1985. This Completion Report reviews the
preparation, implementation and achievements of an Engineering and
Technical Assistance Project which was intended to prepare the Investment
Project (para 3.06) and to serve as a vehicle for an in-depth institutional
dialogue. Therefore, this Completion Report should be considered as an
interim one.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION
2.01      Following several years of very difficult dialogue between the
Senegalese authorities and the Bank on the institutional setup of the
sector and on allocation of responsibilities among the several agencies
involved, it was initially agreed with the Government and the (at the time)
potential cofinanciers 1/ to commission consultant studies to prepare a
possible water supply proJect for eleven secondary centers. Therefore,
Engineering Credit S23-SE, appraised in October 1978, was approved by the
Board in April 1979. This Credit provided financing for 15 reconnaissance
boreholes (six of the eleven centers as well as a chemical plant located
north of the capital city, Dakar), feasibility studies and detailed designs
for water supply in the eleven centers, updating of sewerage and sanitation
studies, organizational, financial and tariff studies and technical
assistance to the Ministry of Hydraulics (MH) 2/ and the National Water
Authority, Socift6 Nationale d'Exploitation des Eaux du S&nEgal (SONEES).
1/ Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique of France and Government of
Spain.
2/   At appraisal, a Directorate of the Ministry of Equipment.



- 2 -
Terms of reference for the studies and technical assistance and tender
documents for the drilling of boreholes were discussed during appraisal and
finalized at an early stage of implementation. The implementing agency was
the Ministry of Hydraulics.
2.02      The Credit was negotiated in Dakar in March 1979, approved in
April 1979 and became effective in August 1979. It was intended to finance
100% of foreign expenditures and 77% of local expenditures of consultant
services and drilling works and 100% of foreign expenditures of technical
assistance contracts. There were no specific conditions for effectiveness.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Procurement and Implementation
3.01      The contract for drilling of boreholes in the six centers was
awarded to a joint venture between a French company and the Senegalese
National Drilling Company; the latter experienced some financial
difficulties, but the works (as well as the drilling for the chemical plant
- executed by another French contractor) were successfully carried out in
the end.
3.02      A German consultant firm was selected to perform the engineering
studies and consultants from xrance and Senegal were awarded the
institutional/manpower studies and financial/tariff studies. All
consultants mobilized rapidly and their studies were available late in
1981. Technical assistance to MH and SONEES was provided by German and US
firms respectively; however, both technical assistants seconded were
French. After several months of delay in contract signing due to unusually
long administrative procedures, they arrived in Dakar in fall 1980. Audits
of SONEES accounts were executed by a joint venture of British and
Senegalese auditors.
Outcome of the Studies
3.03      The engineering studies have been satisfactorily completed;
however, during their preparation, it appeared that additional groundwater
investigations were necessary in the centers not covered by the drilling
activities financed by the Engineering Project. Consequently, other
reconnaissance boreholes to be financed by a PPF advance for the Investment
Project. Also, no satisfactory solution could be found to remove the
excess of fluoride in the water produced in the Sine Saloum region
(including the city of Kaolack), despite interesting test runs using
locally produced aluminum phosphate which would have possibly led to a
low-cost solution. Other investigations, to define a technology adapted to
Senegalese financial and cechnical conditions, will have to be carried out
under the Investment Project.



- 3 -
3.04      The institutional study, which was at the center of the
controversy between the Government and the Bank since the beginning of
project preparation, did not lead to any substantial modification in the
prevailing sectorial setup. This type of study, which, inter alia, often
embodies a tacit objective of limiting some of the prerogatives of the
administration which commissioned the study, is always very sensitive. A
major sector reorganization was implemented, however, before presentation
of the Investment Project to the Board after Bank staff heavily involved
themselves in its definition (para 3.06). The manpower study which
addressed the Issue at the sectorial level was far too ambitious and did
not lead to any concrete action. Detailed training activities are now
being defined and implemented under the Investment Project. The tariff
study was successfully carried out and has served as the basis for an
important reform in this field.
3.05      The technical assistants were well accepted and integrated in MH
and SONEES. Their contracts have been extended several times (financed
either by the Engineering Credit, the PPF advance or the Investment
Project); they were still in place in 1986. Technical assistance to SONEES
focussed on creating a Studies and New Works Division within the technical
department and has performed without major problems. Technical assistance
to NH, intended to strengthen planning capability and implement the new
institutional setup, however, has not always been an effective intermediary
between the Government and the Bank, particularly during difficult
exchanges concerning reallocation of responsibilities.
Follow-up Project
3.06      The follow-up Project (Eleven Centers Water Supply Project) was
appraised in March 1982. However, major disagreements still remained
regarding institutional arrangements and allocation of responsibilities.
The Project was finally presented to the Board in March 1985 but only after
the Government agreed to (a) revise SONEES's statutes; (b) entrust SONEES
with full responsibilities for urban water supply and sewerage (including
planning, financing, construction, operation, billing and collection and
debt servicing); (c) sign an "Enterprise Contract" defining mutual
agreement and commitment for a three-year period; (d) put into effect new
water tariffs and provisions for regular revisions along with the
recommendations of the corresponding study; and (e) settle mutual arrears.
These Important modifications in sector management constitute the main
achievements of the Engineering Project.
Project Cost and Credit Disbursement
3.07      Although the closing date of the Credit was postponed three times
from the original date of December 31, 1981, until December 31, 1984, to
allow for inter alia financing of extensions to the technical assistance
contracts, no cost overrun in US$ was observed, due in part to the strong
appreciation of the; US$ vis-a-vis the CFA franc during project
implementation. At the time of Credit closing, an amount of US$205,194.54
was cancelled. Total cost of the completed project (see Annex) was



- 4 -
CFAF 855 million (US$2.71) compared with the appraisal estimate of CFAF 705
million (US$3.20 million). Credit disbursements were refinanced under the
subsequent Investment Project.
Borrower, Consultants, Contractors and Bank Performance
3.08      The Borrower performed satisfactorily when addressing technical
and financial issues, but experienced more difficulties in understanding
the rationale behind the proposed sectorial reorganization and reallocation
of responsibilities; this caused significant delays in processing the
Investment Project. The few special conditions or covenants under the
Credit (i.e., investment limitation, implementation of agreed study
recommendations, IDA approval of consulting contracts) were all in
compliance. Consultant performance proved satisfactory, especially for the
engineering tad tariff studies, as did, ultimately, the drilling
contractors. For its part, the Bank provided a major input on the
institutional reorganization; however, this input came mainly after
appraisal of the Investment Project. The Bank also provided necessary
support to the Government by independeutly reviewing progress and helping
to define least-cost solutions and appropriate alternatives for expansion
of water supply systems.
IV. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
4.01      The project was successfully completed, albeit witth substantial
time overruns. It has been the vehicle for ar in-depth dialogue on major
institutional and financial issues concerning the urban water supply and
sewerage sector. The fact that it took 12 years to reach an agreement (if
one includes the five years spent in the discussions which led up to the
project) would suggest, however, that it might well not have been the best
vehicle for that purpose. Nevertheless, the protracted dialogue did pave
the way for perhaps greater institutional reform under the follow-up
project than might have been otherwise possible.
