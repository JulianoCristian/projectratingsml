properly\n            prepared projects; and, second, create the institutional\n            capacity for identifying investment proposals and processing\n            them through feasibility studies, obtaining financing and\n            establishing final project execution plans. To meet these\n            objectives the project will comprise the following\n            components: (a) an institutional strengthening component in\n            the form of on-the-job training and technical assistance\n            provided to the Ministry of Planning and Statistics and the\n            planning units of the technical ministries; (b) an\n            investment preparation component in the form of\n            identification work, feasibility studies and detailed\n            execution plans of projects included in the public\n            investment program; and (c) a sectoral priorities component\n            in the form of studies to upgrade the available information\n            on sectoral investment priorities and to develop sectoral strategies."}, "docdt": "1991-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
