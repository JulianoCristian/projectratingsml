In 1993,\n            the state, its farmers and communities, and the World Bank\n            joined together to address these problems and create\n            long-term solutions. A key part of the project was assuring\n            land ownership for the farmers. The phases of the\n            reclamation process was followed: testing the soil, digging\n            surface drainage, building tube-wells, applying the gypsum\n            and water for leaching, flushing with good-quality\n            groundwater, planting crops, and regularly continuing to\n            flush salts from the link drains. Within six months, farmers\n            experienced improved agricultural productivity and enjoyed\n            higher incomes. The program model was so successful that the\n            government of Uttar Pradesh planned to follow it in all\n            future sodic land reclamation. Project staff also helped\n            establish women's savings and credit groups to\n            supplement family incomes. Banks began to offer the groups\n            credit for dairy farming, sewing, tree nurseries, and trading."}, "docdt": "2002-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
