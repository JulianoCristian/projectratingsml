outcome\n            was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: Building on a pilot project, which in\n            itself was a lesson in scaling-up, has produced a set of\n            robust and highly efficient systems for intervention suited\n            to the particular needs of sodic land reclamation while at\n            the same time targeting the needs of the poor. These systems\n            can provide for technically sound and transparent criteria\n            for area and beneficiary selection, which target the poor,\n            without excluding benefits to the wider community. While the\n            project systems developed for area and beneficiary selection\n            have worked extremely well, they may have done so partly\n            because of the relative homogeneity of the targeted lands\n            and groups, and the quick visible returns to sodic land\n            reclamation. This bodes well for scaling-up on further\n            larger areas of sodic lands, but considerable effort and\n            resources may be needed to extend these approaches to more\n            complex environments (such as ravine areas in the region).\n            Community mobilization and preparatory activities are\n            essential for successful sodic land reclamation. These\n            result in delayed disbursement in the initial years,\n            followed by accelerated disbursement in the later years."}, "docdt": "2008-03-20T00:00:00Z"}
