         Reclamation II Project seeks to increase agricultural\n            productivity in ten districts of Uttar Pradesh. The project\n            has seven components. 1) The on-farm development and land\n            reclamation component addresses the need for\n            beneficiary-led, on-farm reclamation efforts in sodic soil\n            areas of the state of Uttar Pradesh. Active community\n            participation and well coordinated government intervention\n            are critical elements in the project approach. 2) The\n            rehabilitation and maintenance of main drains component will\n            improve the drain network which will have positive\n            environmental impact by reversing, arresting, or delaying\n            the process the sodic land formation. 3) Technology\n            dissemination will establish a community-based, demand\n            driven system for technology dissemination in the project\n            districts. 4) Upgrading farm to market roads will take up\n            rural roads construction in areas where sodic land is being\n            reclaimed. 5) Human resources development and institutional\n            capacity building of support services will focus on staff\n            training and institutional strengthening in the Panchayats,\n            nongovernmental organizations, and executing government\n            agencies. 6) Adaptive research will verify and refine the\n            available technologies to suit the specific needs of local\n            farmers and to bring about sustainable increases in the\n            productivity of sodic lands through reclamation. 7) Project\n            management will be the responsibility of the Uttar Pradesh\n            Bhumi Sudhar Nigam (UPBSN)."}, "docdt": "1998-11-03T00:00:00Z"}
