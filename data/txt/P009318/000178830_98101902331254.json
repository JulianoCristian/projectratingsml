strengthen the capacity of the Road Construction and\n            Maintenance Department (RCMD)to execute its responsibilities\n            for maintaining and upgrading the highway network in\n            Afghanistan, including primary, secondary and tertiary\n            roads. The principal components of the project would be: (i)\n            a three-year time slice of a payment strengthening program;\n            (ii) a three-year time slice of a road maintenance and\n            improvement program; and (iii) technical assistance for\n            RCMD. The recurrent costs of the maintenance and improvement\n            program, amounting to $17.3 million, would be met in full by\n            the Government. The project works would be carried out by\n            RCMD, which needs an expanding capacity for executing work\n            of the type envisaged. There are no domestic highway\n            contractors, and, given the history of International\n            Competitive Bidding (ICB) for road contracts in Afghanistan,\n            prospects for effective ICB for the proposed work are\n            considered poor."}, "docdt": "1979-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
