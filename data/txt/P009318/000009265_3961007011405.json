The reason for the\n            Bank's decision not to make the credit effective was\n            the prevailing situation in Afghanistan at the time, which\n            made effective IDA supervision impossible. In fact, all IDA\n            disbursements to Afghanistan were suspended in April 1980,\n            and have not resumed as of June 1994. As the project was not\n            implemented, a Project Completion Report was not prepared\n            and project outcome and impact are not rated."}, "docdt": "1994-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
