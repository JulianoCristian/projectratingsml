Some\n            of the lessons learned from the project are: (a) the\n            programming and budgeting by objectives is a complex\n            approach that required nearly three years to be properly\n            adopted by National Institute for Agricultural Research\n            (INRA); (b) the latter successfully adapted the approach\n            while benefiting from the continuous support from\n            International Service for National Agricultural Research\n            (ISNAR); (c) when research embarks on complex restructuring\n            it is unrealistic to expect fast disbursement from the\n            project onset; (d) research being a long term venture cannot\n            operate on the basis of significant financial fluctuation\n            over time thus careful planning is necessary when\n            considering modifying sources of financing; and (e)\n            modifying an approach to extension especially at the\n            national level requires a clear vision and the defining of a\n            strategy for extension at an early stage together with\n            intense participation from farmers."}, "docdt": "1997-04-16T00:00:00Z"}
