Technical Assistance Project aims at\n            assisting the Government in implementing its structural\n            adjustment program by providing studies, expert advice and\n            implementation assistance in key areas of the economy.\n            Specifically, the project will finance approximately 300\n            man-months of consultant services: (i) trade and pricing\n            policies in the agricultural sector and strengthening of its\n            institutions; (ii) effective protection in the industrial\n            sector; (iii) financial, actuarial, administrative and\n            managerial issues in the Social Security Agency; (iv) the\n            Health System; (v) transport infrastructure in the Panama\n            City-Colon corridor; and (vi) other currently unidentified\n            studies needed to carry out the structural adjustment\n            program. The complexity of the project requires efficient\n            coordination both at the technical and administrative\n            levels. Assisted by a panel of local and foreign economists,\n            the Director of Economic and Social Planning in the Ministry\n            of Planning and Economic Policy will be in charge of\n            administrative and logistical coordination, including the\n            appointment of counterpart staff in the technical agencies\n            to work with the consultants. Arrangements are also being\n            finalized with UNDP/OPE to act as contracting agent for the government."}, "docdt": "1983-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
