renewable resources over the longer\n            term.  It would be the first phase of a longer-term program\n            and would be expected to generate the policy, institutional\n            and technical base for future forest management and land\n            titling investments in the Choco Region.  Investments under\n            the NRMP first phase would be confined to Western Colombia.\n            NRMP consists of:  (a) the development of a policy,\n            information and institutional base for forest management,\n            with a particular focus on the Choco Region; (b) the\n            rehabilitation and protection of selected water catchment\n            areas in the highlands; (c) the improved management of\n            national parks; and (d) the strengthening of\n            environmental/forestry education, training and research, and\n            of Program management."}, "docdt": "1993-12-02T00:00:00Z"}
