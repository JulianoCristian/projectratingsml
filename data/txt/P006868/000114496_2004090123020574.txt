Dear Dr. Ocampo:
Subject:
COLOMBIA - Natural Resources Management Project
(Loan. 3692-CO and Grant TF 020818)
This is in connection with the Loan Agreement for the above between the Republic 
of Colombia (the Borrower) and the Bank, dated August 9, 1994, as amended to the date 
herewith (hereinafter 'the Loan Agreement'). As you know, it is necessary to formalize 
the proposal of the Minister for Development Cooperation of the Netherlands 
(hereinafter referred to as 'the Minister') to commit a part of the proceeds of the 
above Grant for the completion of the first phase of Part C of the
Project (i.e. through August 31. 1996). Such completion will enable the Minister to 
determine, in consultation with the Borrower, whether additional grant funds would be 
available for financing by the Netherlands of the carrying out of said Part of the 
Project. Thus, we propose reaching the following understanding:
(a)
it is hereby accepted that the proceeds of the Loan withdrawn by you on 
October 3, 1995 under withdrawal application No. 5 for an amount of Dollars 330,000 be 
imputed, exceptionally, to the financing of Project Expenditures for Part C of the 
Project for 1995 under Category  1 of the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the 
Loan Agreement;
(b)
with the execution of the activities to be financed with said Loan 
proceeds,  the Borrower will be deemed to have  carried out Part C of the Project in 
connection with 1995 in conformity with Section 3.01 of the Loan Agreement;
(c)
the Borrower hereby accepts, exclusively for purposes of financing the 
carrying out of the activities currently included under Part C of the Project in the 
Annual Work Program for 1996 approved by the Bank by notice sent on December 10, 1995, 
to be entitled to utilize part of the proceeds of the grant TF 20818 in an amount that 
shall have the aggregate value of US$2 million (two million United States Dollars) 
(hereinafter 'the First Grant'), and that has been made available to the Borrower by 
the Minister out of grant funds provided by the Minister and currently administered by 
the Bank pursuant to an agreement dated May 24, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as 'the 
General Arrangement') between the Minister and the Bank (the Bank, in its role as  
Administrator, hereinafter referred to as 'the Administrator');
(d)
the amount of the First Grant may be withdrawn from the Grant Account, as 
referred to in paragraph (h) (iii) below, in accordance with the provisions of 
Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement which are applicable to Category 1 of the table in 
paragraph 1 of such Schedule (such Category hereinafter referred to as 'the Eligible 
Category') for Project Expenditures incurred (or if the Administrator shall so agree, 
to be incurred) in with respect to the reasonable cost of goods, works and services 
required for the activities described in Part C of the Project and to be financed out 
of the proceeds of the First Grant;
(e)
the Borrower shall, for purposes of Part C of the Project, open and 
maintain in Dollars a special deposit account (the Dutch Special Account) in its 
Central Bank on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Administrator.  Deposits 
into, and payments out, of the Dutch
Special Account shall be made, mutatis mutandis, in accordance with the provisions of 
Schedule 5 to the Loan Agreement, except that the term 'Eligible Category' shall have 
the meaning defined in (d) above, and the amount related to the term 'Authorized 
Allocation' shall be deemed to be the amount of Dollars 700,000.

(f)
the Administrator shall be obligated to disburse the proceeds of the 
First Grant only to the extent it shall have received funds for this purpose from the 
Minister;
(g)
if on or before October 31, 1996 the Minister will have given to the  
Bank notice of such Minister's determination on the commitment to make available to 
the Borrower grant funds available under the General Arrangement (TF 20818) and 
additional to the First Grant to finance the yearly execution of the remainder of Part 
C of the Project, as approved for each year of  Project execution (commencing with the 
year of 1997)  under the provisions of Section 3.04 of the Loan Agreement, and the 
Bank shall have informed the Borrower of such notice, then the Borrower and the 
Administrator shall promptly enter into a Dutch Grant Agreement substantially on the 
terms and conditions provided for in the attached draft;
(h)
the provisions of this letter shall be an integral part of the Loan 
Agreement and,  exclusively for purposes of the administration by the Bank of the 
First Grant, the General Conditions, as defined in Section 1.01 of the Loan Agreement 
shall be deemed modified as follows:

request of the Borrower, purchase such 
currency with the proceeds of such withdrawal."
Please signify your agreement, on behalf of the Borrower with all of the 
aforesaid by dating and signing both copies of this letter, and by returning to us one
