Registering Minority-held Land in Colombia                                                                 July 1, 2002
                      Afro-Colombians make up 90 percent of the population in the rainforest-covered Chocó region along
                      Colombia's Pacific coast.  Largely dependent on fishing, hunting, and traditional farming, these groups
                      are among the country's poorest.

                      In 1994, the World Bank approved a Natural Resources Management Program to help the Chocó
                      region's Afro-Colombian and indigenous groups obtain titles of land ownership while preserving their
                      cultural and ethnic identities.  The $65.3 million project funded the implementation of a law recognizing
                      Afro-Colombian communities as ethnic groups with collective territorial rights.

Workshops, training courses and village councils raised awareness in the community about land ownership, and with the
active participation of regional Afro-Colombian and indigenous organizations, the project set up regional committees between
the government and the communities to ease ethnic conflicts and develop titling standards.

By 2001, the program had helped 58 community councils gain titles to 2.4 million hectares of land for households together
comprising more than 100,000 people.
