rated as satisfactory, sustainability\n            as likely, institutional development impact as substantial,\n            Bank performance as satisfactory, and Borrower performance\n            as satisfactory. The project was seriously affected by the\n            lack of internal security in Colombia. Besides, internally\n            the project was affected by the budget problems and fiscal\n            austerity measure that began in 1995. A number of important\n            lessons have been learned or reinforced during the project\n            implementation:1) It is essential to have an Monitoring and\n            Evaluation (M&E) system in place at the beginning of a\n            project, and this implies that the preparation of the\n            base-line study and the design of the M&E system itself\n            should occur as early as possible in the project cycle. 2)\n            Flexibility and pragmatism in implementation should be\n            encouraged when an opportunity presents itself. 3) The\n            experience of the early years of implementation with respect\n            to accounting, financial management, and audit strongly\n            endorses the Bank's recent initiatives to require the\n            installation of a proper accounting system as a necessary\n            condition for the processing of a loan. 4) The conservation\n            of natural resources depends crucially upon community\n            participation and partnership. The effectiveness and impact\n            of international cooperation, technical assistance, and\n            partnership are enhanced when cooperation extends beyond\n            supervision and auditing progress to participation."}, "docdt": "2001-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
