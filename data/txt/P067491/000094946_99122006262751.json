such as improved disclosure, an improved\n            definition of risk weighted assets; classification and new\n            provisioning rules; improved accounting practices and\n            standards; the restructuring, sale, merger, or liquidation\n            of five banks under the restructuring program for the Bank\n            Savings Protection Institute (IPAB). The Bank funds\n            complement other sources of financing available to IPAB:\n            fiscal transfers, proceeds from asset disposal/recovery, and\n            fees from deposit insurance premiums. The loan is disbursed\n            in three tranches, the first upon loan signing in support of\n            front reform measures already taken by the Mexican\n            authorities, and two floating tranches that will each be\n            disbursed against agreed tranche conditions."}, "docdt": "1999-11-29T00:00:00Z"}
