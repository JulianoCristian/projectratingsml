{"cdata!": "Overall, the outcome of the project is\n            satisfactory, and sustainability is likely. The use of a\n            one-tranche operation provided good support to a pending\n            reform agenda, particularly when, during the last period of\n            an outgoing administration, no compliance with tranche\n            conditions remained for the new government to implement. The\n            lessons indicate that, although the reform program was\n            largely successful, three measures might have improved the\n            implementation, and sustainability of reforms: 1) a stronger\n            public awareness campaign could have been built into the\n            program, to emphasize the rationale for reform, which in\n            turn would have increased public support, particularly in\n            Panama, where interventionist policies, and benefits of\n            competition, and market-oriented policies have had limited\n            acceptance; 2) the Government, with the support of the Bank,\n            should have addressed the needs of poor producers -\n            negatively affected by the trade reform program - by clearly\n            devising a strategy to minimize the transitional impact,\n            while non-competitive farmers should have been encouraged to\n            shift to other economic activities; 3) while the difficulty\n            of reducing the share of public expenditure in an election\n            year could have been foreseen, and adjusted, it is fair to\n            say that realistic fiscal assumptions could have led to\n            better planning, and phasing of subsequent budget cuts."}, "docdt": "2000-05-05T00:00:00Z"}
