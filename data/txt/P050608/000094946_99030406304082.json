      ongoing three-year IMF Extended Fund Facility. The project\n            focuses on the various reforms and restructuring of the\n            administration. Firstly, trade reforms are due to boost the\n            economic growth and employment over the long term, with the\n            new tariff structure reducing consumer prices. Secondly, the\n            project examines domestic competition reforms, through the\n            support of the Competition Law. Furthermore, the social\n            security reform will strengthen public sector finances, in\n            addition to improving the equity of social expenditures, and\n            fostering savings and capital market development. The\n            reduction of poverty and inequality is a major concern,\n            being specifically addressed through the implementation of\n            the Poverty Strategy and the corresponding Action Plan. One\n            such action involves the improvement of the existing Poverty\n            Map, through the combination of the Living Standards\n            Measurement Survey (LSMS) and Census data, directly\n            impacting the incidence of public spending."}, "docdt": "1998-10-29T00:00:00Z"}
