primary objective of the Fifth\n            Highway Project is to assist the Senegalese Government to\n            carry out badly needed maintenance operations on its road\n            network so as to avoid a severe deterioration of the\n            network.  Related objectives are to keep balance between\n            maintenance and new road construction, and to further\n            improve the efficiency of the road maintenance organization\n            already strengthened under earlier Bank Group operations.\n            This includes the decentralized financial and cost\n            accounting systems, and planning and monitoring of\n            maintenance activities.  The project will support the\n            Directorate of Road Maintenance and Equipment program over\n            the four-year period 1983/84 - 1986/87 as follows:  (a)\n            routine maintenance of about 9,100 km of roads in the first\n            year, increasing to about 10,500 km by the fourth year,\n            including maintenance of feeder roads; (b) periodic\n            maintenance (repaving and regravelling of road surfaces and\n            rehabilitation of structures) as warranted on roads\n            maintained under (a) above; and (c) deferred periodic\n            maintenance of other paved and gravel roads neglected in\n            recent years because of the Government's inability to\n            adequately fund the necessary operations.  The project will\n            also increase the use of regional revolving funds to promote\n            local administration."}, "docdt": "1984-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
