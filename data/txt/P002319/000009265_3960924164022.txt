PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SENEGAL
FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
(Credit 993/Loan 1810-SE)
FIFTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
(Credit 1448 and Special Fund Credit SF-15-SE)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Fourth and
Fifth Highway Projects in Senegal, for which Credit 993/Loan 1810-SE and
Credit 1448/Credit SF-15-SE in the amounts of US$38.0 million and
US$21.5 million were respectively approved on April 4, 1980 and June 22,
1984. Credit 993/Loan 1810, cofinanced in the amount of US$12.9 by the
OECF (Japan), was fully disbursed. The amount of US$0.28 million from
Credit 1448/Credit SF-15-SE was cancelled.
The PCR was prepared by the AF5 Division of the Africa Regional
Office and was based on the Staff Appraisa' Reports; the Credit/Loan
Agreements; supervision reports, correspondence between the Bank and the
Borrower; and internal Bank memoranda.
The PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED)
which did not audit the projects at this time though it may do so in the
future. The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower and cofinancier for
comments and the Borrower's comments are attached to this final version of
the PCR as Attachment I.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SENEGAL
FOURTH HICHWAY PROJECT
(Credit 993/Loan 1810-SE)
FIFTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
(Credit 1448 and SRecial Fund Credit SF-15-SE)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
1.        The socio-economic setting against which the two projects were
identified and prepared is discussed in paras. 3-6, 11-12 and 13-23 of the
February 28, 1980 President's Report (PR), and paras. 1.01-1.03 of the February
26, 1980 Staff Appraisal Report (SAR), (for the Fourth Highway Prejeut); and
in paras. 3-7, 10-11 and 17-19 of the February 21, 1984 PR, and paras. 1.01-
1.07 of the February 10, 1984 SAR (for the Fifth Highway Project).
2.        The rapid growth in the road network in the 1960. and 19709 was
not matched by a corresponding increase in maintenance funding. Accordingly,
the Fourth Highway Project emphasized measures to improve the Government's
performance in maintenance activilies, including a comprehensive staff training
program and responsibility for adequate financing of the Road Fund for equipment
renewal and operating expenses. During implementation of the Fourth Project,
Senegal's financial situation deteriorated to the point where the Government
was not able to meet its commitment to replenish the Road Fund. Fundir.g of
road maintenance remained the most important sectoral issue which the Fifth
Project, while devoting continuing attention to staff training and institutional
strengthening, undertook to address.
FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
OBJECTIVES
3.        Intendedt: Increase Government capacity to keep the road system in
adequate condition and, in particular, to train technicians and selected
staff; to improve road work planning and programming capacity; and to
rehabilitate and upgrade important road sections (SAR, para. 3.01). Achieved:
Maintenance capacity has been increased but insufficient funding by Government
has posed serious obstacles to works execution (PCR, paras. 2.18, 2.20, 2.28).
Staff training did not produce the anticipated results (PCR, paras. 2.18, 2.20,
2.22, 2.24); the rehabilitation program for 280 km of roads foreseen at appraisal
was fully executed and an additional 170 km of roads received periodic maintenance
(paras. 2.25-2.27).



- vii -
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
4.        Experience with  the  Implementation of the different  project
components was as follows:
(a) A three-year training trogram for road maintenance staff. Significant
problemsa Training Center had no official budget (PCR., para. 2.18);
consultant unsuitable (PCR., para. 2.20); difficulties in Identifying
trainees (PCR, pare. 2.22); Training Center had no statutory anid
budgetary identity (PCR, para. 2.24).
(b) A 2.5 vear technical assistanceprogram for road maintenance exec.ztion.
Good performance by consultants but little cooperation between them
and the consultant for training (PCR, para. 6.02).
(c)  Upgrading of the Soils Laboratory. Problems: The Laboratory, like
the Training Centex, had no statutory and budgetary identity and
Government failed to provide the financial autonomy that had been
promised earlier (PCR, para. 2.24).
(d) Designing of proper and systematic pavement maintenance and
strenttherint programs.  Satisfactorily carried out by the same
consultants that were employed for item (b) (PCR, para. 6.02).
(e)  Strentthening and rehabilitation of about 200 km of primary paved
roads.  Major problems initially, wainly because of lack of local
counterpart funds: the Government was not a.lle to comply with the
covenant ceiling for a CFAP 3 billion yearly Road Fund allocation
(PCR, para. 2.18). Early in the execution phase, resources were
further constrained because of sizeable irregularities mainly concerning
the purchase of fuel and spares (PCR, para. 2.19) but finally fully
executed. Appreciation of the US dollar (leading to an uncommitted
amount of about US$13 million -- PCR, para. 2.22) allowed expansion
of the scope of work to an additional 170 km of periodic maintenance
(PCR, para. 2.19).
(f)  Constructior. of the Louta-Dahra road (about 85 km) to two lane, waved
standard. Financed by Japan's OECF. Supervised by Bank. Completed.
(PCR, para. 2.22).
5.        Volume of physical work wes more than planned, thanks to fund
surpluses generated by US dollar appreciation (PCR, para. 2.29). Actual
completion time was extended to June 1986 (from December 1983 planned at
appraisal) to accommodate delays associated with the training program (PCR,
para. 2.24) and disputes   '  bidders on the road strengthening component
(PCR, para. 2.27). From 301 estimated at appraisal, re-estimated ERR was 382
(PCR, para. 4.03). Institutional strengthening is not explicitly treated in
the PCR but seems to have been satisfactory, except for the training program's
limited success, and persistently cumbersome Government procedures.

SUSTAINABILITY
6.        The project is judged to be only partially sustainable because of
major problems with the training program (PCR, paras 2.18, 2.20, 2.22, 2.24);
and difficulties in strengthening and rehabilitation contract administration
due mostly to non-availability of timely Government counterpart funding (PCR,
paras 2.18 and 2.28).
LESSONS
7.        Cumbersome administrative procedures, noted under previous Bank-
assisted operations (OED Reports No. 1723, 5077, 4810 on the First, Second
and Third Highway Projects and on the Feeder Roads Project), continued to inhibit
implementation.  It required about one year of pre-negotiations with the
Government for the Bank to obtain the commitments recommended in the Issues
Paper. The project was approved by the Board in March 1980 but did not become
effective before December 1980, because of delays in the preparat:on and
approval of the Decree and the Arrete (PCR, para. 2.13). Future operations
ought to take into account the extra time which experience suggests is
indispensable for project implementation.
8.        Non-payment by Government of local funds was a perennial problem
even though the Bank financed 902 of the cost of strengthening works, and all
of the costs of consultants and imported spare parts. In future Bank-assisted
operations, if smooth implementation Is the objective, 100X financing might
be considered. If institution-building is a higher priority, a longer project
horizon ought to be envisaged.
FIFTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
OBJECTIVES
9.        Intendeds Assist the Government to carry out maintenance operations.
Keep an adequate balance between maintenance and new road construction.
Improve further the efficiency of the road maintenance organization already
strengthened under earlier Bank Group operations, including decentralized
financial and cost accountirg systems, and planning and monitoring of
maintenance activities (PR, para. 3.01). Achieved: Significant progress was
made on these objectives (PCR 3.16) although some areas of concern remained,
mainly centered around timely payment of contractors, and diversion of
maintenance equipment and funds to non-programed works.
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
10.       Implementation experience with the project's components (designed
to support the Directorate of Road Maintenance and Equipment's program over
the four-year period 1983/84-1986/87) was as follows:
(a) Routine maintenance of about 9.000 km of roads in the first yeer.
increasing to about 10.450 km by the fourth year. includina
maintenance of feeder roads: programs were established annually,



- ix -
covering 9,330 km in 83/4 and 9,760 km in 86/7.  Actual works
covered no more than 701 of programmed works.
(b)  Periodic maintenance as warranted for roads maintained under (a),
and
(c)  Deferred periodic maintenance of other paved and travel roads
nexlected in recent years because of the Government's inability to
fund the necessary operations: This was to cover some 320 km of
paved roads and 700-800 km of gravel roads over the four-year
period. Actual works realized were resurfacing of 350 km of paved
roads and regravelling of 270 km of gravel roads. While this kept
the most heavily trafficked portions of the network in acceptable
condition, it was not sufficient to increase - or even maintain -
the total road net at the serviceability level it had at project
start-up (PCR, Table 4).
11.       The training Program continued under Highways V until project funds
ran out and the program was terminated (PCR, para. 6.03). Prolect completion
time was extended to December 1988 (from December 1987 planned at appraisal)
to allow finishing up of a few uncompleted contract works (PCR para. 3.24).
Re-estimated ERR was 65% (from 100% estimated at appraisal). Institutional
strenithenins has been satisfactory.
SJSTAINABILITY
12.       Thc project is judged not to be sustainable because of major
problems with force account routine maintenance operations (PCR, paras 3.13-
3.21, 4.05); with the training program (PCR, para 6.03); and with institutional
strengthening (PCR, para 8.04).
LESSONS
13.       There were major problems with local funding which resulted in
erosion of confidence in the administration on the part of the private sector
(PCR, paras. 2.28, 3.21). Unless new safeguards can be introduced, this will
create difficulties for the proposed turn-over of more maintenance work to
private contractors.
14.       Fund shortages have led to an increased backlog of maintenance work
(PCR, para. 5.06). This ought to be dealt with by contract rather than force
account. The Bank ought to decide how payments to contractors will be possible
when Government continues to be short of funds.
15.       The disappointing results of the training program equally reflect
the problem of funds, rather than a lack of Government commitment to training
(PCR, para. 3.22). This raises questions concerning whether, and under which
conditions, the Bank ought to be prepared to be further involved in this
undoubtedly high-priority activity.

FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
(Credit 993/Loan 1810-SE)
FIFTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
(Credit 1448 and Special Fund Credit SF-15-SE)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01        The Fourth and Fifth Highway Projects both essentially provided for
a continuation of road maintenance operations initiated under the first three
highway projects. As the Fourth and Fifth Projects were similar in scope, it
is appropriate that they be evaluated together in a single PCR.
1.02        By 1979, the main road network was approaching a state which met the
country's economic and social needs, but the overall network had not been kept
in good repair. It still lacked regular maintenance and timely strengthening
of the more heavily travelled roads which had deteriorated under increasingly
heavy traffic.   The major objective of both projects was to continue to
strengthen the Government's capacity to maintain its road system.
1.03        Efforts to improve road maintenance began under the First Highway
Project in 1972 with the establishment of a centrally administered road
maintenance organization. About 1,000 km of primary roads which needed pavement
strengthening were identified under the project by a road improvement and
maintenance study, and maintenance equipment was purchased. According to the
PCR, the findings of the study provided a useful basis for follow-up projects.
1.04        The Second and Third Highway Projects were designed to assist in
implementing a paved road strengthening program and a highway maintenance
program. The PCR for these two projects noted that the results of both were a
significantly improved trunk network and a much improved maintenance system.
It fur,her noted that there were still major problems to be overcome in highway
maintenance but that the country was in a good position to make significant
advances. One problem highlighted in the PCR was that under the Second Highway
Project, a reorganization to centralize maintenance operations was initiated.
However, this was strongly and vigorously resisted by local staff; under the
Third Project the Bank assisted the Ministry of Equipment (ME) in returning to
the decentralized system it had before.
1.05        The overall responsibility for both highway projects, as for the
earlier project, was assigned to the Directorate of Road Maintenance and
Equipment (DERM) in the General Directorate of Public Works (DGTP) of the ME.
The Fourth Highway Project was cofinanced by the overseas Economic Cooperative
Fund of Japan (OECF), while the Fifth Highway Project was financed by IDA and
the Special Fund on a 50:50 basis.
1.06        This report is based on information in Bank files, and on interviews
with Bank staff associated with the project.



II. THE FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
A. Identification. Preparation and Appraisal
Identification
2.01        The main components of the project were firmly identified at an early
stage in t}e project cycle as consisting of: (i) continuation of maintenance
programs begun under earlier projects, and (ii) construction of the Louga-Dahra
Road for which studies were carried out under the Third Highway Project. The
project proposed in the first Project Brief (PB) of February 21, 1978 closely
resembled the project that was eventually presented as the Fourth Highway
Project. The tentative cost estimate was also close to the appraisal estimate
of US$59.5 million.
2.02        The PB noted the main problems which had been encountered with the
earlier project as (i) unsatisfactory administrative organization and procedures,
(ii) lack of qualified staff, and (iii) unsatisfactory finances. It called for
a clear commitment from the Government to improve these problem areas in parallel
with project preparation. The PB considered this commitment a prerequisite for
improving maintenance  efficiency.    The  strategy  proposed  for  improving
maintenance efficiency under the Fourth Highway Project consisted of (i)
concentrating on improving routine maintenance operations which would be carried
out by force account, and (ii) executing more periodic maintenance by contractors
since the consultant had estimated that it was less expensive to execute this
work by contract than by force acc unt.
2.03        The PB pointed out that one problem holding back the implementation
of earlier maintenance projects was the lack of qualified personnel at all
levels. Related problems included the low level of civil service salaries and
travel allowances, and the fact that almost half of the maintenance budget was
spent on personnel.  The PB recommended that: (i) appointment of new staff who
are either fully qualified for the more important positions or suitable for
training, should be made a condition of effectiveness; (ii) incentives to
personnel based on performance should be provided; and (iii) staff numbers should
be reduced.
2.04        In examining the budget for road maintenance, the PB noted that
there was substantial waste of resources, particularly fuel, by force account
operations and recommended that mor.e periodic maintenance be carried out by
contract.   The Road Fund was being increasingly abused and usea to finance
construction at high cost to the Government. It called for earmarking the Road
Fund for maintenance purposes.   The PB recommended that in view of the
significant budgetary constraints being experienced in Senegal, the Bank should
finance as much of the local costs as possible.
2.05        The PB indicated the priority of the project components so that the
project could readily be reduced to suit the funds available, and recommended
that the Bank seek co-financing. As regards the Louga-Dahra road, the PB noted
that the feasibility study showed only a return of 15% and that its priority



should be reviewed. It also recommended t.iat the unecornomic Louga-Dahra branch
rail line be closed when the road was opened to traffic.
2.06        Lastly, the PB stated that the Government had not yet provided all
the counterpart funds for the ongoing Second and Third Highway Projects, thus
delaying the award of several contracts. It recommended that signature of these
contracts should be a condition of project negotiations.
Preparation
2.07        The preparation mission of July 1978 submitted an updated PB of
October 1978, in which the project content, scope and cost was largely unchanged.
It focussed on a first phase three year training program that had been recently
prepared which called for the reorganization of the Training Center in Dakar.
It also proposed ways and means to remedy the major organizational, managerial
and  cost  constraints  identified  earlier.    The PB  recommended  that  the
establishment of an acceptable road maintenance organization and satisfactory
arrangements for its funding be conditions of the loan. It noted that a request
to cofinance US$20.0 million had been made to Japan.
Appraisal
2.08        The project was appraised in late 1978 with the participation of a
consultant who was _.nvolved in preparing the training program.  The project
remained unchanged from that proposed in the October PB. In order to permit an
early start on training, the mission recommended in the Issues Paper that a
surplus of about US $2.5 million in the Third Highway Loan be used to: (i)
rehabilitate the Training Center; (ii) provide technical assistance for the
fIrst 6 months of the training program; (iii) extend the use of consultants for
road maintenance by one year, and (iv) finance further workshop rehabilitation.
2.09        Other issues included a recommendation that the Bank and the co-
lender finance about 901 of total costs.   It was noted that Senegal had a
relatively well developed road network, and that it should concentrate on road
maintenance and slow down on the construction of new roads. The Government was
in the process of approving a decree for the reorganization of the ME and it was
recommended that signature of this decree be a condition of negotiations.
2.10        The Issues Paper further recommended that: (i) the Bank seek to
limit or restrain the financing of road construction from the Road Fund; (ii)
a signed decree establishing the Road Fund be a condition of Board Presentation;
(iii) a special account be created to replenish the Road Fund; and (iv) a
covenant be included in the loan document requiring the Government to consult
with the Bank on its annual road construction plan if it exceeded a certain
limit.
2.11        The Decision Meeting of January  16, 1979 endorsed the basic
recommendations of the appraisal team with minor amendments. It proposed to
send a letter to Government notifying it of the conditions of negotiations, and
indicating the assurances to be sought at negotiations. The Office of the Vice
President, Operations, (VPO) agreed to the recommendations of the Decision



Meeting except for the external financing of 902 which it recommended should be
limited to 85Z. It commended the Issues Paper as a 'good document".
2.12        In April 1979 the OECF informed the Board that Japan would make an
untied loan to Senegal of about US$12.3 million for the construction and
supervision of the Louga-Dahra road; the contractors and consultants were to be
selected in accordance with OECF guidelines.
2.13        It required approximately one year of pre-negotiations with the
Government for the Bank to obtain the commitments recommended in the Issues
Paper. Negotiations were held in January, 1979. The most important commitments
were: (i) the setting up and the operation of a Road Fund to be used for
maintenance; (ii) the creation of a Special Account to be replenished by the Road
Fund to finance small road maintenance expendituros; (iii) new road investments
to be added to the investment budget rather than to the Road Fund. Conditions
of effectiveness included: the issuance of (a) a decree reorganizing the Road
Fund, and (b) an Arrete establishing the special account.   The project was
approved by the Board in March 1980 but did not become effective until December
1980, because of delays in the preparation and approval of the Decree and the
Arrete.
Proiect Obiectives and Description
2.14        The major objectives of the project were to increase the Government's
capacity to keep the road system in adequate condition, particularly reducing
the acute shortage of trained technicians and other skilled workers; to improve
the Government's capacity to plan road maintenance, and strengthening and
rehabilitation works in the most economical way.
2.15        To achieve the above objectives, the proposed project includeds
(a)   the first three years of a training program, with  classroom
instruction and a training production brigade for road maintenance
personnel, including:
(i)   procure3ment of materials and supplies; and
(ii) technical assistance and fellowships for local trainees and
for training of consultants' counterparts abroad;
(b)   a two and a half year technical assistance program for execution of
road maintenance;
(c)   procurement of equipment and construction of offices  for the
Government soils laboratory to enable it to participate in the
preparation and supervision of road maintenance programs;
(d)   design  of  proper  and  systematic  pavement  maintenance  and
strengthening programs through the introduction of appropriate
technologies;



(e)   strengthening and rehabilitation of 200 km of primary paved roads;
and
(f)   construction of the Louga-Dahra road (85 km) to two-lane, paved
standards.
2.16        The project was expected to be completed in about four years at a
total cost of US$ 59.5 million of which the loanlcredit provided US$38.0 million
and OECF US$12.3 million for a total foreign exchange component of about 85X.
B. Prolect Implementation
2.17        Despite the delay in effectiveness, the project got off to a fast
start. By late 1980, a new contract had been negotiated with the consultants
who had provided technical assistance on road maintenance under the earlier
project. The Government had also called for proposals from consultants on other
technical assistance components, and had prequali!fied contractors for the
pavement strengthening program.  By early 1981, contracts were in the pro ess
of being awarded to consultants for training and the design of the pavement
maintenance and strengthening program, and to contractors for the road
strengthening works.
2.18        By the end of 1981, the improvement works for the Training Center
had been completed and the equipment installed under funding from the Third
Highway Project (para 1.04). The training consultant had begun to mobilize and
the first batch of trainees were scheduled to arrive. By March 1982, most of
the consultant's team had mobilized but no training had started because the
Training Center had no official budget. The problem was resolved on an ad hoc
basis. Progress on other components was mixed, in part because of lack of funds,
as the Government was not able to comply with the covenant calling for a CFAF
3 billion yearly Road Fund allocation. Work on pavement strengthening by a joint
venture contractor was well underway, but no work had started on a second
contract by a local firm. Work was proceeding on the construction of the Louga-
Dahra road which was fully financed by OECF.
2.19        In July 1982, a supervision mission found that project execution
had improved over the last six months, although road maintenance operations had
been hampered by a shortage of operating funds. The Road Fund for FY83 had been
reduced from the target of CFAF 3 billion to CFAF 2.15 billion. In addition,
available resources were constrained because of quite sizeable irregularities
which had come to light, mainly concerning the purchase of fuel and spares. Some
dismissals had followed and the audit system was made permanent. Work on other
components, except for training and construction, was generally proceeding well.
In fact, the scope of the pavement strengthening works was extended because of
the availability of surplus funds as a result of the appreciation of the US
dollar against the CFA Franc.
2.20        The appraisal mission for the Fifth Highway Project in the fall of
1982 reported that progress on the Fourth Project continued to be satisfactory
except on training and construction of the Louga-Dahra road. A Bank training



advisor who visited Senegal. in November 1982 reported that progress on the
training component was unsatisfactory due to poor performance on the part of the
consultant. Their team leader was replaced a few months later and his successor
was instructed to prepare the required programs in time for review by the next
Bank mission. This mission found a commendable change in attitude on the part
of the consultant, and a suitably prepared training program. The performance
of the Senegalese manager of CPTP was fully satisfactory.
2.21        Concerning the Louga-Dahra road, IDA sought OECF agreement to Bank
supervision of the construction because consultants had reported an 'alarming
drop in work quality and insufficiency of contractors equipment". OECF agreed
to the Bank's proposal.  It was found that the concern over quality of work was
largely unfounded, but that the contractor had moved on to a nearby job without
completing the work. The contractor was instructed to complete the remaining
work.
2.22        By mid 1983, progress on the project was noted as 'on the whole
satisfactory". However, the Training Center was operating below capacity because
of the difficulty in identifying suitable trainees willing to forego field
allowances to come to Dakar for training sessions. Uncommitted funds of about
US$13.0 million due to the appreciation of the US$ to the CFAF, were to be used
for additional technical assistance and studies, further pavement strengthening
works and a retroactive increase in disbursement percentages on routine
maintenance to help the financially hard pressed Government. The latter payment
was conditional on the Government paying contractors large arrears that had
accrued. The Bank sent an economist to review the economic justification of the
proposed additional strengthening works.
2.23        In October 1983, an audit mission from the Bank pointed out a number
of shortcomings in the public works administration. The mission recommended a
series of steps to tighten controls over the revolving funds in the regional
offices, the use of equipment and procurement arrangements. It also called for
better cost vontrols over the work.
2.24        By the end of 1983, the date the project was to have been completed,
the original physical components were largely finished.   The main problem
continued to be the Training Center where the training program was proceeding
slowly. It finally appeared that a major problem in setting up the Training
Center was that due partly to the severe budgetary constraints experienced at
the time, it did not receive a clear statutory and budgetary identity.
Incidentally, the central soils laboratory which was also to be set up under
the project suffered from the same type of problem. In its case, the Government
failed to provide the financial autonomy to the agency that had been agreed on
earlier.
2.25        As noted in para 2.22, surplus funds were available to do additional
work and studies for this were being competently carried out. The Government
paid the arrears due contractors in January 1984 and shortly thereafter the
disbursement rate on the Bank loan was increased retroactively from 76% to 902.
The Bank recommended to the DGTP that the consulting firm on road maintenance



- 7 -
add an expert on financial management to its team to help strengthen the
accounting work of that entity.
2.26        With regard to the additional pavement strengthenlng works (par.
2.22), the Government indicated to the Bank early in 1984 that it would prefer
to widen the Trans-Gambia Route rather than continue with previously identified
works.   It was finally agreed that only part of the Route would form an
acceptable program. As regards the findings of the audit (para 2.23), the April
1984 mission found that audits of the regional revolving funds were nearing
completion and had been well done.
2.27        Contracts for the 170 km of strengthening works were not awarded
until about mid 1985 because of a dispute with domestic bidders who were rejected
from prequalification by the Bank and contested this action. The dispute was
finally settled, with the Bank's rejection upheld. The delay necessitated a
second extension of the Closing Date to June 30, 1986. The Bank also approved
the widening of 126.5 km of the Tran-Gambia Route from 3.5 m to 6 m, and the
reconstruction and widening of a bridge.
2.28        Towards the end of the project, non-payment by the Government of
local funds again became a problem even though the Bank financed 90S of the cost
of the strengthening works, and all of the costs of consultants and lmported
spare parts. The problem was of even greater concern under the ongoing Fifth
Highway Project but was eventually resolved (para 3.21). The disbursement rate
for civil works was subsequently reduced to 73Z in June 1986 to avoid
overcommitment of remaining funds. The project was substantially completed by
mid 1986.
2.29        Disbursements of credit and loan funds lagged behind the appraisal
estlmate by approximately one year during the first three years of the project.
After that, disbursements were further delayed by the time required to call for
bids and award contracts for the additional strengthening works.   The very
favorable rate of exchange increased the purchasing power of the loan funds,
which enabled Government to do considerably more work than originally planned.
Credit funds were completely disbursed as of December 11, 1985, and the loan
funds as of October 14, 1986.
III. THE FIFTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
A. Identification. Preparation and Appraisal
Identification and Preparation
3.01        The Fifth Highway Project was identified in a Project Brief prepared
in July, 1982. The brief noted that the budgetary allocations for maintenance
had been lowered in FY82 (para 2.19) and continuing constraints were expected
in FY83 and FY84. This left little funds for naintenance as first priority was
given to meeting the payroll.



-8-
3.02        The project was identified as continuing support for   annual
maintenance programs for which planning, execution and monitoring systems had
been developed with the assistance of the Third and Fourth Highway Projects.
The Brief stated that no separate project preparation was needed except for
defining more accurately the monitoring controls which had already been prepared.
The main elements to be worked out were disbursement and auditing procedures and
a tentative cost estimate. The purpose of the project was to ensure adequate
funding for highway maintenance, recognizing that if maintenance was deferred,
it would result in more extensive and costly work later.
Appraisal
3.03  The project which consisted of a 3 year extension of the ongoing
maintenance program, under the Fourth Highway Project, was appraised in
September, 1982.  In the Issues Paper of October 18, the main issue was one of
local financing.  The appraisal mission indicated to the Government that the
project was to supplemenit its effort, and not replace it. The FY82 budget which
had been lowered from the covenanted CFAF 3.0 billion to CFAF 2.15 million (para
2.19) was finally reduced to only CFAF 1.0 billion, and there was uncertainty
as to how much would be available for FY83. The Government indicated that any
'assurance' it gave would in fact neither assure provision of the budgeted amount
nor its timely availability, given the high public deficits foreseen for the next
several years. The mission estimated that to meet backlog and normal maintenance
requirements, about CFAF 2.1 billion would be required in FY83 and CFAF 4.0
billion over the following three years.
3.04        The Decision Meeting of November 12, 1982, recognized the need to
assist the Government in its efforts to finance road maintenance to a minimum
level, provided that Bank assistance would complement the Government's own
effort. The meeting recognized that some improvement in the budgetary situation
was taking place as a result of the financial rehabilitation program and better
crops. Thus it supported the proposal that the Government's contribution to the
Road Fund be progressively increased over the three year program, and the IDA
contribution correspondingly decreased. Senior Management subsequently decided
that a higher and flat percentage of disbursement would be more appropriate
throughout the project period so as to assure adequate availability of funds.
Also, the project was expanded to cover four rather than three years of the road
maintenance program.  Cost estimates of the project include the entire road
maintenance operations program of the ME over FY84-FY87.
3.05        Three conditions of negotiations were set: (i) the replenishment of
the regional revolving funds; (ii) an allocation of CFAF 2 billion for the Road
Fund in FY84; and (iii) settlement of outstanding local payments to contractors
under the ongoing Fourth Highway Project. The first two were fulfilled and IDA
later decided that in view of the Government's continuing budgetary problems,
agreement on a repayment schedule would be sufficient.
3.06        Negotiations were held in Dakar in August 1983.  The following main
agreements were reachad: (i) a payment schedule for local funds owed to
contractors (subsequently paid t-efore Board presentation); (ii) a mid-term review
of the project, to give IDA an opportunity to apply remedial action if



- 9 -
performance was not satisfactory; and (iii) the allocations for the Road Fund
would be CFAF 1.7 billion in FY85, CFAF 3.2 million in FY86 and CFAF 3.0 billion
in FY87, all in constant 1983 terms. The Government was slow to implement its
agreements, thus delaying Board presentation to March 1984.
3.07        In February 1984, IDA decided to make available funds from the IDA
Special Fund, on a 50/50 baFis between IDA and the Special Fund. These funds
replaced cofinancing which IDA had expected to obtain from another source.
Special Funds were to be used to finance civil works which would be carried out
on the basis of local competitive bidding.    This  arrangement  increased
substantially the amount of external financing available, and enabled IDA to
reduce the Government's financial commitment under the project in view of its
difficult budget situation. Further assistance was provided to the Government
by including in the prrij' ct provision for retroactive financing of up to US $1.5
million for expenses incurred after September 1, 1983.
3.08        The Government promptly opened the Project Account for handling its
contribution to the Road Fund.  It was however slow in submitting the legal
opinion which delayed effectiveness to August, 1984.
Obiectives and Description
3.09        While the ongoing Fourth Highway Project provided funds for the
strengthening of paved roads and training for road maintenance staff, and several
other sources covered feeder road financing needs, the highest return activity,
maintenance, was inadequately financed. The main purpose of the Fifth Highway
Project was thus to avoid road network deterioration for lack of maintenance,
which would result in subsequent rehabilitation needs at far higher cost than
that of timely maintenance. Through involvement in mainuenance activities, a
second objective was to further improve efficiency in physical operations, use
of funds, monitoring and control. These institutional developments would also
improve later use of Government's own funds.
3.10        The Project consisted of a 4-year time slice of the road maintenance
program of DERM, during which the IDA credit would finance a percentage (declining)
of all road maintenanee expenditure. The objective of the program was to prevent
further deterioration of the paved network, and through the execution of deferred
maintenance, return the gravel network to at least the average quality that it
had in the late 1970s. The work program consisted of:
(a)   routine maintenance of 9,100 km of roads in the first year rising
to about 10,500 km in the fourth year, including the extension of
proper maintenance to the feeder road network;
(b)   periodic maintenance (repaving and regravelling of road surfaces,
and repair of structures) as warranted on the maintained network;
(c)   deferred periodic maintenance of paved and gravel roads not carried
out in a timely fashion because of the funding problems in recent
years.



- 10 -
3.11        To thia end, the DERM was to continues
(a)   to plan yearly work programs In accordance with practices established
under the Third Highway Project and to Improve such practices where
required;
(b)   to operate about 60 field brigades for carrying out all routine
maintenance and part of the periodic maintenance (regravelling);
(c)   to sub-contract remaining periodic and deferred maintenance (repaving
and regravelling; the intent was to shift the force account/contract
balance for periodic maintenance from 50-50 to 30-70);
(d)   to ensure the timely renewal of DERM road maintenanae equipment;
(e) to complete the modernization of central and regional workshops, and
to adtaquately maintain the brigades' equipment;
(f) to maintain and improve the financial and cost accounting system_S
(g)   to carry out yearly audits of all road %aintenance operations and
related activities.
3.12        The project was to be completed in mid-1987 at a total cost of US
$40.3 million excluding taxes, of which the IDA and Special Credit provided
US$21.5 million.
B. Project Implementation
3.13        As the project was essentially a continuation of the Fourth Highway
Project, its execution got off to a good start. The contracts of the consultants
for maintenance and training on the earlier project were extended, and IDA sent
out a mission, including a financial consultant, in mid-1984 to identify and
resolve start up problems. These were mainly financial, involving mechanisms
of project funding, reimbursement, accounting and auditing.
3.14        By the end of 1984, IDA had approved contracts for the supply of new
equipment under retroactive financing, and existing equipment was being
rehabilitated. Tenders for additional equipment had been called but because
IDA procurement guidelines were not followed, delays ensued. Also, the Government
requested IDA to finance an ongoing road reconstruction contract but IDA declined
on the grounds that among other issues, its guidelines had not been followed in
selecting the contractors.
3.15        Early in 1985, the financial consultant who had supervised the Fourth
Highway Project, reported that in general the project was going well. However,
he noted that delays in ordering spares had been particularly damaging to the
overhaul and repair of equipment, and listed a number of minor problems for IDA's
attention during the forthcoming mid-term review (para. 2.08).



- 11 -
3.16        The mid-term review took place in June 1985. The mission concluded
that from "the standpoint of improvement in financial reporting, and internal
controls, the midpoint of the project represented an achievement of considerable
progress".  However, viewed from the standpo4lt of the Fifth Highway Project
taken as a whole, with its institutional g4al of managerial self-sufficiency,
certain areas left cause for concern. In general, the improvements made were
not sufficiently integrated into the functions of the DERM, and a strategy for
achieving this integration had not yet been formulated. In other areas (training,
equipment, maintenance and repair, levels of equipment availability necessary
for road maintenance) a similar lack of fully coordinated strategy had serious
consequences.
3.17        The mid-term mission noted that there had not been any resolution
of the issues of the official establishment of the Training Center and its
budget. It called attention to the fact that (i) a private bank which was the
custodian of IDA local funds was having liquidity problems, and (ii) the
administration of Government payments to suppliers was unsatisfactory in that
DERM was not notified by the Treasury as to who was paid and when. Rectification
of these problems was essential in view of plans to entrust equipment repairs
to the private sector.
3.18        Finally, the mission found that preliminary results indicated that
for force account work only 571 of the planned work would be achieved, but using
83X of funds.   This poor showing was accounted for in part by the use of
maintenance equipment on work outside the project, and by excessive idle equipment
time. For contract works, 100% of the funds had been committed but actual work
would not be completed until long after the budget period. As a result, IDA proposed
several amendments to the Credit Agreements to increase the rate of disbursement,
pay suppliers directly, and change fuel purchases from ICB to LCB (which had been
proposed in the SAR).
3.19        By October 1985, the HE's approach in integrating the planning of
road maintenance with that of training and of equipment maintenance was showing
progress. This was reflected in a revised training program which was agreed
upon. Maintenance work execution by contract was satisfactory and progress on
force account works improved somewhat to 70% of the target.  The Government
continued to fall behind schedule in paying local suppliers: while the budget
was adequate, liquidity problems in the Treasury caused delays in payments. The
liquidity crisis at the bank holding the project's revolving fund was continuing
and the account had to be moved to another bank.
3.20        By mid-1986, road maintenance works by contract were all underway.
These covered the 320 km of paved, roads to be resurfaced under the project;
actual works were carried out on 350 km (324 km double surface treatment, 26 km
cement-asphalt). Force account works continued to be delayed, in part because
of slow payment of local funds and in part because of lengthy procedures involved
in replenishing the Revolving Fund from the credit, although in the end, all
local funds due the Revolving Fund had been paid, and the Fund replenished up
to its authorized ceiling of CFAF 1.3 billion. Regravelling of unpaved roads
by force account, foreseen for 700-800 km at appraisal, covered only some 270
km. Routine maintenance plans were established annually and covered 9,330 km



- 12 -
in 1983/84, increasing to 9,760 km in 1986187. However, only the paved road net
was actually fully covered, while earth and gravel road maintenance Leached only
between 50-60X of programmed maintenance levels. While these actions kept the
most heavily trafficked portions of the network in acceptable condition, they
were not sufficient to maintain, let alone improve, the serviceability index of
the road net overall as expected at appraisal (Table 4).
3.21        The 1986 mission reported that a major problem in project execution
was the recent development of a growing backlog iti the payment of bills to
suppliers with a resulting erosion of confidence in the administration on the
part of the private sector. This problem ad4ed to the difficulty of turning over
more work from force account to the private sector as suppliers and contractors
became increasingly reluctant to bid on Government contracts or to sign contracts
which had been awarded to them. The mission pointed out to the Government that
the situation was untenable and that it would be increasingly difficult to pursue
a follow-up lending operation if the matter was not settled rapidly. By October
1987, the payment situation had greatly improved and the amount owed had been
reduced from CFAF 2.2 billion to CFAF 360 million. However, it still has not
been possible to establish a mechanism that would enable the ME to maintain up-
to-date records of its accounts payable and avoid similar situations in future.
3.22        During the visit, Government requested approval to use most of the
remaining funds of CFAF 500 million for resealing of existing paved roads by
contract. IDA subsequently approved this work. The mission found that since
the consultants managing the Training Center had left in March 1986, output of
the Center had steadily deteriorated.
3.23        Audits have been completed by external auditors approved by IDA
during the past three years. These reports indicated thac the accounts were
generally in gcod order.
3.24        By end 1988, the last of the actions financed under the project were
completed. The status of the road network as of December 1987 when the majority
of project works were completed is given in Table 4.
IV. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
Fourth Hiahwav Proiect
4.01        As implemented, the Fourth Highway project completed more maintenane-
works than anticipated at appraisal: approximately 250 km were strengthened as
compared to 200 km planned and in addition the Trans-Gpmbia Road (126 km) was
widened from 3.5 to 6 meters. This achievement was in part made possible by the
availability of surplus funds resulting from the appreciat'on of the US$ against
the CFA franc. The economic reevaluation followed the appraisal methodology
which quantified only the benefits derived from vehicle operating cost (VOC)
savings stemming from an improved road network. These VOC savings were expected
to be passed on to shippers and vassengers due to the competition among truck
and bus operators: tariffs actually charged for freight and passenger transport



- 13 -
do, in fact, vary fairly consistently with the state of different road trajectories.
The resulting estimate of the project economic rate of return (ERR) is 38S-- above
the appraisal estimate of 302, even though the economic reevaluation shows
significant differences between the appraisal forecast and the actual estimates
of some economic factors.
4.02        Firstly, the appraisal overestimated the traffic, assuming a traffic
growth above 4.51 from 1977 onwards. In fact, the traffic declined in 1979 and
during the early years of 1980, reflecting the overall economic downward trend
caused by droughts and low export prices. Traffic came back to 1979 level in
1985, and is estimated to grow at about 32 from 1985 onward (Table 5 compares
forecast and actual estimates of traffic). Secondly, the current estimates of
'OC savings are lower than appraisal estimates; the former were derived from the
updated Highway Design and Maintenance Model (HDM) version 3 which adjusted these
estimates downward from earlier versions of the model (Table 6). On the whole,
the appraisal overestimate of traffic, coupled with higher VOC savings led to
forecast of high benefits. But as the costs of civil works were also generally
overestimated (Table 7), they offset the higher benefits in the appraisal
computation of ERRs.
4.03        At appraisal, the two main components of the project, the pavement
strengthening program and the constructior of the Louga-Dahra Road, were also
evaluated separately. The road sections strengthened consisted of the main road
network linking Dakar with the heavily populated regions of Thies, Sine Saloum,
Eastern Senegal and Casamance, of road sections linking Senegal to Mauritania
and The Gambia, and of other sections used to transport groundnut production in
regions undergoing intensive developmeut of irrigation-based agriculture. These
road sections were at appraisal 13 to 30 years old, approaching the end of their
economic life and in an advanced state of deterioration requiring complete
reconstruction.  The scenarios of pavement degradation used for the economic
reevaluation were the same as those used in the recently appraised Transport
Sector Project, i.e., (i) without project, the international roughness index
(IRI) is 6 and reaches 12 after an eight-year period, and (ii) with the project,
the IRI is 2 at completion of works and reaches 4 after a fifteen-year period
of time. The project life for the pavement strengthening program is 15 years.
Table 7 shows that t.ae actual estimates of ERRs for the 10 road sections range
from 72 to 83% which compare to appraisal estimates ranging from 152 to 602.
The only road section with an ERR under 152 (Sokone-Karang; 11.4 km) was
particularly expensive to build (about 70X higher than appraised) and involved
low traffic and traffic growth (Tables 5 and 6). The overall ERR for the pavement
strengthening program is estimated at 392, compared to 40% at appraisal. If future
traffic growth is 02, the ERR would fall to 36%.
4.04        Benefits derived from the Louga-Dahra new road construction include
lower transport costs due mainly to VOC savings, sborter distances as compared
to the old road (85 instead of 125 km), more frequent and faster public transport
services and also the avoidance of the deficit of the rail branch line which was
closed by the completion of the road construction. All rail passenger and old
road traffic has diverted to the new public road transport. Pas&enger traffic
growth was estimated at 6.3% p.a. at appraisal which compares to actual traffic
growth of 3Z.  Freight traffic was converted to equivalent vehicles assuming at



- 14 -
502-55S load factor and estimated at appraisal to increase from 116,300 tons in
1982 to 243,900 tons in 1997, actual traffic is very close to this estimate.
The project life was estimated at 20 years.  The actual ERR estimate is 301
compared to 151 at appraisal, due mainly to lower construction costs. If the
traffic growth is 0%, the ERR would fall to '7Z.
Fifth Highway Proiect
4.05        The Fifth Highway Project, carried out partly in parallel with the
Fourth Highway Project, aimed mainly at avoiding a severe deterioration of the
road network which would have led to rehabilitation at far higher cost than
timely routine and periodic malntenance.   Very high benefits and ERRs were
estimated at appraisal based on VOC savings and the postponement of the need for
new investments in rehabilitation work. It was assumed that the average index
for paved roads (Table 4) would improve from 3.4 in 1983 to 3.7 in 1987, and that
for unpaved roads from 1.9 in 1983 to 2.6 in 1987. However, mainly because of
underfunding of the local share of maintenance, the project did not fully achieve
its objectives and, at the end of 1987, the average indices for paved and unpaved
roads had declined to 2.9 and 2.1 respectively. Without the project, it is
estimated (using very conservative assumptions) that these indices would have
fallen to 2 bad 1 respectively. With these assumptions, the re-estimate of the
project ERR is 65Z, still well above the opportunity cost of capital but less
than the appraisal estimate which forecasted an ERR above 1001. Detailed results
are presented in Tables 8, 9, and 10.
V. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
5.01        The Government was slow in taking necessary measures both in meeting
the conditions of the loanicredit effectiveness, and implementing the Fourth
Highway project. After the first year, the Government funded less than half of
the agreed highway maintenance budget, which seriously handicapped road maintenance
o'teratlons. The available funds went to meet fixed costs, main'y personnel, leaving
insufficient funds for operations.
5.02        The uneconomic Louga-Dahra branch rail line (para. 2.05), was closed
after the parallel road had been completed.
5.03        The Government mishandled a number of procurement matters on both
projects involving consultants and contractors, by failing to follow Bank
guidelines. This caused delays in getting work underway.
5.04        As noted in para. 3.17, the operations of both the Training Center
and the soils laboratory were severely handicapped by the lack of administration
action to legalize their status and finance their operations. The Government
never did act in these matters, and this remains a major failure on its part to
meet obligations under the Fourth Highway Project.
5.05        Government was generally slow in making available its local currency
commitments to both projects.   This led to delays in project execution and



_ 15 -
reluctance of local suppliers and contractors to bid on contracts for spar.
parts, fuel, and maintenance works.
5.06 As a result of the shortage of budgetary funds combined with higher than
normal rainfall leve&s over the past years, the backlog of maintenance work has
risen substantially: 302 of the paved road network now requires strengthening
and periodic maintenance is overdue on a similar proportion of the unpaved network.
The rehabilitation and maintenance needs for the next five-year period are estimated
at US$300 million. A major effort is thus required to reduce this backlog. Periodic
as well as some of the routine maintenance works should in future be carried out
by private contractors rather than by departmental forces who, for multiple
institutional-administrative reasons have proved less efficient in the past.
VI. THE CONSULTANTS PERFORMANCE
6.01        The performance of the three main consulting firms involved with the
execution of both projects was mixed. The consultant on the pavement strengthening
component performed satisfactorily.
6.02        The consultant on maintenance generally performed well both on
improving maintenance programming and execution of wo;ks. A real contribution
to the project was the training on both field and office tasks given by the
maintenance consultants to a number of engineers to prepare them for advancement.
But there was little cooperation between that firm and the consultant on training;
obviously it was important for the Training Center to produce trainees with the
skills and in sufficient numbers to meet the needs of the maintenance program.
6.03        As for the consultants on training, the files indicate unsatisfactory
progress in establishing and operating the Training Center throughout the
implementation period. The first project manager accomplished little and was
eventually replaced. His successor was much more dynamic and pulled the team
together.   But his efforts were somewhat frustrated by the failure of the
Government to provide a clear organizational and budgetary identity to the
Training Center (para. 5.03) which contributed to its inability to meet training
needs (para. 2.24). It was not until towards the end of the execution period
of the Fifth Highway Project that the consultant succeeded in designing and
implementing a satisfactory training program.   By then, available funds were
running out and the program had to be terminated. This would seem to indicate
that the Governmet was either not much Interested in, or thought it could not
afford to pay for, training.
VII. tHE BANK'S PERFORMANCE
7.01        The Bank moved promptly to identify, prepare and appraise both the
Fourth and Fifth Highway Projects, and the projects appraised were the same as
the projects that were first identified.  The Bank acted quickly to locate
sources of cofinancing for the road construction component in the Fourth Highway



- 16 -
Project. The delays In project processing followed negotiations of both projects
and were attributable to the slow progress of the Government In meeting lending
conditions.
7.02        As regards execution, both projects were supervised by Bank staff
with training, financial and mechanical specialists brought in at appropriate
times to deal with problems in their fields. Two aspects which contributed to
the quality of supervision deserve particular attentions (i) the project staff
remained unchanged throughout most of the execution period of both projects; and
(it) as indicated in the Basic Data, supervision missions were frequent. Prompt
action was taken by the Bank to deal with problems as they arose both in processing
the projects up to appraisal and during supervision.
7.03        The Bank was active in seeking cofinancing, especially for the Fourth
Highway Project. The Bank worked closely with the cofinancier on this project,
keeping them fully informed of developments, and even supervising the construction
component when the cofinancier did not have staff available to do that work.
Cofinancing for the Fifth Highway Project was obtained from the Special Fund soon
after it had been established.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01        Prompt action was taken to correct problems and bring in specialists
to assist when appropriate. However, the inability of the Government to budget
funds presented problems beyond the control of the Bank.
8.02        The main shortcoming in the Fourth Project was the slow  progress
in setting up and operating the Training Center. The Bank should have specifically
called for the establishment of a new institution, in the Credit Documents and
taken steps to ensure that the new entity was legally and financially established
both in the Government's organizational structure and in its budget. In setting
up new agencies or reorganizing existing ones, it is most important that the Bank
agree with the Government on an action plan that will detail the steps it must
take to create the agency and provide the appropriate budgetary allocations.
8.03        Insufficient funding on the part of the Government delayed the
execution of both projects. Given the economic problems of the Government, it
is difficult to say what more might have been done by the Bank other than what
it did to ease the shortage of local funds.
8.04        The next road project should concentrate on reducing the backlog of
periodic maintenance. This work, as well as some routine maintenance, should
be carried out by the private construction industry (para 5.05). The ME,, which
has improved its administrative capability over the last decade, will need some
technical assistance to help it prepare standard contract documents for routine
maintenance operations heretofore carried out by force account; analyze bids
expeditiously, and effectively manage and supervise construction and maintenance
works by large numbers of small contractors.
