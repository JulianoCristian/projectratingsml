                   The Program Development Objective is to support economic policies to
                   mitigate the impact of the global crisis and strengthen the medium-term
                   framework for sustainable economic recovery and growth. The program
                   will contribute to achieving this objective by further developing the
                   regulatory, monitoring and financial framework for fiscal and financial
                   sustainability, labor market efficiency, and trade liberalization.
                   The four main Policy Areas of the DPL are:
                   · Implementation of countercyclical fiscal policies during 2009 while
                     adopting measures to enhance medium-term fiscal sustainability for
                     2010 and beyond, including an increase in non-oil tax revenue and
                     improvements to public expenditure management;
                   · Implementation of regulatory reforms to foster financial sector access,
                     consumer protection and stability;
                   · Enhancement of short-term employment support programs while
Program              developing medium-term reforms for labor market efficiency and labor
Development          productivity; and
Objective(s) and   · Improving competitiveness by lowering international trade costs via
                     reduction of Most Favored Nations (MFN) tariffs and simplification of
Contribution to      the trade tariff regime and customs processes.
CPS
                   The CPS envisaged an annual multi-sector DPL. This DPL is consistent
                   with this strategy though the Bank has significantly increased the amount of
                   lending following the onset of the global crisis. This DPL supports key
                   actions of Mexico's National Development Plan (NDP)--as revised in
                   reaction to the global crisis. The government is using the global crisis as an
                   opportunity to display its renewed capacity to conduct countercyclical
                   policies to confront the crisis, while simultaneously advancing key structural
                   reforms on the fiscal, financial sector, labor and trade areas that are central
                   to medium-term development. Some of these reforms, e.g., the increase in
                   non-oil tax revenues on a permanent basis, address some of the most
                   contentious policy issues in recent decades.
                   While a stand-alone operation, the proposed DPL is part of broader and an
                   ongoing World Bank programmatic engagement which includes
                   knowledge and coordination services to support the government's medium
                   term economic policy agenda

                   A key risk to the success of the operation relates to the potential for
                   substantial modifications by Congress to the policy program and budget
                   law submitted by the administration in September 2009. The specific risk
                   would be a deterioration of the fiscal position in 2010 that may result
                   from the budget ultimately approved by the legislative. Structural
                   medium-term revenue enhancing measures may or may not be approved
                   by Congress. Factors mitigating this risk include (a) the government's on-
                   going intensive negotiation and public dissemination efforts, (b) an
Risks and Risk
                   emerging national consensus about the need for a reduction of
Mitigation         dependence on volatile oil revenue, and (c) the possibility that the
                   executive may implement alternative policies under its control, if
                   required.
                   A weak global recovery from the current sharp downturn in economic
                   activity represents another important source of risk to the operation. A
                   "double dip" recession in the United States--Mexico's main trading
                   partner--would diminish the Government's ability to maintain
                   expenditure levels for key social and infrastructure programs. The factor


                                           ii
               mitigating this risk is that the Government has confirmed its commitment
               to the policies and reforms supported by the DPL--as evidenced by their
               prominence in its economic program. In addition, the Government has
               requested complementary technical assistance loans from the World
               Bank in public expenditure efficiency and customs administration to
               support implementation of the reform program. The Bank continues an
               active knowledge services agenda in fiscal, financial sector and labor
               policy reforms. A possible follow-up development policy loan in FY11
               would support continued reforms.

     ECONOMIC POLICIES IN RESPONSE TO THE GLOBAL CRISIS DPL


                                     I.    INTRODUCTION

1.       Mexico is on the frontline of the global economic crisis. The country shares a
common border with the United States, over which more than 80 percent of its exports is
exchanged. Millions of Mexican emigrants live in the United States, and prior to the
crisis, they sent home over $25 billion per year in remittances. A number of important
financial institutions are subsidiaries of international banks that were at the epicenter of
the financial crisis. Tourism and other service exports also have the United States as a
prime consumer.

2.       While the crisis started in the United States, its impact has been more heavily
felt in many areas in Mexico. Trade has declined by about 30 percent in the first half of
the year. Remittances have fallen substantially, 12.6 percent--in dollar terms--in the
first seven months of the year, and foreign investment--direct and portfolio investment--
declined by 45 percent in the first half of 2009. The impact of these external factors on
the overall economy has been substantial: GDP in the first half of the year declined 9.2
percent compared to a year earlier and the Mexican economy lost more than half a
million jobs between June 2008 and June 2009.

3.      The current moment is an historic one for economic policy making in
Mexico. The Government is using the global crisis as an opportunity. It is an
opportunity to display its renewed capacity to conduct countercyclical policies to
confront the crisis, while simultaneously advancing key structural reforms that are central
to medium-term development. This approach is evident in a variety of areas. The initial
countercyclical fiscal stimulus will be gradually withdrawn while non-oil tax revenues
are increased on a permanent basis. This represents a major achievement as one of the
most contentious areas of policy making in recent decades has been overcome. The
financial system has weathered the global crisis relatively well--due in large part to
previous regulatory and institutional reforms--and the authorities continue to monitor the
system closely. At the same time, the Government is putting in place additional measures
to further strengthen the regulatory framework for stability, access and consumer
protection. In terms of labor markets, the Government has increased substantially
temporary programs to alleviate the impact of the recession, while at the same time
preparing a reform of the national labor law--a law that has remained largely unaltered in
over thirty years. On the trade front, during a period of heightened global protectionist
tensions, the Government has also progressed in trade liberalization--evidence of its
commitment to the global public good of free trade.

4.    The Government has requested this proposed Development Policy Loan, for
the amount of US$1.504 billion, to support implementation of its response to the
ongoing global economic recession and broader program of reforms. The proposed
loan would support the Government's core economic policy implementation during the
economic downturn--the fiscal, financial, labor market and trade policies that both

                                           -1-
combat the crisis and provide the basis for renewed economic growth. As a result of
Mexico's strong track record of macroeconomic policies, the IMF's Board of Directors
approved the first Flexible Credit Line (FCL) for Mexico in April of this year. The FCL
provides access to approximately US$47 billion as a backstop to Mexico's international
reserves and thus mitigates the risk of stress in the balance of payments or speculative
attacks on the currency. The FCL and budget support from the World Bank and Inter
American Development Bank provide complementary multilateral financial assistance
during the global downturn.

5.       The proposed operation is a central element in the implementation of the
2008 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). The CPS proposed an annual DPL to
support the Government's National Development Plan, combined with an expanded and
flexible program of knowledge and coordination services. The latter would inform the
annual DPL and also assist the Government--via an array of analytical and advisory
activities--in solving technical problems associated with its policy reform and
institutional development agenda. Since the onset of the global crisis, clearly the World
Bank's lending program has expanded both in volume and in scope, with a blend of DPLs
and investment loans to provide both financing and more intensive technical support
during a difficult period.1 This proposed DPL follows the spirit of the original CPS in
terms of its close links to the Government's program, the multi-sector nature of the policy
areas, and the reliance on a strong set of knowledge and coordination services to support
the design of the DPL.

6.       The proposed DPL is based on a broad programmatic engagement that
includes substantial knowledge services to support preparation and implementation
of economic policies. These knowledge services involve a blend of instruments, as laid
out in the CPS, including strategic studies, on demand/fast response policy advice,
permanent long-term advisory role, convening power, monitoring and evaluation of
policies and programs, and implementation support.2 For example, fiscal policy has been
supported by intensive dialogue on results informed budgeting drawing on international
experience in this area. Reforms of the financial regulatory system and development
banks were informed by the joint Bank-Fund Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP) and FSAP Update, as well as subsequent programmatic non-lending technical
assistance (NLTA) on financial sector issues. Bank staff has worked closely with the
Ministry of Labor (STPS) on evaluating the impact of the labor reform policies. Bank
staff is also working with the customs agency on institutional reform to facilitate trade.
These examples illustrate the support of the programmatic knowledge services to the
institutional and policy reform program supported by the proposed loan.

Recent Economic Developments in Mexico3

7.      Mexico has been hit hard by the global economic recession. Despite a strong
track record of sound macroeconomic management and stable economic conditions over
the last several years,4 the Mexican economy stands out as the Latin American country
most affected by the global recession. Economic activity declined by 9.2 percent during
the first half of the year and the current base case scenario projects a contraction of
annual GDP by 6.8 percent in 20095 before a modest rebound of economic activity in
2010.

8.     The severity of the current crisis has surprised many. The most important
channel through which the global crisis hit Mexico has been the collapse in trade with the
United Sates. The United States is the destination of more than 80 percent of Mexican
exports and the Mexican manufacturing industry is highly integrated into the industrial
production of the United States. A plausible explanation for the much sharper decline in
GDP in Mexico compared to the United States is that both trade and industrial production
make up a significantly higher portion of the Mexican economy.

9.     The current economic recession is characterized by a sharp contraction in
aggregate demand. In addition to a collapse in external demand and international trade,
the rapid tightening in domestic demand can be attributed to increased uncertainty
regarding global and domestic economic prospects, increased unemployment, reduced
availability of credit and significant currency depreciation. During the first semester of
this year, households and businesses responded to the deteriorated financial and
economic outlook with a contraction in private consumption of 9.2 percent and private
investment of 11.5 percent compared to the same period of the previous year. Even
though the decline in trade triggered the overall economic contraction and exports and
imports are both down by more than 30 percent in nominal dollar terms6, the net trade
balance is not a source of retrenchment of aggregate demand.

10.    In response to the severe recession, the Mexican authorities have increased
public expenditure to counter the sharp contraction in private aggregate demand.
Contrary to previous cyclical downturns, the sharp fall in public sector revenue observed
in 2009 has initially not been associated with a reduction in public expenditure or an

  A detailed assessment of recent economic developments and outlook is presented in Annex 4
Macroeconomic and Debt Sustainability Assessment.
4
  Mexico's GDP growth averaged 3.8 percent during 2004-2007 and the economy enjoyed a stable
currency, inflation of 3.8 percent in 2007, low levels of external indebtedness as a share of GDP, declining
public debt ratios and a sovereign credit rating two notches above the lowest investment grade.
5
  GDP projections for the third and fourth quarter of 2009 show a rebound of economic activity with
positive quarterly growth, based on seasonally adjusted quarter-on-quarter GDP growth rates. The depth of
the economic recession is likely to keep the level of GDP-in real terms-in the third and fourth quarter of
this year below the level observed in the same period of the previous year.
6
  There is a close link between the two with more than 70 percent of import used as inputs for export
production.

                                                   -3-
increase in taxes and, in that way, fiscal policy is allowing automatic stabilizers to
function. Fiscal discipline and strong fiscal policy frameworks, including the
establishment of stabilization funds and the acquisition of oil price hedges, enabled the
authorities to conduct an adequate countercyclical policy response for 2009.

11.     The authorities also have taken appropriate actions to maintain order in
foreign exchange and domestic financial markets. The central bank intervened in
foreign exchange markets providing foreign currency liquidity to the private sector
though, eventually, the level of reserves by the end of this year is expected to be similar
to the one observed previous to these currency interventions. Indicators of foreign
reserve adequacy continue well above conventional thresholds relative to short-term
external debt or imports. Bilateral and multilateral support, through a US$30 billion
currency swap arrangement with the US Federal Reserve (recently extended until
February 2010) and a US$47 billion Flexible Credit Line (FCL) with the IMF, provide
additional precautionary sources of external funds. Announcement of the FCL last April
greatly reduced volatility of the peso.

12.     The Central Bank also started easing monetary policy in January 2009. The
reference rate was lowered from 8.25 percent to the current level of 4.50 percent--
achieved in July 2009. Monetary policy is taking place within an inflation targeting
framework with a medium-term target of 3 percent. The inflation rate has been on
declining trajectory since the end of 2008.

13.     The banking system appears sound and is well supervised. Commercial banks
are currently well capitalized with an aggregate capital adequacy ratio of 16.2 percent at
the end of June 2009--well above the required minimum ratio of 8 percent7. Non-bank
financial institutions (NBFIs) are relatively small and unlikely to cause systemic
instability. Concerns, however, persist regarding the health of some NBFIs.

14.      The turmoil in international financial markets has had a considerable impact
on corporate sector access to financing. Increased risk aversion and global
deleveraging made it difficult even for large companies to issue debt overseas, and the
cost of such borrowing became substantially higher. In the domestic market, the
slowdown in credit growth began in early 2008, and overall credit growth stalled by the
second half of 2009. The Government reacted by mobilizing its development banks to
facilitate the continued flow of credit through private financial institutions, thus
preventing a sharper contraction in credit.

Macroeconomic Outlook and Debt Sustainability

15.    There seems to be an emerging consensus that the global economic downturn
is currently bottoming out, even though uncertainty remains with respect to the
strength of the rebound. Assumptions regarding the evolution of the external

 In addition, early warnings are triggered when the capital adequacy ratio goes below 10 percent leading to
an intervention by CNBV and coordinated planning for capitalizing the bank until the capital adequacy
ratio reaches 10 percent.

environment have a major impact on the projection of Mexico's main macroeconomic
variables. A base case scenario follows the Bank's September 2009 Unified Survey
Assumption for global economic activity.8 The simulated impact of such assumptions on
the Mexican economy is a significant recession in 2009 and a modest rebound by 2010
and 2011.

16.    A gradual recovery of economic activity is expected for 2010. The projected
recovery in 2010 is modest compared to the depth of the recession observed in 2009 and
the economy is expected to operate well below its level of potential output until at least
2012. Risks to this scenario are largely external. A "double dip" recession in the United
States would have a significant impact on Mexican growth prospects, if materialized.

17.     The sharp external trade adjustment is not generating pressures on the
external balances of the economy. The collapse in exports was more than compensated
by the decline in imports. There is a substantial component of imported inputs in the
production of manufactured exports. Weak domestic demand has further depressed
imports. External debt is projected to remain below 25 percent of GDP while the term
structure of that debt does not pose major risks for the balance of payments.

18.      The main assumptions for the 2010 public sector budget proposal include: an
economic growth of 3.0 percent, an average oil price for the Mexican mix of oil exports
of US$ 53.9 per barrel9 and a reduction in the volume of oil production to 2,500 thousand
barrels per day. Oil production is falling steeply as only four years ago production was
still 30 percent higher at 3,256 thousand barrels per day.

19.     The Government estimates a shortfall in fiscal revenue in 2010 of 2.9 percent
of GDP (374 billion pesos, see table 2).10 Part of the revenue shortfall is due to a
"transitory" issue, namely that GDP will remain below potential as the recovery is
expected to be slow. The structural component of the deficit is caused by lower oil
revenue--lower oil prices and declining oil production. The Government's budget



8
  World output is projected to fall by 2.5 percent in 2009 and experience a gradual recovery in 2010 when
growth is expected to be 2.3 percent. Similarly output in the United States is projected to contract by
2.5 percent in 2009 before rebounding by 2.3 percent in 2010.
9
  The recent increase in oil prices raised the budget reference price for oil to US$59.0 per barrel.

   A more detailed analysis of Mexico's fiscal policies and challenges is included in Annex 5a.

proposal compensates a substantial part of the transitory shortfall with non-recurrent
revenue--inter alia withdrawals from its stabilization funds. In addition, the proposal
also allows part of the transitory shortfall to result in a temporary fiscal deficit of 60
billion pesos or 0.5 percent of GDP. Meanwhile, the Government will address the
structural gap with non-oil tax revenue enhancing measures aimed at increasing revenues
over the medium-term.

20.     A series of non-oil tax revenue enhancing measures are being adopted to
cover the structural component of the revenue shortfall. Public revenue enhancing
measures aim to broaden the tax base and to enhance non-oil revenue through changes in
the regime for excise taxes, income taxes, the tax on cash deposits in the banking system
and the introduction of a new consumption based tax. The government's proposal had
estimated to raise 176 billion pesos, 1.4 percent of GDP, from the non-oil tax revenue
enhancing measures. As a result of revenue enhancing measures--and a modest recovery
of economic activity--non-oil tax revenue were projected to increase to 10.8 percent of
GDP in 2010 from 9.3 percent in 2009.11

21.    The Government's strategy is to keep the level of programmable federal
public sector spending in 2010 at a similar level in real terms in spite of the sharp
reduction in inertial revenues. In subsequent years expenditure growth would be in line
with the growth in economic activity. Based on an expected return of the economy to
potential output by 2012, the Government plans for temporary deficit financing for a two-
year period, 2010 and 2011, while returning to a balanced budget by 2012.

22.     The Government's proposal to enhance non-oil tax revenues demonstrates a
broad commitment to longer-term fiscal sustainability. Credit rating agencies have
warned that there is the need for a clear and credible medium-term fiscal strategy of
revenue-enhancing measures or sustainable spending cuts to compensate for lower public
sector revenue. The proposed fiscal package seeks to strike a balance between the need
for fiscal consolidation to assure markets of fiscal sustainability while smoothing out the
withdrawal of fiscal stimulus.


11
  At the time of writing, the lower House of Congress adopted a Revenue Law that substitutes the
consumption tax for an increase in the general Value Added Tax rate and reduces the tax revenue
enhancement by 56.3 billion pesos. As a result, estimated non-oil tax to GDP is reduced to 10.3 percent.

23.    Inflation has been falling and the central bank expects to reach its medium-
term inflation target towards the end of 2010. Inflation expectations remain well
anchored, though the revenue raising measures in the fiscal package provide an additional
challenge to the monetary authorities to assure that their impact on headline inflation
remains a one-off event.

24.    In order to reduce pressures on domestic financial markets, the Government
is looking to finance a substantial share of its Public Sector Borrowing
Requirements (PSBR) externally. The net financing requirements of the Government
are US$23.8 billion and US$28.4 billion in 2009 and 2010, respectively. The
Government is planning to finance a larger fraction of the PSBR externally and has
requested support from the multilateral development banks--World Bank and Inter-
American Development Bank--to finance the major part of its external net financing
requirements12 in 2009 and 2010 (US$7.4 billion and US$8.8 billion respectively in
Table 3).

25.    Net public debt, at just over 40 percent of GDP, remains within manageable
proportions despite a modest increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio projected through
2011. Debt sustainability analysis, based on average levels of economic growth, the
primary balance and the real interest rate on public debt observed over the past decade
shows a return to a downward path of the debt-to-GDP as of 2012.13

26.     Notwithstanding the significant challenges posed by the global economic
downturn, the macroeconomic policy framework is considered adequate for the
purposes of the proposed Development Policy Loan. This DPL supports adequate
economic policies to mitigate the impact of the current economic recession and to
strengthen the framework for sustainable economic recovery and growth.




12
   The Government also faces foreign currency denominated public debt repayments of US$13 billion and
US$ 12.5 billion in 2009 and 2010, respectively, which it is planning to refinance on global, private
markets.
13
   Values for the variables used in the debt sustainability exercise include: growth average 3.1 percent,
standard deviation 2.07 percent; primary balance (adjusted for off-balance expenditure and excluding non-
recurrent revenue) average 0.55 percent, standard deviation 0.69 percent; and real interest rate 3.3 percent.

          III.    THE GOVERNMENT'S ECONOMIC POLICY PROGRAM
                         AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

27.      Sustained policy and institutional reforms have resulted in substantial social
and economic progress in Mexico since the 1995 "Tequila" crisis. Macroeconomic
stability was restored, total factor productivity began to grow and the financial system
was rebuilt on a sustainable basis. Policy reforms formed the basis of this recovery with
the elimination of fiscal imbalances, a decline in the public debt to GDP ratio and the
development of sound regulatory and supervisory arrangements for the financial system.
Monetary policy credibility was established with an inflation targeting regime and
inflation was reduced to the single digits. Extreme poverty declined from 37 percent in
1996 to 14 percent in 2006.14 Renewed macroeconomic growth was a fundamental
determinant in poverty reduction while, at the same time, social programs were expanded
and improved. In fact, Mexico was a pioneer in the development of conditional cash
transfer programs with the Oportunidades (formerly Progresa) Program.

28.    The global crisis, however, threatens the progress that has already been
achieved. The Mexican economy had transformed its export base from a dependence on
petroleum products to manufacturing goods; however, the destination of these exports
was concentrated on the United States--leaving the economy exposed to the epicenter of
the global economic crisis. Furthermore, export goods are largely consumer durables--a
segment of aggregate demand that was particularly affected by the downturn in the
United States. Investment in dynamic export sectors would suffer as a result of the
downturn, and job losses would inevitably have an impact on poverty rates. In addition,
the headcount poverty rate had already started to increase during 2008--driven by food
price shocks in the early part of that year. Credit to the private sector was also
constrained, as banks became more hesitant to lend and even hoarded liquidity. In brief,
the global crisis has threatened to create a downward spiral with dire social
consequences. Immediate action was needed to mitigate the impacts of the external shock
but without departing from the broad policy direction and objective framework laid out in
the 2007 National Development Plan.

29.     The Calderón administration established its medium-term development
program in the national development plan (Plan Nacional de Desarrollo--PND)
presented to Congress in 2007. The PND was based on five pillars: economic
competitiveness and job creation; public safety and the rule of law; effective democracy;
equality of opportunity; and environmental sustainability. The proposed DPL is
particularly focused on the first pillar. Several elements of that pillar are particularly
closely linked to the policy areas proposed for this operation.15 fiscal reform for
competitiveness, efficient financial system, promotion of employment, and the promotion
of productivity and competitiveness.

30.      As noted in the introduction, the Government has used the global crisis as an
historic opportunity to deepen and accelerate medium term structural reforms.
Fiscal policies were adjusted to create additional stimulus expenditures in the short-term,
while tax reforms are being proposed to enhance non-oil revenues over the medium-term.
Financial sector policies were adjusted to address the lessons learned from the global
financial crisis while also refining existing regulations to support consumer protection
and access to finance. In the labor area, temporary work programs were expanded while
the Government continued to prepare a broad reform of the labor code. Trade had been
an important engine of growth in recent years, and the Government continued throughout
the crisis period to move towards an even more open and transparent trade regime. The
latter is itself an important element in promoting lower costs to firms and improved
productivity.

31.     In general, the Government response can be divided into four main policy
areas: fiscal, financial sector, labor market and trade. Fiscal policies for 2009 and
2010 are moderately expansionary. The "moderate" qualifier is due to the limitations
imposed on a Government that has a credit rating two notches above lowest investment
grade, and the need for maintaining low cost access to credit as part of the Government's
medium term development strategy. The Government executed higher expenditure levels
in the first half of 2009 (relative to the previous year)--most notably by increasing
investment expenditures in real terms at a double digit pace. As noted in the figure
below, increasing expenditure levels did have an effect on offsetting the decline in GDP
emanating from the impact of external shocks on private aggregate demand. The
Government faces a delicate balance moving forward. Despite potential benefits from
continued fiscal stimulus, there are medium term fiscal issues that need to be addressed
as fiscal policy adjusts to the post-crisis period. In particular, there is the longstanding

                                                                                             -9-
dependence on oil sector revenues, and declining production will require additional non-
oil sources of revenue. As noted in more detail below, the new budget law presented to
Congress calls for a new consumption tax16 as well as higher income tax rates and higher
excise taxes.

32.      In addition, the Government has set in place mechanisms to improve the
quality of public expenditures. The fiscal reform of 2007 developed a comprehensive
approach to improving the budget cycle (Ciclo Hacendario). This approach implies
changes from the fundamentals of accounting to management and information systems to
results monitoring for budget execution and impact evaluation of specific programs.
Institutional development of this nature takes time; however, the approval of the new
Governmental Accounting Law is a key step in the process.

33.     The financial sector policy response concentrated on resolving limited
potential gaps in the regulatory framework, measures to bolster access to finance, as
well as market-friendly measures by development banks to maintain credit during
the global crisis. The global financial crisis has shown that the regulatory and
supervisory system in Mexico is quite strong in terms of assuring systemic stability. That
said, the Government took advantage of the lessons of the recent global financial crisis to
reinforce the regulatory system with new measures. Consumer protection norms have
been strengthened to help avoid predatory lending practices. These measures also assure
greater transparency in lending and can help foster broader access to credit. The
Government also secured legal reforms to assure the companies provide information on
derivatives positions. Legal amendments were also passed to facilitate the development
of banking agent services--a promising approach to improved access to financial
services. Finally, the Government made effective use of the reformed and healthy
development banks to counteract the tight liquidity conditions and facilitate the continued
flow of credit through private financial markets.

34.      On the employment front, the Government expanded those active
employment programs that had proven effective.                Spending for temporary
employment programs more than doubled during the first half of 2009 (compared to the
first half of 2008), and the coverage of the programs was expanded to urban areas where
the crisis hit hardest in terms of job losses and unemployment. The National
Employment Service was also allocated additional resources to attend more workers with
job training and job placement services. Finally, the Government expanded the scope for
unemployed workers to use personal savings in individual retirement accounts for
consumption smoothing during the recession.

35.     The Government reiterated its long term commitment to trade liberalization
by lowering Most Favored Nations (MFN) tariffs on manufactured imports and
simplifying the tariff regime and customs procedures for international trade. This
reform will lower the cost of integrating into global supply chains as it will be less costly
for firms, in particular SMEs, to access imported inputs from the most efficient sources.

In addition, reduced cost of some consumer goods is expected to increase welfare of
consumers, in general. It should be noted that this reform represents a commitment to the
global public good of free trade, during a period of growing protectionist pressures
internationally.

36.     The fiscal and labor policy measures, the support of development banks and
infrastructure measures were presented in the National Agreement in Favor of the
Family Economy and Employment (ANFEFE--Acuerdo Nacional a Favor de la
Economía Familiar y el Empleo). For 2009, the Government estimates that the overall
direct economic impact of the ANFEFE package of measures is on the order of 1.4
percent of GDP.17 The public investment programs, energy price reductions and
development bank support are the three largest elements in terms of their estimated
impact.

37.     The short-term policy response is embedded in the Government's medium
term development policy agenda. On the fiscal front, the Government has established
non-oil tax revenue enhancement and improved efficiency of Government expenditures
as key objectives over the medium-term. As the economy slowly emerges from the
recession, the adjustment towards fiscal balance requires new tax measures--as proposed
in the 2010 budget--that would increase non-oil tax revenues. In addition, the improved
monitoring and evaluation techniques have been used to streamline expenditures while
securing or even expanding programs that have shown to provide better results. In terms
of financial sector reforms, the Government is working to strengthen further the
regulatory and supervisory system, while continuing to promote competition and access
to finance within a framework that provides adequate consumer protection. In terms of
labor policies, the Government has already prepared a broad labor reform proposal that
would promote greater efficiency in labor court procedures, as well as introducing new
apprenticeship modalities for labor contracts. Finally, trade liberalization is a key
element in the broader competitiveness agenda, as noted in recent opinions issued by the
Federal Competition Commission.18

Consultative and Participatory Processes in Mexico's Economic Policy Formulation

38.    Mexico's economic policy program is built on a consultative process that
started with the NDP. The plan was formulated on the basis of ample consultations that
included extensive focus groups and surveys, the findings of which were made publicly
available.19 The NDP process highlighted inter alia the need to strengthen tax revenue

   The plan, a description of its consultative process and the results of those consultations can be found at
http://pnd.calderon.presidencia.gob.mx. The consultative process included 205 workshops with a
participation of 51,997 citizens. In addition 79,921 citizens participated individually by sending their
proposals and comments.

bases and enhance public expenditure management; foster access to finance while
maintaining a stable financial system; and enhance competitiveness by facilitating trade.

39.     The economic policy program in response to the global crisis, ANFEFE, was
announced by President Calderón on January 7, 2009 as an agreement among
different sectors of Mexican society. In recognition of the seriousness of the
international crisis, the office of the President initiated a series of consultations with the
most important sectors of the Mexican economy and society during the last quarter of
2008, so that a concerted response to the adverse economic environment could be
convened. The agreement included a series of policy actions to be adopted by the Federal
Government during 2009, as well as a string of commitments on the part of several public
and private Mexican institutions. The agreement includes commitments by the Federal
Government, the Congress, heads of the Executive of Federal States, as well as labor and
business organizations. The agreement was signed by a large set of high-ranking officials
of these institutions. The five pillars included in the agreement are: (i) Support to
Employment; (ii) Support to Mexican Families; (iii) Support to Industry and SMEs; (iv)
Support to Infrastructure Investment for Competitiveness and Employment; and (v)
Transparent and Efficient Public Expenditures. The proposed operation supports
important elements of the first, third and fifth pillars. Other Bank operations support
other elements of this plan as well.

40.    The Ministry of Economy conducted a series of consultation processes with
regard to the reductions in the MFN tariffs and simplification of customs processes.
These were concentrated on a specific number of industries and business chambers due to
the breadth of the reform. Further communication with stakeholders throughout the
implementation of the program through 2013 will likely be necessary to further explain
the benefits of lower tariffs in terms of the simplification of the trade regime and
competitiveness.

41.     Finally, Mexico's multi-branch Government and competitive political system
provides a framework for ample discussion of Government proposals. In the fiscal
area, the proposed revenue and expenditure laws that comprise the budget package are
subject to a calendar of preparation (April-August), presentation (early September) and
eventual approval by Congress (mid-November) that allows for ample and active
deliberations of the proposal and the presentation of counter-proposals by the elected
representatives in Congress as well as discussions among business chambers, unions,
civil society, special interest groups and the public in general. In the financial sector
area, the discussions of technical decrees and regulatory norms were conducted with
professional finance associations that are likely to be impacted by the reforms. In the
labor area, the Government signed a National Agreement on Labor Productivity with
labor groups and it also had a consultative process with worker and firm representatives
regarding the preparation of a reform of the Federal Labor Law taking into account the
many proposals that have been submitted by different groups in recent years. Moving
forward, the Government has been introducing ideas for reform of the labor law to the
general public during public presentations and on the ministerial website
(www.stps.gob.mx).

     IV.         BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

Link to Country Partnership Strategy

42.     The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) was discussed by the Board in
April 2008, and it proposed a highly flexible program of assistance for Mexico. The
partnership was based on a continued lending program on the order of US$800 million
per year; however, the CPS envisioned that the overall program could be adjusted upward
depending upon market circumstances. Another principle established in the CPS is that
the Bank's program should be closely aligned to the Government's own development
strategy. Given the still strong market access for Mexico at that time, and continued
demand for knowledge services from the Bank, it was proposed that the lending program
be simplified into one or a small number of DPLs in order to free up Bank administrative
budget for knowledge services and strategy and coordination activities.

43.     Market conditions have changed since April 2008, and the Government--as
noted above--has made adjustments to its development policies. The Bank is
responding positively to the Government's request for a substantially higher volume of
lending. In the spirit of the CPS, the proposed Economic Policies in Response to the
Global Crisis DPL is to support the Government's policy measures to respond to the
challenges posed by the global crisis, while also advancing in the medium-term reform
agenda. In this sense, it is essentially the broad based annual DPL that was foreseen
originally in the CPS.

Summary Update of the Implementation of the CPS

44.     The flexible design of the CPS has facilitated timely and effective Bank
response with total lending in FY09 reaching US$3.4 billion.20 The framework for
moving forward, agreed with Mexico, includes a major effort to alleviate the expected
human consequences of the economic downturn, as well as efforts to promote the basis
for gradual reactivation of the economy by strengthening the financial sector, supporting
investment in infrastructure and climate change, and enhancing governance and
countercyclical measures.

45.     The Government of Mexico has requested access to US$5 billion in CY09 and
would like to access a further US$5 billion in CY10 of IBRD lending as conditions of
access for emerging market economies to international capital markets have
deteriorated following the global financial crisis. In response, US$6.7 billion in new
lending commitments is proposed for FY10. Together with ongoing operations, this is
expected to yield around US$7.7 billion in disbursement during CY09-10, with exposure
increasing to around US$12.5 billion by FY12-13, depending upon the pace of
implementation. The composition and level of the lending program for FY11 will be
developed in the coming year with due regard for client needs and dependent on IBRD's
overall lending capacity.

  As referred in footnote 1 a previous update was prepared for the Framework for Green Growth DPL,
Report 49491-MX, Annex 8 to be discussed by the Board on October 20, 2009

                                              - 13 -
46.     The IFC will continue to be a strong partner with Mexico as the crisis
unfolds, with a focus on investment and advisory activities that complement IBRD
efforts to improve the living conditions and economic opportunities at the base of
the pyramid. Support includes broadening and deepening the financial sector,
infrastructure investments and advice, strengthening of the investment climate, improving
the quality of healthcare and corporate governance. Having identified Climate Change as
a new priority area of support, the IFC will be working to support investments in
renewable energy and energy efficiency projects in concert with the objectives of the
Green Growth DPL. In response to the crisis, the IFC is focused on the implementation
of systemic interventions, such as the recently announced US$150 million facility to
support housing finance. Under current conditions, the IFC has a strong counter-cyclical
role to play by partnering with the IBRD and Mexican development banks.

Collaboration with the IMF and other development partners

47.     World Bank and IMF staff meet on a regular basis to exchange views on the
macroeconomic situation and prospects for Mexico. These consultations occur at least
quarterly and also involve exchange of documents and recent reports conducted by the
respective teams. Financial sector issues are often discussed as both institutions are
actively engaged in policy advice in this area. Other structural issues--for example labor
reform--have been discussed during these meetings as well.

48.     The IMF's Board approved a Flexible Credit Line (FCL) for approximately
US$47 billion in April of this year. Mexico was the first country to qualify and request
this new instrument, which is intended to be a one-year arrangement and is treated as
precautionary by Governments. This type of support during a global downturn is very
much complementary to World Bank and IDB financing of the Government budget. The
scale and precautionary nature of the IMF program provides a backstop on international
reserves of the Central Bank, thus limiting the possibility of speculative capital outflows
that could cause further damage to economic prospects. Meanwhile, Bank financing
provides counter-cyclical and long-term financing of Government expenditure and allows
the Government to limit crowding out of private sector access to local (and international)
capital markets.

49.     The Bank has also collaborated with the Inter-American Development Bank
(IDB) during loan preparation. The IDB is considering a parallel operation in similar
policy areas, and task teams have been exchanging views and sharing documents.

Relationship to Other Bank Operations

50.     The Bank is supporting the Government's countercyclical policy response
and medium-term development agenda through a variety of instruments. For
example, the development banks are facilitating the functioning of financial markets due
to increased risk aversion by private agents, and this is being partially financed by a
number of Bank investment loans. Last fall, the Board approved a loan to the Sociedad
Hipotecaria Federal that would allow it to restructure its liabilities in order to have the
financial capacity to support housing finance during this critical time. An additional

                                          - 14 -
financing to BANSEFI, approved in late 2008, continues support for another
development bank's activities. There is currently another investment loan under
preparation that would support the expansion of lending activities by two other
development banks: Bancomext and NAFIN.

51.    On the fiscal front, the Bank has been working closely with the Government
on performance informed expenditure management. The Government can use its
growing array of performance measures to improve the impact of the stimulus and the
eventual need for fiscal consolidation in three ways: (a) expenditure prioritization; (b)
improving the performance of operational expenditures; and (c) improving the
performance of investment expenditures. The Bank is providing a variety of instruments
to support efficient, effective and transparent public spending. Two critical Technical
Assistance loans were approved last year--one for results based management and
budgeting, and another for customs administration. The latter is also important in terms
of lowering transaction costs for international trade and thus improving competitiveness.
In terms of non-lending services, the Bank is working--on a fee basis--with the
Government on improved integrated financial management. There are also fee based
arrangements with states to bring the results oriented budgeting initiatives to that level of
Government.

52.     The financial sector policy area of the proposed DPL follows up on a number
of actions previously supported in the First Programmatic Finance and Growth
DPL.21 This programmatic series did not move on to subsequent stages as the
Government's demand for IBRD lending diminished during FY07. The reforms
supported by that operation helped to create the relatively strong financial system that has
shown substantial resilience during the global crisis. In addition, actions to improve
prudential regulation and the transparency of financial intermediary operations that are
proposed in the financial policy area below clearly build upon the achievements of the
earlier Finance for Growth DPL. These reforms complement the support of the
development banks mentioned above.

53.     In the area of labor policies, the Bank has been providing advisory and
analytic services to the STPS. In late 2008 and early 2009, the Bank has been providing
STPS with background on international experience with active labor market policies, as
well as evaluation of existing Government programs.

54.     The Bank is supporting the administrative reforms necessary for lowering
the cost of trade via the Mexico Customs Institutional Strengthening project. The
objective of the project is to improve the efficiency of customs processes thus
contributing to improving Mexico's competitiveness and facilitating trade with foreign
parties. This would be accomplished through institutional redesign, training of customs
staff and a communications strategy to build consensus for the institutional reform.

     An ICR for this loan (IBRD-73630) was published in January 2008.

                                                  - 15 -
55.     Bank support to infrastructure and social sectors is complementary to the
proposed DPL. The Bank also plans to support key components of the infrastructure
expenditure plan, as well as associated infrastructure sector reforms that are linked to
long term environmental objectives. A loan to finance the urban mass transit systems is
in the final stages of preparation. A DPL to support a positive environmentally focused
framework for long term sustainable growth has been presented to the Board on October
20, 2009. The Bank is also providing direct financial support to the social safety net.
Earlier this year, a large operation was approved to finance the Oportunidades
conditional cash transfers, which has increased the monthly transfer amount in response
to the food price crisis and economic conditions. A loan to support the Seguro Popular
targeted health program is also under preparation. The Bank has also provided timely
support for financing the cost of the response to the AH1N1 influenza outbreak. Existing
loan funds were quickly reallocated to this issue during the height of the crisis, and the
Bank is nearing completion of a loan to finance vaccination and surveillance costs for the
upcoming flu season.

Lessons Learned

56.     The design of the proposed operation takes into account the lessons learned
from the overall program with Mexico, the recent Development Policy Lending
Retrospective22 and in general from Bank work with other middle-income countries.
In particular, the most important lessons include the following:

       a) Operations should be focused and avoid large and complex policy matrices.
          Rather than seeking to cover an extensive list of measures the design of this DPL
          has sought to concentrate on those that address the cornerstones of the economic
          policy response to the global financial and economic crisis.

       b) Flexibility to respond to changing circumstances is fundamental. In order to
          implement a lending program that best addresses Mexico's needs as a
          creditworthy middle income country, the Bank needs the flexibility to be able to
          respond quickly to changing circumstances. This is particularly important in the
          context of the current global financial and economic crisis.

       c) Prior strong analytical work and continued engagement is a necessary
          precondition. In preparing policy-based operations, the Bank should lead with its
          comparative advantage which is bringing to bear strong technical capacity and
          ample cross-country experience. The Borrower must be confident that its dialogue
          with the Bank will add value to its own efforts. The Bank has maintained a very
          fruitful dialogue with the Government during the current CPS period, as well as in
          previous years, leading to the preparation of analytical work that has assisted
          Mexico in strengthening its performance informed expenditure management and
          public expenditure monitoring and impact evaluation programs.

     d) There is the need to take into account the political economy of reform. In
        designing a policy-based operation, political factors and the legislative needs of
        the country need to be understood and included in the dialogue with the client.
        Some of the measures at the concept stage, such as the 2010 budget will still be
        reviewed by Congress, and the task team will follow this process closely with
        Government counterparts.

     e) Strong country ownership is critical to success, particularly when supporting
        cross-sectoral efforts, such as those included in the proposed loan. The proposed
        project responds to Government's request to support specific priority programs
        and areas which reflect the outcome of national policymaking processes.

     f) Providing just-in-time strategic engagement and support: the Government has
        repeatedly requested the Bank's support in the areas of expenditure management,
        financial sector reform, labor reform and customs administration. The
        experience with developing and providing comprehensive analytic and advisory
        packages on those priority issues, through Memorandums of Understanding
        (MOUs), as a complement to policy lending, has served to ensure that policy
        development is predicated upon a sound and strategic analytic basis.

     g) The commitment of the Government is central in ensuring the success of the
        program. Previous policy-based and investment operations all pointed to the
        important role of strong Government leadership in their success. The proposed
        operation effectively responds to the Government's own priorities and
        commitment as reflected in the actions already taken as well as the fact that the
        policy thrust supported by this operation lies directly along the key policy axes of
        the Government's national development plan and the strategy to face the global
        crisis.

Analytical Underpinnings

Analytical Underpinnings for Growth and Medium Term Reforms

57.     Bank analytic work at the global, regional and country level have
contributed to the understanding of the growth process and design of medium term
economic reforms. Global and regional research reports are actively discussed in policy
forums in Mexico: for example, the work of the Growth Commission and regional
reports on the determinants of growth.23 Country level analysis has focused on areas like
general competitiveness and education.24 A particular effort was made during the
political transition to provide inputs to the prioritization of the medium term reform
agenda in the form of the Policy Notes: Creating the Foundations for Equitable Growth.


23
   For example, see the regional reports, From Natural Resources to the Knowledge Economy, Economic
Growth in Latin America and the Caribbean, and The Role of Fiscal Policy for Human Development and
Growth.

   For example, see Mexico's Competitiveness--Reaching its Potential and Mexico: Determinants of
Learning Policy Note.

                                               - 17 -
The issues of dependence on oil revenue, financial sector development, trade
diversification and improved labor market performance were all highlighted in the
Overview chapter of this report.

Analytical Underpinnings for the Fiscal Policy Area

58.     The Bank has provided fiscal policy analysis at the global, regional and
country level that is extremely relevant for the design of the proposed DPL. At the
global level, PREM policy papers25 have analyzed the fine balance between fiscal policy
response to the crisis and maintaining fiscal sustainability--given varying degrees of
policy flexibility. Regional analysis for Latin America has also examined the role of
fiscal policy during the crisis, including the development of an index of the scope for
fiscal policy adjustment.26 Fiscal responsibility laws in the LAC region have also been
studied.27 At the country level for Mexico, a chapter of the 2006 Policy Notes analyzed
the use of the fiscal windfall from high oil revenues and the need for increasing non-oil
revenue sources.28 The challenge of declining oil revenues was a key issue in the
Overview Chapter of the Policy Notes as well.

59.     Support to the Government's efforts to improve the quality of public
expenditures is anchored in a solid base of analytical work developed by the World
Bank. Extensive analytical work confirms that successful financial management and
performance management-oriented reforms must be based on performance evaluation
systems capable of tracking and ultimately improving the management of expenditures
(Public Expenditure Review FY04), as well as strengthening Government accountability
for service delivery to citizens (programmatic poverty analysis series FY04, FY05,
FY06). The Institutional and Governance Review (FY07) advised on the need for public
information on sector performance as a means to strengthen electoral accountability and
democratic governance. The Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR FY08),
which was produced in coordination with the IDB, offers specific recommendations for
improvements to the procurement system, some of which have already integrated in the
recently approved amendment to the Procurement Law. The NLTA program on Financial
Management, agreed between the World Bank and SHCP, offers concrete
recommendations for improving Government accounting standards and systems with the
goal of increasing the overall quality and harmonization (across different levels of
Government) of budget reports and financial statements. These recommendations were
included in the new Government Accounting Law, the enactment and implementation of

which is supported by this operation. A series of notes highlighting advances in
performance informed budgeting have also been produced over the last year.29

60.    The Bank's ongoing and future technical assistance in the area of public
sector reform are geared towards a blend of on demand advisory services, TA loans
and policy notes. These activities are being coordinated under the MOU concept
developed in the 2008 Country Partnership Strategy (see Box 1).

                        Box 1 MOU for Public Sector Reform
The MoU characterizes recent Government reforms as a 3-pronged strategy:
   i. Enhance budgetary discipline by strengthening fiscal planning and accountability
      to ensure compliance with revenue and expenditure management rules throughout
      the public sector
  ii. Establish a focus on expenditure efficiency
 iii. Focus on the achievement of key results.

Public sector reform support has focused on the implementation of reforms to the Ciclo
Hacendario, the financial management system and supporting the public sector
accountability and performance agenda. The technical and financial assistance which is
either currently being delivered to the Government or under consideration focuses on:
   i. Budgetary discipline: reforms to the Ciclo Hacendario and Financial
        Management Information Systems;
  ii. Performance:
        a) Performance-informed Budgeting;
        b) Improvement of Revenue Agency performance;
        c) Regulatory and Operational Reforms to improve the performance of selected
            sectors and agencies; and
        d) Performance-oriented Judicial Reforms.

Analytical Underpinnings for the Financial Policy Area

61.     Financial sector policy issues have also been analyzed extensively by the
Bank at the global, regional and country level. DEC Policy Research Reports have
laid the framework for financial sector policies globally.30 Regional studies have also
examined issues of access to finance, SME lending and capital market development.31 At
the country level, the 2002 Mexico FSAP report and the 2006 FSAP Update provided key
policy recommendations, including reforms of the structure of the system of development
banks. These recommendations were also summarized in the 2007 Policy Notes. More
recently, the Government has requested knowledge services via NLTA that studied issues

of competition in the banking system, new modalities for access to finance, monitoring
indicators for development banks and capital markets development. The policy dialogue
following the outbreak of the global financial crisis has been led by the LAC regional
chief economist and centered on the impact of the crisis on the financial system and
lessons on the need for adjustments in the regulatory framework and in particular
regarding the perimeter of institutions under prudential regulation.32

Analytical Underpinnings for the Labor Policy Area

62.     Bank analysis of labor market issues has also been extensive. The PREM
anchor produced an international report on employment and shared growth33, along with
the development of new diagnostic tools for country analysis. The LAC regional chief
economist's office has also been actively involved in this research area with key recent
reports on job creation and informality.34 Analytic work at the country level has explored
income generation for the poor35, and the growth and employment nexus.36 Over the past
eight months, the Bank has been working with the STPS in analyzing the labor reform
proposal that has been publicly announced by the ministry. A report analyzing the
proposal and putting it in international context was presented to the Minister and his team
in early September.

Analytical Underpinnings for the Trade Policy Area

63.     At the global level, the Bank has been an important advocate for multilateral
trade liberalization, providing some of the most cited estimates of the gains from
advancing the Doha round of trade negotiations. DEC research has provided empirical
evidence on trade and growth links.37 In addition, there have been numerous
international research papers on the gains from investments in trade facilitation, including
studies on Mexico.38 At the regional level, studies have examined the lessons from
NAFTA for the LAC region,39 the potential economic impacts of the Central American
Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA),40 and there is a soon-to-be-completed regional report
on the quality of trade in the region. At the country level, competitiveness studies41 have
laid out the key role of trade in Mexico's growth prospects. In addition, the Bank has had

                     V.        THE PROPOSED OPERATION

Operation Description

64.     The Overall Program Development Objective is to support economic policies
to mitigate the impact of the global crisis and strengthen the structural medium-
term framework for sustainable economic recovery and growth. This will be
achieved by further developing the regulatory, monitoring and financial framework for
fiscal and financial sustainability, labor market efficiency and trade integration. The four
policy areas of the DPL are:

·       Implementation of countercyclical fiscal policies during 2009 while adopting
structural measures to enhance medium-term fiscal sustainability for 2010 and beyond,
including an increase in non-oil tax revenue and improvements to public expenditure
management

·     Improvement of the regulatory framework to foster financial sector access,
consumer protection and stability;

·      Enhancement of short-term employment support programs while developing
additional medium-term reforms for labor market efficiency and labor productivity; and

·     Improving competitiveness by lowering international trade costs via reduction of
Most Favored Nations (MFN) tariffs and simplification of the trade tariff regime and
customs processes.

65.    This DPL is proposed within the framework of the 2008 CPS to conduct an
annual multi-sector DPL to support the Government's key actions of its national
development plan (NDP). Due to the global crisis, this DPL focuses on supporting a
number of key policy actions in response to the crisis, embedded in a medium-term
economic policy reform agenda.       This operation is supported by an ongoing
programmatic engagement (see Box 2)--including knowledge and coordination services
and investment lending--to support the Government's medium-term economic policy
agenda as noted in Section III.

presented below and a summary of these is presented in Box 3.

Policy Area I: Fiscal Policy and Public Expenditure Management42

Trends and recent developments

67.     In the years previous to the current global crisis Mexico observed a
significant growth of total public sector revenue and expenditure. The expansion of
the public sector has been driven in part by significantly higher oil revenue as oil
continues to make up about 36 percent of total public sector revenue. Efforts to raise
non-oil tax revenue were initially focused on improving tax administration, but by the
end of 2007, these were complemented with changes in tax policy and the introduction of

     See Annex 5a for a more detailed discussion

                                                      - 22 -
new taxes which led to an increase of close to 10 percent in the ratio of non-oil tax
revenues to GDP in 2008. Nevertheless, at less than 10 percent of GDP, Mexico's tax
effort remains substantially below the level observed in other countries in the region or at
a similar stage of development.

68.     Fiscal policy in Mexico is carried out within the framework of a Fiscal
Responsibility Law (FRL) that was adopted in 2006. The FRL strengthened and put
into a more permanent legal framework some of the macroeconomic stability oriented
features of fiscal policy in Mexico that had been evolving in the context of annual budget
formulation and discussion in Congress. The FRL requires budget formulation, approval
and implementation to lead to a balanced budget. The FRL also includes an oil revenue
stabilization mechanism consisting of a formula to determine the budget reference price
for oil and rules on the distribution of excess revenue resulting from an oil price that is
higher than the estimated budget reference price.

69.     The Government also engaged in a longer term program of public sector
management reforms to produce a more efficient and effective public
administration. The Government improved its budgetary discipline by strengthening
fiscal planning and accountability to ensure compliance with revenue and expenditure
management rules throughout the public sector. Efforts to enhance the efficiency,
effectiveness and accountability of public spending have been framed in an expenditure
performance evaluation system, the Sistema de Evaluación del Desempeño (SED), which
establishes methodologies and policies on performance informed management and
performance informed budgeting.

Fiscal policies and public expenditure management during the global crisis

70.     In the wake of the global crisis the Mexican authorities managed to initially
increase and eventually maintain the level of public expenditure to withstand the
sharp contraction in private aggregate demand. Contrary to previous cyclical
downturns, the sharp fall in public sector revenue that can be attributed to a downturn in
economic activity has not been compensated by a sharp reduction in overall public
expenditure or an increase in taxes and, in that way, fiscal policy is allowing automatic
stabilizers to function. At the same time the Government is recognizing the need for
medium term reforms to reduce the reliance on declining oil revenues.

71.     While providing for short-term countercyclical measures, the Government's
program is thus also laying the foundations for structural medium-term fiscal
sustainability. In addition, it is complementing sustainability efforts with improvements
in public expenditure management. The proposed operation would support the
Government's reforms to (i) conduct a counter-cyclical fiscal management program, (ii)
enhance non-oil tax revenue; and (iii) improve public expenditure management in
particular through the approval and implementation of a Governmental Accounting Law.




                                           - 23 -
Prior Actions in the Fiscal Policy and Public Expenditure Management are:

·      Implementation of countercyclical fiscal stimulus measures during the first
semester of 2009 as demonstrated by:
       (i)     an increase, in real terms, of current spending by 5.4 percent, and
       (ii)    an increase, in real terms, of public sector induced physical capital
               investment spending by 27.7 percent compared to the same period of the
               previous year.
·      Submission to Congress of an Economic Program for 2010 outlining a
multiannual fiscal policy strategy including:
       (i)     the creation of new taxes and modification of existing taxes to enhance
       non-oil revenue; and
       (ii)    a temporary deficit and the use of non-recurrent revenues to compensate
       for a temporary, cyclical shortfall in public sector revenue.
·      Issuance of a General Governmental Accounting Law to harmonize accounting
standards among the federal, state and municipal levels of the executive branch of
government as published in the Official Gazette on December 31, 2008

72.   The preparation, discussion and approval of the budget for 2009 took place
at a time of a rapid deterioration in the external economic and financial
environment following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers mid-September 2008.
The approved budget provided for a considerable countercyclical fiscal stimulus to
economic activity.

73.     Actual budget execution for 2009 has modified the size of the estimated fiscal
stimulus. The collapse of the oil price end-2008/early-2009 and the severe global and
domestic economic downturn led to an estimated gross revenue shortfall of 478 billion
pesos (4 percent of GDP) in 2009. The Government is covering this amount with a
transfer of profits from the central bank, receipts from an oil price hedge contracted by
mid-2008, withdrawals from the Government's oil revenue stabilization funds and,
eventually, some reductions in public expenditure with respect to its original budget.
Based on the adjustments to its program the Government now projects to maintain the
level of public spending constant in real terms this year compared to the budget executed
in 2008.

74.     In order to provide support to economic activity when most needed, the
Government front-loaded its public expenditure and investment programs in 2009.
As a result, current expenditure and public sector induced physical investment increased
by 5.4 and 27.7 percent, in real terms, respectively during the first half of 2009 compared
to the same period of the previous year.

75.     In its budget proposal for 2010, the Government estimates a revenue
shortfall of 374 billion pesos (2.9 percent of GDP), compared to the budget approved
for 2009. This shortfall is divided into a temporary or transitory revenue shortfall
attributed to a level of economic activity below potential output and a more permanent or
structural component due to a reduction in oil revenue as a result of a lower volume of
production and a lower budget reference price for oil.

                                          - 24 -
76.     The Government proposes to cover the transitory shortfall to an amount of
155 billion pesos with non-recurrent revenue and additional deficit financing. The
latter implies invoking, for the first time since its adoption, a clause in the FRL that
allows for a temporary deviation from the balanced budget rule under extraordinary
conditions.

77.    To cover the structural component of the revenue shortfall in 2010 of 219
billion pesos the Government proposes a series of public revenue enhancing
measures. Public revenue enhancing measures aim to broaden the tax base and increase
non-oil tax revenue through changes in the regime for excise taxes, income taxes and the
introduction of a new consumption based tax. The latter--called "contribution to reduce
poverty"--is a tax on the consumption of all goods and services. The revenue collected
from this contribution should be allocated, on a priority basis, to poverty reduction
programs and, in particular, to conditional cash transfers and social protection
programs.43

78.     In order to allow a successful implementation of its expenditure performance
evaluation system (SED), the Government prioritized the establishment of an
overall accountability and compliance framework with public financial management
requirements at all three levels of Government. Progress in public expenditure
management reforms are being used to guide the reduction and reallocation of public
spending. In order to provide accurate, consistent and timely information, required for an
adequate operation of the SED, a Governmental Accounting Law was enacted on
December 31, 2008 to establish accrual accounting and harmonize the accounting
standards among the three levels of Government (federal, state and municipal). The law
has an implementation horizon of three years and by 2012 the accounting norms,
standards and practices at all levels of Governments should be harmonized and able to
issue information in real time.

79.     Regarding the implementation of the law, progress has been made in the
creation of a national council for accounting harmonization and a consultation
committee. In addition, the Government has advanced in the development of the
conceptual framework of the governmental accounting, and the norms and methodologies
for the determination of the expenditure accounting moments.

80.    Consolidation of the performance informed budgeting at the federal level will
continue through the end of the current administration. Implementation of the SED,
at the different levels of Government, will require substantial coordination with the
subnational levels. The states' initiatives will be strengthened during 2010 particularly
due to some specific requirements of the Governmental Accounting Law in terms of
physical and financial indicators. These efforts will build upon the progress achieved by
the Federal Government in the definition of specific methodologies to measure results
that will be very useful in a context of a harmonized framework for the programmatic
budget information.

Policy Area II: Financial Access with Stability44

Trends and recent developments

81.     Mexico´s financial sector appears sound and well supervised, but remains
underdeveloped relative to other high-middle income countries. Financial depth and
access indicators compare unfavorably with both global and regional indicators. The
banking sector, for example, is broadly half the size of Brazil's and Chile's. In addition,
recent surveys indicate that access by the adult population ranges from 45 percent to 60
percent. Many small and medium enterprises (SMEs) remain excluded from the domestic
banking sector, and medium- to long-term financing remains a challenge. .

82.     In addition, global financial turbulence has had a substantial impact on
Mexico´s financial markets and financing alternatives for Mexican companies. Large
corporations have found fewer opportunities to issue abroad and costs have been
substantially higher. Credit growth by commercial banks virtually halted and declined in
real terms in the second quarter of 2009. Tighter credit conditions have made it more
difficult for SMEs to secure bank financing as large companies have resorted to domestic
bank borrowing. In order to mitigate the effects of the global financial turbulence, the
Central Bank eased monetary policy and the Ministry of Finance supported the expansion
of the balance sheet of development banks in a counter-cyclical fashion as discussed
below.

83.     Although current economic conditions heighten existing vulnerabilities, the
system appears relatively sound and well regulated. To a large degree, this situation
results from Government efforts implemented over more than a decade to enhance the
regulatory framework and strengthen capacity to supervise the system. Non-performing
loans increased to 3.8 percent in June 2009 which is affecting earnings. The deterioration
of the credit portfolio and earnings is expected to continue in coming months, but the
system's capital and loan loss reserves appear ready to absorb these. The absorptive
capacity, however, will differ across entities. Stress-tests conducted by the Comisión
Nacional Bancaria y Valores (CNBV) suggest that the solvency ratio for the banking
system would remain well above the minimum regulatory level of 8 percent.

Policy responses to the global financial crisis

84.      For more than a decade, financial sector policy has featured prominently in
Mexico's development agenda with the dual objective of promoting stability and
access. Overall the Government has supported these objectives through a multi-pronged
strategy that encompasses improvements to the regulatory framework, a strengthening of
institutions responsible for financial markets oversight, and pro-active market access
policies through development finance institutions (DFIs). DFIs have undergone
substantial improvements in their governance and institutional structure.




44
     See Annex 5b for a more detailed discussion.

                                                    - 26 -
85.     In the wake of the global financial crisis, the Government has sustained the
overall policy direction noted above but has moved quickly to mitigate risks exposed
by the global crisis. More specifically, the Government has enacted regulatory changes
and promoted a more active role by DFIs to prevent a sharp credit contraction by private
financial institutions that would have aggravated the economic contraction. The most
important regulatory reforms implemented in 2009 seek to address (i) the protection of
consumers of financial services, (ii) the expansion of channels for the provision of
financial services through banking agents, (iii) market transparency, and (iv) the
transparency and impact of DFIs. Prudential regulations have also been strengthened.

Prior Actions in the Financial Sector Policy Area are:

·      Enhancement of consumer protection, access to finance and market transparency
by:
        a.      amending the Law Protecting Users of Financial Services to expand the
        regulatory and supervisory capacities of CONDUSEF as published in the Official
        Gazette on June 25, 2009;
        b.      amending Article 46 Bis 1 of the Law of Credit Institutions to facilitate
        banking through agents as published in the Official Gazette on June 25, 2009;
        and
        c.      amending fraction VI Bis of article 104 of the Capital Markets Law
        requiring issuers to provide information to the CNBV and to relevant stock
        exchanges about the issuer derivative positions and possible contingencies that
        said derivative positions imply for the relevant issuer's financial situation as
        published in the Official Gazette on May 6,2009.
·       Enhancement of the transparency and impact of state owned development
financial institutions (DFIs) by amending the Credit Institutions Law as published in the
Official Gazette on May 6, 2009 and establishing that:
        a.      DFIs shall publish monitoring indicators that evaluate the services
        provided by the relevant institution (art 31), and
        b.      SHCP shall annually carry out and publish two evaluations(in which at
        least two academic institutions need to participate) of DFIs (art 55 Bis 2).

86.      The global financial crisis brought to the fore the importance of fostering
access to finance together with adequate consumer information. In this spirit, the Law
Protecting and Defending Users of Financial Services was amended in June 2009.
CONDUSEF will be responsible for (i) promoting an equal and fair relationship between
financial institutions and its users, (ii) educating and informing the public on costs and
quality of services provided by financial institutions, (iii) facilitating arbitration services
between financial institutions and users, and (iv) issuing guidelines on marketing
practices and financial contracts of credit institutions with the purpose of ensuring that
consumers receive adequate information on their rights and responsibilities. The
institution was already responsible for items (i) to (iii) above prior to 2008, but the lack
of enforcement authorities severely constrained its effectiveness. The legal reform
addresses these gaps by expanding CONDUSEF´s authorities to regulate, supervise and
issue penalties. The institution will face the challenge of balancing the two attributions of


                                            - 27 -
arbitrage and regulation. It is currently developing an institutional strengthening plan to
meet the greatly expanded set of responsibilities.

87.     The Law on Credit Institutions was amended in June 2009 to facilitate the
development of new and cost-effective channels to extend financial services to
underserved market segments through the provision of banking agent services. The
legal reforms will allow banking institutions to contract third parties (e.g., retail chains
and retail stores) in order to provide services on behalf of the bank. These new channels
could greatly expand the "outreach of banking institutions" which is currently limited.
The bank will retain at all times the responsibility over the transactions conducted by the
agents, minimizing risks to the population using these services. The CNBV has already
issued regulations detailing the operational requirements for banking agent services, and
at least nine banks have submitted a request to CNBV to provide these services. In
addition, the CNBV plans to issue shortly a regulation that will allow banks to provide
services through mobile phones considering operational and security controls.

88.      The Securities Market Law (Article 104) was amended in May 2009 to
address the lack of transparency concerning derivative instruments used by market
issuers. Speculative derivative positions by several large Mexican corporations
generated commercial paper defaults in October 2008 that nearly brought to a halt the
commercial paper market. To restore market confidence, the reform to the Securities
Markets Law requires market issuers to inform on their derivative positions, including
payment conditions and the possible contingencies that such positions imply on the
issuer's financial position.

89.    The CNBV has set up inter alia new provisioning requirements applicable to
consumer credit by credit cards, supported in a prospective methodology compatible
with the Basel II framework regarding expected losses.

90.     The transparency and accountability of development banks and trust funds
was improved through amendments to the Law of Credit Institutions in May 2009.
Strengthening the accountability framework was important given the increased role
played by development banks in the context of the global crisis. The three main changes
are: (i) development trust funds will have to submit annual operational and financial
plans to Congress through the Government as development banks currently do; (ii)
development banks and development trust funds will have to publish indicators
measuring their services to their target populations according to guidelines to be issued
by the SHCP; and (iii) the SHCP will have to conduct and publish annually two
independent evaluations on development banks or development trust funds that will
include inter alia an assessment of how these institutions are meeting the access to
finance objectives defined in their organic laws. The CNBV also issued a regulation that
can allow, on a case by case basis, temporary increases in the credit concentration ratio of
DFIs. While this could increase the risk exposure of DFIs, the risk is mitigated by the fact
this is a temporary measure with a sunset clause that will have to be cleared by the
CNBV and that the performance of these institutions is supervised by the CNBV as in the
case of commercial banks. For the most part, the same prudential regulations apply to


                                           - 28 -
commercial and development banks (including capital requirements, internal controls,
risk management, and valuation of financial products).

91.    In parallel to the above regulatory measures, DFIs have expanded activities
to sustain the flow of credit to the productive sector and other key areas and prevent
a sharp credit crunch in light of deleveraging and increased risk aversion by private
financial agents. These interventions have been market-friendly, meaning that they have
sought to facilitate the functioning of private markets, not replace them. From September
2008 through June 2009, the credit portfolio supported (directly or indirectly through
guarantees) by development banks had increased by 38% in real terms. DFI financing
has supported the productive sector and trade finance, rural areas, infrastructure, and
housing.

92.      The Government intends to continue promoting the access to finance with
stability agenda in the medium-term and several proposals are already underway. It is
drafting proposals to establish a more agile and suitable framework for bank liquidation
and is also collaborating with Congress on a proposal to establish a stronger regulatory
framework for Sofoles and Sofomes in response to recent defaults by two Sofoles. While
these institutions do not currently present a systematic risk, the authorities would like to
prevent regulatory arbitrage and establish a more adequate regulatory framework under
which they can expand. Further prudential changes area also expected over the coming
one or two years in the context of the G-20 Framework Agreement. In addition, the
Government is planning to develop a set of access to finance indicators to measure the
impact of its policies. The financial sector agenda also envisages the continued
institutional strengthening of DFIs, including the merger of Nafin and Bancomext.

Policy Area III: Labor Market 45

Labor market trends and recent developments

93.     Historically, the Mexican labor market has been characterized by a low level
of unemployment, yet persistently high rates of informality. Although the values of
informal employment vary by source and definition, it has persistently represented over
half of total employment. Linked to the slow growth of formal employment, two other
prominent features of the Mexican labor market have been slow growth in labor
productivity and in real wages. Total labor productivity, in terms of GDP per worker,
declined throughout the 1980's and remained stagnant until the middle of the nineties,
presenting a sharp drop in 1995 due to the crisis. Average labor productivity, especially
in manufacturing and agriculture, has grown since. Yet, the sustained improvement in
these two sectors due to technological gains has been cancelled out to some extent by the
poor performance in the services sector, which concentrates a significant proportion of
the Mexican informal work force. The trends in real wages also show modest growth
rates in recent years.



45
     See Annex 5c for a more detailed discussion

                                                   - 29 -
94.     The global crisis has produced a sharp contraction Mexico's GDP along with
an increase in both unemployment and informality. Monthly data reveals a
synchronized deterioration of labor market indicators, namely a decline in participation, a
rise in unemployment commencing in the last quarter of 2008 and a fall in the number of
workers enrolled in the Social Security. The unemployment rate reached 6.28 percent in
August 2009, the highest figure since February 1996 in the aftermath of the Tequila
crisis. The trends in net job creation have also been unfavorable with more than half a
million jobs lost between June 2008 and June 2009. The deterioration in the labor market
has also led to an important fall in real wages in some sectors.

Labor policies to confront the global crisis

95.      Labor policies constitute one of the five key pillars of the ANFEFE to
confront the global crisis that President Calderón announced in January 2009. The
objectives of these policies are to improve the employability of the labor force, its wages
and productivity, and protect labor incomes during the crisis. This operation supports the
core active labor market policies implemented by the Government in the context of the
ANFEFE that build on labor program reforms instituted during the current decade. The
key policies supported by this Operation are: (i) improvements in the targeting and
institutional set up of the Temporary Employment Program; and (ii) the expansion of the
latter to reach a greater number of beneficiaries, including in urban areas.

Prior Action in the Labor Market Policy Area are:

·      Strengthening and enhancement of active labor market policies by:
       a.      improving the institutional setup of the Temporary Employment Program
       (PET) by including the Sub-secretariat of Employment and Labor Productivity in
       the technical committee that coordinates the PET and
       b.      allowing the PET to be implemented in urban areas in addition to rural
       areas.

96.     The Temporary Employment Program (PET) was originally launched in 1995
in response to the economic crisis of the times and operated in the rural area
exclusively. Initially, the program was managed by the Ministry of Communications and
Transport (SCT) and the Ministry of Social Development (SEDESOL). Subsequently, the
Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT) and the Ministry of
Agriculture and Rural Development (SAGARPA) also joined in program management.
From 2001 on, the participation of the SAGARPA was gradually diminished and phased
out in 2009, when the STPS was granted responsibility for its coordination to better
integrate it with other labor market policies. The PET is currently administered and
financed jointly by three ministries: Social Development (SEDESOL); SEMARNAT; and
Transport and Communications (SCT). Broadly speaking, the reorganization of the PET
around the coordination of the STPS will focus the program on its job creation goal.
Under its coordination, PET resources will be directed to those areas where
unemployment rates are higher. This will make the program a more complete mechanism
of income compensation helping not only areas with problems of poverty or temporary,
adverse weather conditions, but also localities with unemployment shocks.

                                          - 30 -
97.    Along with the institutional changes, several other modifications were
introduced in an effort to enhance the program's effectiveness and targeting. The
most important changes are (i) the PET's extension to the urban areas, targeting those
with the highest rates of unemployment; (ii) the participation of the SNE as an important
channel to facilitate access and reach out to potential beneficiaries; (iii) the harmonization
of information under one coordinated strategy; (iv) the increased frequency of results'
publications and coordination committee gatherings; and (v) the program's systematic
evaluation46. Following the administrative and institutional reforms, the Government
increased spending on the PET by 157 percent during the period of January-June 2009
compared to the same period in 2008 to reach a larger number of beneficiaries.47 Further
increases are planned for 2010. From January to September 2009, the number of PET
beneficiaries already surpassed 549,000.

98.     In addition to the PET, there are two other important active labor programs:
(i) job networking and intermediation services; and (ii) the employment support program,
consisting primarily of job training programs. Spending on all active labor programs was
increased by 34 percent in the period January-June 2009 compared to the same period in
2008 in order to expand the number of beneficiaries. The number of individuals service
by de program increased by 19 percent from January to August 2009 compared to the
same period in 2008.

99.     The Government has complemented the above with an expansion of passive
labor market policies to sustain the standard of living of the unemployed. The two
programs adopted are: (i) the coverage extension of health and maternity benefits for
unemployed workers; and (ii) an increase in permissible withdrawals from mandatory
retirement accounts for the unemployed. The former is a temporary measure that protects
workers and their families during what can be expected to have been the worst period of
the crisis (first and second quarters of 2009), and the latter is a permanent change with
more substantive implication

100. While these measures offered a rapid response that has mitigated the negative
impact of the global crisis, a broader and more comprehensive reconsideration of passive
labor market policies may be necessary in the medium term.

101. Lastly, the Government has expressed its commitment to submit a proposal
to reform the Federal Labor Law to Congress in the near future and to continue
expanding active labor market programs in a selective manner, focusing on those
that have received the strongest evaluations. Active labor market policies are not only
important counter-cyclical measures but are also critical policy tools to facilitate the
reallocation of labor from declining sectors to more productive economic sectors. Thus,
the Government's commitment to further expand them and build on the progress
achieved with the recent reforms. Even though the scope of the current Federal Labor

Law is limited to a few areas, it moves in the right direction. Its eventual approval by
Congress could prove the first step in a series of initiatives to modernize labor legislation
in Mexico.

Policy Area IV: Trade Integration for Growth and Integration

Trends and recent developments

102. Mexico's exports of goods and services increased from less than 17 percent of
GDP in 1994 to 31 percent of GDP in 2000, facilitated by trade policy reforms, but
started to lose dynamism in recent years having fallen to 28 percent of GDP in 2008.
As a result, Mexico's share in world trade has declined from 2.07 percent in the period
2000-2004 to 1.60 percent in 2006-2008.

103. Trade growth benefited from policy reforms that started with a deep
unilateral trade reform process and accession to the GATT in the mid-eighties. This
was followed by a policy of trade negotiations that began with the signing of the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). These have continued until now. So far,
Mexico has concluded 12 preferential trade agreements with 44 countries, including the
United States, the European Union, and Japan. Several rounds of unilateral tariff
reductions also took place in 2002, 2004, and 2006. Changes were also introduced in
customs procedures. These included inter alia (i) a special program for certified
companies to accelerate the customs formalities of high-volume exports; (ii) an integrated
computerized customs system to facilitate customs clearance for imports and exporters,
enabling them to make their import and exports requests electronically; and (iii) training.
Simplified administrative measures have been put in place for the Maquila sector through
the Manufacturing and In-Bond Assembly Industry and Export Services Program
(IMMEX).48

104. In addition to the slowdown in trade growth seen in recent years, the global
financial crisis severely impacted Mexico's foreign trade. During 2008 exports
increased by 7.6 percent due to the increase in oil prices during the first semester.
Mexico's global exports and imports, however, fell around 30 percent during the first half
of 2009. Oil exports decreased by about 55 percent and non-oil exports decreased by
more than 22 percent during the same period. Mexico's exports are closely linked to the
United States, representing 80 percent of total exports. Thus, the recovery of exports
depends on the evolution of the crisis in the United States. In addition, exports to the
United States are relatively concentrated in a few products categories. Three categories of




48
  The IMMEX refers to the Decree on the Promotion of the Manufacturing and In-Bond Assembly
(Maquiladora) Industry and Export Services. The IMMEX provides for the deferment of tariff payments
for temporary import of raw materials, parts and components. The tariff is not paid as long as the inputs are
incorporated into a product for export. Companies conducting operations with IMMEX can register
through a digital system.

the Harmonized Tariff System (HTS) represent 59 percent of Mexico exports to the
United States.49

Trade Policy Measures in response to the loss in export dynamism and the global crisis

105. Despite the trade policy reforms noted above, the Government of Mexico had
identified gaps in its trading regime and opportunities to further reduce trading
costs. A study conducted by the Ministry of Economy identified inconsistencies in
Mexico's tariff structure. According to this study, higher tariffs were applied to inputs
than to final products resulting in negative effective protection, particularly when
producers in countries with which Mexico has preferential agreements may import these
inputs at lower rates and use them to produce goods that were subsequently exported to
Mexico. The antitrust authorities also provided a critical assessment of Mexico's trade
regime in an opinion in 2008, highlighting that the tariff structure discriminated between
importers and created distortions that limited the ability of domestic producers to
compete with foreign producers. The effective elimination of these distortions requires
that all producers gain access to international markets on a non-discriminatory basis. The
antitrust authorities also highlighted the need to address existing non-tariff constraints,
primarily related to customs service providers.

106. To address these issues and further Mexico's trade integration, a
comprehensive tariff reform and staged reduction of the MFN tariffs on
manufactured imports over a five year period (2009-2013) was adopted in December
2008. These measures complement other labor and financial sector reforms that seek to
build a more competitive productive base and generate the conditions for sustainable
growth and will also decrease costs to consumers with a positive social impact.

The Prior Action in the Trade Policy Area is:

·       Reducing the Most Favored Nation tariffs on manufactured imports and
increasing the number of duty-free tariff lines in a staged manner over a five year period,
starting January 1st 2009 in order to enhance trade, competitiveness and simplification of
the external trade tariff structure by amending the Tariff Law for General taxes on
Imports and Exports as per Decree published in the Official Gazette on December 24,
2008.

107. The comprehensive reform rationalizes the tariff structure, reduces
distortions, and trade costs. The reform would lower tariff rates for all non-agricultural
products over a five year period through January 1st, 2013. The reduction is expected to
lower the average MFN tariff rates for industrial products from 10.4 percent to 4.3
percent in 2013. The reform will simplify the tariff structure from thirteen different levels
to six. This means that the reform will decrease the tariff dispersion as well as tariff


49
   These categories are: (i) electrical machinery and equipment and parts thereof; sound recorders and
reproducers, television recorders and reproducers, parts and accessories (24.7 percent); (ii) mineral fuels,
mineral oils and products of their distillation; bituminous substances; mineral waxes (19.7 percent); and
(iii) vehicles, other than railway or tramway rolling stock, and parts and accessories thereof (14.9 percent).

                                                    - 33 -
escalation, and reduce inconsistencies in the tariff structure by cutting the negative
effective protection that currently prevails for some goods. As a result, special
preferential import regimes will lose their relevancy.

108. Overall, the reform is expected to lead to welfare gains. The enacted trade
reform will reduce trade diversion, create greater regulatory certainty and cut the
operational costs of the current users of special import regimes. Due to the high
administrative costs of accessing the special import regimes, larger companies had been
the main beneficiaries of these programs. The tariff reduction makes the special imports
regimes less attractive (or relevant) and the general import regime more accessible to all
producers. Hence, the tariff reform is expected to widen access for smaller enterprises to
more efficient inputs on a non-discriminatory basis increasing their competitiveness. An
import surge is not likely to occur, particularly in the context of the current collapse in
world trade; however, certain industries probably will face more competition from a large
number of suppliers--in particular, from the Asia-Pacific region. The activities that could
be negatively affected are textiles, plastics, metal products, leather products, paper,
printing, chemicals, wood, and oil and coal related industries. Several of these industries
had experienced a fall in their participation in total manufacturing employment and value
added prior to the crisis.

109. The reform will also reduce costs to consumers. A 2004 study found that the
Mexican tariff structure imposed welfare losses of US$2 billion for its citizens. The
Government is implementing other reforms with the active support of the Bank that seek
to further reduce trade costs, the most important of which is the program for
strengthening customs administration. In addition, it is assessing possible options to
facilitate greater competition in the provision of customs related services.

*See Annex 2 for more details

                     VI.           OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

110. OP 8.60 (Development Policy Lending) mandates the Bank to determine whether
policies supported by the operation are likely to cause significant effects on the country's
environment, forests and other natural resources as well as assess the poverty and social
impact. The policies supported by the proposed DPL are expected to have a positive
impact on poverty reduction and a negligible, or even somewhat beneficial, impact on the
environment.

Poverty and Social Impacts

111. The program is expected to have a positive poverty and social impact on the
poor and vulnerable groups. A poverty and distribution analysis carried out by Bank
staff (Annex 6) assesses in some detail the poverty and social impacts of policies
included in the fiscal, labor market and trade policy areas. These findings are
complemented with an additional qualitative assessment of the impacts of financial sector
policies. Further work on a full Poverty and Social Impact Assessment (PSIA) of the
policies will be carried out by Bank staff together with government counterparts during
program implementation.

112. After a decade of continuous decline, the most recent official poverty figures
show that Mexico has experienced an important increase in its poverty indicators
between 2006 and 2008. Extreme poverty (pobreza alimentaria) increased from 13.8 to
                                                  - 36 -
18.2 percent and measures of moderate poverty (pobreza de capacidades and pobreza
patrimonial) rose from 20.7 and 42.6 percent, respectively, to 25.1 and 47.4 percent.

113. The increase in poverty indicators is attributed to the increase in food prices
during 2007 and early 2008 as the indicators do not yet register the impact of the
current crisis. The severe contraction of economic activity in 2009 is expected to
produce a further upward impact on poverty in Mexico even though the Government
developed over the past decade a well-known set of policies and programs to confront
and mitigate the impacts of the crisis on poverty. For example, when the global food
crisis was reflected in a rapid increase of food prices in Mexico, the Government was
able to mitigate the impact on the poor by rapidly increasing the amount of conditional
cash transfers.

114.   The main findings with respect to the specific policies supported are:

Fiscal Policies

115. An evaluation of the distributive impact of the budget proposal by the SHCP
shows a very progressive impact in terms of the absolute incidence on households in
the bottom three deciles of the income distribution. This occurs as the introduction of
new taxes and changes in existing tax rates, including the proposed "contribution to
reduce poverty" on consumption, is more than compensated by an allocation of additional
budget resources to expand the conditional cash transfers under Oportunidades and other
social programs benefitting the poor. This expansion will cover both an increase in the
number of beneficiaries and an increase in the level of transfers to existing beneficiaries
that more than offsets additional tax payments. Households in the bottom three deciles of
the income distribution can on average expect an additional income transfer of 12,577
pesos against additional tax payment of 1,304 pesos per family. These estimates are
conservative since they assume that all the new tax is passed through to consumers. In
addition, consumers in the bottom of the distribution are less likely to purchase goods
from formal retailers.

116. There is a need to carry out a more complete distributional impact
assessment of the fiscal program as the final relative and absolute incidence of the
whole package will depend on adding all the tax and transfer effects in each social group.

Financial Sector Policies

117. Financial sector policies supported by this operation are expected to have a
positive social impact. In particular, the approval of a regulatory framework for the
provision of banking services through agents will permit the expansion of basic financial
services to lower income groups of the population through new cost-effective channels,
helping to narrow the current wide gap. The enhancement of the regulatory and
supervisory capacities of CONDUSEF should lead to greater transparency in financial
contracts and better informed users of financial services, particularly benefitting lower
income households and micro and small entrepreneurs. The support provided by DFIs to
facilitate the continued flow of credit to the productive sector should contribute to

                                          - 37 -
employment preservation in the short term. As the macroeconomic environment
rebounds, the facilitation of credit flow to underserved markets inter alia to SMEs should
facilitate growth and employment generation. SHF's emphasis on credit provision to
households earning less than 6 minimum wages is also helping to enhance the standards
of living of lower to middle income households

Labor Market Policies

118. Temporary employment programs are considered an appropriate
mechanism for dealing with cyclical downturns in the labor market as in the current
crisis. These programs provide an income support for those who lost their job and, given
the self-targeting mechanism--usually at a pay below minimum or nearly minimum
wages--focus on those most in need of finding an income source. Data to June 2009
indicates that nearly half of those that became unemployed were non-salaried (256,000)
and thus the PET is a particularly appropriate instrument for this group.

119. Regarding the expansion of SNE programs, in particular the training
program, the most recent evaluation report by CONEVAL confirmed the favorable
findings of previous studies. These indicated that the training programs had a positive
effect on the probability of finding employment, although no significant, or ambiguous,
effect on salaries.50 Several evaluations usually find a larger positive impact among
women and those with less formal education. Given the fact that women and those with
less formal education have, on average, lower earnings it can be said that these training
programs have progressive impacts that benefit more to those in the bottom of the
earnings distribution.

Trade Integration Policies

120. As noted earlier, the tariff reform is expected to lead to positive effects
through cost reductions to consumers. At the productive level, the sectors that will
benefit from the tariff reforms are mainly the agricultural, construction, and services
sectors that generate 85.7 percent of total employment. Within these, SMEs are expected
to benefit more in relative terms given that it had been relatively more costly for them to
access the special imports regimes. Regarding the manufacturing sector, the authorities
expect that the potentially affected companies comprise 14.3 percent of total
employment51. The activities that could be negatively affected are textiles industries,
plastics, metal products, leather products, paper, printing and related industries,
chemicals, wood industry, and oil and coal related industries. Several of these industries
have experienced a fall in their participation in total manufacturing employment and
value added prior to the crisis. The recent expansion of active labor market programs
(inter alia retraining programs) supported by the third pillar of this operation will provide
assistance to workers that might be adversely impacted by the tariff reform.

Environmental Aspects

121. The proposed operation is expected to have a negligible or even somewhat
beneficial environmental impact. The government's fiscal program is consistent with
environmental sustainability. Environment sustainability is one of the key pillars of
Mexico's 2007-2012 NDP that seeks to mainstream environmental sustainability
principles in sectoral policies and economic development. Despite the economic crisis,
the Government has explicitly maintained its commitment to environmental sustainability
and has continued to develop and implement public policies that protect the environment,
including the development of infrastructure policies that combat climate change and
green house gases. These efforts are being supported by the Bank with a series of
environmental DPLs (Environmental Sustainability DPL and the Green Growth DPL)

122. The enacted tariff reform is expected to have a negligible or even somewhat
beneficial environmental impact. First, the reform does not apply to agricultural
products. Second, tariffs for environmental goods52 are lowered and the import of these
will no longer require following cumbersome procedures of multiple trade agreements.
Third, Mexico's environmental regulations are in agreement with the Banks' overall
environmental safeguards and these regulations will continue to apply to imports as well
as for the granting and enforcement of construction and business operation permits.
Moreover, the simplification of trade procedures will now facilitate their enforcement.
Improvements in the systems of the customs administration agency and its interfaces with
other public agencies, including SEMARNAT, will facilitate the enforcement of these
regulations.

Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation

123. Implementation of the loan will require close coordination among
Government agencies and the Bank. The SHCP constitutes the primary counterpart,
and the CNBV, CONDUSEF, the STPS, and the Ministry of Economy (SE) will also be
involved in program implementation. As the Bank's primary counterpart, the SHCP will
be responsible for coordinating information reporting on the program's monitoring
indicators, and the Bank team will also maintain a close dialogue with Government
counterparts. The matrix of proposed indicators is presented in Annex 2. All the
indicators have been discussed with the Government authorities and agreed on during
program appraisal.

124. Since the proposed DPL is part of an ongoing programmatic engagement in
the four policies areas (fiscal and public expenditure management, financial sector,
labor market policies, and trade integration and facilitation), the Bank will have the

  The environmental goods and services industry consists of activities which produce goods and services to
measure, prevent, limit, minimize or correct environmental damage to water, air and soil, as well as
problems related to waste, noise and eco systems. This includes cleaner technologies, products and services
that reduce environmental risk and minimize pollution and resource use (OECD, Policy Brief, September
2005). Environmental goods are classified into four categories: pollution management, cleaner technologies
and products, resource management, and environmentally preferable products.

                                                  - 39 -
opportunity to monitor the reform impact beyond 2010. This will be important given
that in many cases the target indicators for 2010 cannot be reflective of the full impact of
the reform. The proposed technical assistance in the area of access to finance, investment
operations underway and proposed new operations with development banks, as well as
future FSAPs Updates will provide an opportunity to oversee the full fledge impact of
these reforms. Two critical Technical Assistance loans were approved last year--one for
results based management and budgeting, and another for customs administration--that
will provide the basis for monitoring implementation in other key areas of the proposed
operation over the medium-term. In addition, there is a non-lending technical assistance
underway in the area of labor market policy. Furthermore, a full PSIA analysis of the
policies adopted by the Mexican Government to cope with the crisis will be produced by
Bank staff in calendar year 2010.

Fiduciary Aspects

125. In general, public financial management (PFM) systems in the Mexican
federal administration are adequate for DPL lending, as documented in the 2003
Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA), 2007 Country Procurement
Assessment Report (CPAR), and other analytical work. The DPL would fund the
Federal Expenditure Budget (PEF) and, accordingly, be subject to provisions of the
annual PEF Law, the Federal Budget and Fiscal Responsibility Law, the Government
Accounting Law, the Manual of Budget Procedures, and others. This set of legal and
regulatory arrangements, together with their implementation systems, provides for sound
budget formulation, execution and control arrangements. Other internal control aspects
are ruled by the Federal Public Administration Internal Control Standards. As for
external oversight, the Federal Supreme Audit Institution executes regularly a number of
performance, financial and compliance audits on Government programs, and their results
are made public in the annual audit report on the Federal Public Accounts. Good systems
are in place for follow-up to internal and external audit findings. There is room for
improvement in some PFM areas, such as certain procurement and accounting practices
that are not completely up to international standards, but there are plans underway ­
which the Bank is supporting- to move in that direction.

Disbursements and Auditing

126. The flow-of-fund arrangements are those customarily observed in DPLs for
Mexico, as per long-standing agreements with the Government. The SHCP has informed
the World Bank that BANSEFI will be the financial agent of the Borrower with regard to
the DPL. Under this arrangement, upon effectiveness the Bank would make the single
tranche disbursement to a designated account in US Dollars of BANSEFI,53 for
subsequent credit to an account of the National Treasury (SHCP/Tesorería de la
Federación, or TESOFE) used for general budget expenditures. The funds would thus
become available for financing of budget expenditures through the PFM systems


53
  The use of a financial agent and dedicated account is a local standard procedure established by the
Government of Mexico for their control purposes, not an additional arrangement requested by the Bank.

                                               - 40 -
mentioned in the previous paragraph. If requested by the Bank, the SHCP would provide
the Bank with a written confirmation of the described transaction.

127. Based on the assessment of the PFM and banking environment, no additional
fiduciary arrangements are deemed necessary for the DPL. The review of external
audit reports and the extensive flow-of-fund experience between the Bank and BANSEFI
reveal that there is no evidence that the banking control environment into which the DPL
proceeds would flow is other than adequate.

Risks and Risk Mitigation

128. A key risk to this operation is a substantial modification by Congress to the
economic package and budget law proposed by the administration. Debates within
Congress are progressing; however the final budget that is ultimately approved could
represent an unexpected worsening of the fiscal position in 2010. Perhaps more
importantly, structural medium-term revenue enhancing measures might not be approved.
Mitigating factors include the Government's extensive negotiation and public
dissemination efforts, as well as the broadly recognized need for a reduction in
dependence on volatile and uncertain oil revenue and the possibility that the executive
may implement alternative policies under its control if required.

129. Another risk is the possibility of a weak recovery from the current economic
downturn including a "double dip" recession in the United States, Mexico's main
trading partner, that could lead to a second year of subpar economic and public
sector revenue performance. Fiscal outcomes would be jeopardized, and it may be
difficult for the Government to maintain expenditure levels for key social and
infrastructure programs. A mitigating factor is that Mexico's fiscal track record has
assured good access to financial markets with a credit rating still two notches above
investment grade. There should be adequate access to credit to borrow through a second
downturn, so long as medium revenue reform measures are approved by Congress. The
Government has confirmed that the policies and institutions supported by the DPL are
given priority in its economic program.

130. The increased activity of development banks at times of economic distress
and in riskier market segments is likely to lead to an increase in NPLs and may
negatively affect their earnings. This risk and its potential impact on the institutions is
mitigated by several factors. First, the governance and institutional structure of
development banks has significantly improved over the past decade. Second, all
development banks have a capital adequacy ratio well-above the regulatory minimum of
8 percent, which provides them with a certain buffer. Third, additional guarantee
programs have been supported by supplementary counter-guarantees from the
Government, so that there is a transparent and up-front recognition of the extra expected
costs of these programs. Fourth, high credit risks to the corporate sector have been
overcollateralized or structured products have been devised to minimize the potential
losses to the institutions. Fifth, the CNBV is monitoring closely the performance of
development banks as part of their supervisory duties.


                                          - 41 -
131. Efforts to improve the flow of credit through the financial system could be
overcome by negative developments, such as a substantially weaker economic
recovery than currently anticipated. The financial system remains sound; however, a
second round of negative economic development inevitably could lead to additional
increases in non-performing loans and limited scope for banks to extend credit.
Mitigating factors include the strong initial condition of the financial system, the scope
for additional financial intermediation by the country's development banks, the strong
credibility in the conduction of monetary policy by the country's central bank, as well as
stress tests conducted regularly by the CNBV.

132. Labor market conditions could continue to deteriorate even during an
incipient recovery. The Government may need to expand or enhance the measures
supported in the proposed DPL in order to mitigate the social and economic impact of
such deterioration. These actions could confront fiscal constraints--particularly in the
event of a "double dip" recession. A mitigating factor is the improved targeting,
evaluation and coordination in the implementation of Government's social programs as
well as the progress in public expenditure management to guide the reallocation of public
expenditure.

133. The Government may decide to delay implementation of the next stage of
tariff reductions, due to political pressures. The initial measures of the decree lay out
a clear time table; however, a second decree could be issued to delay implementation.
The Government's commitment appears strong and it plans to continue informing the
public and industry of the benefits of the reform to mitigate pressures.

134. There could be institutional impediments to customs simplification efforts.
Effective results will depend upon improved function of the customs agency. A
mitigating factor is that the customs agency is strongly committed to these reform efforts,
and the Bank's supervision of a technical assistance loan will provide a partner for
institutional development.

        TRANSLATION OF THE LETTER OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY

Mr. Robert B. Zoelick,
President,
World Bank

Mr. Zoellick:

The world outlook has changed radically. The global recession that began in mid-2008
and deepened by the end of that year, occurred on an unprecedented scale, not seen in the
past seven decades of world history. The Mexican economy has been particularly
seriously affected by a combination of various adverse factors. This Letter of
Development Policy describes Mexico's economic conditions, the main economic policy
measures implemented by President Felipe Calderón and the 2010 Economic Program he
submitted to Congress.

Regarding Mexico's relations with the World Bank in the current global economic
context, the Mexican government has maintained an active agenda of dialogue and
exchange of experiences and technical assistance with the World Bank in several of the
essential areas of the institutional framework. This has permitted the implementation of
counter-cyclical policies as well as macroeconomic policies that will contribute to the
recovery and sustainable growth of the Mexican economy. In particular, the policy areas
selected are linked to fiscal policy and public expenditure management, the financial
system, labor policy and foreign trade. In view of the current circumstances, we are now
asking for the actions being carried out in these areas to be backed by financial support
from the World Bank.

Macro-economic Environment

The collapse of international trade and the sharp drop in U.S. industrial production
translated into an abrupt fall in Mexican industry's productive activity, which is closely
linked to the U.S. manufacturing sector. Given the importance of foreign trade and
industrial production in the Mexican economy, the global contraction was reflected in a
steep decline in Mexico's GDP during the first two quarters of this year.

The international crisis has also led to a reduction in the availability of financing
worldwide. The demand for financing in industrialized countries, capital losses in
financing institutions and the review of financial regulation that is occurring worldwide
will lead to less favorable financing conditions over the next few years.

Mexico is also having to cope with the decline in oil production over the past four years,
which is particularly unfortunate, given the high share of hydrocarbon revenue in
Mexico's public finances.

Due to these adverse factors, Mexico's GDP is expected to drop by 6.8 percent in 2009.
Positive sequential growth, however, is anticipated during the second half of 2009. In
                                          - 48 -
addition to the stabilization and recovery that has begun to be observed in the world
economy, Mexico has several elements that will contribute to its recovery after the crisis.
The effects of implementing counter-cyclical policies on the fiscal and monetary fronts,
as well as through development banka and by promoting infrastructure and housing are
crucial elements. Other strengths include price stability, a highly capitalized, solvent
financial system and a more competitive exchange rate.

Challenges of Fiscal Policy

One of the negative consequences of the international crisis has been that in the case of
Mexico, it has led to a sharp decline in public revenue. The country's public finances
have been deeply affected by the combination of the drop in economic activity, derived
from the international crisis and its lower oil production platform and oil prices. These
factors have led to the greatest drop in oil and non-oil tax revenue in at least thirty years.

Despite this, the use of non-recurring revenue such as the oil price hedge and stabilization
fund savings have made it possible to protect spending in 2009. This has maintained the
counter-cyclical impulse provided by public finances during the current spell of
economic weakness.

The country's public finances, however, are experiencing a structural problem associated
with lower oil production, which requires immediate, equally structural solutions. In
particular, the fiscal proposal President Calderón has submitted to Congress for
consideration will lead to the orderly adjustment of public finances with the aim of
strengthening them in the short and medium term. Thus, the economic program for 2010
will establish firmer revenue bases that will offset the reduction in oil revenue while
encouraging growth and job creation and, of course, alleviating poverty.

It is essential to undertake a fiscal reform that will enable us to deal with the current
adverse situation, while allowing us to make up for the reduction in oil revenue due to
lower hydrocarbon production. The aim is to achieve an optimal combination of
measures that will continue to boost the economy and employment as much as possible
without jeopardizing the viability of public finances in the medium term. This will be
achieved by establishing a solid, efficient tax scheme that will be less vulnerable to the
volatility of oil revenue, in which expenditure will be carried out transparently and
efficiently and assigned to the main national priorities. The economic package proposed
for 2010 will therefore have the following components:

   I. A higher level of public debt by resorting to a temporary, moderate fiscal deficit
       linked to the cycle of the economy. This will be complemented by non-recurrent
       revenue and the use of savings.
   II. An increase in the permanent collection of non-oil revenue through modifications
       to the tax regime and more efficient tax enforcement.

A temporary fiscal deficit and non-recurrent revenue will be used to offset the transitory
drop in public income. The decline in oil production will be offset by the adjustment and

                                            - 49 -
containment of public expenditure, accompanied by greater efficiency, transparency and
accountability, together with an increase in the collection of non-oil tax revenue.

Structural Agenda

In addition to the structural vulnerability of public finances, due to their dependence on
volatile oil prices and the decline in crude oil production are required actions that will
enable us to speed up the growth of the Mexican economy.

We must therefore set up a large, integral agenda and chart a clear course by means of a
strategic policy that will enable us to boost the competitiveness of the Mexican economy,
curb the growth of poverty and provide all Mexicans with opportunities to live better: the
point is to propose a course of action that will go beyond the present and in addition to
fostering the reactivation of the economy, establishes ambitious medium and long-term
objectives.

The reforms proposed in the sphere of competitiveness also complement fiscal reform:
even with reforms to boost competitiveness, growth and investment are unlikely to
increase in the absence of healthy public finances while the sustainability of public
finances is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for rapid growth.

Our economic growth and job creation rates are insufficient due to a low competitiveness.
Priority must therefore be given to an agenda of actions in the economic sphere that will
lead to higher growth. These actions must reflect the criterion that government can
contribute more by facilitating the activity of the rest of the country's economic agents
through an adequate legal, administrative and regulatory framework than through direct
expenditure. To this end, it will be necessary to advance on four key fronts, namely:

   1. To make input markets function better and therefore achieve greater
      competitiveness, particularly as regards labor relations, the telecommunications
      market, the energy sector, the financial system as a whole and investment in
      public infrastructure.

   2. Improve the institutional framework that will determine the rules within which
      economic activity and business take place.

   3. Expand the markets in which our products and services participate and

   4. Encourage those sectors which, by virtue of being labor intensive and because of
      their regional characteristics, may have a greater impact on creating employment
      and alleviating poverty.

At the same time, we will act more assertively in external markets. First, by combating
the protectionist measures that emerge as a misguided response to the world economy's
current recession. Second, by lowering rates and tariff classifications to achieve the ideal
of "low and flat" tariffs. Third, by working to harmonize trade regulations with our North

                                           - 50 -
American partners. Fourth, by intensifying the presence and penetration of Mexican
products in Asian markets in areas where there is a significant deficit and which should
see the highest growth worldwide over the next few years as well as in markets in the
south of this continent.

This reform agenda undoubtedly constitutes a highly ambitious program, in keeping with
what the country requires at this moment. It is a program combining a sense of urgency
with long-term vision that will enable us to increase the medium-term growth rate in
addition to continuing to create the jobs required by the upcoming generations.

World Bank's Support

The World Bank has been a reliable partner, supporting not only short-term efforts but
also and even more importantly, the long-term political and institutional reforms required
to make these policy actions viable. In particular, policies in the areas of taxation and
public expenditure management were supported by an analysis and longer term policy
dialogue on the efficiency of public spending, budgetary and accountancy reforms as well
as technical assistance loans to the tax administration system. Actions in the financial
sector were supported by joint missions by the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund as well as subsequent recommendations from both institutions. The
Secretariat of Labor and Social Welfare maintains a close policy dialogue on the labor
market and the design and evaluation of programs in the labor sector. Lastly, the World
Bank's work as a champion of free trade is crucial for emerging economies such as
Mexico that are attempting to insert themselves into worldwide production and
distribution chains. Likewise, recent efforts to promote the institutional development of
the customs administration are crucial to reducing the transaction costs associated with
the flow of merchandise.

We hope to continue to enjoy the World Bank's support in the institutional and policy
innovation that forms part of our medium-term development program. Both the financial
and knowledge services provided by the World Bank are deeply appreciated by our
administration.



                                     Yours sincerely,

IMF Executive Board Completes Review of Mexico's Performance
Under the Flexible Credit Line
Press                 Release                No.                  09/362
October 16, 2009
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today
completed its six-month review of Mexico's qualification for the
arrangement under the Flexible Credit Line (FCL) and reaffirmed
Mexico's continued qualification to access FCL resources. The
Mexican authorities have indicated that they intend to continue
treating the arrangement as precautionary and do not intend to draw on
the line.
The one year arrangement for Mexico for SDR 31.5 billion (about
US$47 billion), approved in April 17, 2009 (see Press Release No.
09/130) was the first commitment under the IMF's FCL, which was
created in the context of a major overhaul of the Fund's lending
framework on March 24, 2009 (see Press Release No. 09/85 and
Public Information Notice 09/40).
Following the Executive Board discussion of Mexico, Mr. John
Lipsky, First Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chairman of the
Board, made the following statement:
"Six months ago, with the global financial crisis near its peak, the IMF
Executive Board approved for Mexico the first Flexible Credit Line
(FCL) arrangement in the history of the Fund. The goal of the FCL is
to provide insurance against tail risks beyond the control of country
authorities. In Mexico, the authorities' responsive policy actions,
additional financing from the international community, coupled with
the FCL have in the last months supported a reduction in perceptions
of tail risks and contributed to stabilization in financial market
conditions. Today, the IMF Executive Board has completed a review
that reaffirmed that Mexico continues to meet the qualification criteria
for access to FCL resources.
"Despite its strong policy frameworks, the current global economic
and financial environment has hit Mexico harder than expected. The
economy is in the deepest recession since the 1994-95 crisis, reflecting
especially close links to the U.S. economy. However, recent indicators
show some signs of recovery and overall growth is expected to pick up
in the second semester of this year. Meanwhile, corporate external
financing conditions have eased and the balance of payments situation
remains manageable.

"However, Mexico's very strong policy framework, which underpins
its qualification for the FCL, has helped cushion the impact of the
global crisis. The flexible exchange rate has adjusted, the inflation
targeting framework has provided an anchor for expectations, and the
fiscal rule and strengthened public sector balance sheets have averted
disruptive moves in risk premia. The well capitalized banking system
and strong supervisory framework provide assurances that challenges
to the financial sector from the sharp growth slowdown will be met.
"In a signal of their commitment to pursuing very strong policies, the
authorities have proposed an ambitious fiscal reform to the Congress
that seeks to strike a balance between the need to begin the process of
fiscal consolidation, while smoothing as much as possible the
withdrawal of fiscal support to the economy. The proposed measures,
in conjunction with the existing fiscal framework, continue to ensure
medium term fiscal sustainability. Monetary policy continues to be
guided by the inflation targeting framework and expectations remain
well anchored.
"Against this backdrop of very strong policy frameworks and actions,
the Executive Board today reaffirmed that Mexico continues to meet
the qualification criteria for the FCL. Accordingly, resources under the
FCL--which the authorities have indicated that they intend to continue
to treat as precautionary--will remain available through April next
year," Mr. Lipsky said.

      ANNEX 4. MACROECONOMIC & DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT

1.      Mexico is in the midst of a deep recession as it faces the impacts of strained
global financial conditions, a sharp contraction in international trade and the outbreak of
the A/H1N1 flu. Based on seasonally adjusted quarterly GDP statistics the economic
recession in Mexico started as early as the third quarter of 2008 and the downturn has
been particularly sharp during the fourth quarter last year and the first quarter of 2009
(see figure 1a). The outbreak of the flu epidemic in the last week of April aggravated the
economic downturn during the second quarter of the year.54 Economic activity during the
first half of this year has been down by 9.2 percent compared to the same period of the
previous year.

2.      The global financial crisis led to a sharp tightening of financing conditions in a
large number of emerging market economies. Mexico has been no exception. In
response to the global financial crisis and emerging market sell-off, the Mexican
authorities implemented several policy actions to maintain and restore liquidity on
domestic financial markets including foreign exchange interventions, the provision of
loans and loan guarantees to domestic firms by government owned development banks
and the repurchase and reduced issue of longer-term government bonds. Nevertheless,
there was a substantial depreciation of the currency, and the flexible exchange rate
continues to operate as a key instrument and signaling device for the rapid adjustment of
the economy to external shocks.

3.     Prior to the onset of the global economic downturn, Mexico experienced moderate
growth within a framework of enhanced macroeconomic stability. GDP growth averaged
3.8 percent annually between 2004 and 2007; fiscal policy successfully focused on a
reduction of the public sector deficit and a decline in the public sector debt-to-GDP ratio,
and enhanced price stability contributed to a healthy domestic credit expansion and
growth of domestic demand.

4.      Economic activity suffered a severe contraction throughout the world. Mexico's
annual economic growth decelerated substantially as the economy entered into a
recession towards the second half of 2008, leading to a more limited GDP growth of 1.3
percent for the year. The current base case scenario for Mexico includes a contraction of
economic activity by 6.8 percent in 2009 which, in view of the dismal performance of the
economy during the first semester requires a substantial recovery of activity in the second
half of the year.




54
  The Government estimates that the contraction of economic activity that can be attributed to the flu
outbreak is about 0.3 to 0.5 percent of GDP this year and is concentrated in the 2nd quarter of the year

5.      The Mexican Government implemented counter-cyclical fiscal stimulus policies
to mitigate the impact of the external demand shock on the domestic economy. The fiscal
stimulus policies adopted include additional public investment in infrastructure
incorporated in the 2009 budget as well as employment programs, a reduction and freeze
of public sector administrated prices in the energy sector and an expansion of
development banks' credit programs.

6.     The contraction of economic activity is leading to a sharp decline in tax revenue
making it difficult to sustain planned public expenditure levels. During the first eight
months of this year non-oil tax revenue dropped by 13 percent in real terms while Value
Added Tax revenue plummeted by 20 percent. The Government plans to compensate
lower oil and non-oil budget revenue this year, currently estimated at MXN 477.5 billion
(US$35 billion, 4 percent of GDP) with non-recurrent resources from a successful oil
hedge, an extraordinary transfer of profits from the central bank and drawing resources
from the Government's revenue stabilization funds. In addition, lower federal
Government revenue automatically translates in less revenue shared with states and
municipalities. Finally, the Government announced public expenditure cuts to a total
amount of MXN 85 billion (US$6.5 billion, 0.7 percent of GDP)55 in order to keep the
2009 budget balance targets on track.

7.      Extraordinary revenue sources used to compensate the shortfall in fiscal revenue
this year will not be available in 2010 prompting additional fiscal adjustment in next
year's budget. The Government's budget projections for 2010 show a revenue shortfall
of MXN 374 billion (US$29 billion, 3.0 percent of GDP) compared to the expected
revenue in the 2009 budget. The Government proposes to close this gap by a
combination of expenditure reductions, revenue enhancing measures and allow for a
higher deficit.56 The Mexican fiscal responsibility law requires a balanced budget57 and
allows for a deficit only under "exceptional circumstances" and conditioned by the
adoption of a medium term fiscal framework to return to a balanced budget. The sharp
decline in public sector revenue due to the current cyclical downturn is further aggravated
by a rapidly falling volume of oil production leading to a more structural challenge to
replace diminishing oil revenue by more permanent sources of revenue. The Government
is proposing a mix of tax policy measures and adjustments in public sector administrated
prices (mainly in the energy sector) and a discussion in Congress is underway to decide
on the mix of revenue and expenditure measures. Therefore, the fiscal package seeks to

   The government submitted its budget proposal for 2010 to Congress on September 8, 2009 in which it
proposes to cover the permanent component of the revenue shortfall, estimated at 1.7 percent of GDP, by
expenditure cuts and revenue enhancing measures, leaving a transitory component of the shortfall to be
financed by additional deficit spending, 0.5 percent of GDP, and non-recurrent extraordinary revenue,
0.8 percent of GDP.
57
   A modification to the law adopted by Congress in 2009 includes all investments by the public sector oil
company in the budget but excludes these investments from the budget balance requirement. Those
investments are currently estimated to amount to 2.1 percent of GDP for 2009 and 2.0 percent in 2010. As
a result the budget deficit for 2009 is estimated at 2.1 percent of GDP, while for 2010 the government
proposes a budget deficit of 2.5 percent of GDP (i.e. 2.0 percent oil sector investment and an additional
0.5 percent temporary deficit spending).

strike a balance between the need for fiscal consolidation to assure markets of fiscal
sustainability while smoothing out the withdrawal of fiscal stimulus. In this regard,
credit rating agencies have also warned that there is the need for a clear and credible
medium-term fiscal strategy of revenue-enhancing measures or sustainable spending cuts
to compensate for lower public sector revenue.

8.      Monetary policy started to ease since January 2009 in order to support other
efforts to reduce the downturn in economic activity. Even though consumer price
inflation continues at a level, 4.9 percent last September, which is substantially above the
authorities' medium-term target of 3 percent. The severity of the economic downturn has
led the authorities to reduce its target for the overnight interbank interest rate by an
accumulated 375 basis points between January and July this year, from 8.25 to
4.50 percent. The central bank currently projects to reach its medium-term inflation
target towards the end of 2010 and forecasts an inflation of 4.0-4.5 percent by the end of
2009. The revenue raising measures in the fiscal package may provide an additional
challenge to the monetary authorities to assure that their impact on headline inflation
remains a one-off event.

9.      The authorities have taken several actions to maintain orderly conditions on
foreign exchange and domestic financial markets in view of the unprecedented global
financial shocks. The central bank intervened in foreign exchange markets providing
foreign currency liquidity to the private sector. Sales of international reserves through
different intervention mechanisms summed to US$30 billion between October 2008 and
August 2009. Though Mexico maintains a level of international reserves relative to short
term debt and imports that is below the level observed in several other emerging market
economies and currency interventions reduced reserves to US$76 billion by August 2009
compared to US$85 billion in September 2008, indicators of foreign reserve adequacy
continue well above conventional thresholds of 100 percent relative to short-term
external debt or three to six months of imports. Furthermore, bilateral and multilateral
support, through a US$30 billion currency swap arrangement with the US Federal
Reserve (extended until February, 2010) and a US$47 billion Flexible Credit Line (FCL)
with the IMF, provide for additional precautionary sources of external funds.
Announcement of the one-year FCL last April greatly reduced volatility of the peso.
Moreover, the revenues from the oil hedge which will be received in November should
lead to a level of reserves similar to the one observed in September of last year.

10.      The Mexican Government, through its development banks, also stepped in to
facilitate refinancing of corporate debt and to support securitized private housing finance
on the private domestic bond market. Issuance of private domestic securities (financial
and non-financial) was severely disrupted. No medium-term bond issues were made
during October and November last year and the issuance of short-term paper also

declined significantly (see figure). A bankruptcy filing of a major AAA58 rated company
following large losses on currency related derivatives impaired the non-financial
corporate commercial paper market. To maintain the flow of credit and allow
corporations to refinance, NAFIN and Bancomext designed an emergency program
through which they guaranteed up to 50 percent of domestic corporate paper issuances.
Sociedad Hipotecaria Federal, the Government's private housing finance development
bank, stepped in to avoid a collapse of the nascent Residential Mortgage Backed Security
(RMBS) market and support the flow of credit to mortgage originating non-bank credit
institutions (Sofoles and Sofomes). After a default by two mortgage Sofoles on the
commercial paper, the SHF designed a program to guarantee up to 65 percent of bonds
issued by mortgage Sofoles enabling them to refinance debt maturing in 2009 and 2010.

11.     Credit to the non-financial private sector has started to contract. Despite a brief
period of double digit growth over the past few years, the level of credit to the private
sector in Mexico remains, at about 30 percent of GDP, low compared to other countries
in the region or at comparable levels of economic development. Growth of credit slowed
down last year and has started to contract over the past few months once one adjusts
credit growth, in constant domestic currency terms, for the depreciation of the exchange
rate. About a quarter of the amount of credit outstanding to the private sector is expressed
in foreign currency and a depreciation of the peso increases the peso equivalence of the
amount outstanding without any additional credit flow taking place. As can be observed
from figure 3, the growth of credit in real, domestic currency terms dropped sharply over
the past three quarters to a contraction by the second quarter of 2009 of 2.4 percent.

12.     The most affected sector for this slowdown trend in credit is the household sector.
After a six-year period of high, double digit growth of consumer credit, led by the credit
card business, a significantly increasing non-performing consumer credit loan portfolio
led financial intermediaries to cut back on the expansion of consumer credit already
before the impact of the global financial crisis was felt in Mexico. Consumer credit
started to present a negative growth rate since the last quarter of 2008 and data for June
2009 show a sharp contraction of 17 percent (Figure 3). The more remarkable
development over the past few months in the slowdown of growth and eventual
contraction of credit is observed in the performance of credit to non-financial private
sector firms and in housing finance, accounting for some 59 and 27 percent of total credit
to the non-financial private sector. Housing loans presented still a moderate expansion of
2 percent at the second quarter of 2009. As expected, the credit crunch is particularly
noted in the externally originated and foreign currency denominated segment of credit to
private sector firms that observed an annual contraction by 11 percent in the second
quarter this year (after adjusting for the depreciation of the peso). The positive growth
persisting in the domestic finance to companies does not any longer compensate the
dramatic drop of external credit flows; total financing to Mexican firms decreased by 1
percent in the second quarter of 2009.

13.     The current economic recession is characterized by a simultaneous sharp
contraction in private consumption, investment and exports. While the latter is due to a
more generalized drop in external demand and international trade, the rapid tightening in
domestic demand can be attributed to increased uncertainty regarding global and
domestic economic prospects, increased unemployment, reduced availability of credit,
and a significant currency depreciation. GDP data for the first semester show a
particularly fast and sharp response by households and businesses to the rapidly
deteriorated financial and economic situation as private consumption contracted by 9.2
percent and investment by 11.5 percent contributing significantly to the overall
contraction of GDP.59 Weak private consumption and investment activity is also
reflected in a rapid decline of imports, down by 31 percent in nominal dollar terms during
the first eight months of the year. Exports over the same period were down by 30.2
percent. It should be noted that there is a close link between export and import declines,
as more than 70 percent of imports are intermediate goods, many of which are used as
inputs for export production.

14.    With additional data becoming available, there seems to be an emerging
consensus that the global economic downturn is currently bottoming out, even though
there remains considerable uncertainty with regards to the strength of the rebound.
Assumptions regarding the external environment have a major impact on the projection
of Mexico's main macroeconomic variables over the next two years. A base case
scenario (Table 1) follows the Bank's Unified Survey Assumptions of September 2009
for global economic activity.60 The impact of such an external scenario on the Mexican
economy is a significant recession in 2009 and a modest rebound by 2010 and 2011. The
sharp reduction in the external demand in the base case scenario in 2009 is reflected in a

   World output is projected to fall by 2.5 percent in 2009 and experiencing a gradual recovery in 2010
when growth is picking up to 2.3 percent. Similarly output in the United States is projected to contract by
2.5 percent in 2009 before rebounding by 2.3 percent in 2010.

                                                                        - 64 -
significant contraction in the dollar value of exports, with the value of oil exports mainly
declining as a result of lower oil prices whereas non-oil exports largely decline due to
lower volumes of production and trade. The latter in combination with tighter credit
conditions (both external and domestic) is projected to lead to a simultaneous sharp
contraction of private consumption and investment. Countercyclical Government
expenditures cannot avoid a sharp contraction of aggregate demand and economic
activity in 2009. A gradual recovery of external demand by 2010 should allow, on the
contrary, for an increase of manufactured exports, private consumption and investment
demand providing for a modest expansion of overall economic activity. Risks to this
scenario are largely tilted towards the downside and a second, low case scenario provides
for the impact on Mexican macroeconomic indicators in case of a sharper reaction in
terms of the domestic demand contraction in the short run and a more protracted
recession in its largest trading partner and the global economy, reflected in a less
vigorous rebound in the volume of exports and a lower international oil price in 2010 and
2011.

15.     In either scenario concerns are focused on the rising fiscal pressures in view of the
rapidly deteriorating outlook for public sector revenue and the increasing public debt-to-
GDP ratios. Fiscal discipline and strong fiscal policy frameworks, including the
establishment of stabilization funds and the acquisition of oil price hedges, enabled a
countercyclical policy response for 2009. The public debt-to-GDP ratio posted an

                                                     - 65 -
important increase end-2008 that can be attributed in part to the issue of a recognition
bond to public sector workers that opted for the individual savings account in the public
sector pension reform. The sharp economic contraction, the depreciation of the currency
and a higher fiscal deficit contribute further to an increase of the public debt-to-GDP ratio
in 2009. Even though there has been some room for an increase of public debt and the
public debt-to-GDP ratio, the rapid increase and level to be attained by the latter by 2010
and 2011 suggests limits to possibilities of fiscal stimulus. In this regard, policymakers
face a difficult trade-off between early fiscal consolidation that may aggravate the
contraction of the domestic economy and a market reaction (as already expressed by
credit rating agencies) that demand a clear and credible medium-term fiscal strategy of
revenue-enhancing measures or sustainable spending cuts to compensate for the lower
public sector revenue.

16.     Debates on the size of the fiscal stimulus and the moment to change toward fiscal
consolidation are taking place in many countries and Mexico is no exception. The size of
the fiscal buffers going into the recession, projections on the depth and duration of the
economic contraction and possible market reactions with respect to increased fiscal
deficits and higher levels of public debt are some of the major elements that have to be
taken into account in policy decisions on the size and length of fiscal stimulus. Mexico
adequately used its fiscal space­created by consistent fiscal policies and falling debt-to-
GDP ratios, the accumulation of resources in revenue stabilization funds and the oil price
hedge­to enact a substantial fiscal stimulus in 2009 and is currently in the midst of
discussing the economic package for 2010.61

and additional corrective policy actions will be needed.

18.      The external current account deficit is not a cause of concern. The rapid
deterioration of the external financing and economic conditions to the Mexican economy
has been rapidly reflected in the country's exchange rate which led to a rapid adjustment
of consumption and investment plans by Mexican households and businesses. This in
turn has led to a sharp contraction of imports, in line with or even more pronounced to the
fall in exports. The low case scenario provides for a slightly sharper functioning of this
adjustment mechanism resulting in an even more modest current account deficit.

ANNEX 5. ANALYSIS OF THE GOVERNMENT'S ECONOMIC POLICIES
              Annex 5a. Fiscal Policies and Public Expenditures

Introduction

1.     Pro-cyclical fiscal policy has been a stylized fact regarding Mexican--and Latin
American--fiscal policy in recent decades. Limited access to finance during downturns
often resulted in expenditure cuts that would exacerbate the recession, while political
economy constraints often made it difficult to save and reduce public sector indebtedness
during boom periods.

2.       In the wake of the ongoing global crisis the Mexican authorities have managed to
initially increase--and eventually maintain--the level of public expenditure to withstand
the sharp contraction in private aggregate demand. Contrary to previous cyclical
downturns, the sharp fall in public sector revenue observed in 2009 has not been
compensated by a sharp reduction in overall public expenditure or an increase in taxes
and, in that way, fiscal policy is allowing automatic stabilizers to function. The fiscal
policy response might have been stronger, however, the need for medium-term reforms to
reduce the reliance on declining oil revenues have limited the Government's ability to
engage in a more forceful short term response.

3.      This annex analyzes fiscal policy as implemented in Mexico in 2009 and
proposed for 2010 and the institutional framework that enabled this policy response. It
also signals some of the challenges that the current framework of fiscal rules faces in
order to enhance the ability to engage in a more countercyclical fiscal policy as well as
some other structural limitations of public finance in Mexico.

Background

4.      In the years prior to the current global crisis Mexico observed a significant growth
of total public sector revenue and expenditure as the public sector managed to expand its
participation in the economy by about 2 percentage point of GDP between 2003 and 2008
(table 1). The expansion of the public sector has been driven in part by significantly
higher oil revenue as a result of an increase in international oil prices and a historically
maximum level of oil production reached in 2004. Oil made up, on average, 36 percent
of total public sector revenue, reaffirming the high dependence on oil of Mexican public
finances.

5.      Efforts to raise non-oil tax revenue during the previous administration were
largely focused on improvements in tax administration. In 2007, the Calderón
administration implemented changes in tax policy--along with other fiscal reforms--and
introduced new taxes which led to an increase of close to 10 percent in the ratio of non-
oil tax revenue to GDP in 2008.64 Nevertheless, at less than 10 percent of GDP the tax


64
  The new taxes adopted end-2007 are: a flat tax on the value added generated by companies that acts as a
minimum income tax (IETU), and a tax on cash deposits in the banking system focused on tax collection
from the informal sector (IDE).

                                                  - 68 -
effort in Mexico remains substantially below the level observed in other countries in the
region or at a similar stage of development.

6.      In addition to a slight decline in the budget deficit in the early part of the period,
public expenditure was raised in almost the same proportion as the increase observed in
total revenue. A reduction in the total interest cost of public debt relative to GDP created
additional space for a more rapid expansion of primary expenditure. A significant part of
that expansion took place in capital expenditure including investments in infrastructure
and a transfer of part of the oil windfall to revenue stabilization funds (more on this
below). At the same time, current expenditure has been expanded.

7.      Fiscal policy maintained a strong orientation toward moderation of public deficits
and a reduction of the public debt-to-GDP ratio. A balanced budget was essentially
achieved as of 2004, i.e. three years before the introduction of a balanced budget rule into
the legal budget framework (more on this below). In terms of the Public Sector
Borrowing Requirements, a broader concept of the public sector deficit, there was also an
important moderation in total public sector deficit spending. This has led to a reduction
of the net public sector debt-to-GDP ratio, as reported by the Ministry of Finance under
the concept of the Historical Balance of Public Sector Borrowing Requirements, from
38.1 percent in 2003 to 29.9 percent in 2007. The ratio increased subsequently in 2008 to
35.7 percent largely due to the issuance of recognition bonds in the context of public
sector workers pension reform.

8.      Fiscal policy in Mexico is currently carried out within the framework of a Fiscal
Responsibility Law (FRL) that was adopted in 2006. As observed, in the years prior to
the adoption of the FRL, moderate public deficit financing and a related reduction in the
public debt-to-GDP ratio had already been one of the guiding principles of Mexican
fiscal policy. The FRL strengthened and put into a more permanent legal framework
some of the macroeconomic stability oriented features of fiscal policy in Mexico that had
been evolving in the context of annual budget formulation and discussions in Congress.


                                                 - 69 -
9.       In this context the FRL includes:

     ·   Balanced budget rule. The FRL requires budget formulation, approval and
         implementation to lead to a balanced budget. A budget deficit is only allowed
         under exceptional circumstances and requires specification of such exceptional
         circumstances as well as the formulation of a timeframe within which budget
         balance is restored. The budget includes the federal Government and the state
         owned enterprises under direct budgetary control, such as the oil company
         PEMEX, the electricity utilities and social security. The budget does not include
         a number of off-budget outlays that are included in a broader concept of Public
         Sector Borrowing Requirements (PSBR). More recently,65 the FRL was amended
         to bring externally financed investments by PEMEX, which were previously
         treated as off-budget expenditures,66 onto the budget while at the same time
         redefining the balanced budget requirement by excluding all investments of
         PEMEX from the budget balance to be considered.

     ·   Budget reference oil price. As oil makes up a significant part of public sector
         revenue in Mexico and the international price of oil has been highly volatile, the
         FRL includes a formula to estimate the oil price as a weighted average of the 10-
         year moving average of the historical price of oil, the medium term futures oil
         price as well as the price of oil on the next year's futures market.

     ·   Distribution of excess oil revenue. The FRL establishes rules to determine the
         amount of surplus revenue resulting from an oil price that is higher than the
         estimated budget reference price as well as its distribution among oil revenue
         stabilization funds. A first oil revenue stabilization fund was established by the
         federal Government in 2000 while two additional funds, one for investments in
         the oil sector by PEMEX and another for investments in public infrastructure by
         state Governments, were added in 2006. According to the law 40 percent of the
         excess revenue is transferred to the federal Government fund and 25 percent to
         the PEMEX and States funds each while the remaining 10 percent is transferred to
         States directly for investment in public infrastructure. The amount of resources
         that can be accumulated in each of the funds has been capped and once the funds
         have reached their limit, 75 percent of the excess revenue is allocated to public
         investment and 25 percent to a fund to support the restructuring of pension
         systems.

Fiscal stimulus at a time of an unexpectedly sharp revenue shock

10.     Preparation, discussion and approval of the budget for 200967 took place at a time
of a rapid deterioration of the external economic and financial environment following the
bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers mid-September 2008. The fast worsening economic and

   The Mexican budget year coincides with the calendar year

                                                 - 70 -
financial conditions is evident from the change in the macroeconomic assumptions
underlying the budget between its proposal early September and approval by Congress in
mid-November. From an economic growth of 3 percent, an average exchange rate of
10.6 peso/dollar and an average price for the Mexican mix of oil exports of US$ 80.3 per
barrel, these variables were adjusted to 1.8 percent, 11.7 peso/dollar and US$ 70 per
barrel respectively.

11.   The approved budget would provide a considerable countercyclical fiscal stimulus
to economic activity with a 13.2 percent increase, in real terms, in total public
expenditure compared to the budget approved for 2008 (see table 2).

12.    The significant fiscal stimulus suggested by a comparison between the approved
budgets for 2008 and 2009 was enabled by a significant increase in oil revenue and an
important adjustment to the FRL creating additional fiscal space. Though the price of oil
reached unprecedented levels in 2008, the approved budget for that year had been based
on an oil price of US$ 49.0 per barrel whereas, as mentioned before, the budget for 2009
was based on an oil price of US$ 70 per barrel.

13.    In addition and more relevant from a structural point of view was the amendment
to the FRL and the balanced budget rule, referred to before, that brings externally
financed investments by PEMEX (PIDIREGAS) onto the budget, while at the same time
excluding all investments by PEMEX from the budget balance requirement. As PEMEX
finances part of its investment program externally and part with budget allocations, the
exclusion of all investment from the balanced budget rule created additional fiscal space
estimated at 0.7 percent of GDP for the budget in 2009.

14.    Clearly, a more accurate analysis of the fiscal expansion requires a comparison of
actual executed expenditures, and it also requires adjustments due to the changing

                                            - 71 -
definition of budgetary expenditures. As it turns out actual budget execution for 2008
and, as currently programmed, for 2009 modifies the size of the estimated fiscal stimulus.
Primarily as a result of a higher oil price, total revenue and expenditure in 2008 were
substantially higher than budgeted. Increased expenditure includes a transfer of resources
to revenue stabilization funds and, as these funds reached their limit, to a fund for the
restructuring of pension systems.

15.     More importantly the severe global and domestic economic downturn following
the intensification of the global financial crisis in the last quarter of 2008 and in the first
quarter of 2009, is leading to a gross revenue shortfall in 2009 compared to the approved
annual budget of 478 billion pesos or 4 percent of GDP (see table 3).

16.     The significant fall in both oil and non-oil revenue compared to the originally
approved budget can be attributed to a lower oil price, currently estimated at US$ 51 per
barrel on average for 2009 compared to the US$ 70 per barrel original budget estimate, a
lower level of oil production, at 2,622 thousand barrels per day instead of 2,750 thousand,
and a contraction of the domestic economy, estimated at 6.8 percent, instead of a GDP
growth of 1.8 percent.

17.     The gross revenue reduction led to an automatic reduction in the tax revenue
shared with lower levels of government, thus creating a net shortfall of 428 billion pesos.
The Government proposes to cover this amount with a transfer of profits from the central
bank, receipts from an oil hedge contracted by mid-2008 and withdrawals from the
Government's oil revenue stabilization funds as well as by reducing public expenditure
by 85 billion pesos. In addition, the cost of PEMEX' investment program increases by
24 billion pesos largely attributable to a weaker peso though this increase does not
require to be compensated under the recently amended balanced budget rule and is
reflected in a higher budget deficit.

18.    An initial comparison between the budget implemented in 2008 and the year-end
budget estimates for 2009 suggests that the public sector has been able to maintain the
nominal level of expenditure (table 4). A more complete assessment of the spending
impulse requires some adjustments to the expenditure accounts in order to make the

                                                   - 72 -
economic impact of the expenditure between 2008 and 2009 fully comparable. Such
adjustments include: adding the externally financed investment by PEMEX in the budget
spending for 2008 and subtracting the transfers to stabilization funds in 2008 as these are
a financial saving rather than expenditure. Estimates presented by SHCP, incorporating
such adjustments, show that public spending maintained its level in real terms between
2008 and 2009.68

19.    To provide support to economic activity when most needed the Government front
loaded its public expenditure and investment programs in 2009. As a result, current
expenditure and public sector induced physical investment69 increased by 5.4 and 27.7
percent, in real terms, respectively during the first half of 2009 compared to the same
period of the previous year. .

20.     The impact of front loading public expenditure in the first half of 2009 as well as
of increased spending observed during the second half of 2008 on aggregate demand can
be observed figure 1. The figure presents the contribution to the growth in aggregate
demand (year-on-year) according to the main categories of demand identified in the
national account statistics. From the third quarter of 2008 up until the second quarter of
2009, public expenditure had a significant positive contribution to economic activity;
however, it was clearly unable to compensate for the dramatic reduction in private
consumption and investment. Even though the collapse of trade played an important role
in the overall contraction, the figure shows a positive contribution of net foreign demand
which is a reflection of an even sharper contraction of imports than the reduction of
exports.

The 2010 budget: Addressing the transitory and permanent revenue shock

21.     On September 8th the Government sent its proposed fiscal package for 2010 to
Congress. The package consists of a revenue law, an expenditure decree and a document
describing the macroeconomic situation and main assumptions underlying the proposed
fiscal policy.

22.     The main macroeconomic assumption on which the budget estimates and
proposed policy measures are based include an economic growth for 2010 of 3.0 percent,
an average oil price for the Mexican mix of oil exports of US$ 53.9 per barrel and
reduction in the volume of oil production to 2,500 thousand barrels per day. On the basis
of these assumptions and an update of the 2009 budget implementation, the Government
estimates a shortfall in revenue in 2010, compared to the budget approved for 2009, of
374 billion pesos (2.9 percent of GDP). This shortfall is divided into a temporary or
transitory (tax) revenue shortfall attributed to a level of economic activity below potential
output and a more permanent or structural component due to a reduction in the volume of
oil production (see table 5).

23.     The Government proposes to cover the transitory shortfall to an amount of 155
billion pesos with non-recurrent revenue, 95 billion pesos, and additional deficit
financing, 60 billion pesos. The latter implies invoking, for the first time since its
adoption, a clause in the fiscal responsibility law that allows for a temporary deviation
from the balanced budget rule under extraordinary conditions.
24.     The Government strategy to cope with the revenue shortfall is based on
maintaining the level of programmable expenditure (excluding PEMEX investments) in
2010 similar, in real terms, to the level estimated by the end of 2009. For the years
thereafter the Government envisages to keep a constant expenditure to GDP ratio, thus
                                                                                           - 74 -
allowing for expenditure growth, in real terms, similar to the growth of economic
activity. Based on an expected return of the economy to its estimated longer term
potential output growth of 4.2 percent by 2012 and the income generating capacity of a
series of public revenue enhancing measures the Government foresees the need for
temporary deficit financing, attributed to a slack in economic activity, for a two-year
period, 2010 and 2011, while returning to a balanced budget by 2012.

25.    To cover the structural component of the revenue shortfall in 2010, 219 billion
pesos, the Government proposes a series of public revenue enhancing measures to an
amount of 176 billion pesos.

26.     Public revenue enhancing measures aim to broaden the tax base and are oriented
to enhance non-oil revenue through changes in the regime for excise taxes, income taxes
and the introduction of a new consumption based contribution. Proposed adjustments in
the area of excise taxes include the introduction of an excise tax on the use of
telecommunication services and an increase of the excise tax rate on tobacco, lotteries,
beer and alcoholic beverages. Modifications to the income tax regime include a
temporary increase of the top income tax rate from 28 to 30 percent for 2010 to 2012 and
gradually reducing the rate to 29 percent by 2013 and back to 28 percent by 2014. The
tax on cash deposits in the banking system (that was introduced in the 2007 tax reform to
capture revenue from the informal sector as the tax is creditable against the income tax)
will be increased from 2 to 3 percent while the threshold for exempt deposits is lowered
from 25,000 (about 15 minimum wages) to 15,000 pesos (about 9 minimum wages).

27.     The Government is also proposing to introduce a new tax, called the "contribution
to reduce poverty", on the consumption of all goods and services at a rate of 2 percent.
The Government expects to collect revenues of 72 billion pesos (0.6 percent of GDP)
from this tax in 2010 and these resources will be allocated, on a priority basis, to poverty
reduction programs--in particular conditional cash transfers and social protection
programs. Among the actions included in the Government program for 2010 that will be
supported by the adoption of the contribution are an increase in the budget allocation for
the Oportunidades and Food Support cash transfer programs by 31.5 billion pesos to a
total budget allocation for 2010 of 81.1 billion pesos in order to expand coverage to at
least 6.5 million families.



                                               - 75 -
28.    The proposed budget also includes a gradual increase in prices of publicly
supplied goods and services (largely electricity rates and gasoline prices), though does
not specify the exact amount of these increases. As these prices can be set by the
Government without an explicit approval by Congress, the Government may adjust the
increase following the outcome of budget discussion with Congress.

29.     Among the measures to close the permanent revenue shortfall, the Government
proposes a cut in programmable spending, 74 billion pesos or 0.6 percent of GDP. In
addition, a reallocation of programmable expenditure is required to create space within
the budget for increased pension payments and an expansion of the poverty reduction and
health coverage programs to an amount of 144 billion pesos. Both efforts demand a gross
reduction of 218 billion pesos in existing structures and programs of the federal public
administration. In addition to streamlining the public administration and a reduction of
operational and payroll expenditures, the Government plans to concentrate resources on
programs that are better aligned to the priorities of national development and on projects
and programs that have demonstrated better results and evaluations. Efforts to improve
the performance monitoring and evaluation capacity within the public administration over
the past few years are being used to guide this reduction and reallocation of expenditure.
This is discussed in greater detail below.

Medium term challenges to enhance fiscal rules and strengthen non-oil revenue

30.     The global financial crisis and its consequences on world economic activity and
trade have been transmitted to the Mexican economy and its public finances through
several channels. In this regard, fiscal policy in Mexico is formulated and implemented
in the face of three major revenue shocks: one due to a collapse of oil prices, a second as
a result of a sharp contraction of economic activity and the related drop in tax collection,
and a third related to an unexpectedly rapid reduction in the volume of oil production.
The first two of these shocks are related to the business cycle whereas the third is of a
more structural nature.

31.     The first two cyclically related shocks are being addressed through a set of fiscal
rules that are used to smooth public spending and reduce the pro-cyclical bias of fiscal
policy in Mexico, even though the exceptionally strong economic downturn in 2009 is
showing some of the limitations in the existing framework.

32.      The mechanism in the FRL to limit the impact on public spending of volatile oil
revenue as a result of the oil price volatility consists of two basic features: (a) a formula
to set the budget reference price for oil and (b) rules for the distribution of excess revenue
among different revenue stabilization funds and public investments.

33.     Until recently oil price forecasts used in Mexican budgets have been conservative
compared to actual prices (Figure 2). The formula that is used as of 2006 to set the
budget reference price of oil is based on a weighted average of the 10-year moving
average of the historical price of oil, the medium term futures oil price as well as the
price of oil on the next year's futures market. The weights given to each of these prices,


                                            - 76 -
25, 25 and 50 percent respectively tends to bias the reference price towards the prevailing
market price (OECD 2009).

34.    As elaborated further below, the combination of a budget reference price and the
use of (capped) stabilization funds as currently in place in Mexico protects public
spending during a budget year from a sharp fall in oil prices compared to the budget
reference price. It does not avoid the need for sharp fiscal adjustments in case of
reductions in the oil price beyond one year as currently observed in the budget process
for 2010. The reference price for oil in the proposed 2010 budget is 23 percent below the
reference price in 2009. A stronger smoothing of the inflow of oil resources into the
economy and public finance may require some further adjustments to the formula of
determining the budget reference price or the use of alternative institutional arrangements
such as independent expert panels as in the case of Chile.

35.     The institutional framework of setting a budget reference price should be
complemented with rules on the distribution of excess revenue and the creation of oil
stabilization funds. In principle, oil revenues that exceed the annual set reference price
would be transferred to the funds. However, despite a consistently higher actual price of
oil than the budget reference price up to and including 2008, savings accumulated in the
stabilization funds stood at 145 billion pesos or 1.2 percent of GDP at the end of 2008.
The limited accumulation of savings in the stabilization funds can be attributed to
deductions from the excess oil revenues to compensate other revenue shortfalls or higher-
than budgeted expenditures in specific categories of the budget and, more importantly, to
low caps established on the accumulation of resources in each of the funds. After
reaching the cap, as in 2008, further excess revenue is allocated to additional public
investment and transferred to a fund for the restructuring of pension systems.

36.     Caps on the accumulation of funds in the stabilization funds were almost doubled
in the amendments to the FRL in November 2008. Nevertheless, they remain remarkably
low compared to the challenge of reducing impact of volatility of oil prices on budget
spending. The Government is proposing to lift the limit on the accumulation of savings


                                           - 77 -
in the funds for 2010; though a more permanent action to raise the caps substantially or
lift them altogether would seem appropriate.

37.     Despite the limited accumulation of savings in the stabilization funds, the
Government successfully averted the negative impact of the collapse of oil prices (late
2008 and early 2009) on the budget in 2009. It was able to do so as it had contracted
mid-2008 oil price hedges for estimated net exports at the average budget price of 70
dollar per barrel, using resources from the federal Government's stabilization fund to
purchase the hedges. Thus it was able to offset the impact on the budget from a drop in
the oil price below the level estimated in the budget by leveraging the resources available
in the stabilization fund. Employment of such additional risk management instruments
should be encouraged though are no substitute for raising of the limits on the stabilization
funds.

38.     Another pillar of the FRL consists of the balanced budget rule. Rather than
encouraging a smoothing of public spending or countercyclical fiscal policies, the aim of
the balanced budget rule is to ensure fiscal sustainability. The rule itself has a bias
towards pro-cyclical fiscal policy as larger revenues during the upside of a cycle would
tend to be spent at the time they are collected (OECD 2009). Only the escape clause that
allows for additional deficit spending under exceptional social or economic conditions, as
proposed to be applied in 2010 and 2011, may reduce some of the pro-cyclicality of the
rule. The framework of the FRL does not establish a methodology to determine the
amount of deficit spending that can be incurred, nor does it establish to need to
compensate for deficit spending in bad times with the creation of a fiscal surplus in good
times. In this regard the FRL framework could benefit from the introduction of a
cyclically adjusted or structural budget balance rule.

39.     A decline in oil production from a record high in 2004 has been observed now for
a couple of years already (Figure 3) and can hardly be referred to as a shock. A tax
reform introduced in 2007 was aimed at broadening the non-oil tax base to start
compensating for a projected decline in oil production. Nevertheless, the recent decline
in oil production has been much steeper than anticipated. Over the past two years the
Government included production and export estimates in the budget documents between
100-200 thousand barrels per day above the levels of production actually attained.
Current Government estimates point at a stabilization of the levels of production at 2,500
thousand barrels per day between 2010 and 2015, though these estimates are surrounded
by a large margin of uncertainty. Increasing non-oil tax revenue, from a level as low as
10 percent of GDP, by broadening the tax base, reducing exemptions and improving tax
collection thus remains a high priority in order to reduce the dependence of Mexico's
public finance on highly uncertain and exhaustible oil revenues.

Public expenditure management to support fiscal policy efficiency and effectiveness

40.     Over the last decade the Government has made substantial progress in public
sector management reforms to produce a more efficient and effective public
administration. The Government improved its budgetary discipline by strengthening
fiscal planning and accountability to ensure compliance with revenue and expenditure
management rules throughout the public sector.

41.     The administration of President Calderon has framed its efforts to enhance the
efficiency, effectiveness and accountability of public spending in an expenditure
performance evaluation system, the Sistema de Evaluación del Desempeño (SED) which
establishes methodologies and policies on performance informed management and
performance informed budgeting.

42.     The overall objective of performance-informed budgeting (PIB) is to strengthen
the quality of public expenditures by improving the allocation, efficient use and
consistency of public resources in alignment with social and political priorities and goals.
Performance informed budgeting has also been designed to promote public sector
responsiveness and accountability to Congress and the public alike. The intermediate
objective is make performance information available to decision makers in a manner that
allows them to link it, albeit generally loosely, to planning and managerial actions so that
decisions are informed by performance measurements in addition to other sources of
information such as experience, qualitative information and political priorities.

43.     There are a number of necessary precursors to the successful implementation of
performance informed budgeting and the effective use of performance information in the
budget process. These include the development of program budgeting and the use of
medium term expenditure frameworks. The Government of Mexico has decided to
prioritize the implementation of these precursors by establishing a foundation to ensure

                                           - 79 -
overall accountability and compliance with public financial management requirements at
all three levels of government.

44.      In this respect, a Governmental Accounting Law was enacted on December 31,
2008 to establish accrual accounting and harmonization of the accounting standards
among the three levels of government (federal, state and municipal). The law has an
implementation horizon of three years and by 2012 the accounting norms, standards and
practices at all levels of governments should be harmonized and able to issue information
in real time.

45.   During the first year of implementation of the law the following actions were
completed:
  i. Creation and installation of the National Council for Accounting Harmonization
      and the Consultation Committee, both with their internal norms and regulations.
 ii. Development of the Conceptual Framework of the Governmental Accounting,
      Fundamentals of the Governmental Accounting and Norms and Methodologies
      for the Determination of the Expenditure Accounting Moments.

46.     Further steps to implement the mandates of the law include:
  i.    Harmonized budgetary classificatory
 ii.    Norms and Methodologies for the Determination of the Income Accounting
        Moments.
 iii.   Structure of the basic financial statements
 iv.    Guidelines for the physical-financial progress indicators (link to Federal public
        resources)
  v.    Main rules to register and value public goods
 vi.    Structure of accounting catalogs and accounting manuals

47.     The challenge to implement the Governmental Accounting Law within all the
three levels of government will depend on an adequate coordination across these levels of
government.

48.    Other actions carried out to date at the level of the Federal Government to further
the adoption and implementation of the SED includes:
   i. Adaption of the budgetary framework to identify the final use of public spending
       as well as link spending to strategic planning objectives for national
       development;
  ii. Institutionalization of new methods to define objectives, performance indicators
       and targets for the federal programs with the purpose to gradually incorporate
       performance information in budgetary decisions.
 iii. Development of IT systems to follow up targets established in the programs that
       integrate The Budget Law for the Federal Government
 iv. Definition and operation of mechanisms for all program evaluations established in
       the Annual Evaluation Program and to follow up the corresponding program
       improvement recommendations.



                                          - 80 -
49.    Specific progress in the implementation of the SED as reflected in the 2010
budget proposal includes:
   i. Alignment of the budgetary process to performance information across the budget
       cycle (Planning, Programming, Budgeting, Execution, Monitoring, Evaluation
       and Accountability).
  ii. Adjustment of the budgetary structure to integrate performance information. A
       specific module was created in order to reflect the alignment of the Federal
       Programs to sectoral strategic objectives and to the National Development Plan
       objectives.
 iii. Progress in the Indicators Results Matrices. Currently 58.7 percent of the
       budgetary programs integrate performance information and the target for 2012 is
       to increase this to 72.5 percent, whereas 11.6 percent of the budgetary programs
       have been evaluated in accordance with the criteria established in the annual
       evaluation program and the target is to increase this figure to 16.5 % by the end of
       2012.

50.     Consolidation of the performance informed budgeting at the federal level will
continue through the end of the current administration. Implementation of the SED, at
the different levels of Government, will require substantial coordination with the
subnational levels. States have initiated the process by establishing the corresponding
legal framework in terms of budget, expenditure and accounting. Some of them have
already approved the decree for the creation of the evaluations units and advanced the
formulation of performance indicators.

51.     The states' initiatives will be strengthened during 2010 particularly due to some
specific requirements of the General Accounting Law in terms of physical and financial
indicators. These efforts will build upon the progress achieved by the Federal
Government in the definition of specific methodologies to measure results that will be
very useful in a context of a harmonized framework for the programmatic budget
information.

Introduction

1.     Mexico´s financial sector appears sound and well supervised, but remains
underdeveloped relative to other high-middle income countries. In addition, the global
financial turbulence has had a substantial impact on Mexico´s financial markets and
financing alternatives for Mexican companies. For more than a decade, financial sector
policy has featured prominently in Mexico's development agenda with the dual objective
of promoting stability with access. Competition and access to finance gained greater
prominence as stability strengthened. In the wake of the global financial crisis, Mexico´s
government has moved quickly to mitigate new risks and stepped up financing support by
development finance institutions to prevent a sharp credit contraction that could further
weaken economic activity.

have grown in the past years, especially mandatory pensions, but remain relatively small

institutions in the sector and raise funds through capital markets or bank borrowing but
are not allowed to take deposits. They offer credit to consumers, SMEs, real estate
developers and home buyers and have played a particularly important role in the
mortgage sector.

5.       Total credit to private non-bank sector increased at double digit rates until mid-
2008 before the global turbulence heightened (Table 2). Consumer credit increased the
fastest, led by the credit card business, accounting for 25 percent of total bank credit to

about a fourth of total credit to the non-financial private sector (Table 2).

6.     Notwithstanding the above, many market segments remain underserved. Recent
surveys suggest that the percentage of the adult population with access to financial
services ranges from 45 percent to 60 percent. Many small and medium enterprises
(SMEs) continue to face difficulties in accessing finance, and availability of long-term
finance is scant, and most commercial bank lending tends to be short-term and costly
given high interest rates and commission charges. In addition, compensatory balances are
usually required to gain financing from Mexico's largest banks, with balance
requirements above 30 percent for SMEs. Uncertainty about the foreclosure process
under Mexican law means that lenders demand conservative collateral ratios or simply do
not consider weaker or smaller companies. By contrast, Mexico's large corporations face
a greater number of options, including access to domestic capital markets and external
financing (43 percent of total private corporate financial debt is external).

Impact of the International Financial Crisis

7.      The global financial turbulence at end-September 2008 had, as elsewhere,
significant effects on the Mexican financial markets. The deepening of the financial crisis
after the collapse of Lehman Brothers had two main effects: increased risk aversion
prompted investors to find more secure assets, and financial institutions embarked on a
deleveraging process, liquidating positions in several markets. Emerging countries--
among them Mexico--were particularly affected: spreads increased on sovereign and
corporate debt and exchange rates depreciated and became more volatile (See Figures
2(a-f) in Annex 4). As in other Latin American countries, the stock market experienced a
sharp fall (Figure 3).

8.      The financial markets turmoil has had a considerable impact on financing
alternatives for Mexican companies. Institutional investors shifted towards safer assets
and shortened the duration on their portfolios by selling longer-term assets, including

                                                       - 84 -
government bonds. Speculative derivative positions by several large Mexican
corporations caused unexpected commercial paper defaults as the peso depreciated,
damaging investors' confidence in the credit quality of local issuers, which experienced
difficulties in rolling-over maturing securities. The uncertainty caused by this event and
the global turmoil further increased risk aversion in domestic markets, and the
Government had to step in to facilitate the refinancing of corporate debt and to prevent a
collapse of the nascent mortgage backed security market (Section IV). Issuance of
domestic corporate bonds with maturities beyond one year declined by 87 percent in the
last quarter of 2008 and, during the first half of 2009, amounted to half the value issued
during the same period in 2008.

9.      Large companies are also finding fewer opportunities to issue debt abroad and
costs are substantially higher. In the first quarter of 2009, external issuances decreased by
15 percent. The cost of issuance in external markets experienced an average annual
increase of 570 basis points in 2008, reaching 1,200 points above the five-year US
Treasury bond rate at year-end. By April 2009, the spread had declined to about 800 basis
points but was about 4 times higher than prior to the crisis. Against this backdrop, large
corporations have turned to domestic banks for funding.

10.     Credit growth by domestic commercial banks virtually halted and decreased in
real terms in the second quarter of 2009. Commercial bank credit during the first half of
2009 was largely flat in real terms during the first half of the years versus compared to
almost double digit growth a year earlier, despite the reversal in the monetary policy
stance (Annex 2). Consumer credit has been most affected contracting by about 21
percent in real terms at the end of June 2009 compared to a year earlier. Interest rates
increased in the second half of 2008 due to constrained liquidity and the increased risk of
default of debtors. Although the expansive monetary policy brought down the TIEE by
375 basis point, average commercial loan rates have only declined by about 100 basis
points and stood at around 11 percent during the first half of 2009.

11.     Tighter credit conditions have made it harder for SMEs to secure bank financing
as large companies have resorted to domestic bank borrowing. The results of a Banco de
México survey conducted in the fourth quarter of 2008 indicated that about ¾ of survey
participants did not seek commercial bank credit. The primary reasons were higher
interest rates (49.8%), more restrictive lending conditions (44.8%), and deteriorating
economic conditions (37.5%). SMEs have been particularly affected since they now have
to compete with companies that formerly financed themselves abroad or in the domestic
capital markets. This is illustrated by the fact that the proportion of the loan portfolio
owed by the largest debtors has increased noticeably71. Loan maturities have also
declined. About 32 percent of the peso-denominated bank credit to enterprises had
maturities exceeding 90 days during the period October 2008-May 2009 compared to 40
percent during the first quarters of 2008.



71
  About 70 percent of the commercial loans granted by the 6th largest banks is owed by 1 percent of
debtors at end-May 2009 compared to 60 percent at end-September 2008.

                                                  - 85 -
In order to mitigate the effects of the global financial turbulence and prevent a collapse in
credit, the Central Bank eased monetary policy (see Annex 2) and the Ministry of
Finance supported the expansion of the balance sheet of development banks in a counter-
cyclical fashion as discussed in the next section.

Risks to the financial system

12.      Although current economic conditions heighten existing vulnerabilities,
Mexico's financial system appears sound and it is well supervised. To a large degree, this
results from public efforts implemented for more than a decade to enhance the legal and
regulatory framework and strengthen capacity to supervise the system. The main risks to
the financial sector arise from commercial banks, which dominate the system (Table 1).
Mexican commercial banks are currently well capitalized with capital adequacy ratios
above the required minimum (16.2 percent at the end of June 2009) and could withstand
further deterioration in their portfolios. Stress tests conducted by the CNBV72 indicate
that the solvency ratio for the banking system would remain well above the minimum
regulatory level of 8 percent. Some small banks, however, may have to increase capital or
merge with other stronger institutions. Nevetheless, the increase in loan loss provisions is
likely to impact their profitability. Return on equity went down from 21.1% in March
2008 to 11.2% in March 2009. Some of the medium and small banks exhibit great
concentration in their sources of funding.73

13.     The deterioration of the loan portfolio in the event of a severe economic downturn
poses the main risk to the financial system. Non-performing loans for the total banking
system were 3.8 percent in June 2009 versus 2.8 percent a year earlier (Table 3). The
fastest and strongest deterioration has been in consumer portfolios with average non-
performing loans of 9.5 percent of total loans as of June 2009 (7.0 percent in June 2008).
The CNBV has issued a new regulation modifying provision requirements for consumer
credits, using a prospective methodology that is better aligned to the Basel II framework
regarding expected losses. Amendments in the methodology include inter alia new

   The Comisión Nacional Bancaria y de Valores is responsable for supervising commercial banks and
securities markets.
73
   At end-March 2009 the ratio of liquid assets and assets maturing in 30 days to liabilities potentially due
in 30 days stood at about 200 percent, although there was wide disparity among banks, with some of them
(including one of the largest 6 banks) having a ratio below 100 percent.

                                                    - 86 -
parameters to determine the probability of default and measure expected losses within a
12-month period. The request of authorization to the CNBV for the use of internal
models will be allowed.

14.     The rate of non-performing loans in the commercial portfolio at the end-of-June
2009 was 2.0% but is likely to increase further as indicated by the number of credit rating
downgrades experienced by Mexican corporations during the year and the substantial
concentration of banks´ commercial portfolio in large firms. The 281 largest debtors
represent 50 percent of commercial banks´ credit in this segment. The downgrades are
limiting firms´ capacities to refinance their debt which could in turn result in defaults.

15.     Non-bank financial institutions are relatively small and unlikely to pose systemic
instability. Nevertheless some concerns persist regarding the health of some Sofoles and
Sofomes. The market for mortgage back securities, which had become an important
source of funding for Sofoles dried up at the end of 2008, and 2009 issues have been
scarce. Sofoles had difficulties in refinancing their debt, and two defaulted on their debt
in spring 2009. Guarantees by Sociedad Hipotecaria Federal (SHF) may have solved the
liquidity problems of the Sofoles in the near term, but there are concerns over the quality
of their portfolios. NPLs loans for the Sofoles surged to 7.5 percent in March 2009 from
3.8 percent in March 2008. Coverage rates have decreased and are much lower than for
commercial banks (43 percent in March 2009 versus 159 percent for commercial banks).
This could impact the Sofoles' solvency, with a capital-to-asset ratio of 10.6 percent as of
March 2009. The Government is working with Congress on legal reform proposal to
enhance the prudential and supervisory framework that applies to the Sofoles and
Sofomes.

Financial Sector Policy Interventions to Foster Stability and Access

16.      Financial sector policy has had a prominent role in Mexico's development agenda
with the dual objective of promoting stability and access to finance to support growth and
improve the living standards of the population. Early on, there was a greater policy focus
on financial stability. As the financial system became more resilient, policy attention
increasingly turned toward issues of competition and access without losing sight of the
importance of stability. The National Development Plan of 2007-2012 reconfirmed the
importance of broadening access without threatening stability. Overall the Government
has supported the objectives of stability, competition and access through a multi-pronged
strategy that encompasses improvements to the regulatory framework, a strengthening of
institutions responsible for financial markets oversight, and pro-active market access
policies through development finance institutions (DFIs). The last has been accompanied
by substantial improvements to the governance and institutional structure of DFIs.

Legal and Regulatory Changes to Strengthen Stability and Access

17.    Overall, the regulatory and institutional framework for financial markets and their
oversight has strengthened substantially during the current decade. A summary of the
main legal and regulatory changes implemented to promote stability and foster greater
market access and diversification of financing follows.

                                           - 87 -
    Strengthening Prudential Regulations and Market Transparency
·   Issuance of regulatory accounting standards in accordance with international
    accounting standards. (FSAP update 2006)
·   Issuance of regulations by the National Banking and Securities Commission (CNBV)
    to strengthen prudential requirements and risk management in the banking sector that
    cover inter alia (i) capital adequacy-based early warning indicators to trigger prompt
    corrective action; (ii) standards for external auditors and credit institutions in relation
    to the provision of external auditing services; and (iii) corporate governance
    requirements for integrated risk management of credit institutions.
·   Amendments to the Law of Credit Institutions (2004 and 2006) strengthening the
    framework for bank resolution. The first reform provides a modern system of early
    warnings and prompt corrective actions. The second reform provides cessation of
    payments as a trigger for bank resolution; provides for information exchange between
    relevant agencies; defines flexible options for closed-bank resolution based on the
    least cost criteria; and protects supervisors discharging their duties in good faith.
·   Issuance by CNBV of regulations to enhance market disclosure and transparency that
    cover inter alia financial reporting requirements for financial group holding
    companies that are subject to supervision by CNBV and harmonize the disclosure of
    financial information by credit institutions.
·   Enactment of a new Securities Markets Law (2005) that enhances governance by
    establishing inter alia the role and duties of the management and boards of listed
    companies and applicable sanctions (2005).

    Increasing Access, and Diversification of Financing and Investment Instruments

·   Enactment of a legal framework to regulate Credit Information Bureaus (2001) that
    broadened the universe of participating lenders, improved data timeliness, and
    strengthened the protection of personal data.
·   Enactment of a new Securities Market Law (2005) that enhances access to capital
    markets by inter alia creating new corporate vehicles to facilitate stock market listing
·   Amendments to the Pension System Laws in 2003 and 2007 increasing the number of
    pension funds that pension firms can manage from one to two and five, respectively,
    and expending the universe of instruments and assets classes that pension funds can
    invest in. These reforms have expanded financing sources for the private sector and,
    more importantly, have provided participants in the system with a wider set of
    portfolios to choose from according to their risk preferences and age.

    Enhancing Consumer Protection

·   Enactment of the Law on Transparency and Ordering of Financial Services (2004
    and 2007) that prohibited discriminatory practices between credit institutions and
    users; established transparency requirements in check account balances, credit and
    debit cards, and other credit instruments; and established transparent mechanisms to
    permit users of credit institutions to know about the value and fee of transactions.
    Broadly speaking, it entrusted CNBV with the regulation and supervision of
    marketing practices and issuance of general criteria on financial contracts offered by

                                            - 88 -
   regulated credit institutions to foster adequate services to consumers, and provided
   the National Commission for the Protection and Defense of Consumers of Financial
   Services (CONDUSEF) with similar criteria on non-regulated SOFOMEs.

In parallel to the aforementioned legal and regulatory changes, the Government continued
its efforts to enhance the capacity of agencies responsible for the oversight of financial
market institutions. As a result, oversight has greatly improved.

Fostering Access through Development Finance Institutions

18.     Substantial legal and institutional changes have taken place during the decade in
order to enhance the role and effectiveness of DFIs in facilitating the delivery of financial
services to underserved markets. The literature's thinking on development banks has
evolved over the last half century (Box 1), and to a large degree, the transformation of
Mexican policy towards development banks during this decade reflects the latest thinking
on development finance or the agency view. The latter recognizes that DFIs can be an
important channel to address market failures and respond to social mandates as long as
their interventions do not conflict with long-term market development (De la Torre,
Gozzi and Schmuckler 2006). Such interventions, however, do not come without
challenges. DFIs can be prone to resource misallocation (Banerjee 1997) unless a good
governance framework and the operational flexibility are in place to allow for
independent and professional management. Furthermore, DFIs can often face a tension
between their public policy mandate, which may require subsidies to reach the targeted
population, and the need to show a sound financial performance (De la Torre et al. 2006),
thus arguing for a clear separation of subsidies from financing (Box 1).

19.     Broadly speaking, the reform of DFIs in Mexico has taken into account the
concerns and guiding principles provided in the DFI literature, but the pace of
transformation has changed across institutions. Overall, an important rationalization of
DFIs has occurred during this decade resulting in a reduction in the number of DFIs from
[12] to six through mergers and the closure of poorly performing institutions. For the
most part, the focus has changed from first tier (direct financing) to second tier financing
through other market intermediaries. The six DFIs broadly support the development of
different financial market segments (productive sector, trade finance, infrastructure
finance, rural finance, and housing finance), but there is some degree of overlap in a few
cases. The legal mandates of the recently created DFIs (Sociedad Hipotecaria Federal,
Bansefi and Financiera Rural), which were created in the early 2000s, incorporate the
new thinking on development finance and tend to be more precise compared to the
mandates of Nafin, Bancomext, and Banobras with a far longer history.

20.    In 2002, the Credit Institutions Law and the charters of development banks were
amended to establish that the objective of DFIs is to promote the development of the
productive sectors, while maintaining their capital, and offered them greater autonomy of
operation in exchange for improved governance and accountability. Three changes were
incorporated to strengthen governance. First, the independence of their Boards was



                                           - 89 -
enhanced through the mandatory participation of two independent and qualified
members.74 The Treasury Secretary is always the chairman of the board, and two-thirds
of the boards are represented by various departments of the federal government. Second,
disclosure and transparency was strengthened with the annual submission of operational
and financial plans to the Government and Congress. Third, a risk management
committee was created at each institution through a regulation issued by the CNBV.
Although exceptions apply, there has been a general tendency to change the pricing of
products to better reflect costs. Guarantees of market products with higher risks and a
social or market failure rationale are supported by counter-guarantee funds directly
financed from the Federal Government in order to make subsidies more transparent and
allay the tension between the need to maintain a sound financial performance and fulfill
specific policy objectives.

21.     Broadly speaking, governance changes and other institutional reforms have
contributed to improvements in the overall financial performance of DFIs. Development
banks have maintained capital levels above the regulatory minimum, which is the same as
that of commercial banks. The net capital to risk weighted assets indicator presents a
large spread among institutions, with the lowest at 12.5 percent for SHF and the highest
at 27 for Bansefi. Return on assets has varied over time and among the development
banks, with the highest variation experienced by Banobras and Bancomext, both showing
positive positions in 2008. Margins of intermediation tend to be thin reflecting the tension
between profitability and their public policy mandate.

22.     Delinquency rates have been on a downward trend until 2008, and there is a good
coverage ratio of non-performing loans. The ratio of NPLs to total loans had been
dropping for all development banks and in particular for Bancomext that saw a decrease
from about 11% in December 2006 to 1.7% in 2008, as reported by the CNBV. However,
March 2009 reported figures suggest a slight increase in NPLs for Bancomext and SHF
close to 2%. All others remained below 0.5%. In terms of loan loss reserves to NPLs,
these range from 254 percent for Banjercito to 1,228 for Nafin in March 2009. SHF saw a
big decrease from 1,556 percent in December 2008 to 519 in March 2009, while
Bancomext also experienced a small, but not significant, decrease.

Policy Responses to the Global Financial Crisis

23.     In the wake of the global financial crisis, the Government has sustained the
overall policy direction laid in the National Development Plan of fostering access to
finance with stability but has moved quickly to mitigate risks exposed by the global crisis
through regulatory changes and a more active role played by DFIs to prevent a sharp
credit contraction by private financial institutions.




74
   Shareholding is divided in two types of shares: A shares (66% of total) can only be held by the
Government and B shares can be held by the public but in practice are held by the Government. The former
are always represented by public officials, while the latter might be represented by non-government
officials but appointed by the Federal Government.

Legal and Regulatory Reforms

24.     The most important regulatory reforms implemented in 2009 address (i) the
protection of consumers of financial services, (ii) provision of banking services through
third agents, and (iii) market transparency. Some prudential regulations were also
enhanced. The global financial crisis brought to the fore the importance of fostering
access to finance together with adequate consumer information. The enactment of the
Law on Transparency and Ordering of Financial Services in 2007 constituted a positive
step. The Law entrusted the CNBV with the issuance of criteria on acceptable practices
by regulated credit institutions for consumer information and marketing, and its
supervision and enforcement; and similar provisions to CONDUSEF in regard to non-
regulated SOFOMEs. Accordingly, the CNBV issued regulations on consumer
information and started to develop the capacity to supervise them, but its main focus
remained on financial stability. The global financial crisis exposed the difficulties and
greater urgency of addressing issues related to the protection of consumers of financial
services and decided to entrust this responsibility to a specialized agency CONDUSEF75.

25.      In this spirit, the Law Protecting and Defending Users of Financial Services was
amended in June 2009. CONDUSEF will be responsible for (i) educating users of
financial services, (ii) promoting an equal and fair relationship between financial
institutions and its users, (iii) informing the public on services provided by financial
institutions (including costs and quality of services, and level of claims raised by
consumers against financial institutions), (iv) facilitating arbitration services between
financial institutions and users, (v) requiring financing institutions to take adequate
measures to prevent or address business practices that impair consumers´ rights; and (vi)
regulating marketing practices and financial contracts of credit institutions in order to
ensure that consumers are aware of their rights and responsibilities. The institution was
already responsible for items (i) to (iv) above prior to 2008, but the lack of capacity to
penalize institutions severely constrained its effectiveness. The legal reform addresses
these gaps by expanding CONDUSEF´s capacities to regulate, supervise (including
capacity to visit premises), and issue penalties. The institution will face the challenge of
balancing the two attributions of arbitrage and regulation. The CNBV will no longer be
responsible for regulating marketing and contracts of credit institutions with regard to
consumer protection. The Federal Government will issue a secondary regulation defining
in greater detail the scope of supervisory responsibilities and capacities of CONDUSEF.
The law envisages a transition period of 180 days for the new [regulatory] authorities to
become effective. The institution is currently developing an institutional strengthening
plan to meet the new challenges.

26.    The Law on Credit Institutions was amended in June 2009 to facilitate the
development of new, secure and cost-effective channels to extend financial services to
underserved market segments. The legal reforms will allow banking institutions to

  CONDUSEF´s Board is comprised of a representative from SHCP, a representative from Bank of
Mexico, a representative from each of the financial supervisory agencies, and three representatives from the
National Consultative Council. CONDUSEF´s president will participate with voice but no vote.

                                                  - 91 -
     contract third parties (e.g., retail chains and retail stores) in order to provide services
     (deposit taking, payments, transfers, and receipt of documentation to open a bank account
     or request a credit) on behalf of the bank. These new channels could greatly expand the
     "outreach of banking institutions" which is currently limited, especially in the Southern
     part of the country (see Figures 5 and 6.) The bank will retain at all times the
     responsibility over the transactions conducted vis-à-vis the customer, while the agent will
     only provide a transactional channel. This provision is critical to provide certainty to
     transactions and minimize the risks to the population using these services. Tight
     requirements have been imposed on banking institutions that provide services through
     agents and banking institutions that contract them will be liable and penalized for the
     non-compliance of the former. An agent will be able to provide services to more than one
     bank in order to encourage a more competitive market. The CNBV has already issued
     regulations detailing operational requirements for agent banking and allowing
     correspondent banking through networks. At least nine banking institutions have already
     submitted a request to CNBV to provide these services. Complementing the above, the
     [Anti-money Laundering Law was amended in May 2009] provides a simplified regime
     for the opening and operation of low value bank accounts. The CNBV plans to issue soon
     a new regulation allowing the use of mobile phones for transaction payments of low
     value.

     27.      The Capital Markets Law (Article 104) was amended in May 2009 to address the
     lack of transparency concerning derivative instruments used by market issuers. As noted
     earlier, speculative derivative positions by several large Mexican corporations generated
     commercial paper defaults in October 2008 that severely heightened risk aversion and
     nearly brought to a halt the commercial paper market. To address this serious gap, restore
     market confidence, and prevent similar situations in the future, the reform to the Capital
     Markets Law requires market issuers to inform on their derivative positions, including
     payment conditions and the possible contingencies that such positions imply on the
     issuer's financial position. The CNBV also issued a regulation establishing new reserve
     requirements for consumer lending provisions which require estimates on expected losses
     to be determined on a forward looking-basis. Banking institutions will have the choice to

                                               - 92 -
absorb the new requirements as a one-time charge or spread it on a monthly basis over a
one-year period.

28.     The transparency and accountability of development banks and trust funds was
improved through amendments to the Law of Credit Institutions in May 2009.
Strengthening the accountability framework was important given the increased role
played by development banks in the context of the global crisis and heightened risk
aversion by the private sector as discussed below. The three main changes: (i)
development trust funds will have to submit annual operational and financial plans to
Congress through the Government (as development banks) currently do; (ii) development
banks and development trust funds will have to publish indicators measuring their
services to their target populations according to guidelines to be issued by the SHCP; and
(iii) the SHCP will have to conduct and publish two independent evaluations on
development banks or development trust funds that will include inter alia an assessment
of how these institutions are meeting the access to finance objectives defined in their
organic laws and their coordination activities with other public institutions to promote a
more efficient use of public resources. The first two independent evaluations concerning
the operations of Bansefi and SHF will be presented to Congress in April 2010. The
CNBV also issued a regulation that can allow, on a case by case basis, temporary
increases in the credit concentration ratio of DFIs. While this could increase the risk
exposure of DFIs, the risk is partially mitigated by the fact this is a temporary measure
with a sunset clause and that the performance of these institutions will be supervised by
the CNBV.

New Counter-cyclical Measures Implemented through Development Finance
Institutions

29.     In parallel to the above regulatory measures, DFIs have expanded financing
activities to prevent a sharp credit crunch in light of deleveraging and increased risk
aversion by private financial agents. From September 2008 through June 2009, the credit
portfolio supported (directly or indirectly) by development banks76 had increased by 38%
in real terms--equivalent to an annual growth rate of 53% (Figure 7). By June 2009, the
(direct and indirect) credit portfolio of development banks was equivalent to 47% of
commercial bank credit extended to the business sector, housing and infrastructure
compared to 36% in September 2008.




76
     Indirect support includes loan and commercial paper guarantees.

30.     Nafin and Bancomext launched an emergency program guaranteeing up to 50% of
commercial paper issued by corporations meeting minimum credit rating benchmarks.
This program was critical in preventing the "drying up" of the commercial paper market,
which is actively used by Mexico's corporate sector. The program was retrenched in July
2009 as activity in this market picked up again. Bancomext provided direct lending to
large corporations experiencing refinancing difficulties in capital markets and
overcollateralized credits to protect the quality of its portfolio. In addition, NAFIN and
Bancomext expanded their support to SME finance through both guarantees and credit
lines provided to qualified financial intermediaries. Producers in the rural sector also
benefitted from expanded financing by FIRA and Financiera Rural. December 2008
compared to December 2006.

31.      In the infrastructure sector, Banobras increased financing to support the
development of new infrastructure projects and prevent the disruption of existing ones
due to sponsors' lack of access to private financing. In the housing sector, SHF stepped in
to facilitate the flow of credit to mortgage originating institutions (Sofoles and Sofomes)
and prevent a collapse of the nascent residential mortgage-backed security market. The
institution has also continued to maintain an emphasis on credit provision to households
earning less than 6 minimum wages.

Medium-term Policy trends

32.      The Government intends to continue promoting the access to finance with
stability agenda in the medium term. To this end, a number of proposals are already
underway. The Government is drafting proposals to establish a more agile and suitable
framework for bank liquidation. The current legal framework requires a judicial
bankruptcy procedure which is slow and cumbersome.


                                               - 94 -
33.      It is also collaborating with Congress on a proposal to establish a stronger
regulatory framework for specialized financial institutions (known by the acronyms of
Sofoles and Sofomes). These reforms are in response to recent defaults on unsecured debt
by two larger Sofoles noted above. While these institutions do not currently present a
systematic risk, the authorities would like to prevent regulatory arbitrage and establish a
more adequate regulatory framework under which they can expand. Currently, only
Sofomes related to banks and financial groups are regulated by the CNBV. The proposal
expands the regulatory and supervisory framework to Sofomes that finance their
operations through capital markets and those related by ownership to savings
institutions.77 It establishes a broad prudential framework entrusting the CNBV with the
issuance of more detailed regulations. 78 In regard to ownership links, however, the
proposal sets a more precise definition to avoid regulatory arbitrage. In addition, it
defines a process for the authorization and cancellation of a Sofome license and sanctions
that would apply in case of non-compliance with the regulatory framework. The safety
net framework that would apply to these institutions may need further clarification.
Sofomes would be allowed a transition period to adapt to the new framework. Sofoles
could apply for a license to become a regulated Sofome.

34.    The Government has also presented to Congress a draft proposal to foster a more
competitive retail payment system. Further prudential changes on capital adequacy,
leveraging and other critical issues area also expected over the coming years in the
context of the G-20 Framework Agreement. In addition, the Government is planning to
develop a system and a set of indicators to measure access to finance on a regular basis
and monitor the impact of its policies.

35.     The financial sector agenda envisages the continued institutional strengthening of
DFIs and the merger of NAFIN, Bancomext and the Mining Trust Fund to profit from
synergies. The first steps in this direction were already undertaken in 2007 by appointing
the same Director General to both institutions. The two institutions also share a number
of other key senior management appointments (e.g., Treasurer).




     77
          Other Sofomes may apply for the license of regulated Sofome or remain unregulated.
78
  Those linked to savings institutions would have to comply with the regulatory provisions applying to
savings institutions.

Recent evolution of labor market indicators

1.      Historically, the Mexican labor market has been characterized by a low level of
unemployment, yet high persistent rates of informality. Values of informal employment
vary by source and definition. Figure 1 depicts informal employment defined in terms of
lack of social security coverage from two distinct sources.79 Informal employment has
persistently represented over half of total employment since the beginning of the 90s.

2.     In the past two decades, unemployment has peaked during economic contractions
(reaching its highest rate of 7.4 percent during the 1995 Tequila Crisis) while informality
has shown upward and downward trends during periods of growth in the economy
(Figure 1). The international crisis has produced a deep contraction of Mexico's GDP and
a consequent increase in both unemployment and informality. Zooming-in on recent
monthly data (from 2006 to the present) reveals a synchronized deterioration of labor
market indicators, namely a decline in participation and a rise in unemployment
commencing in the last quarter of 2008 (Figures 2 and 3). Between September 2008 and
June 2009, the number of workers affiliated to the Social Security System (IMSS)
declined by nearly 700,000. The unemployment rate reached 6.28 percent in August
2009, the highest figure since February 1996 in the aftermath of the Tequila crisis.

3.       The recent deterioration of labor market performance is further illustrated by the
destruction in net jobs, which amounted to half a million jobs between June 2008 and
June 2009. In the case of non-salaried labor, the largest net destruction occurred at the
time of the outbreak of the crisis: over 1,200,000 net jobs were lost in the fourth quarter
of 2008 (Figure 4). This loss surpassed the diminishing net job creation of salaried jobs
(around half a million), which led to a large net job destruction of more than seven
hundred thousand jobs by the end of 2008. The first quarter of 2009 showed a further net
destruction of non-salaried jobs, which again surpassed the almost flat net growth of
salaried jobs (around 50 thousand). In the second quarter of 2009, with the additional
shock of the AH1N1-flu outbreak, there is a net job destruction of salaried jobs for the
first time, which was compounded by the continued (although smaller) destruction in
non-salaried jobs.

4.      Linked to the slow growth of formal employment, two other prominent features of
the Mexican labor market have been slow growth in labor productivity and in real wages.
Total labor productivity, in terms of GDP per worker, declined throughout the 1980's and
remained stagnant until the middle of the nineties, presenting a sharp drop in 1995 due to
the crisis. Average labor productivity has subsequently grown in most economic sectors
(Figure 5).

5.      The agriculture and manufacturing sectors are mainly accountable for the recent
improvement in productivity. Yet, the sustained improvement in these two sectors due to
technological gains has been cancelled out to some extent by the poor performance in the
services sector, which concentrates a significant proportion of the Mexican informal work
force (Figure 5). Low productivity in sectors with large shares of informal labor is due to
the low investment in technology adoption and worker training in these sectors (Levy,
2008). To make matters worse, the service sector has been largely responsible for job
creation in Mexico since the early nineties (3 out of every 4 new jobs were created in the
service sector) causing a notable negative impact on overall average labor productivity
(Pagés and Scarpetta, 2007).

6.     The trends in real wages also show modest growth rates in recent years. Despite
improvement in a few sectors (e.g., financial services and extractive industries) real
wages have recovered at a sluggish pace following the crisis of the mid-nineties (Figure
6). More recent monthly wage data indicates that the service sector has endured a severe
decline in real wages since early 2008, whereas wages in the manufacturing sector, which
maintained their real value for most of 2008, have started to record declines in 2009
(Figure 7)

7.      In summary, the international crisis has produced a severe shock to the Mexican
labor market through an important rise in unemployment rates and a decline in the labor
participation rate. For the year ending in June 2009, Mexico has lost more than half a
million jobs, and the number of unemployed has risen by more than seven hundred
thousand. The sharp deterioration of the labor market follows a period of sluggish wage
growth in most sectors and has led to an important recent fall in real wages in some
sectors.

Labor policies to confront the international crisis in Mexico

8.     The most important policy reaction to the global crisis by the Mexican
Government is the National Agreement in Favor of the Family Economy and
Employment (ANFEFE--Acuerdo Nacional a Favor de la Economía Familiar y el
Empleo). This agreement was prepared during the last quarter of 2008 by the Office of
President Calderón. Concerned about the depth of the global crisis, the Office of the

                                               - 101 -
President initiated a series of consultations with the most important sectors of the
Mexican economy and society, so that a concerted response to the adverse economic
environment could be convened.

9.       On January 7, 2009, President Calderón announced to the Nation the content of
the agreement. It contained a series of policy actions to be adopted by the Federal
Government during fiscal year 2009, as well as a string of commitments on the part of
several public and private Mexican institutions (inter alia the Federal Government, the
Congress of the Union, heads of the Executive of Federal States, and labor and business
organizations). The agreement was signed by a large set of high-ranking officials of these
institutions.

10.     Policy actions by the Federal Government included in the agreement are grouped
into five pillars. The first pillar, Employment and Workers´ Support (Apoyo al Empleo y
a los Trabajadores) includes specific actions to create employment and provide support
to the unemployed. The second, Support to Mexican Families (Apoyo a las Familias
Mexicanas) introduces price subsidies and income support to protect household
consumption and sustain households' disposable income. Third, Support to Industry and
SMEs (Apoyo a la Industria y a las Pequeñas y Medianas Empresas) provides facilities
for new capital investment. Fourth, Infrastructure Investment for Competitiveness and
Employment (Inversión en Infraestructura para la Competitividad y el Empleo) is the
main fiscal impulse investment program of the agreement. And, fifth, Transparent,
Efficient and Timely Public Expenditures (Gasto Público Transparente, Eficiente y
Oportuno) includes a set of administrative measures to promote more efficient and
expedite government expenditures.

11.     Although pillars three and four are expected to have an indirect impact on
employment creation, the first pillar focuses on labor policy measures. This pillar has the
explicit objective of "...adopting specific actions to promote more employment both in
the public and private sector ... as well as concrete measures to provide support to those
who lose their job..."80 This pillar contains five components (Table 1). In addition to the
ANFEFE, the Government has prepared a proposal to reform the Labor Labor and
address structural issues affecting the labor market.

12.     The Employment support pillar of the ANFEFE agreement is a combination of
both active and passive labor market policies, which are further discussed below. The
Mexican Government has taken advantage of the recent modernization and improved
effectiveness of existing programs to elicit a rapid response to the crisis. Some
components have a temporary nature (extension of health and maternity benefits to the
unemployed and wage subsidies paid by the Federal Government to employees exposed
to temporary suspension of work or "paros técnicos"), whereas others have a more
permanent character (the expansion of the Temporary Employment Program and the
National Employment Service as well as withdrawals from retirement savings accounts).

13.     The reorganization and expansion of active and passive labor market policies is an
important step to strengthen institutional mechanisms for dealing with cyclical or
structural shocks. Despite having most of the standard labor market policy instruments,
Mexico´s expenditure in these tools has been very low by comparison to other OECD
countries (OECD, 2009).

Active labor market policies in Mexico

14.    Active labor market policies (ALMPs) directly promote the creation of jobs
among the unemployed and underemployed. In Mexico, the National Employment
Service (SNE) constitutes the overarching umbrella for implementing ALMPs, including
programs for information and networking, training and temporary public employment.
ALMPs under the Employment pillar of the ANFEFE have concentrated on the
expansion of the SNE resources and its services.

15.     The National Employment Service: The National Employment Service (SNE)
constitutes an overarching umbrella of labor services offered by the Ministry of Labor
and Social Provision. Since it was first launched in 1978, the national system of labor
services has undergone several changes to its complex structure. It currently encompasses
5 separate strategies: (i) a host of job networking services (Servicios de Vinculación
Laboral - SVL); (ii) the Employment Support Program (Programa de Apoyo al Empleo-
PAE); (iii) the Employment Fostering Program (Programa de Fomento al Empleo -
PFE); (iv) the Support Program for emerging workers in the Services Sector (Programa
de Apoyo Emergente a los Trabajadores del Sector Servicios ­ PAETTSS); and (v) the
Temporary Employment Program (Programa de Empleo Temporal- PET), which is

further discussed below. Figure 8 shows the distribution of individuals serviced and
placements for 2009 among the 5 programs which conform the SNE.

16.     The SNE has expanded its budget by 34 percent between January to August 2009
compared to the same period a year earlier, and its coverage (in terms of individuals
serviced81) by 19 percent during the same period (Table 2). By August 2009, the program
had already executed 80 percent of the budget committed in the ANFEFE for 2009

 17. The Temporary Employment Program: The Temporary Employment Program
 (PET) was originally launched in 1995 in response to the economic crisis of the times
 and operated in the rural area exclusively. Initially, the program was jointly managed by
 the Ministry of Communications and Transport (SCT) and the Ministry of Social
 Development (SEDESOL). Subsequently, the Ministry of Environment and Natural
 Resources (SEMARNAT) and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development
 (SAGARPA) also joined in program management. From 2001 on, the participation of
 the SAGARPA was gradually diminished and phased out in 2009, when the STPS was
 granted responsibility for its coordination to better integrate it with other labor market
 policies. The PET is currently administered and financed jointly by three ministries:
 Social Development (SEDESOL); SEMARNAT; and Transport and Communications
 (SCT). Broadly speaking, the reorganization of the PET around the coordination of the
 STPS will help focus the program on its job creation goal and direct resources to those
 areas where unemployment rates are higher. This will make the program a more
 complete mechanism of income compensation helping not only areas with problems of
 poverty or temporary, adverse weather conditions, but also localities with
 unemployment shocks.

 18. Along with the institutional changes, several other modifications were introduced
 in an effort to enhance the program's effectiveness and targeting. The most important
 changes are (i) the PET's extension to the urban areas, targeting those with the highest
 rates of unemployment; (ii) the participation of the SNE as an important channel to


81
  However, the coverage measured in terms in of the actual placements or jobs preserved has remained
nearly unchanged (in fact it fell by 0.4% between 2008 and 2009).

 information under one coordinated strategy; (iv) the increased frequency of results'
 publications and coordination committee gatherings; and (v) the program's systematic
 evaluation82.

19.     Following administrative reforms and further efforts to improve targeting, the
Government increased the budgetary allocation for 2009. Figure 9 along with Table 3 and
Table 4 present the PET's coverage and expenditure figures for 2009 disaggregated by
ministries. Currently, the SCT is responsible for more than half of the program's budget
and beneficiaries (55 and 56 percent correspondingly). The figures show the PET has
indeed expanded its budget execution by 157 percent during the period January-June
2009 compared to the same period in 2008, and 83 percent of the 2009 budget allocation
had been executed by September 2009.

Passive labor market policies

20.     Passive labor market policies aim at sustaining the standard of living of
individuals, when they are not employed. The Employment pillar of the ANFEFE
comprises to passive labor market measures: i) expanded withdrawals from pension
savings accounts for unemployed workers and ii) extended coverage of health and
maternity benefits for unemployed workers who contributed to the system. The latter is a
temporary measure that protects workers and their families during what can be expected
to have been the worst period of the crisis (first and second quarters of 2009). The former
is a permanent change with more substantive implications.

21.     Withdrawals from mandatory retirement savings accounts for the unemployed:
Mexico does not have a conventional unemployment insurance mechanism that
constitutes the bulk of passive labor policies in OECD countries. However, the reform of
the Social Security System that created individual pension accounts had a provision for
withdrawing a limited amount of resources in the event of unemployment. In this regard,
Mexico has a quasi-form of what is called Unemployment Insurance Savings Accounts
(UISAs).83 UISAs are an unemployment protection mechanism that is not based on
pooling risks through collection of contributions from employers and employees with
different propensities to unemployment. Instead, it is an individual savings account (with
or without public funding) from which individuals can withdraw resources when out of
work. This type of mechanisms has also been adopted in other countries (e.g. Chile,
Brazil, and Sri Lanka among others). The Mexican provision, however, does not consist

     See Vodopivec (2008)

                                                  - 107 -
of a separate savings account but allows contributors to make limited use of savings from
their pension account.

22.     The recent reform of the Social Security Law facilitated and expanded the use of
individual retirement accounts by introducing two fundamental changes. First, the
maximum withdrawal was raised to the lowest between 90 days of salary or 11.5 percent
of the accumulated savings compared to the lowest between 75 days or 10 percent of the
savings stock prior to the reform. This provision applies to workers with more than five
years of contributions (not necessarily continuous). Second, the number of contributions
necessary for being eligible was reduced from five to three years (non-consecutive in
both cases). Workers with more than three years but less than five years are allowed to
withdraw up to 30 days of salary. The requisite number of days unemployed remains at
46 as certified by the IMSS, and the facility cannot be used again for another five years.

23.    Preliminary information about the use of the facility shows that the take up rate by
unemployed workers has increased dramatically (Table 5). As the Mexican economy
worsened during 2008, the number of workers withdrawing from the accounts rose
surpassing 56,000 in December 2008 compared to about 36,000 in January 2008.
Following the reform in May 2009, the number of account holders grew by nearly 40
percent in only one month.

24.     The reform allowed the Government to instrument a rapid response to an
increasing problem of unemployment due to the international crisis. However, the limited
nature of the compensation in terms of coverage (nearly eight hundred thousand of
beneficiaries for a total number of unemployed around 2.3 million, by August 2009),
duration of the benefit (only once every five years) and replacement rate (up to 50
percent of basic wage for up to six months) calls for a reconsideration of the

                                                - 108 -
unemployment protection mechanisms in Mexico. Most concerning, the current scheme
poses a high threat of eroding workers' pension funds in the long run. This risk is
specially born by those workers most vulnerable to suffer long periods of unemployment.
In this context, the current reform is an indication of the need for more flexible and
dynamic forms of income protection, beyond the current unemployment withdrawals
provision in the Social Security Law and the conventional severance payments in the
Federal Labor Law.

Proposal to reform the Federal Labor Law

25.     On February 9th, 2009, the Mexican Labor Secretary, Javier Lozano, presented a
proposal to reform the Mexican Federal Labor Law (LFT). This proposal currently
constitutes the seventh point in President Calderon's Decálogo para Cambiar de Fondo
a México presented in the Government's Third Official Report (`Tercer Informe de
Gobierno') in September 2008. The proposed reform to the labor bill is not presented as
an exclusive initiative of the current Administration, but rather as a synthesis of over 250
different initiatives presented to Congress during the last eleven years. It is an effort to
find common ground between employers and employees and the result of the STPS's
consultation efforts with diverse stakeholders (i.e., employers and unions). The proposal
was officially presented at the forum "Mexico ante la Crisis: ¿Qué hacer para Crecer"
organized by the Senate and the Chamber of Representatives (H. Congreso de la Unión)
in February 2009.

26.    The reform bill addresses inter alia three important issues. First, it proposes the
introduction of new types of contracts, which can potentially expand the size of formal
employment among some groups of workers. Second, the proposal includes several
provisions to expedite the resolution of labor conflicts of the Juntas de Conciliacion y
Arbitraje (JCA), which may alter significantly the costs of labor disputes. Third, the
reform bill attempts to address the issue of enhancing productivity growth through
mandatory employer-provided training and through Productivity Councils (Comisiones
Mixtas de Productividad, Capacitacion y Adiestramiento). Additionally, there are a series
of new stipulations regarding the work of women, children and disabled workers as well
as migrants and indigenous population.

27.     A World Bank analysis of the reform proposal84 indicates that the proposal
contains elements that constitute an initial positive step. Further significant changes to
labor regulations will be needed to eliminate persisting distortions and inefficiencies
present in the Mexican labor market. Notwithstanding this, the LFT was originally
published in April 1970, and few substantial changes have been introduced for nearly 40
years. In this context, the reform proposal is a credit-worthy effort that could potentially
set the stage for a reform process to address the core issues affecting the labor market in
several stages.

Conclusion

28.     The Government of Mexico has adopted a series of measures that indicate an
important effort to both deal with the cyclical impact of the international crisis and lay
the ground for stronger labor market policy instruments to face future cyclical and
structural shocks. It has also shown clear intentions to continue strengthening its labor
market institutions and has expressed its commitment to submit a proposal to reform the
Federal Labor Law in the near future. Even though the scope of the current proposal may
be limited, its direction is correct. The eventual approval by Congress of a reform to the
Labor Law could prove the first step in a series of reforms to modernize labor legislation
in Mexico.

2.      The performance of Mexico's foreign trade                 Mexico's total exports
is closely linked to exports to the United States                 Mexico´s Exports to the U.S.
(Figure 1). The United States economy represents Source: Ministry of Economy
the destination of 80 percent of total Mexican
merchandise exports. While exports to the U.S. fell 29 percent in this period, exports to
Latin America and the European Union led the decline in Mexican exports (Table 1).
Because of its close economic links to the U.S. economy, the recovery of Mexican's
exports depends on the evolution of the crisis in the United States.

3.     Mexican's exports to the U.S. are relatively concentrated in a few products
categories. Five categories of the Harmonized Tariff System (HTS) represent 74 percent
of Mexico exports to the United States. These categories are: (i) electrical machinery and
equipment and parts thereof; sound recorders and reproducers, television recorders and
reproducers, parts and accessories (24.7 percent); (ii) mineral fuels, mineral oils and
products of their distillation; bituminous substances; mineral waxes (19.7 percent); (iii)
vehicles, other than railway or tramway rolling stock, and parts and accessories thereof
(14.9 percent); (iv) nuclear reactors, boilers, machinery and mechanical appliances; parts
thereof (11.4 percent); and (v) optical, photographic, cinematographic, measuring,
checking, precision, medical or surgical instruments and apparatus; parts and accessories
thereof (3.5 percent). Among U.S. imports, the most affected categories were oil and
vehicles that faced a contraction of 50 percent and 43.5 percent, respectively (Table 2).

4.    In the first and second quarters of 2009, imports contracted by 27.6 percent and
more than 30 percent, respectively. All three product categories (consumption,

                                                              - 113 -
intermediate, and capital goods) have been severely affected falling by 39.9 percent; 32.5
percent; and 30.1 percent, respectively, during the second quarter of the year. Unlike
others countries, Mexico's has not actively used trade instruments as a response to the
international crisis.

Mexico's integration process into the world economy

5.      The severe impacts of the international crisis in Mexico's trade reflect its deep
integration to the world economy in general and to the U.S. market in particular. In the
mid-eighties, as response to the debt crisis, Mexico undertook an in depth unilateral
reform process that included its trade liberalization and accession to the GATT.
According to the OECD, integration was an issue for Mexico's growth before the 1990s,
but because of the liberalization reforms undertaken in the 1980s and 1990s, lack of trade
integration has ceased to be a major hindrance to growth for Mexico (OECD, 2009)86.

6.      After a comprehensive unilateral liberalization process, Mexico adopted an active
policy of trade negotiations that began with the signing of NAFTA and has continued
until now. NAFTA was the first free trade agreement negotiated between a developing
and two developed countries and established a new standard for trade liberalization that
has been replicated--with some adjustments and updates--in a number of bilateral
negotiations in different regions. So far, Mexico has concluded 12 preferential
agreements with 44 countries, including the United States, the European Union, and
Japan.

7.      The Mexican Government is currently assessing its trade strategy towards the
Asia-Pacific region and other emerging markets. The aim in the former case is to
establish a coherent approach towards the faster growing region in the world. In the latter
case, the main short run priority is to increase trade links between Brazil and Mexico, the
two biggest economies of the Latin America region. In this case a joint committee to
explore means to achieve this goal, including negotiating a free trade agreements, was
created, and work is underway.

8.      The overall reforms undertaken by Mexico resulted in an average expansion of
exports of goods of 18 per cent between 1993 and 2000. The share of exports of goods
and services in the GDP increased from less than 15 per cent to more than 31 percent in
200087. Trade growth, however, has weakened in the current decade falling to an average
of 7 percent for the period between 2000 and 2008. The share of exports of goods and
services in the GDP felt from 31 percent in 2000 to 28 percent in 2001 and has remained
at that level since then. Mexico's share in world trade has declined from 2.07 in the
period 2000-2004 to 1.60 in 2006-200888.

9.    Between 2002 and 2006 Mexico adopted several trade initiatives to improve its
competitiveness89. The most relevant were:

·    In September 2002, tariffs for the electronics and high-tech industries (known as ITA
     Plus) were reduced establishing a tariff-free regime for 292 tariff lines which faced
     tariffs of 23, 18, 13 and 3 percent.

·    In December 2004, an overall tariff reduction of 3 and 10 percentage points affecting
     9,183 tariff lines took place.

·    In September 2006, a new tariff reduction was enacted affecting 6,089 tariff fractions.
     According to the WTO, this measure reduced the average tariff rates from 16.5 per
     cent in 2001 to 11 per cent in 2008.

·    Finally, Mexico merged the PITEX (Programas de Importación Temporal para
     Producir Artículos de Exportación and Maquila) and the Maquila Export Promotion
     in 2006 through the IMMEX Program (Programa para la Industria Manufacturera,
     Maquiladora y Servicios de Exportación). The PITEX program allowed companies
     that met certain minimum export requirements temporarily to import raw materials,
     parts and components duty-free and at a VAT rate of 0 per cent90. Under the new
     IMMEX program, the tariff on temporary imports of raw materials, parts and
     components is not paid as long as the inputs are incorporated into a product for
     export. It maintains a simplified administrative procedure for payment of income tax
     and other benefits concerning the fixed assets tax (IMPAC) that was available under
     the Maquila program.

10.     Changes were also introduced in customs procedures. A special program for
certified companies was established to accelerate customs formalities of high-volume
exporting companies with a good fiscal and commercial track record. The program
allowed certified companies to use reserved lanes leading to a reduction in procedures
and inspection times. In addition, an Integrated Computerized Customs system was
created to facilitate customs clearance for importers and exporters, enabling them to
make their import and export requests electronically. Customs modernization efforts also
included investment in customs infrastructure and technology, and training for customs
officials91.

11.    Despite these individual initiatives, Mexico liberalization has lagged behind on
some fronts. The emphasis on bilateral trade agreements created a gap among the average
bound tariff rate at the WTO92 (36.1 percent), the applied average Most Favored Nation

(MFN) rates93 for imports from countries without trade agreements, and the effective
average tariff rate resulting from tariff preferences negotiated by Mexico. Table 3 shows
that Mexico's MFN tariff rate is relatively high compared to other emerging economies
and OECD countries. In contrast, when preferential agreements are factored in, its
average applied tariff rate is the lowest among this group of countries, except for high
income OECD countries and Malaysia. Finally, Mexico's overall trade restrictive index
(OTRI) that includes both applied tariff and non-tariff measures is among the highest in
this group of countries after Malaysia and Brazil94.

12.    Mexico's trading partners have expressed concern about its trade regime. In the
context of the WTO's Trade Policy Review of Mexico, which took place in 2008,
members of the WTO "commended Mexico's commitment to trade liberalization, as
demonstrated by its unilateral reduction of tariffs in 2006. However, Mexico was urged to
continue simplifying its trade regulations and to reduce the gap between bound and
applied tariffs in order to increase the predictability of its trade regime "95.

13.     The Mexican Government also identified important problems in its trading
regime. According to a study by the Ministry of Economy, higher tariffs were applied to
inputs than to final products resulting in negative effective protection, particularly when
producers in countries with which Mexico has preferential agreements may import these
inputs at lower rates and use them to produce goods that were subsequently exported to
Mexico. Furthermore, the study considered that tariff reductions for the import of inputs
and machinery allowed under the PROSECs (Programa de Promoción Sectorial) were
not an optimal solution because of their administrative costs and their limited scope (Box
1). As a conclusion, the study proposed to lower MFN tariffs, particularly on raw
materials, as they represent a cost disadvantage for Mexican companies.

                           Box 1: Specialized Tariff Reduction Schemes.

Under the PROSECs regime, created in November 2000, companies may import inputs, at a reduced tariff,
within a range of 0 to 5 per cent, to produce goods for exports or the domestic market. Both the inputs
imported and the goods produced are grouped by sector, the benefits of the program only apply to those
inputs included in the sector in question and may not be used for other purposes.

Among the sectors that have used this program are: electricity; electronics; furniture; toys, games and
sports articles; footwear; mining and metallurgy; capital goods; photography; agricultural machinery;
chemicals; articles of rubber and plastic; iron and steel; medical equipment, medicines and
pharmaceutical products; transport (except the automobile industry); paper and paper board; wood; hides
and skins; the automobile industry and automobile parts; textiles and clothing; chocolates, confectionery
and the like; coffee and various industries.

The Regla Octava provides tariff concessions for products not covered by the PROSECs. The imports of
these products are administered through import licences under heading 98.02 of the tariff in the Law on
General Import and Export Taxes TIGIE. The beneficiaries must have a program authorized by the
Secretaria de Economia and meet the following criteria: non-existence or insufficiency of domestic
production; diversification of sources of supply; the goods imported are required at a stage prior to the
commencement of production under new projects; and the commercial obligations in international markets
are respected.

14.     The Mexican Antitrust Commission, Comisión Federal de Competencia (CFC)
also issued an opinion in May 2008 providing a critical assessment of Mexico´s trade
regime. According to the CFC, the tariff structure discriminated between importers and
created distortions that limited the ability of domestic producers to compete with their
foreign competitors. This leads to low levels of efficiency, higher production costs and
higher prices for consumers. The view of the competition authority was that the tariff
structure should not create distortions in production and consumption decisions. The
effective elimination of these distortions required to give all operators the right to access
to international markets on a non-discriminatory basis.

15.    Regarding non-tariff measures, the competition authority identified three main
concerns in the Mexican regime: (a) customs procedures, including barriers to entry to
customs-related services providers; (b) technical barriers to trade, including conformity
assessment procedures; and (c) a lack of adequate resources in the customs agency for
performing verifications. The competition authority concluded by identifying five areas

                                                - 117 -
that provided opportunities for further improvements: (a) reduce the level and dispersion
of tariff structure; (b) simplify customs procedures; (c) eliminate barriers to entry for
services related to customs procedures; and (d) strengthen the customs authority by
providing adequate infrastructure and resources in line with its responsibilities and the
needs of users.

16.     Consistent with the aforementioned concerns, the Government issued a Decree on
December 24, 2008, that rationalizes the MFN tariff structure for all non-agricultural
products from an average of 10.4 percent to 4.3 percent in 2013 (Figure 2). It will also
simplify the tariff structure from thirteen different levels to six. Overall, the reform
rationalizes the tariff structure, reduces distortions and trade costs, and eliminates the
negative effective protection that prevailed for some goods. The first phase of the reform
was implemented on January 1st, 2009, reducing the average MFN rate on manufacturing
products to 8.3 percent. The sharpest reduction will take place in January 2010 when the
average MFN tariff on manufacturing products will fall to 5.2 percent. Products that will
maintain a 20 percent tariff rate are concentrated in the following categories: apparel,
leather manufactures and shoes, vehicles and auto parts, and chemical products, including
pharmaceuticals. Products under the category of electrical machinery and equipment and
parts will face tariffs of 10 or 15 percent. A recent OECD report considers that the
"significant reductions in import tariffs should help the economy take fuller advantage of
trade and investment integration, which could be a relative strength for Mexico given its
geographic location"96.

17.     What are the expected impacts of the reforms? The Bank's view is that the
impacts will depend mainly on the effect that the tariff reduction will have on the origin
of imported goods. For those products in which imports come mainly from trade
agreements and in which MFN tariffs are high, a reduction in the tariff may redirect
imports to more efficient suppliers that have no trade agreements with Mexico such as
East Asia trading partners. By reducing MFN tariffs, it would be expected that the
diversion effects that Mexican FTAs may have created will be reduced, improving
overall welfare and leading to a reduction in consumer costs. A 2004 study found that the
Mexican tariff structure imposed welfare losses of US$2 billion to citizens (or 0.3 percent
of GDP in 2004)97. The products identified in this category include: vehicles, electronics,
equipment and machinery, chemical products, including pharmaceuticals, woods,
furniture, and steel98. This does not mean that an import surge is likely to occur,
particularly in the context of the current collapse in world trade; however, these industries
probably will face more competition from a large number of suppliers--in particular from
the Asia-Pacific region.

18.     Reforms will reduce trading costs to companies especially benefiting smaller
companies. The enacted trade reform will simplify the operational costs of current users
of certain special imports regime such as the Sectoral Promotion Programs (PROSECs)
and the Regla Octava--described in Box 1--and reduce the costs of the agencies
responsible for their administration and control. In addition, large and medium sized
companies have been the main beneficiaries of these programs given the high
administrative costs to access them. The tariff reduction makes the special imports
regimes less attractive (or relevant) and the general import regime more accessible to all
producers. Hence, the tariff reform is expected to widen access for small companies to
more efficient inputs on a non-discriminatory basis increasing their competitiveness.

19.    The impact on Mexican tax revenues is expected to be small. In terms of total tax
revenues, tariff importance felt from a maximum of 10 percent in 1992 to 3.6 percent in
2008. Moreover, in terms of GDP its incidence was reduced from 1 percent to 0.3 percent
during the same period.




                                                - 119 -
20.     Additional reductions in trade costs are also a priority in the Government agenda,
and the Government has already eliminated certain requirements in order to simplify and
to facilitate trade. For example, importers are no longer required to deposit a security to
ensure the price estimates by the SHCP of imported goods (WTO, Trade Policy Review
Mexico, 2008). The Register of Importers in Specific Sectors was eliminated except for a
few sectors, mainly related to national security. Now importers must be registered only in
the Importers´ Register. Nevertheless, some problems remain in regard to the causes for
cancellation of importers from the Register. In addition, certificates of origin validity
were extended until the last working day of February 2010. The new certificates issued
are valid for a period of 3 years, and the criteria to obtain an approved exporter certificate
have been relaxed. New electronic certificates of origin are also in place for bilateral
trade between Colombia and Mexico since August 2009. Finally, a digital system for
registration of domicile for companies conducting operations with IMMEX programs was
also implemented.99.

21.      The Mexican authorities have identified other key areas where trade regulations
should be streamlined and procedures rationalized. Among them it is worth mentioning:
(a) pre-validation requirements; (b) barriers for the provision of customs related services;
(c) the extent of customs agents' powers; and (d) technical barriers to trade, including
conformity assessments procedures. Mexico's Customs Institutional Strengthening
Project (Report Number 47396-MX) supported by the World Bank will address points
(a), (b), and (c) with the specific goal of reducing costs and time of trade transactions in
accordance with international practice and agreements. The project will also strengthen
the implementation of a risk management system for customs merchandise and
passengers. As Table 4 highlights, there is substantial scope for improving Mexico´s
customs efficiency, which is well below the OECD countries´ average and slightly better
that the Asian-Pacific economies.

22.      Regarding technical barriers to trade, there are two types of problems. First, the
number of agencies responsible for control and verification increases complexity and
costs, in particular in the sanitary and phytosanitary area. Second, regarding conformity
assessment procedures, barriers to entry reduce competition among services providers.
The Government´s objective is to start addressing these matters in the near future. The
establishment of a single window for trade transaction will provide a basis to start dealing
with this aspect.

                ANNEX 6. POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT REVIEW

Recent evolution of poverty and inequality in Mexico

1.     After a decade of continuous decline, the most recent official figures show that
Mexico has experienced an important increase in monetary poverty. Making use of the
most recent household expenditure survey, CONEVAL has estimated that extreme
poverty (pobreza alimentaria) increased from 13.8 to 18.2 percent of the national
population between 2006 and 2008.100 Measures of moderate poverty (pobreza de
capacidades and pobreza patrimonial) rose from 20.7 and 42.6 percent, respectively, to
25.1 and 47.4 percent in the same period. All measures of poverty increased in around
4.5 percentage points, which makes current figures to be the highest in record since year
2002 (see Figure 1).101

    CONEVAL stands for Consejo Nacional de Evaluación de la Política de Desarrollo Social. It is the
Mexican institution, according to the Social Development Law, that produces the official estimates of
poverty.
101
    Three concepts of poverty (pobreza alimentaria, de capacidades and de patrimonio) are regularly
computed in Mexico. Pobreza alimentaria refers to individuals or households unable to afford a basic
basket of food products with the totality of their disposable income. Pobreza de capacidades refers to
inadequacy of incomes to pay expenditures in health and in education, in addition to the basic food basket.
Pobreza de patrimonio also includes inadequacy to afford expenditures in clothing, housing and
transportation. In the urban area, the poverty lines for these concepts amount to 949.38, 1164.41 and
1904.84 monthly pesos per head, respectively (around US $ 90, 100 and 170, respectively). In the rural
area, the poverty lines are 706.69, 835.52 and 1282.36, respectively (around US $ 65, 75 and 115,
respectively)

                                                 - 122 -
2.     The new poverty rates also indicate increases in both urban and rural monetary
poverty. Extreme poverty grew from 7.5 percent of the population in urban areas in 2006
to 10.6 percent in 2008 and from 24.5 percent to 31.8 percent in rural areas during the
same period. This has meant an increase in 2.2 million new poor in urban areas and 2.8
million in rural areas. If pobreza de patrimonio is considered, then the urban rates grew
from 35.6 percent in 2006 to 39.8 percent in 2008 and the rural rates from 54.7 percent to
60.8 percent during the same period. In absolute numbers, this implies an increase of 3.6
million new poor in rural areas and 2.3 million in urban areas (Table 1).

3.      In terms of inequality, CONEVAL reports that the bottom decile of the population
concentrates 1.4 percent of total income whereas the top decile has 39.3 percent of total
income, in year 2008. The figures for 2006 were 1.6 and 39.3 respectively, which
indicates a slight increase in inequality as measured by this indicator.

4.      Interestingly, arguing in favor of the multidimensionality of poverty, CONEVAL
also reports coverage in basic services (such as education, health and housing) and in
social protection (access to social security and social assistance). In this regard, indicators
of school attendance, life expectancy, child mortality, maternal mortality, and housing
infrastructure (access to "piso firme") show a favorable trend for the period 2006-2008.
Although the share of household heads without access to a social security program
increased from 71 to 72 percent, the percentage of households without coverage of any




                                                 - 123 -
social program declined from 50.1 to 44.1, in the period of reference.102 This indicates
that other welfare indicators have not shown the same trend than monetary poverty and
that the Mexican Government has been successful in expanding the coverage of social
protection.


5.      The results in terms of monetary poverty and inequality can be the consequence,
among many other things, of the food prices crisis that shocked the world economy
during 2007 and early 2008. However, the impact of the current global crisis is not
registered in these numbers because the reference survey collected information in August
2008. The global crisis affected Mexico since the last quarter of 2008 when there was a
net job destruction for the first time in several years and output declined by 1.6 percent
(year-to-year). Furthermore, the most severe impact of the crisis was felt in the first half
of 2009, when unemployment rose to 6.28 percent (August 2009) and GDP fell by more
than 8 percent for two consecutive quarters. This dire economic performance is likely to
produce a further upward impact on monetary poverty and inequality figures for year
2009. Given the depth of the crisis, there may also be a stop in the advances in social
development or even deterioration in these if the duration of the crisis lengthens more
than expected.

6.     Recent studies indicate that growth-elasticity of poverty lies in the range of [-5.0,
-0.5] depending on method and sample of countries.103 Consequently, an economic
downturn for year 2009 of around 6 percent, could lead to an increase in poverty rates of
3 to 30 percent, that is (using the extreme poverty measures for 2008) an increase
between half a percentage point and five percentage points. Historical evidence from the
previous "Tequila" crisis shows that extreme poverty rose from 21.2 percent to 37.4
percent between 1994 and 1996 (a period when growth declined 7.0 percent in 1995 and
then rebound 7.1 percent in 1996). The massive expansion of poverty during that crisis
led to the introduction of innovative social programs, and a series of political and
economic reforms that allowed for a continuous reduction of poverty between 1996 and
2006. Currently, Mexico has a battery of instruments to prevent the repetition of the 1995
experience.

7.       In response to the deep and rapidly deteriorating situation of the economy, the
Mexican Government has adopted a series of measures in several areas. Most of these
policies take advantage of the process of modernization of the Mexican economy and
institutions that the country has undergone in the last two decades. Some policies seek to
correct fiscal imbalances, others to strengthen the financial and business sectors and yet
others to protect families standards of living. Some of these policies aim at producing a
rebound in economic growth and others at protecting the most vulnerable groups of the
population. The latter have, therefore, an explicit social protection objective. Among the

ISSTE, PEMEX, Marina (Navy), Ejército (Army) and Universities. Household without coverage of social
program refers to a household without access to Oportunidades or Procampo, no member is affiliated to
Seguro Popular and household head does not have access to health coverage as job benefit.

crisis impact mitigating policies with an explicit social protection objective are the Fiscal
reform with 2010 budget proposal and the labor market polices included in the
Employment pillar of the ANFEFE.

Fiscal policies

8.      The most important fiscal policy measure of the Program is the budget proposal
for 2010 which includes a series of changes in new and existing taxes that seeks to
increase non-oil revenues for the central government. These taxes are accompanied by an
important expansion of the most important social program in Mexico (the conditional
cash transfer program Oportunidades). The combination of these two broad sets of
policies has interesting distributive consequences.

9.      The new taxes proposed for fiscal year 2010 onwards include: a new excise tax on
telecommunications services (4%) and increases in excise taxes (IEPS) from tobacco,
beer, alcoholic beverages and games and lotteries. It also includes changes in the income
taxes through an increase in the corporate rate, changes in consolidation practices, an
increase in personal income top bracket (of 2 percentage points) and a reduction in the
minimum level for tax exemption. Furthermore, a new consumption tax (in a non-
cumulative way, allowing for credits) of 2% on all goods and services.

10.    The new consumption tax, the most controversial given past attempts to broaden
the base of the existing VAT in Mexico, is argued to finance in part an expansion of the
Oportunidades program in 800 thousand new families. The whole tax program is also
intended to finance expansion of other social programs such as the Programa Alimentario
(PAL) and the Seguro Popular.

11.     A preliminary evaluation of the distributive impact of the budget proposal has
been produced by the Secretaría de Hacienda y Credito Publico (SHCP). In this
evaluation, it is assumed that the new consumption (as well as the new or increased
excise taxes) is fully paid by consumers (i.e., the tax incidence falls fully in consumers,
as if demand were perfectly inelastic) and that all consumers actually buy their products
in formal markets that comply with the new tax code. These are conservative estimates,
because it is plausible to assume that not all the new tax is passed through to consumers
and consumers in the bottom of the distribution are less likely to purchase goods from
formal, fully tax compliant retailers. Given the share of tobacco, beer and other alcoholic

                                             - 125 -
beverages and lotteries consumption within total consumption for those households in the
bottom of the income distribution (approximately the three bottom deciles) and assuming
that these households total consumption is equal to their total income (i.e., they have little
or no savings whatsoever), the total and per-household new tax collection is computed to
be of 1,043.5 million pesos and 1,304 pesos, respectively (Table 2). Given that the total
estimated tax collection amounts to 192.3 billion pesos, it can be said the poorest
members of the Mexican society only contribute in 0.5% of the total, which indicates that
the proposal is very progressive in terms of absolute incidence.

12.     Making some additional assumption about the average benefit that beneficiaries
from Oportunidades, new and old, will receive (approximately 26.2 percent of the annual
income of households in the two-three bottom deciles of the distribution), SHCP has
estimated the average transfer to be received by these families. This transfer amounts,
they reckon, to 12,577 pesos per year, per beneficiary family. Given the annual tax
collection of 1,304 pesos hypothesized for this group, it can be said that the families in
the bottom of the distribution will receive a net transfer of 11,273 pesos per year.

13.     The complete distributional impact of the fiscal program, however, requires an
assessment of the transfers, both in cash and in kind, that other groups in the income
distribution may receive in year 2010. The expansion of Seguro Popular and of PAL, is
likely to favor groups in both the bottom and the middle of the distribution. The
temporary expansion of health and maternity benefits (see next section) is likely to
benefit families in the middle of the income distribution. In any case, households in the
middle of the distribution are likely to receive less generous transfers than those in the
bottom, and given their relatively higher proportion of consumption than those in the top
of the distribution, it is plausible that middle income households will have a larger
relative incidence than other income groups of the consumption tax. To complement this,
it should also be said that families in the top of the distribution will perhaps receive no
transfers from the social programs mentioned above and will have to pay both the
consumption and excise taxes as well as the expansion of income taxes. This latter
component is likely to have a large absolute and relative incidence on families in the top
of the distribution. The final relative incidence of the whole package will depend on
adding all the tax and transfer effect in each social group. This is an empirical question
that requires additional scrutiny.

14.     Even though, a preliminary evaluation of the net impact of the program seems to
indicate that absolute incidence is favorable to those in the bottom of the distribution, it is
also necessary to investigate the relative and absolute incidence of the whole package.
This, however, requires to compute how all the taxes (consumption, excise and income
taxes) affect middle and top deciles of the distribution, as well as the transfers both in
cash and in kind, that different groups will receive from the next budget. In summary, the
present preliminary evaluation of the net impact must be complemented at a further

stage104 with a rigorous analysis of the taxes' absolute and relative incidence along the
income distribution.

Labor market policies

15.     On January 7, 2009, President Calderón announced to the Nation the content of
the National Agreement in Favor of the Family Economy and Employment (ANFEFE--
Acuerdo Nacional a Favor de la Economía Familiar y el Empleo). The agreement
includes a series of policy actions to be adopted by the Federal Government during fiscal
year 2009, as well as a string of commitments on the part of several public and private
Mexican institutions. Policy actions by the Federal Government included in the
agreement are grouped into five pillars. The first pillar, Support to Employment (Apoyo
al Empleo y a los Trabajadores) is a combination of both active and passive labor market
policies to confront the international crisis.

16.     The Programa de Empleo Temporal (PET) and the Servicio Nacional de Empleo
(SNE) are the two main active labor market polices proposed in the ANFEFE. The
former is an emergency employment program that provides temporary employment to
workers out of work, or with reduced income, due to a natural emergency or limited
employment opportunities due to a fall in labor demand. SNE is a umbrella of programs
that includes both labor intermediation, mobility and training services.

17.     Temporary employment programs are considered an appropriate mechanism for
dealing with cyclical downturns in the labor market. They provide an income support for
those who lost their job and, given their self-targeting mechanism (they usually pay
below minimum or nearly minimum wages), they focus on those most in need of finding
an income source. In addition since they are not tied to social security contributions or
any other previous employment requirement, temporary employment programs are
expected to benefit those in the bottom of the income distribution. The international
impact evaluation literature finds that these programs have only short term employment
impacts and no wage/productivity impact for the beneficiaries.105 The Latin American
literature for this type of programs finds positive short-term employment effects.106 This
evidence confirms the anti-cyclical, temporary, emergency character of the program.

18.    For the case of the Mexican program PET, there are very few evaluations
available. One evaluation done in 2002 (cited by Samaniego, 2002) recorded that the
program was effective in helping 60% of its beneficiaries escaping poverty. A more
recent performance evaluation done by FAO (2007) highlighted that the program had
problems in design and targeting of beneficiaries. In a similar vein, the most recent
evaluation by CONEVAL (2008) also remarks the lack of recent and thorough program
evaluations of PET. CONEVAL acknowledges the wide geographic coverage of the


104
    Further work on a full Poverty and Social Impact Assessment (PSIA) of the policies will be carried out
by Bank staff together with government counterparts during program implementation.

al (2005), Betcherman et al. (2004) and Estevao (2003)

program but highlights problems in both program design, selection of beneficiaries,
objectives and quantitative indicators and targets. The administrative reform of the
program (described in Annex 5c) is a response to this recent CONEVAL report.

19.      Despite its problems, it can be argued that PET is a potentially useful and
adequate mechanism for dealing with the current crisis.107 Some authors argue that PET
is a flexible and appropriate program for dealing with the cyclical aspect of this crisis (in
contrast to other programs like Oportunidades, which deal with more long term,
structural poverty). In addition to its short-term benefits in terms of employment, it could
be argued that the programs may also have long-term, indirect benefits in terms of
community infrastructure in poor backward regions. Scott (2009) argues that PET is one
of the most progressive social programs in Mexico, only after Oportunidades and Piso
Firme (Table 3).

20.     Regarding the effectiveness and distributive impact of training and intermediation
programs, there is also a vast literature.108 The literature of developed and transition
economies find that intermediation services are an effective means for helping job
seekers find a job. The studies for Latin America, however, do not find a favourable
evidence in this regard due, perhaps, to the usual reliance on informal methods (word of
mouth, family contacts, self employment) of job search that predominate in the region.
An intermediation service for which there is an impact evaluation is the Brazilian SINE.
This evaluation reports that the program has a positive impact in finding a formal job.109
Evaluations of training programs, on the other hand, show more diverse results. Training
programs for adults show mixed results depending on country and methodology while
training programs for youth show no favorable results in developed countries (with the
exception of Job Corps in the USA) and positive results for Latin American countries (the
Jóvenes type program).110

21.    For the case of the Mexican program SNE, which encompasses both labor
intermediation and training programs, there are several evaluations regarding the latter

component. Most of these evaluations find that the program has a favorable impact on
short and long-term employment, but no significant impact on wages. The most recent
evaluation report by CONEVAL to the Progama de Apoyo al Empleo (PAE, one of the
sub-programs within the SNE) also confirm the findings of previous studies: training
programs in Mexico (BECATE in particular) have a positive effect on the probability of
finding employment, although no significant, or ambiguous, effect on salaries.111 Several
evaluations, both recent by CONEVAL and previous, usually find a larger positive
impact among women and among those with less formal education. Given the fact that
women and those with less formal education have, on average, lower earnings it can be
said that these training programs have progressive impact that benefits more to those in
the bottom of the earnings distribution.

22.     The passive labor market policies included in the ANFEFE are two: i) expanded
withdrawals from pension savings accounts for unemployed workers and ii) extended
coverage of health and maternity benefits for unemployed workers who contributed to the
system. The latter is a temporary measure that protects workers and their families during
what can be expected to have been the worst period of the crisis (first and second quarters
of 2009). The former is a permanent change with long term implications.112 The short-
term distributive impact of these policies can be expected to be favorable to middle
income families. In fact, both measures are linked to being a beneficiary of the formal
social security systems in Mexico, particularly the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social
(IMSS). In this regard, as Figure 2 shows, beneficiaries of the IMSS are concentrated in
the middle and top deciles of the income distribution, hence allowances to withdraw from
pension funds and extended coverage of health insurance will have a larger likelihood to
occur in middle and top deciles of the distribution. If unemployment concentrates in
lower-middle income households (as some preliminary evidence from CONSAR
indicates, see Annex 5.c) then it can be hypothesized that this policy will have a
distributive impact favorable to those in the middle of the income distribution in the short
term. Notwithstanding that the expanded withdrawals from individual retirement
accounts allowed the Government a rapid response to an increasing problem of
unemployment due to the global crisis, there might be a need for a broader review of
passive labor market policies in the medium term since the current provision raises a
threat of eroding workers' pension funds.

pension savings towards the end of the working life is beyond the scope of this Annex.

      security and being covered by Seguro Popular; less than one percent of households in all deciles report

Trade integration policies

23.     The tariff reform is expected to reduce costs to consumers. However, a full
welfare gains analysis requires an evaluation of wage and employment gains and losses,
as well as its distribution. According to the authorities the productive sectors that will
benefit from the tariff reforms are mainly the agricultural, construction, and services
sectors that generate 85.7 percent of total employment. Within these, SMEs are expected
to benefit more in relative terms given that it had been relatively more costly for them to
access the special imports regimes. Regarding the manufacturing sector, the authorities
expect that the potentially affected companies comprise 14.3 percent of total
employment113. The activities that could be negatively affected are textiles industries,
plastics, metal products, leather products, paper, printing and related industries,
chemicals, wood industry, and oil and coal related industries. Several of these industries
have experienced a fall in their participation in total manufacturing employment and
value added prior to the crisis. The recent expansion of active labor market programs

(especially the temporary employment program, the retraining program, and job
networking) supported by the third pillar of this operation will provide assistance to
workers that might be adversely impacted by the tariff reform

Conclusion

24.      The response to the international crisis by the Mexican Government includes a
series of policies that have an explicit social protection objective. Among them is the
fiscal reform contained in the 2010 budget proposal and the labor market polices included
in the Employment Pillar of the ANFEFE. A preliminary analysis of these measures
indicates that they may have a favorable impact in the lower and middle ranks of the
earnings/income distribution.


25.     The expansion and administrative improvements of existing labor market policies,
together with the introduction of an important fiscal reform, shows the capacity of the
Mexican Government to rapidly confront the severe crisis that the economy is
undergoing, while making at the same time what appear to be, after preliminary study,
distributionally sensible economic policies.
