Mexico were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: one of the lessons that can be drawn from this\n            operation is that considering the interests and political\n            strengths of various stakeholders and groups in the reform\n            process may help in tailoring successful reforms and provide\n            more realistic expectations of reform outcomes. Although the\n            reform progress remains gradual in Mexico, the Development\n            Policy Loan (DPL) supported reforms have been successful.\n            Ongoing engagement by the Bank in DPL supported policy areas\n            is crucial for measurement of the longer term developmental\n            impact. This is particularly significant in instances when\n            outcome indicators are not reflective of the full impact of\n            reform, or when methodological changes in indicator\n            measurement postpone data release. Despite the ease in\n            measurement of some quantitative indicators, such as the\n            expansion of outlets providing financial services, the true\n            impact of the increase will not be evident for some time. As\n            the Bank remains engaged on financial sector issues and\n            other development areas, it can help assist with the\n            construction indicators and monitor policy impact, such as\n            the ongoing financial inclusion survey conducted every three\n            years, to provide an informed basis to adjust policies to\n            enhance development outcomes."}, "docdt": "2011-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
