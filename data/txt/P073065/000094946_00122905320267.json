seeks to curb the spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in\n            Cameroon and to mitigate its impact for those who are\n            infected or affected by HIV/AIDS through the strengthening\n            of communities' capacity to design and implement action\n            plans for HIV/AIDS and through support to the design and\n            implementation of sector specific HIV/AIDS strategies. The\n            project consists of five components: 1) The first component\n            will support communities' efforts to prevent and\n            mitigate of the impact of the HIV/AIDS crisis. Strong\n            emphasis is given to the participatory nature of the\n            development of community action plans. 2) The implementation\n            of specific targeted health sector interventions geared to\n            HIV/AIDS will be supported through this component. These\n            include the establishment of voluntary testing and\n            counseling center, the improvement of blood transfusion\n            safety, and the management of blood banks, etc. 3) The third\n            component will support the design and implementation of\n            sector strategies. Targeted sectors include health,\n            communication, transport, defense, education, agriculture,\n            public works, youth and sport, tourism, women affairs,\n            mining, environment, etc. 4) This component will provide\n            resources to support capacity building among those sectors\n            who are involved in the fight against HIV/AIDS. 5) This\n            component will support the establishment of a implementation\n            and coordination unit at the national and provincial levels."}, "docdt": "2000-12-18T00:00:00Z"}
