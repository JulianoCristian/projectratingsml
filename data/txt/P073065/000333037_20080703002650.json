Defense\n            Syndrome (AIDS) Project for Cameroon were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, the Bank performance\n            was moderately unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: the Multi-Country AIDS Program (MAP), developed in\n            2000 and aimed at enabling African countries to scale up\n            their programs against the devastating epidemic, was focused\n            on speed, flexibility, learning by doing and reliance on\n            multiple implementing partners. Scaling up promising\n            activities makes much sense, but these activities must be\n            clearly defined and the justification of providing vastly\n            increased resources clearly made. Providing grants to a\n            multitude of local organizations is a risky business\n            everywhere and particularly in a context of poor governance.\n            It was clear from the outset that the risks of misuse of\n            funds were high. Extraordinary precautions should have been\n            taken to mitigate these risks and reduce the vulnerability\n            of a key Bank-financed operation to corruption. Pressure to\n            disburse in a context of weak governance and lack of\n            accountability for results leads to inefficiencies in the\n            use of resources."}, "docdt": "2008-04-01T00:00:00Z"}
