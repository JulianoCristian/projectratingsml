outcome is\n            satisfactory since the project achieved most policy\n            objectives and supported the government in introducing\n            sector reforms, and the need for cost recovery in sector\n            services such as water supply was recognized and is being\n            implemented. Overall, project sustainability is rated as\n            likely; and both World Bank and Borrower performances are\n            rated as satisfactory. Key lessons include the following:\n            The government's ownership of the project and strong\n            support from the locally staffed project unit were essential\n            for success. Smaller and more focused projects involving\n            fewer implementing agencies improved management's\n            chances for success in implementation. Risks should be\n            carefully assessed and managed, specifically, project\n            requiring intense Bank supervision should be allocated the\n            necessary resources; when a project is restructured, risks\n            should be re-evaluated and corresponding new risk management\n            plans developed; and during periods of civil war, the Bank\n            should communicate with the government about the need to\n            minimize resulting project risk. Finally it is difficult to\n            effectively transfer knowledge from international\n            consultants to local staff: it would be more effective to\n            recruit and train local staff supported by the IDA project\n            teams. Focused short-term technical assistance should also\n            be used during early phases of the project to provide\n            practical training and to solve problems."}, "docdt": "1999-12-16T00:00:00Z"}
