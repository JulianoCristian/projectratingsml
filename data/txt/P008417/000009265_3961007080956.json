The project will have two main components: a)\n            The infrastructure rehabilitation investment component will\n            aim at protecting essential existing infrastructure from\n            further decay and renovating some additional urgently needed\n            economic and social services.  This component includes five\n            types of operations: 1) heating and energy-saving measures\n            for schools and hospitals; 2) urban transport; 3) water\n            supply; 4) waste water; and 5) solid waste collection and\n            disposal.  The institutional development component will aim\n            at: 1) implementing the project effectively; 2) initiating a\n            process to develop, over time, local capabilities in such\n            critical areas as project and financial management,\n            procurement, investment analysis, and environmental\n            assessment and management; 3) developing coherent strategies\n            and action programs, mainly at the local levels, to deliver\n            key municipal services and control or alleviate serious\n            pollution problems along Georgia's Black Sea coast."}, "docdt": "1994-10-17T00:00:00Z"}
