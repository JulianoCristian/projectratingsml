Lessons learned suggest that the\n            project's responsiveness to the country's\n            priorities generated strong commitments to project\n            implementation in the initial three years, particularly\n            important given Georgia's unfamiliarity with project\n            procedures. However, this responsiveness to rapid\n            preparation, though beneficial, encountered costs, and\n            losses, such as the need to build institutional capacity, in\n            particular financial discipline, transparency, and\n            competitive procurement. This diversification in the lending\n            portfolio led to declining Bank supervision resources,\n            unable to provide the assistance needed by the borrower.\n            Nonetheless, the strong, initial support by the Bank,\n            provided the impulse for this investment project to move\n            forward, which in hindsight, may have even prevented greater\n            deterioration in project performance during the final years\n            of implementation. But the application of Bank procurement\n            guidelines seems unrealistic, given the country's\n            recent political unrest, which conflicted with international\n            procurement attempts, and, in retrospect, closing the\n            project as originally scheduled, made better use of scarce\n            resources, rather than extending the project to complete few\n            remaining contracts, since actually, procurement was largely completed."}, "docdt": "2001-02-26T00:00:00Z"}
