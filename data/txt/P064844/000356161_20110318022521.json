main development objectives of the\n            Rural Electrification and Transmission Project are to\n            improve power sector efficiency and reliability, while\n            reducing electricity supply costs, improve standards of\n            living and foster economic growth in rural areas, by\n            expanding rural electricity supplies, and, strengthen\n            electricity institutions, the regulatory framework, and the\n            'enabling environment' for sector\n            commercialization and privatization. Negative impacts\n            include: air quality, soil erosion, water quality, noise\n            pollution, worker/public safety, and loss of agricultural\n            productivity. Mitigation measures include: 1) concrete\n            batching plants to be located downwind and away from\n            inhabited areas; 2) groundcover to be left undisturbed as\n            much as possible; 3) fuel or hazardous materials securely\n            stored at least 20m from any surface water and above flood\n            level and the proper wastewater treatment, water supply and\n            waste disposal facilities for workforce; 4) activities to be\n            conducted during daytime hours and local residents informed\n            of construction schedule; and 5) tower footing design should\n            minimize permanent land use requirement, and should allow\n            access for farming in and around footing area."}, "docdt": "2011-03-15T00:00:00Z"}
