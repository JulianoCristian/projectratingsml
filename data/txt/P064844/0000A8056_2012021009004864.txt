                         Implementation Status Overview
                         For PDO (a), (i) the power sector efficiency has been improved as Electricity du Cambodge’s (EDC) overall system power loss declined from 14% at appraisal to 9.8% by mid
                         December 2011; (ii) supply reliability has been improved and the average number of hours of electricity services provided by Rural Energy Enterprises (REEs) increased from 4 hours
                         at appraisal to 12 hours by December 2011 compared to the target of 8 hours; (iii) EDC’s cost of power supply has not been reduced to the target of US$ 0.11 kWh but is down from
                         0.155 US$/kWh at appraisal to US$ 0.147/kWh mainly because the cost of fuel for power generation has increased, due rising oil prices.

                         For PDO (b)the living standards of the targeted rural households have been improved, with (i) access to modern energy services provided to some 503,779 people compared to the
                         target of 567,000 people. More people will access to modern energy services as new connections are ongoing; (ii) the retail tariff charged to the rural households in the private REEs’
                         license areas covered by the project declined from 0.60 US$/kWh to 0.35 US$/kWh vs. 0.425 US$/kWh target, by REEs switching from inefficient and expensive self-generation to
                         EDC’s grid supply; and (iii) opportunities for income generation provided to rural households through productive uses of electricity such as sewing, hair dressing, agricultural
                         processing and using electric motors to replace diesel or gasoline ones in cottage industries.

                         For PDO (c), the project has resulted in (i) the licensing and operation of 295 private REEs in the electricity distribution business (vs. 180 REEs target), which contributed to extending
                         grid-supplied electricity services to 50,000 new households; (ii) operation of four private companies in renewable (solar) energy business vs target of 5 companies; and (iii) investment
                         and commissioning of 193 MW of hydropower capacity.

                         For GEO: For renewable energy development: (i) installation of SHSs has been completed for 9,870 remote rural households (82% of the target) and is on track to achieve the target
                         of 12,000 SHS by end January 2012; (ii) the planned installation of micro hydropower capacity of 1,200 kW will not be installed as it was not found economically and financially
                         viable. However, this will have little impact on achievement of the GEO, since (i) CO2 emission avoided by December 2011 reached more than 600,000 tons vs 233,000 tons targeted
                         for the project period; (ii) installed hydropower generation capacity reached 14.5% of the total installed capacity in the country vs 5% renewable energy capacity targeted; and (iii) four
                         companies were engaged in solar energy business vs 5 companies targeted.
