                         Implementation Status Overview
                          Progress toward achieving the PDO is reasonable. Construction of high voltage TL and reinforcement of existing TL completed. The expansion of MV line is in progress. So far
                         some 10,500 new connections have been made. Under the REF mechanism, REF has signed subgrant agreements to connect almost 50,000 new households of which 42,000
                         households have been connected so far. These works contribute to improving power sector efficiency and reliability and are improving the standards of living and fostering economic
                         growth in rural areas. However the achievement of the objective related to reducing electricity supply costs is at risk due to rising diesel fuel costs, unforeseen at appraisal. A study to
                         examine the present tariff structure and recommend an equitable tariff structure is recommended. Recently AusAID offered Additional Financing (AF) of US$5.3 million to (a) scale
                         up the rural electrification component; and (b) finance TAs related to training in tariff-setting and regulations and to the commercialization of efficient cook stoves under the National
                         Improved Cook Stove Program. Preparation work to gain approval of the AF is underway.

                         Regarding the GEF PDO, progress is poor as there is little done toward actual delivery of solar homes systems (SHS) and no progress on mini and village hydro plant. The SHS
                         may be pursued if the AusAID Additional Financing is approved and the closing date of the Credit is extended; however the mini and village hydro plants are not likely to be
                         constructed due to weak market demand from private companies.
