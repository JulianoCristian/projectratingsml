    and Transmission Project for Cambodia were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, and the Bank and the\n            Borrower performance were moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: 1. a well designed monitoring and\n            evaluation framework is essential for properly assessing the\n            real achievements of a project, and garnering support for\n            replication and future scale-up. 2. In order to make private\n            sector investments happen in renewable energy in rural\n            areas, the basic policy and regulatory enabling environment\n            should be complemented with carefully designed and well\n            targeted financing support, technical assistance and\n            capacity building. 3. Customized support for developing,\n            scaling up and sustaining productive uses is highly likely\n            to make a significant impact on the feasibility and\n            viability of rural electrification investments. 4. In\n            designing solar home system programs for rural areas, the\n            choice of appropriate system sizes based on robust upfront\n            analysis, suitable delivery approaches, and\n            post-installation operation and maintenance arrangements is\n            likely to have a significant bearing on the efficiency, cost\n            effectiveness, and sustainability of those programs."}, "docdt": "2012-08-30T00:00:00Z"}
