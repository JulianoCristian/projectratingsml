for Tunisia strengthens the institutional environment for\n            the delivery of municipal basic services and infrastructure.\n            There are two main components having several subcomponents.\n            The first component builds capacity for the Municipal\n            Development Fund (CPSCL) to provide funding for municipal\n            investments, including a credit line to CPSCL to finance\n            priority municipal investments; a credit line to CPSCL to\n            finance micro-projects; and technical assistance, training,\n            and studies to support its transformation into an autonomous\n            and financially-viable institution. The second component\n            comprises institutional strengthening of the government and\n            public entities. The sub-components support institutional\n            reform of the municipal training center, focusing on the\n            scope, and delivery of the training program; assist the\n            municipalities in strengthening their managerial and\n            financial capacity, providing computerization for tax\n            management purposes.
