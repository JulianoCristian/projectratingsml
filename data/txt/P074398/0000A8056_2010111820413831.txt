                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project closed on June 30, 2010. The total amount of the loan has now been disbursed.

                         The MG-6, a 29 million Euro contract to acquire solid waste for all of Tunisia's 264 municipalities has been successfully completed.

                         (i) The project achieved concrete and tangible results by contributing to the financing of the 5-year municipal investment plans (PIC) in all of the country's municipalities. This

                         translates in 1933 Km of roads and sidewalks, 79 Km of drainage and sanitation pipes, 36428 public lamps, 35 Km of water pipes, and 14 sanitary landfills, among other infrastructure
                         works.

                          (ii) The project also achieved very important targets regarding the development and implementation of municipal management tools, such as the systems for expense management
                         (ADEB) and income management (GRB), geographic information systems, and electronic payment. ADEB and GRB have been generalized to all the municipalities.

                          (iii) The project supported many national reforms such as the revision of the municipal organic law, the modification of laws and decrees concerning municipal taxation, the sustained
                         evolution of the central government transfers (FCCL), the undertaking of administrative measures to improve the municipal training institute (CFAD), and the development of
                         incentives to promote inter-municipalmanagement.

                         (iv) The project supported the modernization of CFAD, a key instrument in Tunisia's municipal strengthening efforts.

                         (v) The project achieved only partial success in developing a sustainable program of financial recovery for the many municipalities in financial distress. As was underlined in previous
                         ISRs, this goal was an especially ambitious and difficult one. The project supported the development of restructuring plans and subsequent contracts for municipalities in distress,
                         reaching 104 municipalities,and following closely a handful of those. Encouraging results are taking place in many municipalities but these do not translate yet into changes of
                         financial status, except for few municipalities. In restrospective, targets seem to have been too ambitious and unrealistic given the long term and intensive nature of municipal
                         restructuring.

                         Note: As per MNADE, the team would like to record that due to a system glitch, the information concerning Board restructuring is inaccurate.
