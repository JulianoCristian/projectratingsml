Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The objective of the second phase of the APL is to promote progress in coverage of
eight-year basic education and improved basic education quality by supporting the



                                             ii

implementation of the Basic Education Program. The second phase of the APL will
support the Basic Education Program during the three-year period 2002/03 - 2004/05. In
particular, activities supported through the second phase of the APL will concentrate on
increasing coverage and improving quality among the children of low-income families
and children with special needs. The project will also continue to extend opportunity to a
greater number of children to have access to Information and Communications
Technologies (ICTs) in basic education schools across the country.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)

1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank assistance)

Operational context
The Bank's engagement in Turkey's education sector began in the early 1980s and eight loans
have been made since that time.1 The early projects focused on vocational education and training,
but over time, the priority shifted to projects supporting broader reform of the education system.
Over the past two and a half decades, a collaborative relationship with Government has
developed and the World Bank continues to work with the Government of Turkey in a strong
partnership on education issues. However, it must be noted that portfolio performance has been
challenging. The early projects in the sector, e.g., the two Industrial Training Projects, the two
Vocational Training Projects and the National Education Development Project, all had serious
implementation problems. In 1997, as a result of lagging projects overall in the Bank-financed
program, Turkish Treasury requested and the Bank agreed to institute a joint Remedial Action
Plan, including cancellation of poor performing projects, tightening of procurement and
disbursement procedures, and increased Bank task management delegation to the field office,
including sign off authority for procurement and disbursement. These actions did lead to some
improvements in the overall portfolio. However, persistent issues remain within the education
sector where implementation remains slow and the implementation environment continues to be
relatively weak, mainly due to cumbersome organizational structures and uneven institutional
capacity.

Sector background
Educational attainment of Turkey's population and labor force was by far the lowest of all the
OECD countries before the Government's Basic Education Program was launched in 1997.
Indeed, in 1997, virtually all children in other OECD countries completed at least eight years of
schooling, but in Turkey, fewer than 90 percent of children completed the first five years of
schooling. Of those students who did complete the first five years, 45 percent - mostly girls - did
not pursue further education. Just 17 percent of Turkey's labor force had at least a secondary
education, versus an average of 60 percent across all the OECD countries. Fully 70 percent of the
labor force had only a five-year primary education or less. Ten percent of the labor force was
illiterate. The East and Southeast regions of Turkey lagged far behind the rest of the country in
educational attainment, with almost half of girls dropping out before completion of fifth grade in
some provinces. In particular, rural schools had problems with high turnover of teachers,
availability of educational materials, school attendance, and educational performance. As far as
the education quality is concerned, data from international comparative studies were not available
in 1997 to benchmark Turkey performance, but later in PIRLS 2001 and PISA 2003 Turkish
students performed well below the international averages.

In August 1997, Turkey's Parliament adopted the Basic Education Law No. 4306 which extended
the period of compulsory basic education from five years to eight years, mandated improved



1Industrial Training Projects 1 and 2, Vocational Training Projects 1 and 2, National Education
Development Project, Basic Education Project 1 and 2, and Secondary Education Project.

quality and relevance of basic education and raised new tax revenues to finance a significant
expansion of the education infrastructure to accommodate the expected increase in basic
education enrollments. Enactment of this law was followed by the launch of Government's Basic
Education Program to support the objectives and provisions stipulated by the law. In 1998, the
Bank was requested to provide support to this new legislation with two projects, Basic Education
Adaptable Program Loan 1 (BEP1) which became effective in 1998 (US$300 million loan), and
the follow-on project, BEP2 (US$300 million) which became effective in October 2002.

Government's Basic Education Program comprised a broad range of actions, financed largely by
the Government, but also by major private contributions. In 2002, total annual expenditures for
the Basic Education Program, including all investment and recurrent costs that directly support
basic education, were estimated at over US$3 billion annually. The Program included
construction of new schools, refurbishment of existing schools, and provision of educational
equipment and materials, including computer equipment, free textbooks and lunches for poor
students, daily bussing for students from villages without school (or with a school without grades
6-8). The Program also supported an increase in the salaries of teachers and other educational
staff, and recruitment and training of additional teachers and educational staff to expand school
capacity.

The first phase of the APL (BEP1, Loan 4355-TU) financed a subset of the Government's Basic
Education Program. The US$300 million provided under the first APL supported the following
activities: a) refurbishment and enlargement of rural basic education schools; b) provision of
educational materials to all rural schools; c) introduction of information and communication
technology (ICT) classes in rural and urban basic schools; d) in-service training for basic
education teachers and school inspectors; e) monitoring and evaluation; and f) reconstruction of
earthquake-damaged schools and other earthquake recovery actions. The main outputs of BEP1
were as following: a large number of schools were renovated, and new facilities were
constructed; the project provided over 2,800 schools with computer classrooms; about 8,000
education staff were trained out of initially planned 333,000 people; and a large number of
educational materials were provided to the schools. However, the project did not demonstrate
impact on the quality and relevance of education and did not succeed in developing a sound
monitoring and evaluation system. The Closing Date for the first phase of the APL was extended
from June 2001 to December 2003, mainly to allow enough time to complete procurement of
educational materials and to deliver civil works. Despite the fact that the project disbursed 95.5
percent of the loan funds (US$ 286.5 million), the Outcomes, as well as Bank and Borrower
Performance were rated "Unsatisfactory" in the ICR. In terms of Outcomes, the ICR concluded
that the project contributed to expansion of enrollment but failed to train large number of teachers,
central and provincial capacity to implement the program was not improved and mechanisms to
monitor and evaluate project performance were not established. Moreover, there was no evidence
of improved quality and relevance of education. Complex and time consuming procurement
clearance procedures in the MONE and Ministry of Finance together with poor performance of
the Bank during project preparation and supervision jeopardized project implementation.

Despite problematic implementation of BEP1, in fact there had been major progress in achieving
one of the main objectives of the Basic Education Program ­ to increase coverage. Enrollments
in basic education have increased by 1.5 million since the start of the Program, raising the gross
enrollment ratio for eight-year basic education from 85.6 percent in 1997 to 96.6 percent in
2001.2 Enrollments in grade 6, which became mandatory for the first time in 1998, increased by

more than 30 percent. In rural areas, the gains were dramatic: boys' enrollments in grade six
increased by 62 percent and girls' enrollments increased by 162 percent. The rate of enrollment
growth for girls was at least 50 percent greater than for boys in each of the years since the
passage of the Law.3

Despite this progress, by 2002 there were still about half a million children of basic education age
who were not in schools. For the most part, these children lived in rural areas, where there was
generally sufficient school capacity in grades one through five. But many village primary schools
required investments to upgrade facilities, provide better educational materials, and train teachers
in order to raise quality and to attract children who were not attending school. For grades six
through eight, the situation was different. At this level, there were remaining investment needs
throughout the country for expanded infrastructure. In view of the dispersion of the rural
population, there were recurrent budget needs to bus students to central schools in the upper
grades of basic education and to operate boarding schools for students from very remote villages.

As far as the education quality is concerned, some urban basic education schools and a few rural
schools were severely overcrowded, and investments in expanded capacity were needed in order
to reduce crowding. Further investments were also needed to extend the effort of providing all
students with equal access to ICT. In terms of international benchmarking, Turkey performed
below international averages in PIRLS 2001, and PISA 2003 and 2006. However, in PISA 2006
Turkey results were above averages for few countries with similar level of economic
development, i.e. Bulgaria, Brazil, Mexico, and Romania.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The objective of the second phase of the APL (BEP2) was to promote progress in coverage of
eight-year basic education and improved basic education quality by supporting the
implementation of the Basic Education Program. BEP2 was to support the Basic Education
Program during the three-year period 2002/03 - 2004/05. Activities supported through the second
phase of the APL were to concentrate on increasing coverage and improving quality of education
particularly among the children of low-income families and children with special needs. The
project was also to continue to extend opportunity to a greater number of children to have access
to ICT in basic education schools across the country.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

No revisions were made to the PDO or key project indicators.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,
(original and revised, briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD
and as captured in the PDO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected
to benefit from the project)

The ultimate beneficiaries were expected to be young people who would have improved access to
higher quality basic education under the Project. Special emphasis was to be placed on children
from low-income families, including households in low-income areas around large cities
(gecekondu areas) and children with disabilities. The Project also specified girls in the East and
Southeast as the target audience.

Teachers were also meant to benefit from the improved training and incentives, as well as
mothers of children who would be better equipped to provide for their children's health and
education needs because of the Project. Also, provincial education administrations were to benefit
from strengthened capacity to diagnose, implement and manage programs to meet their needs.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The project included five components.

Component 1. Extending Basic Education Coverage (Bank financing US$112.37 million) was to
continue rehabilitation and extension of rural schools and schools in low-income areas around
large cities (gecekondu areas) to improve school attendance. It was to finance the construction of
new preschool classrooms in existing basic education schools, and renovation and extension of
schools for children with special needs.


                                                 4

Component 2. Improved Basic Education Quality (Bank financing US$165.45 million) was to
continue investments to equip basic education schools with ICT classrooms, to equip remote rural
schools with modest computer facilities, to develop an online education portal, and to provide
educational materials to schools in low-income areas around large cities (gecekondu areas). It was
also to initiate support for expanded formal preschool education and education of children with
special needs. In addition, support to nonformal education in early childhood development for
mothers was to be provided to ensure better chances of success in basic education for children
from educationally deprived households.

Component 3. Delivery of Basic Education Program (Bank financing US$16.05 million) was to
provide ICT in-service training to tutors to provide teachers with basic computer skills and to
assist them to utilize ICT to improve instruction, to inspectors to assist them provide pedagogical
ICT support to schools, and to assist computer instructors to utilize the existing ICT classrooms
to their full potential. In addition, specially designed in-service training courses were to be
delivered to teachers of children with special needs and to preschool teachers and trainers of
mothers in early childhood development.

Component 4. Project Implementation Support (Bank financing, US$1.43 million) was to finance
consultant services (particularly in the areas of project management, procurement management,
financial management, reporting and communication, ICT and construction) and provision of
office equipment, training and incremental operating costs to upgrade implementation capacity.

Component 5. Monitoring and Evaluation (Bank financing, US$1.70 million) was to support
studies and assessments of the outcomes of the Program against performance indicators, and
provide continuous feedback to Program management to improve the effectiveness of the
Program. In particular, the loan was to support semi-annual reviews of the Basic Education
Program and the second phase of the APL by Government and the World Bank.

1.6 Revised Components

Overall, project components were not revised. However, a significant change in the project took
place towards the end of the project implementation with the cancellation of the educational
software under Component 2 worth US$19 million. The procurement of this software was not
completed under the project. The main reason was uncertainty and lack of agreement within
Ministry of National Education (MONE) Directorates and Board of Education (BoE) about
technical requirements to the software and areas of curriculum to be supported. Finally, MONE
decided that they would finance the software from their own budget (not loan) and the funds were
cancelled. In the end, while MONE did not purchase the expected software, some educational
software was procured at the provincial level using BEP2 funds. Moreover, based on the ICR
sites visits, many schools seem to have obtained educational software from other sources. Also,
there was no agreement reached within MONE on the design of the educational portal and
electronic decision support system, envisaged under the project. These activities were not carried
out under the project but they were financed later from the national budget.

1.7 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)




                                                 5

There were several changes made during the course of the project, in addition to the one
discussed directly above. A significant change was made in terms of loan allocations during the
project. The amount of funds originally allocated to "Civil works" was increased from the
original US$100 million to US$174.5 million during the course of the project by three Loan
amendments, and the categories of "Goods" and "Unallocated" were correspondingly reduced.
There are several reasons for the increase.        New earthquake safety regulations for school
constructions, renovations and retrofitting were introduced in 2003 after the Bingol earthquake
which increased unit costs of civil works significantly (by up to 50 percent by estimations of
experts and officials). The strengthening of the Turkish Lira against US dollar also affected prices
of many contracts. Moreover, there was a general increase in market prices for civil works and
initial price estimations proved to be very modest. Despite significantly increased loan allocations
to civil works the number of schools which were rehabilitated under the project was lower than
expected (details are available in the Data sheet).

The standard disbursement percentage was increased to 100 percent for all the categories by
second Loan Amendment. This change contributed to significant decrease in the amount of
Borrower cofinancing from originally planned US$56.86 million to US$0.25 million.

Teacher training activities in the area of ICT were not conducted under Component 3 as planned.
The MONE decided to reallocate some funds from ICT related training to training of subject
teachers in new curriculum, as the demand in this area was urgent and considered as a priority. In
the ICT area, while the project focused on training ICT tutors (trainers or "formators"), a
significant number of teachers were trained in ICT but financed by Government.

The project was restructured in June 2005 in order to overcome implementation inefficiencies
caused by long and complicated procedures of agreeing on the terms of references and contracts
at the national level (i.e. between MONE Directorates and Board of Education). As part of the
restructuring, provincial authorities were delegated responsibilities to conduct minor
procurements on the local level without involving BOE, which significantly improved the project
implementation.

The project Closing Date was extended twice (from February 28, 2006 to February 28, 2007, and
then to August 31, 2007). The main rational for the first extension was to compensate for the
delay and to enable the project to complete planned activities (details provided in section 2.2).
The second extension was given in order to complete remaining contracted works.                 The
extensions turned out to be fully justified. During this additional time the project team was able to
commit and disburse roughly US$250 million.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

The preparation of BEP2 started during the course of BEP1 implementation. The overall
preparation process was very inclusive, and the Government and the Bank team maintained
continuous dialogue regarding ways to ensure that the project was designed in the most suitable
way in order to support the Government reform agenda. Moreover, visible efforts were made to
improve on the previous deficiencies of BEP1 implementation. For example, as suggested by the
Quality Enhancement Review (QER) which took place in December 2000, an effort was made to



                                                  6

develop a sound monitoring and evaluation system by introducing an improved and
comprehensive results framework and adding to the project design a set of studies to measure
project outcomes. Also, the team made an effort to ensure that the results framework was more
outcome-oriented (which was not the case under BEP1). There were a number of additional
recommendations provided by the QER many of which were accepted by the team in order to
improve the project design. The QER also concluded that the triggers for the second phase of the
APL would be met by the completion of APL1, except for trigger four which required proper
monitoring and a social assessment to be conducted.

Thus, the design of BEP2 built on the work started under BEP1, in support of the Government
Basic Education program. The Government of Turkey explicitly requested that BEP2 should
address a wide variety of issues and goals, as outlined in the Basic Education Program. As a
result, the design of BEP2 turned out to be complex. The Bank could have done a better job in
encouraging the Government to keep the design simpler (perhaps with focus on one or two key
components), and this could have been a very important value added by the Bank in ensuring
efficient implementation. However, the simplicity was not ensured. This complex large-scale
project with diverse activities and multiple responsible parties (i.e. 11 MONE Directorates)
required strong implementation capacity. However, as was discussed at the beginning of this ICR,
the operating environment in MONE remained challenging and project complexity only
exacerbated difficulties in the speed of the project's implementation. Unfortunately, the project
design did not specifically address this issue and more attention should have been paid to develop
better project management skills, and better arrangements to facilitate decision making and
clearance procedures in MONE. On the other hand, the Bank team could have predicted that
implementing such a complex projects with large scale civil works would require an
implementation period longer than 3.5 years and could have proposed a more realistic
implementation timeline to the Government. Unfortunately, the complexity of project design was
not counterbalanced by a comprehensive set of mitigations and arrangements.

In June 2003, the Quality Assessment Group (QAG) conducted a Quality At Entry review for the
project. The review rated both the Project and Bank Inputs and Processes as "Marginally
Satisfactory" (rating of 3). The QAG identified a number of issues that needed improvement,
among which the following main weaknesses were pointed out: (i) insufficient formal sector
analysis was done to support preparation; (ii) the risk assessment was not well thought-through;
(iii) weak measures were envisaged to draw in the remaining children who were not enrolled into
the education system; and (iv) measures to maximize benefits to the poorest and most vulnerable
were uncertain.

Indeed, a number of these issues were correctly identified as weaknesses during the preparation
and some of them were addressed during the implementation. With respect to sector work, no
formal piece of sector work was carried out but this project was second in a series of operations
and Government priorities were clear and the Bank was already fully engaged in its support of the
Basic Education Program. The poor assessment of project risks is a fact. Indeed, a risk of not
having sufficient implementation capacity in place during the project implementation was not
mentioned in the risks section. Considering that this was one of the weaknesses under BEP1, the
Bank team could have done a better job to ensure that capacity building was given a more
prominent role in the project. In addition, another important risk which should have been taken
into consideration during preparation, as was mentioned earlier, is the earthquake safety situation
in Turkey. This is particularly poignant because the Bank already had experience in assisting
Turkey in responding to the Marmara earthquake in the summer of 1999 in a variety of areas,
including education. Unfortunately, BEP2 did not take this into account in the design of its
school reconstruction and construction program. As a result, additional school retrofitting


                                                 7

activities had to be introduced during the implementation to include the new earthquake safety
requirements. These changes significantly increased the costs of the civil works and hence
reduced the number of schools that eventually were financed by the project. As far as drawing in
the children who were not enrolled, the project design addressed the issues of making schools
more accessible for students with special needs, i.e. additional schools for this target group were
constructed, and special accessibility facilities were introduced to a number of basic schools. The
issue of girls' education was addressed through education of mothers of preschool age children,
particularly through exposing parents to the benefits of providing girls with basic education;
however, no specific measures were planned to enroll girls of school age and to retain children in
the education system till the end of the basic cycle. The project design envisaged measures to
improve large number of schools in poor rural and urban areas. Schools to be supported under
BEP2 were carefully selected by the Government and one of the main criteria was location in low
income areas.

2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and actions
taken, as applicable)

BEP2 faced many internal and external issues during its life and the project implementation
environment was challenging, but MONE managed to overcome most of the obstacles and BEP2
was fully disbursed and delivered a large number of outputs.

It must be stressed that BEP1 was under the final stage of implementation when BEP2 was
launched, and two projects were under implementation for the whole year of 2003. It was very
difficult for MONE to keep the new large project in focus while it was ensuring successful
completion of the ongoing operation. Indeed, the start of BEP2 was precarious. The Government
changed two months after project effectiveness (in December 2002). Consequently, several
internal changes took place at MONE with a number of the consequences affecting BEP2
implementation, i.e. lack of familiarity with the project and Bank procedures, including
procurement, and a general lack of ownership of the operation designed by predecessors. Indeed,
the new Ministry of National Education reviewed the project design and proposed adjustments in
some of the project activities. Later, a few consultations were conducted internally and with the
Bank staff to clarify questions on the project objectives and design. At the end of 2003, however,
the Government confirmed its commitment to the initial project objectives and informed the Bank
that it would not request any significant changes in the design of BEP2.

Moreover, the new budget law was enacted in 2003, requiring all external donor funding to be
included within the Government budget. An immediate impact of the new legislation was that the
2003 budget was provisional in nature, and no resources were allocated for the project
investments. Another reason for lack of funding allocations during the first implementation year
was the request from SPO to evaluate BEP1 results and impact first, and only after that commit to
the new project. While it is a reasonable request to learn the lessons of previous operation, it shall
be noted that BEP1 was still under implementation, making results evaluation challenging. As a
result, only a very limited number of activities were initiated in 2003.

When BEP2 began its implementation in 2003, the implementation was slow and only about ten
percent of the loan was disbursed by mid 2006. There were three systemic reasons for delays in
implementation. The first reason relates to the complexity of decision making and clearance
procedures on the Government side. Different departments of the MONE, including the Board of
Education, are involved in decision making regarding most of the activities and procurement
exercises. As a result, reaching an agreement was not an easy and smooth process. Also, the lack


                                                  8

of cross-communication and coordination across Directorates and BOE and heavy use of complex
committees and working groups exacerbated the situation.

A good example of the cumbersome decision making process in MONE is the procurement of
educational materials. By MONE procedures, all decisions in the area of curriculum and teaching
and learning materials have to be approved by the Board of Education. This influential body in
the MONE provides expertise and ensures quality control of all relevant documents. Evaluation
criteria and procedures are complex, demanding and sometimes difficult to interpret, making it
challenging for Directorates to develop reasonable specifications acceptable to the BOE. As a
result, development of the specifications for educational materials took much longer time than
was initially planned and many of the materials were excluded from procurement on the national
level (most of them were later procured on provincial level). In fact, the same difficulties in
reaching an agreement between Directorates and BOE and getting BOE's approval resulted in
cancellation of educational software from the project.

The Bank team was familiar with these complex procedures and arrangements and could have
provided better support to the implementation through more ongoing dialog with MONE
regarding concrete technical issues that prevented MONE from reaching agreements. More
extensive consultations regarding technical issues and just-in-time technical advice during first
years of the project life could have been helpful in accelerating the implementation.

The second reason for implementation delays relates to insufficient implementation capacity and
comprises of several issues: (i) capacity to plan complex activities is not fully developed within
MONE; (ii) organizational structure makes it difficult for implementing units to accept
accountability, control the necessary human and material resources, and recognize ownership of
the results; (iii) relevant procedures and tools for monitoring and evaluating the implementation
are missing; and (iv) lack of familiarity of MONE staff with Bank procurement procedures,
especially with the selection of consultants. Following project restructuring in 2005, MONE and
the Project Coordination Center (PCC) staff took project management courses which had a
positive effect on the implementation.4

The third obstacle to smooth implementation was the unclear role of the Project Coordination
Center (PCC) within the MONE. The PCC was supposed to coordinate implementation activities
between different line units of MONE, external Government bodies and the Bank, while the
project was to be implemented by MONE. The PCC faced difficulties in coordinating project
implementation, mainly because it was not fully integrated into the Ministry structure and the
official status of the PCC staff was not sufficiently high to accelerate decision making in the
MONE. Despite its formal coordination function, in reality the PCC was responsible for many
daily implementation aspects backing up MONE Directorates.

Moreover, there was another objective external reason which affected implementation of
construction works under BEP2. All regulations in the area of school construction and
renovation were revised after the earthquake in Bingol in May, 2003. The changes in the
regulations and construction procedures were crucial to ensure school safety against the
earthquakes. New regulations were developed by late 2004 giving no possibility to launch civil
works under the project in time. After regulations were revised, consultancy services were



4PCC was established to coordinate implementation of international projects (including those financed
through the Bank loans) between different line units of the MONE, other Government bodies and
international organizations.


                                                     9

contracted under BEP2 to examine all the schools in Turkey to identify needs for retrofitting and
renovations. This exercise was necessary but time-consuming. Consequently, new specifications
were developed under the project to match new earthquake safety regulations and support
retrofitting of selected schools throughout the country. MONE made a tremendous effort in
introducing these changes which allowed to improve the quality of the civil works, ensure school
safety and address the school needs better. However, a natural price to pay for these
improvements was postponed launch and a significant increase in costs of the construction works.

To address these issues and delays in implementation, a practice of regular (monthly and semi-
monthly) meetings between MONE, PCC and the Bank was introduced in 2005 to discuss and
resolve areas which were delayed. The agreements of these meetings were closely followed up
both on the Government and Bank sides. This led to some improvements in implementation pace
but mainly affected small contracts. Preparation of major procurements of construction works and
goods still suffered from long and complex decision making processes inside the MONE and,
sometimes, insufficient quality of technical specifications.

As mentioned previously, the project was restructured in June 2005 at the time of the planned
Mid-Term Review. The main purpose of the restructuring was to address implementation
inefficiencies by enabling local authorities to procure minor goods and civil works. The threshold
for minor works was raised for this purpose. Giving more autonomy for procurement at the local
level helped to speed up procurement as the documentation did not have to go through reviews of
BOE and MONE Directorates but only through the procurement unit of the PCC. Moreover, it
became easier to address specific schools' needs which are more visible on the local level (for
example, schools provided lists of educational materials they needed to provincial authorities; the
consolidated lists were then converted into specifications and materials got procured through
simple shopping procedures). A formal Mid-Term Review was never conducted because there
was little progress made by the project until the middle of 2005, and the restructuring was carried
out instead. The Bank conducted regular supervision missions once every 4 to 6 months, as well
as supervision meetings (in country and by videoconferences) to accelerate implementation.
Project progress and ongoing issues were under constant attention of the Bank team.

In the end, despite all the difficulties and the significant delays which the project experienced
throughout its life, most of the project activities were implemented in the last 18 to 24 months and
the loan was fully disbursed (US$280 million), except for the US$19 million which were
cancelled.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

BEP2 had a separate component devoted to monitoring and evaluation. The component was
designed to monitor progress in project implementation as well as general development of the
education system towards improving education quality. The results framework had relevant
outcome indicators to capture progress towards improving education quality and access to ICT,
however, the objective to extend education coverage was not as well reflected by the outcome
indicator and the end of the project target related to coverage was not clear enough. A number of
relevant studies were planned under BEP2 to evaluate project impact. Output indicators were well
designed to monitor progress of the key project activities. However, in some cases, end of the
project targets were too specific; for example, the target for training special needs education staff
specifies 628 administrators to be trained.

While the results framework was sensible overall, the implementation arrangements for M&E
activities were not well thought-through. Despite the fact that a special unit was organized in the


                                                   10

PCC to monitor project progress, in the reality M&E functions were spread between different
Directorates in the MONE and units in the PCC. MONE Directorates collected information
regarding progress under relevant contracts and submitted to the PCC, while the PCC was
preparing regular progress reports for the Bank. The PCC developed a useful tool to monitor
progress in civil works and goods and managed to collect reliable information about progress in
procuring these two categories. However, the data regarding consultancy services procured under
the project, including teacher training were often incomplete and inconsistent, and obtaining data
to track relevant project indicators has proven to be challenging. Indeed, the MONE and PCC
evaluated progress of the project against inputs (i.e. number of signed contracts, amounts of
committed and disbursed funds) rather than outputs. The short period of actual implementation
limited opportunities for monitoring the progress towards outcome indicators. Baseline studies for
the project outcomes were conducted with significant delays closer to the project completion,
allowing no time for follow up studies and proper reflection of the lessons learned. In order to
receive objective information regarding project achievements and outcomes, the Bank team
requested MONE to conduct a Beneficiary Survey for BEP2. A comprehensive study was carried
out straight after the project completion and the results were made available in mid-December
2007. Moreover, the MONE demonstrated a strong desire to evaluate the long-term impact of
both stages of the APL on access to and quality of education and agreed with the Bank to include
a special evaluation study into the ongoing Secondary Education Project in Turkey.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)

Safeguard. The project design did not identify any significant environmental risks, connected
with the civil works under the project, and indeed, no environmental issues of note presented
themselves during project implementation. School construction was done in accordance with the
Handbook for Basic Education School Buildings which was developed during the preparation of
BEP2. Moreover, all civil works were carried out in accordance with the agreed Environmental
Management Plan and were closely supervised by independent civil works supervisors which
were hired to monitor the completion of works as well as their quality. There were no
resettlement or land acquisition issues as a result of project investments.

Procurement. Procurement activities under BEP2 were carried out in compliance with the
guidelines, and the efficiency of procurement improved during the course of the project. MONE
and PCC have successfully overcome most of obstacles and procurement capacity increased in
MONE and PCC during the implementation period. One area of procurement which has been
particularly difficult is selection of consultants because of lack of experience of MONE officials
in procuring consultancy services under the Bank guidelines. Close follow up and assistance from
the Bank procurement specialists helped to resolve the issues.

Financial Management. Overall, the financial management aspects of the projects were handled
efficiently with no significant issues identified. A solid financial monitoring basis was developed
under BEP1, and then improved and successfully utilized under BEP2. However, there were some
minor procedural issues which sometimes caused delays in payments to the contractors.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by
present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional
capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)




                                                  11

While there is no post-completion operation planned at this moment, a good policy dialogue on
the quality of education is being held between the Government and the Bank. Arrangements for
sustaining reforms and Government expenditures for the education sector are discussed in section
4. The main physical infrastructure that the project helped to build was preschool classrooms. The
Government keeps preschool education in focus of the sector development agenda which ensures
that the infrastructure created will be properly maintained. In accordance with the law,
municipalities have to allocate at least 20 percent of their budgets to the education sector, and
provincial authorities which are in charge for maintaining the infrastructure provide regular
annual allocations appropriate for keeping school premises in good condition. As far as
implementation capacity is concerned, the key PCC staff who were involved in BEP2
implementation were retained and are currently assigned to implementing the Secondary
Education Project, financed from the Bank loan.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

Relevance of Objectives
BEP2 supported the central CAS objective: "to help Turkey meet its goals of improving living
standards and reducing economic vulnerability and poverty". Financing under the project
contributed to two of the five themes of the CAS: it supported the first of these, "to expand social
services and social protection", by improving coverage of basic education throughout the country.
It supported the second theme, "to accelerate connectivity and technological capabilities", by
financing introduction of computer assisted teaching and learning in basic education schools. The
CAS for 2004-2006 highlighted the contribution of BEP1 and BEP2 to achieving Governments
objective to improve access to education and education quality.

When the project was prepared, coverage was still an issue even though Turkey was making
progress in this area. Gross enrollment rate in grades one thorough eight increased from 85.6 in
1997 to 96.4 percent in 2002 following enactment of Basic Education Law.5 However, ECA and
other middle income countries on average typically show gross basic education enrollments rates
at around 100 percent. Education quality was and still is a key issue in Turkey. Turkey was well
below the international average in PIRLS 2001 study, and later in PISA 2003. A large proportion
of schools suffered from a lack of basic learning materials, including books, and researchers
reported low qualifications of teachers. BEP1 contributed to improved access to ICT, however,
both access and educational use of the technologies was very limited when compared to OECD
countries. Therefore these areas were included into the design of BEP2.

Relevance of design and implementation
Overall, project design included 5 components and generally reflective of the PDOs. In relation
to quality of education and access to ICT, the project design fully addressed the relevant
objectives. Key inputs needed to ensure basic aspects of education quality were covered by the
project: provision of educational materials, training teachers, renovating school premises,
ensuring schools' safety, etc. Access to ICT was ensured for greater number of students through
equipping schools with computer equipment and training staff; new technologies were utilized to
develop ICT literacy among students and to enhance teaching of basic curricula.

The objective to improve eight-year basic education coverage, however, was probably an over-
statement because the actual design of the first component "Extending Basic Education
Coverage" included measures to improve coverage but was limited to constructing new
preschools and special needs education classes in low-income areas. In fact, the more specific
part of the PDO does state that measures to increase coverage would be concentrated on students
from low-income families and students with special needs. Unfortunately, the results framework
was relatively vague in relation to measuring the PDO on coverage. Outcome Indicator #1
captures "the number of students benefiting as a result of renovated or new educational facilities",
whereas, the indicator should have been specific with respect to measuring the increase in
coverage. The preparation team was aware that at the beginning of APL2, the net enrolment rate
was just above 90 percent, which means that there was a limited share of children not covered by
education services. Targeting relatively limited groups of children excluded from the education
system would be very difficult to achieve for a variety of reasons. Anecdotal evidence, however,
suggests that this group consists mainly of children from poorest areas and girls from eastern and
south eastern parts of the country, where the issue of girls' education seems to be socially and
politically sensitive. It must be noted, that one of the reasons why BEP2 did not include extensive
measures to fully address the issue of coverage was that there was another Bank loan under
implementation in Turkey (at the same time with BEP2 implementation), which financed
activities promoting education coverage among children from poorest families with special focus
on girls. Indeed, Social Risk Mitigation Project was launched in 2003, and it introduced
conditional cash transfer (CCT) system. One of the conditions for the transfers was appropriate
level of school attendance by children. During 2003-2006, this project provided incentives for
families of more than 1 million of school age children.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on
outputs in Annex 2)

MONE utilized the project to support its education development agenda and to extend the scale of
improvements in access to quality basic education in Turkey. In spite of delays in launching most
of the activities under BEP2, significant results were achieved during a rather limited
implementation period (the last 24 months).

For the analysis of progress towards achieving the PDO the objective can be presented in three
sub-objectives:
    (i)     extended coverage of basic education;
    (ii)    improved quality of basic education; and
    (iii) extended access to ICT for basic education students.
The first two objectives were to focus on children of low-income families and children with
special needs.6




6The results framework and outcome indicators (OI) suggest assessing achievement of the PDO through
the number of students benefiting from renovated or new educational facilities (OI#1), students improved
performance due to new educational materials and staff training (OI#2 and 3), children improved school
readiness due to preschool staff training and mothers educational programs (OI#4 and 5), and students
using ICT for learning (OI#6). Quantitative progress towards the targets is presented in the Data Sheet and
qualitative aspects of the achievements are discussed in this section.



                                                    13

Progress against these objectives was assessed by several means. The beneficiary survey was
conducted in Autumn 2007 to evaluate the progress of BEP2. In total, 1,825 interviews were
conducted with headmasters, teachers, parents and students from schools supported under the
project in 12 provinces. Moreover, in order to evaluate project impact, 14 project sites were
visited during ICR mission, over 50 headmasters, teachers, parents and officials at the provincial
level were interviewed. On the national level, meetings and interviews were conducted with
officials of eight key MONE Directorates involved in the project, officials from State Planning
Organization and PCC staff.

(i) Extended coverage of basic education.
Extended coverage (or "progress in coverage") means that more children are enrolled into the
education system. This target with particular focus on grades one to eight and students from low
income families and children with special needs is included into the development objective.

However, this PDO is difficult to measure because of two reasons. The first reason is the
following. This objective is reflected in the Outcome Indicator #1: "More than 350,000 students
benefit as a result of renovated or new educational facilities", and this indicator only partially
captures the objective of increasing education coverage. In fact, two objectives are mixed in the
indicator: i) enrolling additional children in the basic education, and ii) providing students
already enrolled in the system with access to improved education infrastructure and facilities.
Detailed end-of-project targets are set up in the results framework for this indicator, but they do
not separate two categories of the beneficiaries (target groups). Thus, it is challenging to estimate
the intended impact of the project on coverage in quantitative terms. The second reason is that,
the objective itself sounds too ambitious, considering the number and substance of the activities
planned under the project and targeted to extending education coverage. These activities under
Component #1 "Extending Basic Education Coverage" included: i) constructing new preschool
classes, and ii) constructing classes for special needs education. Also, the special emphasis was
placed on low income rural and urban areas.7

In spite these difficulties, there is evidence of progress towards improving basic education
coverage. Thus, nine new school buildings (with 8 classrooms each) for special needs education
were constructed under the project (the target was to construct 20 new buildings). This
investment provided access to basic education for approximately 1,800 students with special
needs.8 As reported by officials, most of these children had limited (home schooling supported by
visiting teachers) or no access to formal education before the project. Moreover, facilities for
special needs students were constructed in 109 basic schools, i.e. ramps, proper toilets and




7No investments were planned to other areas which typically lead directly to extended coverage, i.e.
recruiting teachers, providing incentives for families, bussing children to schools, etc. However, as it was
mentioned in the section 3.1, Conditional Cash Transfer program was planned and implemented under
Social Risk Mitigation Project in 2003-2006; the program directly addressed the issue of education
coverage.

8The target for the relevant Outcome Indicator #1 is 14,800 students with special needs. The actual value
of 1,800 students specified here is lower because i) the target of 14,800 students include those students who
benefited from renovated schools (7 special education schools were renovated), ii) less schools were
constructed, i.e. 9 against the target of 20 (output indicator #7), and iii) special assess facilities for students
with limited physical capabilities were constructed in 109 basic schools, but there is no data available about
number of special needs students attending such schools and therefore these students are not included into
the actual value for the indicator.


                                                       14

elevators. This is very valuable achievement in improving access to education for children with
limited capabilities.

The major investment targeting better coverage was building new preschool classes (preschool
education is considered as part of basic education in Turkey). 169 preschool classrooms were
constructed as separate buildings, mainly in rural areas with low income population (the original
target was 300 schools). On average, these classrooms are attended by 24 children each, giving in
total about 4,000 children attending the new preschools.9 Before new classes were constructed,
preschool students attended classrooms located inside main school buildings, or, in rare cases had
no access to preschool education. Interviews with school administrators and preschool teachers
showed that having new separate and well-equipped buildings especially designed for young
children helped in developing positive attitudes to preschool education among parents. Some
preschools reported a small increase in enrolments during current school year and they do expect
a more visible increase in school year 2008/09. New preschool classes have a capacity to
accommodate greater number of students. Most of the construction works were done with high
quality, which was acknowledged by officials at the national and provincial level and by direct
beneficiaries, i.e. teachers and headmasters. All new preschools were properly furnished and
equipped under BEP2.

Taking into account that BEP2 was supporting Government's Basic Education Program, which
also targets better coverage of basic education, it is important to mention progress in this area
achieved beyond the direct project interventions. As a result of continuous efforts of MONE,
basic education enrolment increased by more than 500,000 students during the course of the
BEP2 (from 2002 to 2007). However, due to growing school age population in Turkey, there was
no increase in enrolment rates during the period of 2002-2007: net rate slightly decreased from
90.98 percent in 2002/03 school year to 90.13 in 2006/07, and gross rate did not change, - 96.45
and 96.34 percent respectively. The share of girls to boys in basic education increased from 91.1
percent in 2002/03 to 94.1 percent in 2006/07.10 Net enrolment rate for preschool education
increased dramatically from 11 percent in 2002 to 25 percent in 2006/2007 school year reaching
the target set in Government's 9th Five Years Development Plan.11

Finally, considering the number of improved, extended, renovated and retrofitted schools (over
480 schools together with those newly constructed), the coverage of children by schools of higher
quality did improve as a result of the project. This is an important achievement, especially taking
into account that the issue of access to quality education always comes to the front once universal
access to regular educational services is ensured. Better equipped, renovated, less crowded and
safe schools staffed with well trained teachers are well received and contribute to developing
positive attitude towards education among parents and local communities. These improvements in
the education quality are discussed below.

Overall, the rating for this development objective is moderately satisfactory.



9Data from Project Completion Report. Observations during visits to two rural preschools gave an average
of 12 students been present in classes. The actual value of 4,000 students is lower that the target of 12,000
specified in the Outcome Indicator #1. This is due to the fact that i) less schools were constructed, i.e. 166
against the target of 300 (output indicator #6), and ii) the initial target was too ambitious (300 schools with
24 student end up with 7,200 students who supposed to benefit from the new preschools).

(ii) Improved quality of basic education
Quality of education is traditionally considered as a combination of quality of conditions of
education and educational process, and quality of educational outputs and outcomes. As most of
the activities were implemented during the last 24 month of the project, there was not sufficient
time to determine the project impact on educational outcomes (such as improved students'
achievements in national and international tests, better key competences and skills, etc.).
However, there is evidence available from the beneficiary assessment and interviews for
assessing changes in quality of various components of education process and educational outputs.
Findings in these two areas are presented below.

The following major project interventions contributed to increasing quality of education process
and educational outputs:
     1) Improving and renovating school premises;
     2) Retrofitting school buildings to ensure earthquake safety;
     3) Constructing new classrooms (within existing schools);
     4) Providing students and teachers with educational materials;
     5) Providing teaching and learning materials for special needs education;
     6) Constructing new preschool premises separate from main school buildings and especially
        designed for early childhood education;
     7) Providing access to ICT for students and assisting in developing basic computer literacy;
     8) Providing mothers of future students with relevant educational materials regarding
        growing their children and preparing them for schooling; and
     9) Training teachers.

Quality of educational process and conditions of education.
A large number of schools (more than 310) was renovated under the project. Schools for
renovation were carefully selected and most of them were located in poor and remote areas.
Education authorities on the national level suggested that a large number of these schools are
geographically isolated and their improvement would have been delayed without the project
implementation. Almost all schools which were renovated were also retrofitted (just above 300).
Headmasters and officials also stressed the importance of retrofitting (earthquake safety) works
conducted under BEP2. Improved earthquake safety in the schools was highly appreciated by all
beneficiaries, including teachers and parents. As the result of the project, about 216,000 students
annually attend better, cleaner, well renovated and safe schools (the original target was 350,000
students, but because of the increased costs of civil works fewer number of schools and
consequently students were supported), including over 45,000 students in gecekondu areas.

It must be noted here, that for a number of output indicators dealing with construction works the
actual values are lower than the targets. As it was mentioned in the section 1.7, this is due to a
number of factors, including earthquake safety regulations increasing unit costs, the strengthening
of the Turkish Lira against US dollar, and a general increase in market prices for civil works
together with modest initial price estimations and ambitious targets.

School administration and provincial officials reported that new classrooms (over 180)
constructed under the project reduced the number of overloaded classes and in some cases
reduced the number of double shifts, which had positive implications for the quality of
educational process. One hundred out of these new classes were constructed in schools in poor
gecekondu areas, and over 70 in special needs schools.




                                                16

BEP2 provided large number of schools with educational materials. 2.45 million students attend
schools provided with the materials, including 2.39 million students in poor gecekondu areas. In
most cases, schools' needs were studied carefully and schools received those particular materials
that they were missing. Educational authorities on the provincial level and school staff reported
that the materials are intensively used and teachers were satisfied with them. Educational
materials for special needs education were provided to teachers and students, helping to address
specific needs of this sector of basic education. All beneficiaries appreciated this support and, in
many cases reported a positive impact of new materials on the students' performance.

Large number of educational staff was trained under the project (over 87,000), including teachers,
school inspectors, teacher trainers and administrators. The training covered a variety of topics,
including student-centered teaching, new educational technologies and practices, social aspects of
education, new curriculum, approaches to assessing school performance, etc. Most of the training
was conducted on the provincial level. Schools and teachers could choose training programs they
wanted to undertake and adjust professional development paths according to personal needs.
Teachers reported that the training received helped them in improving teaching practices, and in
introducing new methods of teaching. In general, they observed improvements in students'
performance after the new practices were applied in the classrooms.

New preschool classes (169) constructed under the project not only extended access to education
but also improved the quality of preschool education. Younger children now attend separate
classrooms especially designed to accommodate their needs. All preschool classes were well
equipped with appropriate furniture and learning materials. The buildings were constructed in
compliance with earthquake safety regulations.

The quality of educational outputs, including students' performance.
Under the Beneficiary Survey, headmasters and teachers evaluated the impact of the different
project interventions on the quality of educational outputs and reported visible impact. The
findings are presented below and grouped around key beneficiaries of the project. The impact was
attributed to different project interventions. Moreover, interviews with the stakeholders and
observations made during the sites visits correspond to the evidence available from the
Beneficiary Survey.

As a result of the project, basic education students improved their performance during lessons,
increased interest towards school and lessons, participated in lessons more actively, had more
equal access to computers, and improved computer / internet using skill. Special education
students improved writing, reading and mathematical skills (impact is attributed to hearing
devices and Braille typewriters), interactions and communication skills (impact is attributed to
hearing devices), and social and independent life skills. First year students whose parents
participated in "Mother and Child" education program when compared to other students
demonstrate better team working skills and help one another more regularly. They participate
more in classroom activities, are better at expressing their ideas within a group, give more respect
to fellow students' rights and are more aware of their own rights, follow the rules of school and
society better, and give importance to their personal care. Moreover, "Mother and Child"
education program supported by the project addressed the issue of girls' education by providing
mothers with relevant information and training.

The objective of improving quality was reflected in the outcome indicators 2, 3, 4 and 5, which
were designed to measure students' performance and preschool children's readiness for schooling.
Unfortunately, there are no data available to determine the exact numbers of students who



                                                 17

improved the performance or school readiness, but the results of beneficiary survey demonstrated
qualitative evidence of improvements in these two areas.

Thus, the project improved educational infrastructure and conditions of delivering educational
services, especially in poor areas, and demonstrated positive impact on teaching practices and
students' performance with special emphasis on students with special needs, and students from
poor areas. However, there are important shortcomings which keep the rating for this objective to
moderately satisfactory: i) the scale of achievement related to quality of education could have
been higher and closer to originally planned targets if the project was implemented according to
original schedule, and ii) data to measure project impacts on quality of educational outcomes
(such as improved students' achievements in national and international tests, better key
competences and skills, etc.) are not yet available due to insufficient time to collect such data.

(iii) Extended access to ICT for basic education students.
Under the project, 3000 schools (over 4000 classrooms) have received ICT hardware providing
access to ICT to more than 2.4 million students a year. Computer classrooms installed under
BEP2 made a visible difference in providing students with access to ICT and equipping students
and teachers from poor areas with basic ICT skills. During the site visits and under the
Beneficiary Survey, students and teachers reported greater opportunities for accessing ICT for
computer science lessons, as well as teaching and learning other subjects and performing
extracurricular activities (i.e. developing web-sites). Computer labs are extensively used for
improving students' computer literacy. There are positive examples of ICT use to support new
curriculum, and students' independent learning. The Outcome Indicator #6 for this objective
required 2 million of students to use ICT for learning and it was fulfilled.

School visits and meetings with teachers demonstrated that most of the teachers' demands for
formal training in ICT literacy and support in using ICT for teaching are met at local level
(outside the project). Ongoing support to teachers in using ICT is provided by tutors (instructors)
trained under the project. Local communities also appreciated the ICT equipment installed in
schools. For example, in one of the rural Erzurum provinces the head of parental committee
stressed that there were no opportunities for children to have public access to computers and
some of them visited parents' offices to search the internet to prepare homework and projects,
while other students did not have such opportunity. In contrast, now all children easily access ICT
in their own school. At the same time, the parents association helps the school with minor
computer supplies and maintenance, if needed.

Overall, the rating for this development objective is satisfactory.

3.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least cost,
and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)
The framework for financial or economic analysis was not set up in the Project Appraisal
Document. No cost benefit or economic analysis was done as indicated in the PAD. Quality At
Entry review panel stressed the lack of economic rational behind the project design. However,
four major studies were conducted by the Bank and OECD in 2005-2007, exploring education
sector efficiency issues.12 The studies did not have BEP2 as the specific focus but rather looked
into   the Government's education sector development program (Basic Education Program).

However, they do provide information for a rough assessment of education sector efficiency and
BEP2's contribution.

The following conclusions can be made when efficiency is considered in terms of the cost of
producing graduates of a given quality. Turkey increased public expenditures on primary,
secondary and post-secondary non-tertiary education as share of GDP from 1.7 percent in 1995 to
3.1 percent in 2004.13 These investments allowed Turkey to extend basic education coverage, - in
net terms the enrollment rate increased from 84.7 percent in 1997 to 90.1 percent in 2006.14 At
the same time, Turkey is ranked among poor performers in international assessments (PISA 2003
and 2006, PIRLS 2001) and average results of the students in annual national achievement tests
remained constant or showed very modest improvements during the recent years.15 It is important
to note, that it was a major achievement that school quality measured by annual learning
achievement tests did not decline during the rapid enrollment expansion. Thus, Turkey has
probably had very modest reductions in cost per quality graduate (owing to higher enrollments
and retentions) if at all, but clearly much more could be done. BEP2 has made a small
contribution to this efficiency gain (by raising quality of graduates) due to its small overall size
relative to the Government's program.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)
Rating: MS
The project was and remains relevant to basic education development agenda in Turkey and to
the CAS priorities. In terms of three main PDOs, BEP2 successfully addressed the issues of
increasing access to and use of ICT for learning, supported improving quality of basic education,
and contributed to extending basic education coverage by focusing on preschool education and
the vulnerable group of students with special needs. BEP2 has improved quality of educational
infrastructure, teachers' qualifications, and teaching and learning process. Moreover, there are
first modest indications of improved quality of outputs, i.e. student's skills, attitudes towards
learning, learning experience, teaching practices, etc. The most visible impact was done in the
area of special needs education were investments into increasing quality of educational process
lead to students' successes in learning. Students from rural areas, poor families and with special
needs were targeted by the project. BEP2 improved access to ICT for students and teachers and
the equipment is efficiently used. However, there are some important shortcomings that keep
progress towards achieving the PDO at moderately satisfactory rating: i) limited project impact
on increasing basic education coverage, ii) partial achievement of end of the project targets for
selected outputs, and iii) delays in implementation followed by postponed impact.

BEP2 improved educational infrastructure in poor rural and urban areas. The project impact on
education quality contributes to improving quality of human capital which is associated with
poverty decrease. Observations during school visits and interviews with school administration
(including in eastern territories) demonstrated that there are no internal barriers in the education
system limiting access to schooling for girls. "Mother and Child" educational program supported
under the BEP2 addressed the issue of girls' education by stressing the importance of providing
equal educational opportunities for both genders and explaining benefits girls receive from
completing basic education. All project activities supported boys and girls equally.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

Strengthening of institutional capacity was not among the project's primary or secondary
objectives. Nevertheless, some lessons of BEP1 were taken into account and PCC improved its
capacity, i.e. appropriate financial management system was established, it was adequately staffed,
and appropriate training was delivered to the personnel. The MONE and PCC staff improved
their procurement skills, as confirmed by the latest procurement post-review report. The capacity
of local education authorities in the area of procurement was also improved after appropriate
training and support were provided under the project. A practice of supervising civil works by an
independent consultancy firm was introduced during the project and strengthened the quality
assurance procedures in this area; officials from the MONE and the State Planning Organization
referred to this approach as positive and stressed the importance of disseminating this quality
assurance practice to all projects which include civil works.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

There were no unintended outcomes of this project.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)

A Beneficiary Survey was conducted for BEP2.16 It demonstrated that key target groups were
generally satisfied with the changes made by the project. In general, headmasters were neutral
about renovation services provided to their schools (average score is 3.1). For the most part, this
can be explained by the fact that there were few consultations conducted with headmasters during
the preparation stage of civil works, and little attention was paid to headmasters' views on types
and scope of renovations their schools needed and almost no authority to control quality of work
done (as reported during site visits). Both headmasters and teachers were satisfied with new
preschool premises (average scores were close to 3.8). Headmasters and teachers were
moderately satisfied with newly constructed classrooms (average score is 3.4 and 3.65
respectively). School staff appreciated quality of new preschool premises (average scores are
close to 3.8).

Headmasters and teachers appreciated educational materials provided under the project (average
score is 4) and were very positive about materials for special education (average scores are



16The Likert scale method was used in the Beneficiary Survey to measure project impact and beneficiaries'
satisfaction with the project inputs and outputs. A five point scale was used and the following intervals
were identified: "Strongly Disagree" (interval from 1.00 to 1.79 points), "Disagree" (1.80 - 2.59), "Neither
disagree nor agree" (2.60 - 3.39), "Agree" (3.40 - 4.19), and "Strongly Agree" (4.20 - 5.00).

around 4.2), with the exception of Braille typewriters rated 2.7 by headmasters and 2.96 by
teachers, because they felt that the quality of these products was low. Computer laboratories were
well appreciated by teachers but not as much as by headmasters (score 3.72 for teachers against
4.3 for headmasters). All target groups reported that students do use all educational materials
provided under the project, especially computer equipment and materials for preschool education.
Moreover, the survey shows that students demonstrated improvements in knowledge and skills
after they used new educational materials.

Teachers evaluated the quality of training provided as average (scores in the range from 2.44 to
4.15 depending on particular training program). However, at the same time, they made a
statement of overall positive impact of various training received to their knowledge, skills and
actual teaching practices (average scores in a range from 3.78 to 4.0). As a result of the project,
teachers reported improved relationships with headmasters (and vice versa) and students;
increased job satisfaction and desire to develop professionally; improved ability to provide
efficient lessons using a larger variety of educational activities; used computer laboratories to
support their teaching and other educational activities more often; and started using computers
/internet more frequently for preparing and conducting lessons, and for evaluation and assessment.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Low
Increasing quality and coverage of basic education are official objectives of the MONE, as
reflected in current national Five Year Development Plan. These objectives are supported by
stable allocations to education sector from the national budget. Therefore, there is a little risk that
the reforms showing good progress since 1997 will be reversed or reduced in scale, and that the
investments made under the project will not be sustained.

However, there is a minor risk that the country will not be able to sustain the current high level of
educational expenditures if economic situation turns unfavorable. Moreover, the school age
population is increasing in Turkey. The pace of GDP growth has to be sufficient to support the
growing demands of the education system, both in terms of share of resources channeled to
education and per capita expenditures. It is likely that if the Government was forced to reduce
expenditures to the education sector, the most likely candidates would be activities directly linked
to quality improvement: teacher training, educational materials, maintaining ICT and other
infrastructure.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: MU
The preparation of this project took place when its predecessor BEP1 was still under
implementation which made it challenging to draw and apply the full range of lessons which were
later outlined in the BEP1 ICR. Nonetheless, the Bank team made an effort to improve some of
the problematic implementation aspects which made BEP1 unsuccessful. The project team made
an effort to ensure quality at entry, including conducting a quality enhancement review and by
taking on board many of the recommendations of the QER. The Bank team also relied on some of
the lessons learned during the implementation of BEP1. As a result, a separate component on
monitoring and evaluation was included in the project and key project indicators were improved



                                                  21

to focus more on outcomes. Also, significant efforts were made to improve the fiduciary aspects
of the project which were highly problematic during BEP1. Greater emphasis was placed to
improve financial reporting and procurement under the project.

It must be noted that the Bank team was very focused on ensuring that the new project would
continue to provide the kind of support which the Government of Turkey requested. Therefore,
the project was designed to contribute to the Government's Basic Education Program, building on
its previous achievements. However, this kept the design of the project complex and challenging
to implement and the Bank could have made more efforts to simplify the design. The Bank team
did not explicitly recognize a number of weaknesses of BEP1 as risks for implementation. Thus,
the Bank team could have done a better job to introduce more realistic implementation timeframe
and to ensure that more capacity building was introduced in the project. Specifically, more work
could have been done to ensure that a monitoring and evaluation system was established, which
was one of the lessons of BEP1. In addition, as was previously noted, one important factor was
not taken into consideration, i.e. the need to include earthquake safety measures into the design of
civil works. As a result, the project costing significantly overestimated the number of schools
which could be rehabilitated and reconstructed within the budget envelope. Consequently, the
actual number of schools which were financed by the project was much less than originally
expected.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: MS
The supervision of this project was challenging given delays and implementation issues as
described above. The Bank team learned an important lesson from BEP1 and from early stages of
BEP2, i.e. that more intensive supervision was necessary to enhance implementation efforts.
Therefore, the supervision efforts improved over time, the Bank conducted frequent supervisions
of the project as well as regular video-conferences, with participation of relevant MONE staff. In
addition, following major delays in the earlier years of project implementation, the Bank team led
a restructuring effort in mid-2005 to enable the project to move forward. This contributed to an
acceleration of the project in the last year and a half when significant loan funds were disbursed
(US$250 million). Another positive aspect in Bank supervision was that the project was closely
followed up by the team at the Bank Country Office. The procurement staff provided the Client
with ongoing and just-in-time support to ensure quality and efficiency of procurement exercises.
A critical recommendation was made by the Bank procurement team, to involve independent civil
works supervisors in the project in order to improve the quality of works. Although the selection
of the consultant firms took some time, the end result was that the highly ambitious plan to
rehabilitate and construct schools in a limited timeframe was achieved and the quality of works
was assured. Also, financial management staff on the Bank side provided important inputs in
developing a comprehensive financial monitoring system for the project.

One aspect which remained deficient during implementation was an insufficient attention to
ensuring that a system for monitoring and evaluation of the project was in place. Although the
Bank made regular attempts to improve on this issue, particularly following project restructuring,
the system was never fully introduced. To compensate for this, the Bank was successful in
making sure that the Government provided all necessary data in order to adequately measure the
project impact. In part, this included launching a beneficiary assessment at the end of the project
which provided very useful and interesting data about project achievements. The Bank team also
carried out an intensive ICR mission in order to collect some of the data and also agreed to
include impact assessments on BEP2 in the ongoing Secondary Education Project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: MS
The rating for Bank performance is MS given the Bank's strong commitment and support for the
Government Basic Education Program and its continued and strong dialogue with the
Government throughout the preparation and implementation periods. The Bank team provided
valuable technical and operational support during the implementation period and contributed
significantly to acceleration of implementation in 2006. However, shortcomings, particularly
during the preparatory stage and low implementation progress made during first years of the
project keep the performance rating at Moderately Satisfactory level.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: MS
Overall Government's performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. There was major
uncertainty on the Government side with financial mechanisms appropriate for the BEP2 funding
after the new budget law was enacted in 2003, requiring all external donors funding to be
included within the Government budget. This caused a delay with the project implementation for
a year. State Planning Organization was involved in annual project implementation reviews, and
contributed to the acceleration of the BEP2 implementation during the last year and a half by
monitoring the disbursement progress against strict deadlines.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: MS
The project was implemented by the Ministry of National Education. Multiple components
comprising diverse activities spanning numerous MONE Directorates, have made the project
challenging to implement. Insufficient implementation capacity was also an issue. Organizational
and leadership structures made it difficult for implementing units to take decisions. A significant
area of weakness was monitoring and evaluation; there was no clear leadership in this area, and
the functions and responsibilities were spread between MONE Directorates and PCC, and this
contributed to difficulties with managing and evaluating the project.

Despite these issues, once MONE reached an agreement and made a decision, it was highly
effective. The impressive performance of civil works activities in the last 18 months of the project
shows that the PCC and MONE staff are capable of carrying out these types of activities
efficiently and effectively. MONE made a tremendous effort in introducing earthquake safety
regulations and arrangement under the project. Delegating responsibilities for selected
procurements to the provincial level was a positive step towards facilitating the implementation.
The PCC significantly contributed to fast project implementation during last 24 months of the
project despite of a pressure of multiple and complex procurement activities. MONE
demonstrated commitment to evaluating the impact of BEP2 by conducting the Beneficiary
Survey and commissioning a major impact assessment study.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: MS
In spite of the startup delays and difficult implementation process, the Government managed to
overcome major obstacles and ensured significant progress towards achieving the project
development objectives. During the final 18 month of the project US$250 million was disbursed.
However, the above mentioned hardships keep the performance rating at Moderately Satisfactory
level.

6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

The BEP 1 and 2 were investment lending operations and used the Adaptable Program Loan as an
instrument. Both BEP1 and BEP2 contributed to implementation of the Government's Basic
Education Program and financed same activities as were financed through this Program. In other
words, it cofinanced national educational reform. Taking into account all the difficulties of
implementing investment operations in education sector in Turkey, better consideration should be
given to other Bank instruments, such as the SWAP and the Development Policy Loan, with
procurement and disbursement based on country systems.

Other lessons drawn from the above analysis and discussions are presented below:
    · Project design and scope should be appropriate to implementation capacity and
        significant efforts should be made to keep project design straightforward, simple and
        realistic.
    · A realistic assessment of project duration during the preparatory stage, especially for the
        projects with large amount of civil works, could help to estimate project deliverables and
        impact more accurately.
    · In the case of repeater or follow-up projects (i.e. APLs) it is important to learn lessons,
        obtain evidence to evaluate performance and achievements from previous operations
        before asking the Government to commit resources for next operation.
    · It is crucial to ensure that a robust monitoring and evaluation system is in place before the
        project is launched.
    · Roles and responsibilities of Government units and agencies regarding the projects
        should be made clear during project preparation.
    · Adequate resources should be allocated to provide appropriate technical and operational
        support to the education program, considering the volume of lending and the
        longstanding relationship with Turkey. This includes appropriate full time technical and
        operations support in the country.
    · It is essential that Bank teams not only carry out dialogue on policy aspects of the
        education sector, but also pay close attention to the political, social and institutional
        aspects of education reforms and have consultations with a broad range of stakeholders to
        improve the relevance and design of projects.
    · During preparation of investment loans, straightforward implementation plans should be
        developed to indicate clearly all major activities planned for implementation. However,
        these plans shall leave a reasonable room for changes and adjustments related to details
        of the implementation. The Bank shall be flexible in responding to objective changes in
        the Borrower's' needs.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component


Component 1. Extending Basic Education Coverage

The following main outputs were achieved under this Component:
    · 169 preschool classrooms were constructed;
    · 94 rural schools were renovated;
    · 79 bussing schools were renovated;
    · 50 boarding schools (YIBOs/PIOs) were renovated and received additional facilities, i.e.
         classrooms;
    · 87 schools were renovated in gecekondu areas;
    · 100 additional classrooms were constructed in gecekondu areas; and
    · 7 special education schools renovated and 9 additional buildings with 8 classrooms each
         constructed.
All renovated schools in the list above - over 300 - were also retrofitted (except 5 schools which
did not need retrofitting) to ensure earthquake safety.

Four firms were contracted to prepare documentations for renovating and retrofitting schools and
supervised the civil works in different provinces. The firms prepared renovation and retrofitting
files for 860 schools (part of them was supported under the project and the other part ­ through
Government's own resources).


Component 2. Improved Basic Education Quality

The following outputs were achieved under this Component:
ICT equipment
    · 3,000 schools were provided with 4002 computer laboratories. The laboratories included
         computers for students, teachers, administrators, and librarians, as well as servers,
         printers, scanners, multimedia projectors, interactive whiteboards, air conditioning units,
         appropriate furniture, etc. 2,000 schools with about 400 students received one computer
         lab each and 1,000 schools with up to 1,500 students received two labs each. In school
         selection, preferences were given to schools without ICT equipment located in low
         income areas.
    · 70 special need education schools for mentally challenged students and students with
         hearing impairment were equipped by computer equipment and furniture in 44 provinces.
    · 40 primary education classrooms within hospitals received computers and printers.
Educational materials and furniture
    · 135 preschools and 9 newly constructed schools for special needs education were
         equipped with appropriate furniture.
    · 4,600 low income urban (gecekondu) and rural schools were provided with sets of
         educational materials: microscopes, television sets and DVD players.
    · 800 preschools were provided with relevant educational materials.            17




17The materials included: concept game sets, painting tables, erasable painting sets, table puppet scenes,
human body puzzles, farming sets, town traffic sets, wooden dominoes, wooden memory games, wooden


                                                    26

     · 1,340 classes in special education schools received sets of educational materials.18
     · 151 schools for visually impaired students in 80 provinces received 1,035 Braille
         typewriters.
     · 48 schools for students with hearing impairment were provided with 75 sets of group
         hearing devices.
     · Procuring educational materials (including educational software) on provincial level.
         Over 325 contracts for educational materials delivery were signed in more than 80
         provinces. The materials were supplied to basic education schools, preschools and special
         needs schools. The procurement was made at the local level through the shopping
         procedures and the payments were done at the central level. A wide variety of materials,
         including educational software for various subjects, were supplied to the schools.


Component 3. Delivery of Basic Education Program

In total, over 87,000 educational staff was trained under this Component. This number includes
about 1,500 tutors who continued the cascade type of training beyond the project. The following
numbers represent different types of training delivered to various staff categories:
The national level
     · 600 ICT tutors (master formatters)
     · About 3,350 preschool teachers and administrators
     · About 4,370 special need education teachers, administrators, tutors and inspectors
     · Over 1,300 trainers for "Mother and Child" education program
The provincial level
     · About 4,200 teachers, administrators and inspectors were trained in various areas of
         preschool, special needs and basic education on the provincial level
     · About 550 ICT tutors were trained in the area of new technology and design
     · Over 73,000 teachers were trained in the area of new curriculum in 80 provinces
     · Moreover, 56,000 sets of materials for training mothers of young children under "Mother
         and Child" education program were printed and distributed under this Component.


Component 4. Project Implementation Support

In order to strengthen the performance of the PCC, nine additional individual consultants in the
fields of ICT, financial management, construction, project management, reporting and
communication were contracted under this Component. The Component supported training of the
PCC staff and local educational authorities in the areas of project management, procurement,
financial management, reporting and communication, ICT, and civil works. It also financed office
equipment for the PCC. Recurrent costs of the PCC, including salaries of BEP2 staff and banking




block sets, block coffer (60-80 pieces), soft gymnastics devices, filled dolls and animals, sponge game
cushions, bucket sets, ropes for skipping, train sets, space connection sets, science sets, puzzles, height
scales, hand puppets, clocks, demount-dismantle sets, wooden kitchen sets, dolls, balls, musical rhythm sets,
painting sets, figure matching sets, etc.
18The materials included: mathematics sets, structural educational blocks, traffic sets, "talent cubes", Lego
sets, concept sets, reading-writing books, geometric figures, abacus, blowing sets, geometric planes aiming
to develop concept for visually impaired, and six points reading blocks for visually impaired.

fees, the rent, utilities and maintenance costs for the office and equipment, the procurement
advertisements costs were also financed from this Component.

Project Management System was developed under the project to assist MONE in carrying out the
management and coordination of the World Bank financed projects. The Component was
supposed to develop a database for Education Research and Development Directorate of the
MONE but these services were never committed under the project and the funds were reallocated.


Component 5. Monitoring and Evaluation

The Component financed implementation of five studies:
    · Impact of mothers' education on the readiness of the children for primary school;
    · Impact of in-service teacher training on students' performance;
    · Impact of education materials on learning achievements;
    · ICT integration study; and
    · Impact of special needs education on students' performance.
The studies were designed to collect baseline information in the respected areas but they were
conducted closer to the project completion, and follow-up studies were never implemented.

The Component also financed Basic Education Program Review by OECD. In addition, it
provided funds for printing and disseminating materials necessary for conducting student
achievement tests in 2005.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results
(if any)

The Beneficiary Survey was conducted in autumn 2007 to evaluate the progress of BEP2. In total,
1,825 interviews were conducted with headmasters, teachers, parents and students from schools
supported under the project in 12 provinces. The Likert scale method was used in the Beneficiary
Survey to measure project impact and beneficiaries' satisfaction with the project inputs and
outputs. A five point scale was used and the following intervals were identified: "Strongly
Disagree" (interval from 1.00 to 1.79 points), "Disagree" (1.80 - 2.59), "Neither disagree nor
agree" (2.60 - 3.39), "Agree" (3.40 - 4.19), and "Strongly Agree" (4.20 - 5.00).

The survey demonstrated that key target groups were generally satisfied with the changes made
by the project. In general, headmasters were neutral about renovation services provided to their
schools (average score is 3.1). For the most part, this can be explained by the fact that there were
few consultations conducted with headmasters during the preparation stage of civil works, and
little attention was paid to headmasters' views on types and scope of renovations their schools
needed and almost no authority to control quality of work done (as reported during site visits).
Both headmasters and teachers were satisfied with new preschool premises (average scores were
close to 3.8). Headmasters and teachers were moderately satisfied with newly constructed
classrooms (average score is 3.4 and 3.65 respectively). School staff was appreciated quality of
new preschool premises (average scores are close to 3.8).

Headmasters and teachers appreciated educational materials provided under the project (average
score is 4) and were very positive about materials for special education (average scores are
around 4.2), with the exception of Braille typewriters rated 2.7 by headmasters and 2.96 by
teachers, because they felt that the quality of these products was low. Computer laboratories were
well appreciated by teachers but not as much as by headmasters (score 3.72 against 4.3). All
target groups reported that students do use all educational materials provided under the project,
especially computer equipment and materials for preschool education. Moreover, the survey
shows that students demonstrated improvements in knowledge and skills after they used new
educational materials.

Teachers evaluated the quality of training provided as average (scores in the range from 2.44 to
4.15 depending on particular training program). However, at the same time, they made a
statement of overall positive impact of various training received to their knowledge, skills and
actual teaching practices (average scores ranging from 3.78 to 4.0). As a result of the project,
teachers reported improved relationships with headmasters (and vice versa) and students;
increased job satisfaction and desire to develop professionally; improved ability to provide
efficient lessons using a larger variety of educational activities; used computer laboratories to
support their teaching and other educational activities more often; and started using computers
/internet more frequently for preparing and conducting lessons, and for evaluation and assessment.

Under the Beneficiary Survey, headmasters and teachers evaluated impact of the different project
interventions on the quality of educational outputs and reported visible impact (scores close to 4
or slightly above). The findings are presented below and grouped around key beneficiaries of the
project. The impact was attributed to different project interventions.

                            SUMMARY OF BORROWER'S ICR


1.       INTRODUCTION

Education system of a country is the most crucial indicator expressing how it defines itself and to-
what-extend it prepares a future for its own.

In the new global world, a rapid change process has revealed with the new searches, new
structures. As a requirement of this rapid change and improvement process, traditional type and
classification approach in education system has left the floor to approach of identifying programs
in line with new technologies. Therefore, even the most developed countries are searching for
new ways to improve their education systems constantly and to increase quality in education.

The Turkish Government has introduced radical changes in Turkish Education System
through enactment of the Basic Education Law 4306. In addition to incomes provided with the
Law No.4306, a World Bank loan in the amount of USD 600 million has been received in order
to support the Basic Education Program. The Loan Agreement for the first phase of the Basic
Education Project was signed in June 25, 1998 and published in the Official Gazette dated August
1, 1998. This Agreement released first tranche in the amount of USD 300 million for the Program
and the First Phase of the Basic Education Project (BEP I) was closed in December 2003.

For the sustainability of the Project, a Loan Agreement for the Second Phase of the Basic
Education Project (BEP II) in the amount of USD 300 million was signed by/between the
Government of Turkey and the World Bank on July 26, 2002.

In addition to foreign resources obtained from relevant projects, national projects have also been
implemented for the support to Basic Education Program with the help of national campaigns and
legal arrangements.

2.       THE SECOND BASIC EDUCATION PROJECT

The main objectives of the Second Basic Education Project are to continue the Government's
initiatives for expanding basic education coverage, improving the quality of basic education, and
for making rural schools and schools in low-income areas around large cities (gecekondu areas)
more attractive to the populations they are meant to serve; and to support expansion of formal
preschool education and special needs education which are inseparable parts of basic education.
In this regard, the Project also covered extension of BEP I activities.

The Project consisted of the following parts to achieve such objectives:
Component A: Improved Basic Education Coverage
1. School Rehabilitation
2. Expansion of Preschool Education Facilities
3. Expansion and Enhancement of Special Needs Education Facilities
Component B: Improved Basic Education Quality
1. Information and Communications Technology
2. Educational Materials Provision
3. Preschool Education


                                                 35

4. Special Needs Education
Component C: Delivery of the Basic Education Program: In-service Training
Component D: Project Implementation Support
Component E: Monitoring, Evaluation and Review

3.      ACHIEVEMENTS IN KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS UNDER THE
SECOND PHASE OF THE BASIC EDUCATION PROJECT

Performance Indicators Table defined under the Project's Loan Agreement is as follows. Progress
obtained in terms of performance indicators will be detailed in the following sections.

The Republic of Turkey has mobilized all resources from donations and national allocations into
education system. Besides, the Government makes its efforts to remove educational problems and
to achieve its goals for education with the design and implementation of new projects and
educational reforms.

        Analysis of the Program Development Goals is as given below:

Sector indicator 1:"All children at the of basic education age (including those with special
needs) attend and successfully complete eight year basic education": The MONE has tired to
achieve this goal with different implementations. Figurative progress obtained between the years
of 2002 to 2007 is as given below:

End-of-Program Indicators No.1 "School enrollment for eligible children at the age of pre-
school education approaches 25%": This target has already been achieved and the activities to
reach to 2012-2013 target have been accelerated.

Schooling rate for preschool education during 2006­2007 academic year has increased to 25%.
Our Ministry has accelerated its activities to reach children at the age of preschool education.
(SGB 2007 Budget Report.)

End-of-Program Indicator No.2 "Student performance for all students in basic education
improves":
The Result Report for Student Achievement Test (OBBS) for the year 2002-2005 includes
student achievement rates by grades on the following subjects: a) Science Test, b) Mathematics
Test, c) Social Sciences Test and d) Turkish Language Test.

Absolute achievement rates obtained with science tests in ÖBBS 2002 and 2005 seem to be
parallel with science score profiles. In general, there is an increase of 1 to 5 points in the results
of test implementation in the year 2005 when compared with those of test implementation in the
year 2002. This may be a result of review of test questions in line with the analysis conducted at
the end of the test implementation in the year 2002. A crucial level of increase is not observed in
the absolute achievement rates, which may be an indicator of an important bounce. In 2002, there
has been an increase from the fourth grade to fifth grade, a decrease in the sixth and seventh
grades and an increase at the eighth grade. Reasons leading to decrease in the 6th and 7th grade
seem to continue their effects in both implementations.

Another activity related with student achievements is the PISA Project by ERDD. Results of the
PISA 2003 project were declared in Turkey on December 7, 2004 simultaneously with 41
countries. Under PISA 2003, whether students at the age of 15 years old are well prepared for
future challenges and to-what-extend these students have all skills required for mathematics,
problem solving, reading and understanding and science and what causes failure, were searched.
6 skill levels in Math, 3 basic skill levels in problem-solving and 4 different skill levels in reading


                                                   37

literacy were determined. Compared with other education systems by skills required for basic
education, Turkey is beyond the average levels of OECD countries and 75% of students in our
country are at the second or lower levels for Math.

End-of-Program Indicator No.3 "40% of all children in basic education utilize ICT for
learning":

The Ministry makes its efforts for not leaving any school without Internet connectivity and
computers through the use of donations obtained from 100% Support to Education Project. Under
volunteer donations, totally 2006 IT laboratories were installed by Trade Union of Textile
Employers, 1536 IT Labs under 100% Support to Education Project and 1500 IT labs by the
Ministry of Transportation. Besides, totally 1610 IT labs were installed under the first phase of
the EIB funded Educational Framework Project. Under BEP II, updating of 2561 IT labs installed
under BEP I and installation of 2096 new IT labs were achieved.

Analysis of Performance Indicators
[Comment: Key indicators, as presented in the Section 1.2 on the ICR]

        Findings related with Indicator I:

Renovation of 94 Rural Schools:
Renovations of 94 in planned 200 rural schools were completed. Taking into account the
assumption that the number of students per school is 240, totally 22,560 students will be
benefiting from these schools in one year.

Renovation of 87 Gecekondu Schools:
87 of the planned 210 gecekondu schools were subject to retrofitting and renovation activities
under BEP II. Taking into account the assumption that each school has approximately 8 classes
with approximately 40 students per class, totally 27,840 students will be benefiting from these
schools in one year.

Renovation of 50 YIBOs/PIOs:
50 of the planned 210 YIBOs/PIOs were subject to retrofitting and renovation activities under
BEP II. Taking into account the assumption that each YIBO/PIO has approximately 16 classes
with 2 branches and the number of students per class is 35, totally 28,000 students will be
benefiting from these schools in one year.

Renovation of 79 Bussing Schools:
79 of the planned 200 bussing schools were subject to retrofitting and renovation activities under
BEP II. Taking into account the assumption that each bussing school has approximately 24
classes with approximately 35 students per class, totally 66,360 students will be benefiting from
these schools in one year.

Construction of Additional 169 Preclasses:
Additional 169 pre-classes of the planned 300 in total were constructed under BEP II. Taking into
account the assumption that each pre-class has approximately 24 students per class, totally 4225
students will be benefiting from these pre-classes.

Construction of Additional 9 Classes and Renovation of 7 Special Needs Education Schools:
Additional 9 buildings with 8 classes of the planned 20 schools were constructed and 7 of the
planned 40 schools were subject to retrofitting and renovation activities under BEP II. Taking


                                                38

into account the assumptions that each additional school with 8 classes has approximately 25
students per class, totally 1400 students will be benefiting from these pre-classes in one year.
Totally 3,200 students will be benefiting from these special needs education schools renovated
under BEP II.

Reviewing general status of the civil works and renovations, totally 152,185 students are assumed
to benefit from these investments per year. Taking into account the adjustments/reductions in
figures determined at the beginning of the Project implementation, these results can be regarded
as "reasonable".

        Findings related with Indicator II:

Changes in students observed by school administrators by the use of educational materials in line
with the findings of Baseline Study on the Impacts of Educational Material Use on Learning
Results indicated that almost 100% of school administrators think that interests of students
towards their courses have increased, 96% of them that active participation and achievement rates
of students against their courses have increased; 86% of them that their degrees of consciousness
of deciding profession have increased;        84% of them that their abilities of research have
increased; 80% of them that their abilities of critical thinking have increased; 71% of them that
their abilities of class environment control have increased; 74% of them that their attendance rates
of class have increased; 67 % of them that success of OKS has increased; 52% of them that their
obeyance for disciplinary rules has increased; and 36% of them that achievement rates in PISA or
alike have increased

Opinions of the Administrators on the Changes Observed in the Students after the Use of The
Education Materials in the Rural/gecekondu regions indicated that almost 97% of students from
gecekondu schools think that interests of students towards their courses have increased, 96% of
them that courses are more fun; 93% of them that their participation in class has increased; 92%
of them that their capability of understanding courses has increased; 91% of them that they do
their homework more regularly. The least effective factor in the use of educational materials by
the students in gecekondu schools is the "finding different answers to questions of teachers"
(%69).

Almost 97% of students from rural schools think that interests of students towards their courses
have increased, 95% of them that courses are more fun; 93% of them that their capability of
understanding courses has increased; 91% of them that they do their homework more regularly.
The least effective factor in the use of educational materials by the students in gecekondu schools
is the "finding different answers to questions of teachers" (%70). In line with these findings, the
use of educational materials both by students in rural schools and in gecekondu schools have
positive effects on learning results and the effects of the use of educational materials are similar
in gecekondu and rural schools

The Impact of In-service Trainings on Students

One of the indicators of an effective in-service training is its impact on students' academic
success. The main purpose of In-service trainings is to improve the quality of teaching and
learning activities presented to students and thus, to increase students' academic success.

Acquirements of Students provided by the In-service Trainings on the New Curriculum




                                                 39

The majority of the teachers indicated that after in-service trainings they attended, increases in
students' academic performances, motivation to and interest in the lessons and study skills were
partially or often observed. While 11% of the teachers indicated that increases in students'
academic success were observed quite often, those of indicating that increases were partially
observed was 60% and those of indicating no increase is observed is 29%. Additionally it has
been indicated that increases in interests and motivation of students against courses has been
observed partially (54% and 48% respectively) and often (30% and 36% respectively). In addition
to these increases, the similar increases in the students' skills of teamwork, doing research and
independent study and active participation in the lessons were also noted. Briefly, in-service
trainings on new curriculum seem to have positive effects on students.

Acquirements of Students provided by the In-service Trainings on ICT

Increases were partially or often observed in students' academic performances, motivation to and
interest in the lessons, and students' teamwork, research, observation and independent study skills.
However, the issue paying attention is that increases in students' academic performances and
skills were seen as `partially' not as `often'.

Either partially or often, the highest increase (87%) was observed in students' motivation and
their participation in the lessons. These are followed by increases in students' interest in the
lessons and their academic performances (69%).

Even though teachers said that they could not transfer new knowledge and skills gained form the
in-service trainings into the practice, increase in this amount in students' academic performances
and skill are appreciative.

Student Acquirements of In-service Trainings at Preschool Education

More than half of the teachers reported that after the in-service trainings, increases in their
students' academic achievement (71%), motivation to the lessons (71%), skills (61%), and
interest in the lessons (71%) were partially or often observed. Despite the fact that preschool
teachers did not obtain significant acquirements from the in-service trainings and could not
transfer them into the practice in their lessons, the results are promising.

Student Acquirements of In-service Trainings at Special Needs Education

While 54 % of the teachers indicated that increases in students' success were observed quite often,
those of indicating that increases were partially observed was 21% and those of indicating that no
increase is observed is 25%. However, it has been indicated that increases in students' academic
performances and skills were observed `partially' (60% and 52% respectively) and `often'(22%
and 26% respectively).

Consequently, more than half of the teachers from various fields reported that in-service trainings
had positive effects on their students' academic performances, skills and motivation. Even if the
majority of the teachers indicated that they could not transfer their new knowledge and skills
gained from the in-service trainings into their practice, the amount transferred to the practice can
be enough to increase students' success and improve their skills. During interviews with the
teachers, they said that their students have become more interested and enthusiastic, and active in
the lessons and began to do research and investigations since they have used the new curriculum.
All these acquirements, naturally, are the results of teachers running their lessons according to the
new curriculum as it has a student-centered approach. For these reasons, as suggested earlier in


                                                   40

this chapter, teachers are supported for using new knowledge and skills acquired from in-service
trainings and followed whether or not they transfer them into their practice in order to increase
the quality of teaching and learning in schools and the effectiveness of in-service trainings.

        Findings related with Indicator III:

As analyzed within Indicator No.2.

        Findings related with Indicator IV:

Figurative Progress obtained at preschool education level is as given within the following table:

Table 6: Figurative Progress at Preschool Education Level

                     2005-2006          18 539     550 146         20 910
                     2004-2005          15 929     434 771         22 109
                     2003-2004          13 285     358 499         17 511
                     2002-2003           8 873     320 038         13 356

This Table presents an ocular increase at the preschool education level. Schooling rate for the
preschool education has reached to 25% in 2006­2007 academic year. Our Ministry has
accelerated its activities for reaching all children at the age of preschool education. (SGB 2007
Budget Report.)

Totally 3497 teachers, administrators and inspectors were trained via of 25 seminars on preschool
education under BEP II. It can be concluded that target related with in-service training on
preschool education has been approached.

        Findings related with Indicator V:

Mother-Children at the age of 5-6 Education Program (MOCEP) has been implemented since
1994 with the cooperation between the Directorate General for Apprenticeship and Non-formal
Education under the MONE and Mother-Child Education Foundation (MOCEF). This Program
has been implemented under Non-formal Education Project between 01.09.1994 and 31.12.1995,
National Education Development Project between 01.01.1996 and 30.06.1999, resources from
MOCEF between 1999 and 2000, and under the Basic Education Project signed by/between the
Government of Turkey and the World Bank between 2000 and 2003 with the support of MOCEF.

The main purpose of the Program is to support multi-dimensional development of the child via
his/her mother who is the closest. This Program is comprised of 3 parts: 1. "Mother Support
Program"; 2. "Reproduction Health and Family Planning" and 3. "Mental Training Program
(ZEP)"

In line with the data obtained from the DG for Apprenticeship and Non-formal Education under
the MONE, totally 120,000 children were reached with the training of 57,852 mothers between
2003-2007.




                                                  41

    Findings related with Indicator VI:

In line with the data from Activity Report for the year 2006, totally 13,292,872 students are
provided with education in basic and secondary education institutions throughout the country.
According to data from EDUTECH, number of computers in public basic and secondary
education schools is 555,000, which corresponds to 23,95 students per student. Moreover, the
Ministry provided training for 50,114 teachers on IT.

Educational Portal activity was excluded from the project design in line with the request of
EDUTECH; however, the Ministry's initiatives for the establishment of EP by local financing
resources are still ongoing. The Ministry plans to continue its initiatives for educational portal by
providing authoring software to teachers, organizing campaigns for teachers, and developing
professional software.

Pursuant to protocol signed with Turkish Telekom, ADSL Internet connectivity was provided to
all schools with required infra-structure and students in these schools are today benefiting from
Internet services.

Under BEP Projects, totally 5802 schools were installed with ICT labs (2802 Schools with 3188
IT Classes under BEP I and 3000 schools with 4002 ICT classes under BEP II). When the
threshold value of 400 students for the installation of IT class is taken into account, totally
2,320,800 students are benefiting from IT labs. If the upper threshold level of 1500 students is
taken into account, then this number increases to 8,703,000 students in total.

On the other hand, in line with the findings of Baseline Study on ICT Integration, taking into
account that 25% of sampling schools have educational software, it can easily be concluded that
the Ministry has achieved its Program targets.

6.      PROJECT FINANCING

Amendments to the Loan Agreement

Since the beginning, the Second Basic Education Project has been amended for three times.

In compliance with the revised project, the third loan amendment request is as listed below:

Schedule 1 (Withdrawal of the Proceeds of the Loan), Clause 1 is required to be amended as
follows:

                                         Amount of the                    % of Expenditures

7.       MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION

A majority of delays were faced in the first two years of the project implementation. The main
reasons behind these delays were the non-allocation of funds for BEP II from the General Budget
and the turnovers in both senior and regular staff experienced with project implementation.

All BEP 2 team worked in the preparation and design of the Project Implementation Plan which is
the basis for project implementation for approximately five months. PIP prepared with great
efforts of the MONE line units, was put out of implementation after 5 months due to the request
of the Bank and a restructuring was proposed in project design. Preparation of restructured
project design and loan amendments based negotiations lasted for approximately four months.

The main reasons for restructuring were to make some procurement at local level to shorten
procurement periods. Accordingly both the Bank's and the Ministry's predictions were realized
and all procurement started in the year 2005 could have been completed by the end of August
2007. However, some of these activities could not be completed in time while some of them
(Education Portal, Decision Support System) were cancelled due to lack of experts. One of the
main reasons behind this situation is the project amendments which were made very often and the
fact that restructuring could not be adapted within a short period of time, while another is the lack
of expert staff (600 Formatter Training).

8.       PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY

Both field trips and the requests forwarded to the Ministry indicate that the public attention and
interest to the Basic Education Program is increasing gradually through the country. The requests
of the community for better educational conditions and technology-based education are
constantly forwarded to the Ministry of National Education. At this point, with full of success in
terms of basic education system in Turkey, there is still much to be done in basic education
system.

The Government of Turkey once again supports its commitment for sustaining Basic Education
Program and sub-projects through the use of government budget, educational laws and
educational mobilization activities and regulations commenced throughout the country.

9.       BANK PERFORMANCE

The Second Basic Education Project which was a subsequent phase of the first one assisted in
achieving the Government's broader development program that is "Basic Education Program".
The Project covers a certain part of a comprehensive program.




                                                 43

The Bank has monitored and oriented the Project implementation in a satisfactory way in terms of
guidance and assessment matters. The MONE prepared a Log Frame and concluded Project
design activities in a workshop with the participation of technical staff from MONE Line units
with the Professional help of the Bank staff. For the effectiveness of Project implementation, the
Bank staff did not denied its best efforts and provided project management training for the
MONE staff for the preparation of the Project Implementation Plan which deemed as one of the
most successful documentation among other projects. Supervision activities are performed on a
regular basis as well. Taking into consideration the whole performance of the Bank, the Ministry
deems the Bank performance at project implementation including preparation and supervising
activities as "satisfactory".

10.      BORROWER PERFORMANCE

During the preparation and implementation of the operation

Regular meetings were held by the PCC at Project implementation period, and senior officials of
the MONE participated actively in these meetings and provided their support for effective and
efficient Project implementation process. World Bank staff also participated in most of these
meetings. Both Assoc. Prof. Hüseyin ÇELK, the Minister of National Education, and Mr. Salih
ÇELK Deputy Undersecretary of the MONE, have provided their support to Project staff during
implementation period.

The BEP 2 Implementation Progress indicator has been deemed "unsatisfactory" in the
Project Supervision Report due to budget constraints for BEP 2 from the budget of the
Government for the year 2003 and turnover of Project manager twice within 12 month period. This
rating was the same for a period of one year. During the supervision mission, the Bank team has
supervised the achievement obtained in terms of action plan targets, Project Implementation Plan,
Detailed Project Schedule, Responsibility Matrix and Project Timing Schedule and intensive
meetings were held with the working groups.

As a result of these revisions and negotiations and based upon the progress obtained on the
Project activities since June 1, 2004, The Bank management has increased the ratio into
Satisfactory. However, during the mission, the Project Manager and BEP II team has
assembled more than twice in order to add the information on detailed activities and
accountability responsibility required for achievement of Project objectives into the PIP
Document before October 22.

The Project implementations commenced with a 6 months delay since there was no allocation in
the budget of the year 2003. The preparation of the Project Implementation Plan in 2004 took a
long time and it was prepared after the workshops lasting more than one month after a month of
training with the participation of approximately 60 representatives from all units under the
project.

On the other side the studies were carried out in order not to give way to any constraints in the
procurement activities by taking the necessary precautions. In this context, most of the bidding
specifications for the procurements to be conducted in 2005 are prepared and/or forwarded for
the no-objection of the Bank.




                                               44

11.      ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME

Evaluation of the Output/Impact indicators presents that the Ministry of National Education is
above the average level in terms of achievement rates for project targets. More detailed and clear
information will be obtained after Assessment Study to be conducted in September 2007.

The overall rating of the project could be regarded as "partially satisfactory".

12.      LESSONS LEARNED

Project implementation can be commenced with at least one year delay due to preparatory
activities in Project management. A part of loan proceedings should be allocated for these
budgetary preparation activities in line with mutual agreement during Loan negotiations and one
year preparatory period (for the preparation of Project Implementation Plan and Technical
Specifications) should be included to this process before the effectiveness of the Loan. The
Bank's procedures should be reviewed in a way to include this period.

Some arrangements made after Loan Agreement causes narrowing in resource funding. In such
cases, for instance activities which are considered to include 5 quantities of activities include 3-4
quantities of activities as a result of such narrowing. Accordingly, loan amendments should be
made in a way not to cause any narrowing in resource funding. For instance exclusion of
Government contribution caused narrowing in resource funding in the amount of USD 59 million.

On the other hand, while some of the contracts are signed in USD, the others are signed in NTL.
In such cases, narrowing in resource funding occurs due to difference in foreign exchange rates
and NTL's increasing value. This problem can be prevented with contracting activities in one
currency (USD).

Pre-bid meetings were held for ICB procurements under BEP II in order to answer the questions
of interested bidders for clarifications. Accordingly, the PCC had the opportunity to make related
clarifications on the issues that the bidders should be following during preparation and
submission of bids, to interested bidders who are used to biddings under Public Bidding Law
procedures but unfamiliar with the World Bank's procurement guidelines. Not leaving any
uncertain issues before the submission of bids contributes to receiving more healthy and clear
bids, which leads to more healthy and quicker evaluation of bids.

Consultancy services were procured for the supervision and projection of construction, renovation
and retrofitting works under BEP II, which led not to have the technical staff based problems in
the preparation of technical parts of the bidding documents and in supervision of civil works.
Constructions performed with the consultation of consultancy firms were completed in a more
efficient and effective way.
