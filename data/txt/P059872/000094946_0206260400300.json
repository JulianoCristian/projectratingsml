education\n            program, over the years 2002-2005, and builds on the actions\n            supported under the first operation, through the development\n            of preschool education, as an integral part of basic\n            education and educational special needs. The project\n            components will: 1) extend basic education coverage, by\n            supporting continued rehabilitation, and extension of rural,\n            and low-income areas' schools, through the construction\n            of new preschool classrooms in existing basic education\n            schools, as well as the renovation, and extension of schools\n            for children with special needs; 2) improve basic education\n            quality, through continued investments for schools'\n            equipment, which includes computer facilities. The component\n            will further initiate expansion of formal preschool\n            education, and education for children with special needs,\n            and, additionally, non-formal education, and early childhood\n            development will be supported, targeted specifically for\n            deprived households; 3) support in-service training in\n            information, and communications technology (ICT) to teachers\n            to improve basic computer skills, and assist in utilizing\n            ICT to improve instruction, to inspectors to prod\n            pedagogical ICT support to schools, and to assist computer\n            instructors for the full utilization of ICT classroom\n            potential. As the previous components, teachers of children\n            with special needs, early childhood parents, and preschool\n            teachers, will benefit from specifically designed training\n            courses; 4) finance consulting services in the areas of\n            project management, procurement aspects, financial\n            management, including construction issues, equipment supply,\n            and training needs; and, 5) support studies to assess\n            program outcomes, particularly supporting semi-annual reviews."}, "docdt": "2002-06-12T00:00:00Z"}
