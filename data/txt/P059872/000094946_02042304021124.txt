C. INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING
1.     Training/Study Tours
There will be some ad hoc training for some personnel who will be working on the disposable of waste water and operating the equipment. In
addition, further training may be provided to ensure monitoring of compliance with the relevant standards.
2.     Consultant Services
The Ministry of National Education, particularly the PCC, will ensure compliance with all environmental measures. When necessary, the
Ministry of National Education will collaborate with other government agencies (i.e. Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Labor and Social Security) to
conduct the monitoring and evaluation work.
D. SCHEDULE
Present (preferably in Chart Form) Start Dates and Finish Dates for:
*   Mitigation Activities
* Monitoring Activities
*   Training Activities
The activities on mitigation, monitoring and training would be carried out throughout the project.
E. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS
The PCC will be responsible to hire and oversee the required architects, engineers and conitractors. In the context of the rehabilitation of schools, the
PCC's role is to manage the design, bidding, supervision of projects (including civil works, goods and services). The PCC's responsibility includes the following
activities:
-   hire the services of private architectural/engineering firms capable of providing comprehensive services, i.e. architectural, all required engineering,
preparation of tender documents and site supervision;
-   supervise the work performed by the architectural/engineering firms to ensure that they are applying adequate standards and are following agreed
procedures, as well as the agreed environmental plan.
-   organize tendering procedures, review tender evaluation performed by the architecturaVengineering firms, arrange for the contracts to be signed in
accordance with agreed procedures.
-   ensure that the architectural/engineering firms are providing adequate site supervision, particularly the supervision of carrying out the
environmental plan (monitoring the disposal of construction materials, disposal of waste water and sewage, and procurement documents specify the
requirements on waste disposals.
