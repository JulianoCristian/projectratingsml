performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            project design and scope can be appropriate to\n            implementation capacity and significant efforts can be made\n            to keep project design straightforward, simple and\n            realistic. A realistic assessment of project duration during\n            the preparatory stage, especially for the projects with\n            large amount of civil works, can help to estimate project\n            deliverables and impact more accurately. In the case of\n            repeater or follow-up projects it is important to learn\n            lessons, obtain evidence to evaluate performance and\n            achievements from previous operations before asking the\n            Government to commit resources for next operation. Roles and\n            responsibilities of Government units and agencies regarding\n            the projects can be made clear during project preparation."}, "docdt": "2008-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
