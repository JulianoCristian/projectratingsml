MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIIDENT
OF TIRE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE        UTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA
FOR A PEROLEUM DISTRIBUION AND SECTOR MANAGEM
IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
1.         I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Korea for the equivalent of US$ 120 miUion co help finance a Petroleum Distribution
and Sector Management Improvement project. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest
rate, with a maturity of 15 years, including five years of grace. The proposed loan would be on-lent to the
Dae Han Oil Pipeline Corporation (DHOPCO) on the same terms and conditions as the Bank loan.
DHOPCO would bear the foreign exchange and interest rate risks.
Background
2.          Korea's per capita energy consumption in 1991 was 2.4 tons of oil equivalent (toe), the second
highest consumer of energy in Asia after Japan. Almost the entire 104 million toe consumed in 1991 were
in the form of commercial energy. About 20% was produced localy and the balance was imported.
Demand is expected to grow at about 6.1 % per year and the country wil require 177 million toe to meet its
needs by 2000. Oil consumption grew at an average of 16% per year over the last five years and reached a
level of 60 million toe in 1991; demand is expected to reach about 100 toe million by 2000.
3.         The energy import bill was US$12.5 bilion in 1991, representing over 15% of the country's
total imports and about 18% of its export earnings. The magnitude of the amount involved and the
country's cemplete dependence on imported energy make the Korean economy extremely vulnerable to
external factors. In order to insure itself against such vulnerability and yet have an energy strategy which is
both sustainable and can support the country's rapid economic growth, the Government initiated measures
which called for energy diversification, deregulation (in order to capture efficiency gains), conservation, and
environmental protection. The results have been mixed. The policy of diversifying sources and types of
fuels has been successful. Efforts at deregulating the energy sector have progressed well, albeit slowly.
Enviromenl issues are being addressed seriously, as the Govermment is making efforts to assess long-term
implications and develop appropriate measures. However, its endeavors at energy conservation have been
halting. Energy is still not consumed efficiently. Korea's economy is more energy intensive than that of the
OECD countries. While energy intensity declined in the early 1980s, after 1987 it rose again, reflecting the
erosion of energy conservation measures the Government had introduced in the early 1980s.
4.          Distribution of petroleum products in Korea is also inefficient. At present, over 90% of the
petroleum consumed is shipped through a host of coastal vessels, rail tankers and trucks-all of which are
more expensive and environmenaly hazardous than the proposed pipeline. The result is an uneconomic
transport system that creates bottlenecks in port operations, congestion and hazards on the roads and
railroads, and significant environmental problems (because trucks and rail tankers create air pollution and
vessels spring leaks that pollute the waterways). The magnitude of these problems is likely to intensify by
the year 2000, when oil consumption is expected to reach 2 million bpd.
5.          The foregoing problems need resoluton and the Government has asked for the Bank's support
in evolving measures to improve sector efficiency while minimizing environmental degradation.
Consequenty, the proposed project has been designed to address these issues.

Lessons from Previous Bank Involvement
6.         The Bank has played a major role in Korea's development through a diversified lending
program involving over 100 operations, including several power projects. However, the Bank has made
otly one loan in the petroleum subsector, for a Gas ystem Expansion Project which became effive in
March 1992. Although it is too early to derive any lessons from this operato  Bank-assisted power
projects in Korea have been implemented with considerable efficiency.
Radonale For Bank Involvement
7.         In August 1991, in the context of graduation discussions with the Government, it was agreed
that Bank participation in future projects should not merely transfer financial resources but also have a
significant value-added content which would make a major impact on sectoral policies. Consequently, the
major thrust of Bank's assistance has focussed on adding value and addressing social and envirmenl
issues. However, as incomes and urbanizaon have increased, the Government has been pressed to do both,
i.e., address emnerging social and envomenl issues, and continue to upgrade inructure and
manufaing   techologies to enable industry to develop w ore sophiscated products for export. The Bank
is, therefore, assisting the Govemment on a selective basis in suppoi  specific areas of high-priority
infS         investment with technology transfer and institutional development, and in furth  liberalizig
the financial sector.
8.         After a seies of discussions in which the country's priorites were assessed, the Goverment
and the Bank agreed that the proposed project addresses Korea's priority needs and conforms well with the
Bank's assistance sty.  The project will result in economic benefits (lower transportation costs),
environmental and safety benefits (reduced air and water pollution and decreased road and rail accidents),
and supply benefits (mote reliable pipeline versus existing modes of ttansport). In addition, Bank
involvement will rcwlt in other criical benefits, such as increasing the sector's efficiency, raising the level
of environental and safety standards in the oil industry's constmrction and opating practces, and
sgtenig the capabilities of the sector's institutions.
9.         With respect to imovig sector efficiency, Bank participation in the proposed project ha
already led the Government to develop a plan seting forth policies and actons to promote energy
conservation. The Bank has assisted the Goveroment in preparing the terms of refrence for a major energy
conservaon study which wil be financed (US$1.5 million) from the proposed loan. The pnmary output of
the first phase of the study is an agreed action plan for implemention. Sector efficiency will be further
improved by the Bank requiring DHOPCO to make the proposed pipeline available for use by all interested
ptudes, hence paving the way for greater private sector partcipation and increased competition. The Bank
has also made a significant contribion in raising the level of safety and envinmental stndards in the
country's oil industry. Some examples of these are: (a) requiring DHOPCO to develop well-designed spill-
control plans that include trained teams and clean-up equipment that can respond immediy in the event of
oil spills adjacent to rivers and lakes; (b) helping DHOPCO to identify potly high-risk accident areas
and requiring it to develop comprehensive disaster contingency plans; and (c) makin DHOPCO aware of
the evronment implications of heavy traffic loads around the Seou terminal, thereby cauing DHOPCO
to  hange the project design and provide adequate access roads and facilites for drivers. These concerns
bave been incorporated in a high quali  envromen  action plan which wil be used by all pariipan,
including new entrants.
10.           Bank involvement has, therefore, led the Government to focus on addressing these cridcal
issues, some of which were not originally addressed in the project scope and design. The Government has
actively sought and largely implemened the Bank's assistance in sector analysis and policy formuat,



- 3 -
particularly in those areas where the Bank is able to bring the benfits of broader experience. Not only will
Bank pardcipadon ensure the implementation of energy conservation programs, environmental midgation
plans, gc.-antees for the open use of the pipeline and institution building within the project entity, but the
iternalization of thmese actions will create the necessary capcly to undertake similar projects in the future.
Project Objectives
11.        The aim of the project is to improve the efficiency of Korea's energy sector and enbance the
reliability of petroleum supply. This will include: (a) establishing a more efficient supply and distribution
system through the constuction of a pipeline network; (b) improving environmental quality and safety
standards by reducing air and water pollution, and rail and road hazards; (c) developing an appropriate
energy conservation program (with a stategy to sustain it); and (d) improving sector institutions by
stregthening DHOPCO's financial, operational, and managerial capabilities.
Project Descripon
12.        The project consists of three parts. The first is an approximately 1000 km pipeline system to
trasport petroleum products. The network will include an east-north trunkline connecing two eastern
refineries (Yukong and Ssangyong) near Pusan to Taejon; a west-north tunkilne connecting the Honam
refinery at Yeochon to Taejon; and two paralle pipelines from Taejon to Seoul. The proposed system w'il
also iluchde two short segments, as wdl as storage tanks, pumping statons and loading and unloading
facilities. The system is designed to initially transport about 500,000 bpd of clean products or about 55% of
the total oil consumed domesticaly. The second part is a major study on energy conservadon, including
preparation of an action plan for subsequent implementaton by the govermment  The third includes
technical assistance to DHOPCO, which involves traing DHOPCO staff in the critcal areas of opeaion,
fine and management, and helping design and implement DHOPCO's management informaton system.
ec Immo
13.        The project wil be implemented by DHOPCO, which is the beneficiary of the proposed loan.
This entity, which was established in 1990 to construct, own, and operate the nationwide oil pipeline system,
is responsible for the tranWortaion and storage of oil products. It is owned by the Government (50.8%)
through the Petroleum Business Fund under the Ministry of Energy and Resources, and by five private
refineries (8.2% each), Korean Airlines (4.1% ) and Kwang Ju Express (4.1%). At the end of 1992, 90%
of the euity-which accounts for 30% of the capital investment program-had been paid by shaeholders,
and the remaining 10% is expected to be invested in 1993. Although major decisions such as approval of
DHOPCO's amuial budget are deferred to MOER, DHOPCO is a commercially autonomous entity that
functions essentially as a private company, largely free of Government involvement in its day-to-day
operatons.  It operates in a competitive environment smce rfieries have various alternatives for
tasporting petroleum products.
14.        The project is in an advanced stage of preparation. A small segment (30 km) of the network
is now complete and operting; most of the land and rights-of-way needed have been purchased; and, some
of the engineerig specifications and some preliminary construction have been completed. The Bank has
evkwed the project design and found it satisfactory. The project is expected to be completed by mid-1995.
15.        The proposed Bank loan will be used to finame (a) goods purchased under the Bank's ICB
prcdurs (US$99 million) and local and international shopping procedures (US$" million), (b) civil works



-4-
procured under LCB procedures (US$12.5 million), (c) the energy conservation study (US$1.5 million) and
(d) technical assistance to DHOPCO (US$2.0 million). Retroactive financing equivalent to 10% of mte
proposed loan is recommended for expenses incurred after July 14, 1992, mostly for partial payment of
equipment purchased through advance contracting approved by the Bank and for the Energy Conservation
Study. The Bank loan represents 16% of total project costs and 90% of the foreign exchange component.
As 30% of the total cost is fimanced through equity, the remaining 54% is being secured through the
Petroleum Business Fund (26%), KDB Industry (6%), and commercial borrowing (22%). A breakdown of
costs and the fimancing plan are shown 'in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and
disbursements are shown in Schedule B. A timetable for key project processing steps and a summary of
current Bank Gr4-up operations in Korea are presented in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 11701-KO, dated May 12, 1993, is being distributed separately.
Project S
16.        The necessary conditons exist to ensure the project's financial and institutional susainability
and tbs provisions for cost recovery will ensure its operational sustainability. MOER's policy is to set
pipeline tariffs that are competitive with alternative modes of transport and yet yield a rate of return (on
DHOPCO's investment) of at least 12%. The criterion for Government investment is that a project must
atain at least a 12% rate of return; thus, a tariff sttucture based on this criterion is embodied in the
contracl relationship between DHOPCO and the five refineres. The minimum tariff is based on a model
that considers future demand, the refineries' optimization of the different transport modes available,
projected quantities of oil transported and stored (under a take-or-pay agreement between DHOPCO and the
five refineries), and DHOPCO's long run marginal costs. Tariffs are adjusted annually.
17.        Regarding institutional sustainability, DHOPCO is an efficient enterprise with competent staff,
whose orgmizational arrangement is suited to the operation of a pipeline. Although DHOPCO has existd
for only three years, it has achieved expertise and efficiency, as evidenced by its preparation for project
mplementation  The company will benefit from the experience it has already acqured from many of the
project development staff recruited from Korea's existing oil company (PEDCO) and pipeline company
(Hankuk Pipeline company), which have already developed, implemented and operated similar projects.
Agreed Actions
18.        Actions agreed with the Government and DHOPCO duing negotiations were: (a) the action
plan conained in Phase I of the Energy Conservation Study will be implemented; (b) as a condition of loan
effectiveness, Government and DHOPCO will sign a Subsidiary Loan Agreement satisfactory to the Bank;
(c) the environmental action plan prepared for the project wiUl be implemented and adhered to by aU parties
who use the pipeline, including new entrants; (d) DHOPCO will provide adequate liability insurance
coverage against risks associated with operatig the pipeline; (e) use of the pipeline will be offered to any
party; (f) the study on Phase II of Energy Conservation will be conducted; (g) DHOPCO's managemeat
iformation system (MIS) wil be stengthened aLd staff will be trained; and (h) DHOPCO wiU meet certain
agreed financial covenants.
Enviromentl Aspects
19.        DHOPCO prepared a comprehensive Environmental Assessment (EA) report which was
reviewed by the Bank extensively over an eight-month period. The major environmenta impacts of the
project have been fully evaluaitd and apprprate mitigation plans have been developed consistent with Bank



5 -
guidlies. Therefore, the poteial adverse environmental impacts of the project are minimal while the
advantages are substantial (para. 20).
Beneft
20.         The project will yield significant benefits that include: (a) economic benefits from substantial
savings in transpornation costs since those related to the pipeline are significantly less than for other modes;
(b) environmental and safety benefits, in terms of reducing air pollution (from the road tankes), water
pollution (from oil leaks and accidents involving vessels), and road and rail hazards (from accidents
iuvolving road and rail tankers); (c) indirect benefits, including a more timely and reliable petroleum supply
to other sectors, as well as reduced wear and tear to the highway system (therefore less capital investment);
(d) reduced congestion of port facilities, which will reduce both demurrage charges and investment costs;
and (e) efficiency improvements from implementing energy conservation measures and from inidating
institution buildmg for DHOPCO such as traning of its staff and providing it with a management
information system. The economic rate of return is esimated at 14%, based only on the benefits resulting
from transportation savings. Other benefits have not been quantified.
Rik
21.         The project-specific risks are minimal. The risk of cost overruns and implementation delays
as been taken into account in the project sensitivity analyses which show that the project economic viability
is robust. The land and rights-of-way have already been acquired. The environmental risks such as adverse
impacts on the ecosystem, land use, water and air quality, have been fully evaluated and approprate
mitigaton plans have been developed consistent with Bank guidelines.
Recmendto
22.         I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Article of Agreement of the Bank
and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
