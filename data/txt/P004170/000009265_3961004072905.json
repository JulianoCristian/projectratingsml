The project\n            consists of three parts.  The first is an approximately 1000\n            km pipeline system to transport petroleum products.  The\n            network will include an east-north trunkline connecting two\n            eastern refineries near Pusan to Taejon; a west-north\n            trunkline connecting the Honam refinery at Yeochon to\n            Taejon; and two parallel pipelines from Taejon to Seoul. The\n            system also includes two short segments, as well as storage\n            tanks, pumping stations and loading and unloading\n            facilities.  The system is designed to initially transport\n            about 500,000 barrels per day of clean projects or about 55%\n            of the total oil consumed domestically.  The second part is\n            a major study on energy conservation, including preparation\n            of an action plan for subsequent implementation by the\n            government.  The third includes technical assistance to the\n            Dae Han Oil Pipeline Corporation (DHOPC), which involves\n            training DHOPC staff in the critical areas of operations,\n            finance and management and helping to design and implement\n            DHOPC's management information system."}, "docdt": "1993-05-12T00:00:00Z"}
