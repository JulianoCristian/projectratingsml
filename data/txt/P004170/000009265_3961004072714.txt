PEROLEUM DJISIFRUTJON AND SECTOR MANAGEME4T IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
The Republic of Korea
y      :Lddan        Dae Han Oil Pipeine Coiporation (DHOPCO)
hA,mt:               US$ 120 million equivale
Teng-                15 years, inclu    five years of grace, at the Bank's stndard variable itre
rate
0     &hgtg Te:    lTe Government would re-lend the proceeds of the Bank loan to DHOPCO on the same
weras and conxitions as the Bank loan. DHOPCO would bear the foreign exchange and
interes. rate risks.
Mhe objecdve of the project is to improve the efficiency or Korea's energy sector and
enhance the reliability of petroleum supply. This will include: (a) establishig a more
efficent and rliable petroleum supply and disbution system ftrough the costuaion
of a pipeline network; (b) improving environmental quality and safety standards by
reducing air and water pollution and by reducing rail and road hazards; (c) developing
an appropriate energy consevaton progran (with a stgy to ustain t); and (d)
proving sector insdtutions by          thehei  ff financial, operadinal and managa
capabilities of DHOPCO.
The project consists of tbree parts. The first is an approximatdy 1000 km pipeline
sysmm to transport petroleum products. The network will include an east-north
undine conecting two eastern refnries (Yukong and Ssangyong) near Pusan to
Tacion; a west-north truline connectng the Honam riney at Yeocbon to Taejon;
and two parall ppelines from Taejon to Seoul. The proposed system also includes
two short segmen, as wll as storage anks, pumping stations and loadig and
unloadig facdites. The sysoMm is designed to initially transport about S00,000 bpd of
clean products or about 55% of the total oil consumed domestically. The second part
is a major study on energy conservadon, including prpration of an action plan for
subsequent implementation by the Govement The third includes tchnical assistance
tu DHOPCO, which involves training DHOPCO staff in the cridical aeals of operaadons,
fine  an management and helping to design and implement DHOPCO's management
information system.
The project will yield significant economic and environmental benefts, as well as
unquantified benefis resuldng from enancement in reliability of supply and greauer
efficiency in the secor, and indirect benefits to other sectors. The project's economic
befits are derived from saving assoated with traportig petroleum products via
the proposed pipeline versus existng mode (coast vessels, rai tankers and trucks).
The environmenta benefits include reductions in (a) aw pollution from the tuk; (b)
marine pollution, from oil leaks of vessels and from the loading facilities; and (c) r

nd ril hazards, fron acceis involving tucks. The Indirect benefits include reduc
wear and tar in the highway system and less congesdon of the port faciltes.
The project-specific risks are minimal. The risk of cost overruns and implean
delays have been tk  into  -ount in the project sensitivity analyses which show tha
its economic vily  is robust  The land and rights-of-way have lready been
acquirod. The envonmental risks have been fully evaluated and mitigation plans tbat
are consistent with the Bank guideines have been developed.

Chapter I
The Etergy Sector
A. Resources and Producton
1.1           Korea is almost totally devoid of indigenous commercial energy resources. Its energy
endowments consist essentially of limited hydroelectric power (2300 mw) and high-cost anthraite coal (750
million tons of recoverab' reserves). Thus, all the energy needs of this rap .Ny growing economy are met
through import.
1.2          In 1991, the total domestic energy supply requirements of Korea were 103.6 million tons oil
equivalent (toe), as is shown in Table 1.1. The country produces about 28% of the solid fuel it uses, mostly
in form of low quality coal (anthracite). However, its anthracite reserves are rapidly becoming depleted.
Furter, becaw  production costs are high, the Government is now encouraging tbat uneconomic mines be
abandoned, which in turn, is contributing to a progressive decline in anthracite production. For the balance
of its coal needs, Korea imports bitumimnous coal (56% coking coal and 46% steam coal), making the
country the second lrgest importer in the world after Japan.

1.3          Io 1991, the imported petroleum consisted of 59.2 million toe of crude oil, which were
processed in the country's five refineries, and 14.5 million toe of finished petroleum products. Petroleum
exports compnsed fuel oil, diesel oil and some jet fuel ( see Chapter II for a discussion of petroleum
supply).
1.4           The entire gas consumed in Korea is imported in the form of liquified natural gas (LNG).
The Govnment decided to import LNG in 1981 to diversify fuei supplies and to address environmental
concerns arisg from the use of more polluting fut-- such as fuel oil and coal. Thus, a contract for
impong LNG from Indonesia was signed in 1983 and once the Pyongtaek terminal was completed, LNG
began to be imported (in early 1987). The Pyongtk terminal is currenty being expanded through a Bank
loan (Loan No.3413-KO) to increase its capacity ftom 3 to 5 million tons of LNG per year; the contuction
should be completed by 1994. The engineering work for constructig a new LNG receiving terminal in
Inchan has begun, and after this terminal commens operatons in 2000, the total import capacity of LNG
wil reach 10 million tons per year.
1.5           At the end of 1992, the total installed power-generating-capacity was about 24,000 mw, of
which nuclear plants accounted for 32%, thermal station for 58% and hydropower 10%. Gross electricity
geneaion during the year was 118.6 trawatt-hours (Twh), about half of which originated from nuclear
plan. Since LNG was imported in 1987, it has accountd for 10.6 % of total electric power generation.

1.7           Growth in coal consumption has been declining primarily because the residental and
commercial sectors have been substuting cleaner and more convenently-handled fuels sucn as LNG,
Ilquified Petoleum Gas (LPG) and electricity for anth    coad. The coal consumption in these two
sectors has been decreasing at an average of 9.8% per year since 1986. Nevertheless, domestic anthracite,
used mostly in fabrication of briquettes for domestic space heating, is the mam source of energy for most
low-income housholds. The use of coal in the power sector has essenally remained constant since 1986,
despite the surge in power demand, which was met by the swpply of LNG. This trend, however, is not
expected to continue since the supply of LNG will be inffcient to meet the rapidly growing demand for
power generation fuel; therefore, the couny needs to import a subsntal amount of coal. Cuffendy, of
the tota coal consumed, 52% is in the industri sector, 29% in the resideial and ommrci  s rs and
19% in the power sector.
1.8           The rapid growth in petroleum consumpion (16% per year since 1986) stems from high
gsoiine conumption in the trasport sector as well as high kerosene consumption in the resent  and
commercial sectors, where kerosene is subsdtuting for coal (see Chapter II for a discussion of petroleum
Consumption).
1.9           The growth in LNG consumption has been limited by the availability of supply: current
consumption is 3 million tons per year and is expected to reach 5 million by 1994, representing 5.5% of the
country's total enery requreme. With the construction of the new LNG terminal at Inchon, supply
capacity will reach 10 million tons per year, rnep tig about 8%  of the couy's total energ
requreme   by 2000. About 62% of LNG will be used in the power sector and 38% in the industrial and
commercial sectors by that year.1'
1.10          The growth of nuclear-based power generation has slowed, as the avaiability of appropriate
sies for plants are becommg ineasigly scarce due to enviromental and safety concems.
1.11          Energy consumption by end-use sectors is shown in Table 1.3.  In 1991, the industrial
sector had the highest consumption (42.9 milion toe), followed by residental and commeal sectrs (21.8
milion toe), power sector (19.5 million toe), transport sector (16.1 million toe) and public sector (2.8
million toe). About 1.4 million toe were lost in tnsformation.

1.12          More dhan any other sector, transport has been responsible for the zrdth m ener
consumption since 1986, having both the highest average annual growth (16%) and z'me highest ncrease in
the share of total energy consumption (from 8% in 1981 to 16% in 1991). This is followed by the industrial
sector, with growth averaging 14.5% per year since 1986, although its share has not changed significantly
since 1981 (reasing from 38% to 41%). The share in the commercial and residal sectors has declined
substantially due to the use of higber efficiency fuels such as LNG, LPG and electricity.
C.PEd=
1.13          Energy products are priced on a full cost-recovery basis and, are in line with international
prices. Domestic coal (anhacite) prices are set by the Government and are approximately at parity with
ined coal prices on an energy-equivalent basis. The average retail price of anthracite coal (gade 5 with
calorific value of 4,400-4,600 kcal/k) was about US$54 per ton in 1991, whie tat of imported bituminous
coal is detmined by the international market place. Since domestic coal production is declining and the
country's future coal needs must be met through iLports, the price of aU coal in Korea wil be based on
inteational prices.
1.14          The price of electricity is based on long-run marginal cos which the Korea Electric Power
Company (KEPCO) intrduced in 1977, including a tme-of-use rates for the larger consumers. In 1989,
KEPCO carried out a comprehenive tarff study as part of the agreemen under SAL II. The study,
reconciling efficiency objectives with financial and income-distribution considerations, resulted in impri
the tariff stucture by eliminating subsidies for the agriclte sector, mnimizing cross-subsidies, redefining
consumer groups and allowing KEPCO to earn a reasonable rate of return on its capitl investmeut. The
average retail price of electricity in Korea during 19.'I was US$0.07/Kwh. However, electricity rates are
expected to rise again in the near future in order to meet KEPCO's significani capital investment
requirements.
1.15          Given the recent development of gas industry in Korea and the Government's plan to
promote the use of gas, the Government continues to set the price of LNG - both the wholesale price
charged by the Korea Gas Corporation (KGC) to KEPCO and the City Gas Companis (CGCs), and the
retail price charged by the CGCs to individual consumers. The wholesale price is based or, the import (CIP)
priceof LNG and an agreed margin designed to cover K5C costs. The retail price is set Lo as to provide
sufficient return to the CGCs, while taking into account the competitive position of gas vis-a-vis alternaive
fuels. The average retail price of LNG in 1991 was US$5.85 per mmbtu to industry, US$6.51 per mmbtu
to the commrial sector and US$8.77 per mmbtu to the residential sector. Gas imports are sublect to a 1%
customs tarff and a value added tax of 10%.

1.16           The dereguation of petroleum  products prices began in February  1983, when the
Government lifted the price control on jet fuels and solvents. Deregulation of other prices has since been
progresively implemented: asphalt in November 1988; premium gasoline and napbtha in March 1989 and
remaining gasoline grades and kerosene in September 1991. The only three products still subject to price
controls are diesel oil, heavy fuel oil and LPG. Price controls on all petroleum products ae expected to be
lifted by the end of 1993 in order to stimulate competition in the oil refining indusfty.
1.17           Prices of products that have not yet been liberlized are set by tIIhe Government at three
stages: for refiners, agents (wholesalers) and retailers (including the service stations). Price setting takes
into account all cost factors. The basic customs tariff is 5% of the CIF price of imported crude oil as well
as of imported petroleum products. Excise taxes are levied either on the price of imported products or on
the ex-factory prices of domestic production as the case may be. They include: 8% for LPG, 9% for
diesel, 109% for unleaded gasoline and 130% for regular gasolineY Also, a value-added tax of 10% is
applied to all oil products at the refiners' level, as well as to the margins of the wholesale and retail dealers.
In addition, the Korea Foreign Trade Association charges a 0.15% tax on the C&F prices of al imported
petroleum products. A surchage tax for the Petroleum Business Fund is levied on imports of crude oil and
petroleum products; and while the amount varies, it should be equal to the diffeene between the actual oil
import cost and the cost set by the Government. The Fund is used mainly for a petro:eum stockpile and for
financial assistance in construction of petroleum transportation facilities, such as the proposed pipeline.

remain the responsibiliy of the Ministry of Science and Technology-MOST), is the Ministry of Energy
and Resources (MOER). KEPCO and Korea Electric Safety Corporadon (KESC) dominate the electricity
sector. Te Petroleum Development Corporation (PEDCO) deals with oil exploration and development.
KGC and the Korea Gas Safety Corporation (KGSC) are responsible for gas supply and safety aspects of the
gas industry. Dai Han Coal Corporation (DHCC) and Korea Mining Promodon Corporation (KMPC) deal
with coal and minesal resources. The Korea Energy Managemenu Corporation (KEMCO) is involved in and
provides most of te fends for energy conservation activities. The Korea Energy Economic Institute (KEEI)
and Korea Inste for Energy Research (KER) are concerned with energy econonucs, foestig and
R&D. (Organiional chart of Korea's energy sectr, showing various affilated entifes and their reltiolns
to the MOER is attached). The proposed project will he implemented by D)ae Han Oil Pipeline Corporation
(DHOPCO), an entity which is 50.88% owned by the MOER and is reponsible for   sporting oil products
in Korea. The President of DHOPCO reports to the Director of the Resource and Policy Office of the
MOER, who in turn reports to the Minister (see para. 4.5).
1.19         There are no major institutional issues in Korea's energy sector. While the Board of
Directors, and in some cases the top management of these entities, are appointed by the Government, the
enites operate on a commercial basis without impeding the functioning of a free energy market; they are
largely independent of Government interventon and fully autonomous in day-to-day operations. A common
practice in Korea with regard to major investments is that the Government frequenty establishes a company,
with itself as the major shareholder, and then privatizes it once it is operating and earning revenues. The
criteria for establishing such companies is for the proposed investment to atin at least a 12% rate of return.
B. Issm. Straterv and the Role of the Pronosed Proect
1.20         While Korea has addressed many of the sectoral issues in the past, some issues still remain;
and, some which had been dealt with have resurfaced. The phenomenal growth in the county's economy-
hence, the need for energy to fuel suL. growth--together with the lack of indigenous energy resources and
past global oil cnses have created a pivotal role for energy m the country's economy and in the
Government's decision-making process.
1.21          Approximately 91 % of Korea's energy requirements were inported in 1991. The import
bil was US$12.5 billion, represendng over 15% of the country's total imports and about 18% of its export
earnings. The sheer magnitude of the unount involved and the country's total dependence on imported
energ creates a central preoccuton for the Government: How to develop an effective and sustainable
energy strategy which would support the county's rapid economic growth. After the two oil crises and with
increasing concerns over the environmenal im4pacts of energy use, the Government, in early 1980s,
developed a strategy that aimed to bring about greater efficiency in the use of energy and enhance the
reliability of its supply, while minimizing the environmental impacts. The strategy targeted five key areas:
(a) fostering energy conservation; (b) deregulat  the energy sector; (c) assessing, in a comprehensive
manner, the environmental impacts of energy production and use and developing and implementing
environmental protection and safety policies; (d) diversifying both the type of the energy utilized as well as
the sources of import; and, (e) optimizing, through expansion, rehabilitation and new construction, the
development of the physical infrastuctur needed to manufacture and transport energy products.
1.22         The Government's attempts to implement the above strategy have met with mixed results.
Diversification has been a success, carried out in an economic and efficient manner. A phased-deregulation
of the sector is also being executed successfully, albeit at a slow pace. Environmental issues associated with
the energy sector are being addressed seriously, as the Government is making gemine attempts at the local
and national levels to assess their long-term implications, and develop appropriate mitigation plans to protect
the environment. However, efforts to sustain energy conservation have not been very successful. Finally,
the construcdon of energy-related infrastucture is being carried out in a rational manner.



1.23          To the extent the above issues have not been addressed, or have been addressed but the
expected reuts have been less than satisfactory (such as the energy conservation issue), Korea's enewr
sector connes to function inefficiently. The rsolving of the rema_ ing issues leading to improvement in
sector efficiency and management is a top Government priority. It was in this cont that the Bank agreed
to work with the Govenment to alleviate the remaiing sectoral issues before Korea's graduation from Bank
lending in 1995. The Bank pardcation in the proposed project helps address as many of these issues as is
feasible under one operation, thus providig significant value-added benefits to the project Y. The following
paragrphs disuss the Government's past success in coping with thte above issues, as well as its handing of
remaining issues and the exte  to which the proposed project intends to address them.
1.24            M   Conservation. Energy intensity  was very high in Korea durig the 1960s and
197Qs when heavy, enegy-inteasive industries such as steel, chemical and petrochemical were expanding.
It decined in the early 1980s when some industrial activities shifted to hr-techlology ma tring that
was less energy-itesive (see Figure 1). In addition to this stctural change, it declined due to certin
Government measures designed to effectively control energy demand and foster conservation: These
included passing the Energy Utilizaton Act (EUA) in 1979 and simultaneously creatng the Korea Eary
Management Coiporation (KEMCO) in order to improve the eficiency of energy use through regulations,
fianci assistance and incentives, national campaigns and education, research and development (R&D) in
conservation technology, the use of energy-efficient equipment and development of high-efficiency forms of
nergy ulaadon schemes such as co-generation and distict-heating. However, after 1987, energy intensity
rose agin, reflecting the erosion of energy conservation measres (see Figure 1).

1.25          While the concept of energy intensity is a relatively crude measurement of energy efficiency
-- because it does not take into account the industay mix -- it does provide a general indication of efficiency
in energ use. Based on this measurement, Karea's economy is significany more energy-intensive than that
of the OECD countries (see Figure 2). Measuring the growth in erergy consumption relative to growth in
the country's GDP (energy/GDP elastcity), also shows significant increase since 1987, with 1990 elasticty
beng well above one. The elasticity is expected to remain above one, at least until 1993-1994, although the
Goverment target for energy elasticity is 0.75 by 1996 ( which is dsigly below the long-term average,
which appears to be an optmistic expectaton). Recognizing the large differences between energy intensities
of Korea and OECD countries, the Government attaches considerable importance to increasing energy
conservation and improving efficiency. Further, given the heavy burden of energy on the economy, the
Government's policy for energy conservation is aimed not only at developing  easues leading to more

1.26          The incase in energy intey since 1987 (Figure 1), has become a major source of
concern beause despite Govent effor in tbis area, the continuing rapid growt of the economy has put
a great deal of pressure on the nation's ability to cost-efectively meet its energy needs. The Goveme's
response to this latest rise in energy intensity was to amend the Enery Ulizaion Act of 1979, prepaing a
much stron  sact for the next five-year Enery Consraton Plan and Program (1992-1997).
1.27          In Bank discussions with the Govemen  it was undetood that a stronger act or
regulation withut te necessay market elements may not reduce energy consunption: Conservation canmot

1.28         Although the structural changes towards les energy-intensive industry are lioely to be more
important in reducing total energy-intensity tban technical efficiency gains, a substantial amount of energy
could be conserved through technical efficiency gains -- if measures are designed and implemented
appropriately. One important element in this route is technology transfer. The Government should foster,
including through import, the introduction of additicnal end-use technologies into the Korean market,
particularly small-scale, bigh-efficiency technologies such as small *-generation units for commercl use
and high-efficiency gas boilers for residential space. The Government should also provide mechanisms for
assisting end-users to adopt these technologies. The altermative end-use technologies, energy consumption,
economic development, and social preferences should then be integrated to provide a framework for
estimating and comparing the potential costs and benefits of alternative conservation measures.
1.29         The Govenment now intends to implement the amended EUA talkng into account the above
factors, in order to develop a sustinable energy conservation program that will not disrupt the economy.
However, the proper evahation of the above factors is a complex task. Thus, Govermment asked for Bank
assistance to study ways to improve energy conservation measures and to help manage energy demand
growdh in Korea. To this end, the Goverment accepted the Bank's recommendation to set up an energy
conservation steering committee of three MOER representatives and one represeave each from the
Economic Planning Board (EPB), KEPCO, KEMCO, KEEI, KGC, and DHOPCO. The steering committee
has initiated, with the help of the Bank, a major study, the objective of which is to develop a plan setting
forth policies and actions that will promote the most efficient use of energy in Korea given the country's
economic development needs and evo'ving consumer demands. The scope of the study is divided into two
phases. Phase I provides (a) an estimate of potential energy savings through conservation efforts, while
considering the interavtions among energy, economic and technology factors in Korea; (b) a "road map" in
the form of a pioritized conservation program developed through a systematic cost-benefit analysis of
vaanous options; and (c) an agreed plan of actions for Phase II, covering the implementon, monitring
and, if needed, further evaluation of specific conservation programs. The Phase I study was carried out by
a reputable intemational consulting firm (Stanford Research Instiute-SRI- Intnational), and the contract for
the study was awarded in accordance with Bank guidelines. The Phase I report dated April 26, 1993 has
been subnitted and subsequenty agreed with the Govermnent during negotiations. The major conclusions
include seven specific actions: (i) strengthening the planning and coordination functions; (ii) establishing
systematic measrement and evaluation processes for Energy Conservation Programs; (iii) actively
evaluating the feasibility of implemenfting Market-based Energy Pricing Policies; (iv) promoting Integrated
Resource Planniag to KEPCO and KGC; (v) developing methodology and technology required for efficient
management and operation of oil and gas pipelines; (vi) deepeing and broadning the Energy Conservation
Support base; and (vii) further developing studies and plans for Integrated Transportation System
Development and Management. Phase II wfll focus on the development of detailed conservation program
desigps, im    ion podures and schedules, the appropriate mechanism for monitoring and evating
the specific energy conservation measures, and recommendations for appropriate institutions for program
implementtion. Duing the negotiations, agreement was reached with DHOPCO that it would engage
qualified consultants, under terms of reference and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, to carry out Phase It
of the Energy Conservation Study. Annex 1 gives the terms of reference (TOR) for Phase I, describing in
more detail the objecdves and scope of the study.
1.30         D     uon. In its attempt to induce greater efficiency in the sector, the Government
promulgated a phased-in deregulation plan for petroleum in 1987. The plan called for libealizing the non-
pricing regations, as well as those that related to price which were still in effect in 1987 (liberalization of
petroleum prices began in 1983). Although the implementation of the plan initially faced some obstacles-
mostly from Govemment's own intervention to protect other industies-the first phase of deregulation was
successfuly completed in 1989. By the end of 1992, many elements of phase two were also in place,
leaving only a few regulations stiU intact.
1.31         Indeed, deregulaton has been applied to every stage in the supply and distribution of
petroleum products in the cotry, such as the refmiing process, imports, tansport, and distrbution. The
refining industry consists of five private companies (pan. 2.4), two of which include foreign capital (the



-9-
Goverment now alows non-Koreans to hold up to 50 percent of the shares of the refiing companies). In
general, the companies only need to obtain Government approval for major modifications of facilities, such
as those involving the disdllation plants and would affect the refining capacity. With regard to imports,
although the imports of crude oil and petroleum products are still subject to a licensing system, it does not
restrict competition. Rather, the system is only used for oil emergency purposes: All licenses are authorized
as long as importers fulfil their obligations with respect to maintaining emergency stocks. The importers
include the five refineries, LPG companies, KEPCO and a number of trading companies. Deregulation in
petroleum transport sector will be increased significantly because the proposed pipeline will be operated
similarly to a common carrier available for use by all interest d parties (para. 3.5). Adoption of this
principle would be an important step toward greater private sector participation in Korea's petroleum supply
and distribution market. Finally, the procedures for settng up service stations have been liberalized so that
any compay, including non-Korean frms, can now establish service stations: At present, the retail
distnrbution of petroleum products is done by 4,700 service stations which are idependent from the refining
companies. The only existing reglaion involves the minimum distance between stations, which has been
relaxed recently and it will be completely lifted on November 15, 1993. Further, the service stations are
now alowed to display any trademarks, including those of a refner (indicating that the station sells products
from that refiner) or independent signs (indicating that it sells products from any refiner); or it need not state
the origin of the products.
1.32          Until now, deregulation has been progressing smoothly and has achieved most of its
objecives, particularly in the area of price decontrol. There are, however, several issues that need to be
addressed expeditiously in order to safeguard the susanablity of the deregulation. First, some type of anti-
trust legisation is needed to ensure that markeing agents do not aRocate the market among themselves.
Second, operators of import termimls must be required to give fair access, at a reasonable fee, to third
parties. Third, ownershp of the petroleum truck fleet must be divorced from the marketers. Further, there
is a need for an adequate regulatory framework to deal with the liralized stuation. The Bank has
dassed these with the Government and is satified it will address these remaining issues in the near future
and that it intends to achieve full dereguation of the country's petroleum industry.
1.33          Given that the objective of Energy Conservation Study is to develop a plan to promote the
most efficient use of energy, this may include identiyng any existng  egulations that hinder the
development of an effective energy conservation program. During negotiations, agreement was reached
with the Govemment that any regulations that hinder the implmentation of an effective energy conservation
program will be removed or revised, in a manner and time frame satisfactory to the Bank, to promote the
most efficient use of energy in Korea.
1.34          Diversification.  The Government's new strategy called for reducing dependence on
petroleum by diversifying into alternative energy sources including imported coal, liquifled natural gas
(LNG) and nuclear energy, as well as selecting a wide spectrum of energy suppliers for oil and other energy
imports. Korea has pursed t"is policy with much success. In the supply side, heavy investments were
made in nuclear energy: As of July 1992, total installed nuclear capacity was 7,615 mw, providing about
14% of the country's total energy requirements. Also, import of LNG is another important facet of this
diversifation strategy: Import of LNG, which began in 1987, now represents 3.5% of the countly's total
energy requirements and will rise to 4%-5% by 1994 after the Bank-financed LNG terminal at Pyongtaek is
completed, and again to about 8% by 2000, after the new Inchon LNG terminal is constrcted. Korea also
diversified its source of oil supply, as it gradually shifted from long-term conats to spot-market purchases.
1.35          Phsical Infrstructure. The Government has also taken measures to ensure that public
investment conforms to least-cost development principles. The energy utilities are allowed to earn a
reasonable rate of return on their invested funds, and in some cases these funds are used to help fnanee the
cotucton of addi          infrastructur. At preset the country's five private refineries are expanding and
upgrdig their facilites so as to produce products which are more compatible with the country's
consumptin paen. However, even considering the lower energy demand forecasts in the seventh five-
year plan (7% per year), considerable investment in still needed in energy-related infr ture to satisfy the



-10-
growing demand. Becuse italy-generated funds are unlikely to be sufficient to cover all the costs of
the planned additions, the Govermment is allowing private sector shareholdings in energy corporations such
as KEPCO.
1.36         The proposed project is another significant undertaking (see Chapter VI for project
benefits). The deleterious effects of traporig   petroleum products under present modes-vessels, rail
tankers and trucks-with regards to the environment, safety, economics and reliability, are discssed in
Chapter II.
1.37          Environmena Policy. In 1980, the Government recognized that the side-effect of its
economic development policy was potential deterioration in the country's environment conditions. Thus,
the sixth five-year plan, and, even more so, the seventh five-year plan had as their main objective, the
harmony between economic prosperity and the preservation of the enviromnent. In Jamnaty 1990, the
Government elevated the Office of Envmironment Administion to Cabinet level and established the Ministly
of Enviromnent (MOE). In the same year, the National Assembly proposed a comprehensive Environmea
Prevention Act, enhancing all aspects of enviromental protection including air, water, hazardous chemicals,
noise and vibration, and solid waste management.  In partcular, the Consttuton was amended to
incorporate a clean and healthy evironment as a basic human right.
1.38         The MOE has identified the main energy-related environmental concerns to be the level of
the emissions of total suspended paulaes (TSP), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulphur oxides (SOx). The
bulk of air pollution in Korea comes from the combustions of coal and oil, and emissions from motor
vehicles. Also, electricit geneaion is a significant contributor and measures have been recendy itmoduced
to reduce emissions from thermal power plants. To meet the emission standards set by MOE for 1995 and
1999, KEPCO is planing to invest US$3.6 billion betwee  1992 and 2000. In addition, MOE has
mandated the use of natual gas for power plants in the metropolitan areas and in the commerci and publc
sectors of 14 designated large cities. The Government has also required oil refineries to instal product
delphurization facilities. With respect to NO, emissions, the Government has introdrieed standards which
require new gasoline vehicles to be fied with catalytic converters. Furher, it is combating the problem of
high-level TSP by replacing coal and bunker-C fuels with cleaner fuels such as natural gas, and relocaing
the poluig inusries such as anthracite bnquette factories outside of cities.
1.39         In the seventh five-year Plan, the Government set a target of incasing the share of clean
energy from 26.5% in 1991 to 49% in 1996. The clean energy share is defined as the number of houses
using gas (as opposed to coal), the mber of LNG-fired power plants, desulphurization capacity, and the
share of unleaded gasoline in the markL Table 1.5 presents the components targeted by the Government
for increasing the share of clear energy.

1.40          In the contex of th Government's high priority to enviromental considetalons, any new
projects must satis  its objectives.  In this rspect, the proposed proiect fits the Goverment's
environmeital and saety citera.  Not only the project contibutes significandy in improving the
environmental quality and safety standards, it helps estaish, for the first time, an environmental and safety

sectoral (industry, residental and commercial, power, and public) energy demand, which is determned by
kng into account the energy price, share of the sector and GDP and popuaion growth.

1.42          The Govemnment projects that the implied energy/GDP elaAtici y will decline from its
current level of 1.27 to 0.75 by 1996. This may be an optimistic projection in view of the sharp growth in
energy demand. Based on Bank projections of GNP growth (7.5% p.a. between 1992-1996) and enery
consumption growth (7% p.a. for the same period), the implied energy/GDP elasticity is expected to be 0.93
for the period. Petroleum dendence is expected to remam at the current level of 57%-60%, but total
energy dependence wil increase to about 95% by 1996, reflecfing the increase in imports of LNG and
bituminous coal.

A. Present and Past Cousum#tlon of Petroleum Products
2.1          Since Korea has no indigenous hydrocarbon resources, the country imports all its petroleum
products, either in form of crude oil (which is processed in five local refineries), or finished petroleum products:
In 1991, this amounted to about 408 million barrels of crude oil and 110 million barrels of finished petroleum
products. Korea also exported about 70 million barrels of products in that year. The country's net consumption
of petroleum products was 448 million barrels, or 1.23 million barrels per day (bpd). Petroleum consumption
per capita in Korea is 10.4 barrels per year. Table 2.1 provides the breakdown of petroleum consumptin by
type of products in 1991, and Table 2.2 shows the pattern of consumption.
2.2           Altogether, consumption has risen dramatically in recent years. The use of LPG has grown at
a rapid pace due to both the improved living standards and stringent environmental regulations. This was
particularly marked in the urban residendal and commercial sectors where LPG substituted for kerosene and
coal. However, kerosene consumption also increased because it is substituting for coal in resident  sector in
remote areas. Further, gasoline consumption surged due to increased demand in the tranport sector: In 1981,
there was one car for every 67 Koreasm, but by 1986, there was one car for every 31 and by 1991, there was
one car for every 10 Koreans. In addition, diesel consumption in the industrial, resiental and commercial
sectors gew at an average rate of 8%-9% between 1981-1991, but growth in transport was 16% over the same
period. Fuel oil demand, which declined from 1981-1986 mainly because of decreased consumption in the
power sector due to environmental concerns, rose agan as the result of increased power generation requirements
and the unavailability of sufficient LNG (as a clean fuel). Consumption of naphtha also grew, due to the
mncreased need for petrochemical products. Table 2.3 provides the sectoral share of petroleum consumpton in
1986 and 1991.
B. Ex%istii System
2.3          In 1991, Korea purchased about 40)0 milon barrels of crude at an average C&F price of
US$19.59 per barrel: 74% was purchased from the Middle East, 21% from Southeast Asia, 4% from Latin
America and 1%  from Africa. In addition, it imported about 110 million barrels of finished petroleum products,
mainly from the Asia region.
2.4           Five refineries process the imported cmde and are also the major importers of the petroleum
products. Although the first refinery was Government owned, all are now privately owned and two have joint
ventures vith foreign oil companies. All five refineries which are located on the coastal region to faciLitate the
ocean tankers, supply the imported crude. About 75% the supply comes from the three refineries in southern
region (Yukong, Honam and Ssangyong). The volume of cmde and products imported by the refineries is
determined by their non-regulated market share.

2.5             The pattern of petroleum consumption has changed, as the countly requies increasigly more
desuphurized light oil products and LPG.  To cope with changng demand, refineries first imported light
petroleum  products; however, they soon recognied that major investment  in heavy oil cracking and
desuphurization facilities were needed to respond to strcter environmental regulaons. Thus, a total of 144,000
bpd of crackdng capacity and 60,000 bpd of desulfrzation capacity will be insaled by the end of 1993. By the
end of 1995, the cracking facilities will reach to a capacity of 204,000 bpd and desulphurization 135,000 bpd
(para. 1.39). Table 2.4 presents the refinery capacity.

2.6             After refining, distribution of petroleum products (both refined and imported) is handled through
a multi-stage network:
(a)     About 47%  of total sup,.ly is transported by the refineries to the "direct sales n depots, to be
sold to the large consumers such as KEPCO. Depending on the location of the large
consumers, it is ansported either in coastal vessels, rail tankers or trucks.
(b)     The remaiing 53%  is transported by the refineries to the "sales agents" who, in turn, sell the
products to a "direct sales store" for medium size consmers (15.2%), to service stations
(29.2%), and to sub-dealers (8.6%) for retail sales to consumers. This supply is also
tansported by coastal vessels, rail tankers and trucks, while the sales agents distrbute the
products mostly by road trucks.

2.7          At present 240 coasal vessels, 1600 fail takers and 5400 tucks tursport about 90% of the
counuty's petroleum. Only about 10% is carred by a pipeline system (IBRD map 24104). Annex 2 provides a
breakdown of the existg transpot modes by type of tansport and by refnries and dealers.
C. Future Demand For Peroleum
2.8          Growth in consumption of varous fuels is expected to slow, but at differing rates. LPG
consumption is not expected to slow significandy until 1996; however, growth in kosene consumption is
expectd to drop from an average of 26% over 1986-1991 to 6.2% from 1991-1996, and will probably level off
to about 2%-3% per year after 1996. Gasoline consumption is expected to slow to 15% between 1991-1996,
and to 12% between 1996-2001. Demand for petroleum products is projected by KEEI, based on a model using
the same paameters that project the country's energy demand. Table 2.5 shows the forecast of future demand
for petoleum .
D. Need for an Efficient Distributon System
2.9          At present, the e ng tansport system creates senous problems. First, it is uneconomic
because most of the rdining capacity is located in the south and over 40% of the market is in the north, in the
Seoul Metropolian area, thus, petroleum products must be trsported by trck, rail tankers and coastal vessels.
The system is also uneliable becuse it does not have the flexibility it needs during peiods of high demand.
Over long distances, pipeline would be the most economic mode for transportig petroleum products. In
addition, trucks and rail tankers create severe atmospheric pollution and the vessels have inceased marine
polution drough ofl leaks and around the loading facilities: It is estimated the annual contribution to air
polution is about 990,000 tons of CO2., 11,000 tons of NOx and 6,000 tons of SO2. The Kean coastal
authorities also estimate that oil leaks from vessels amounted to about 2.42 million liters m 1990. Further, the
exisng modes create safety hazards: While no reliable stistics exist for truck accidents, they are frequently
reported. With respect to shippmg accidents, data from coastal authorities indicate that out of 240 total accidents
in 1991, 35 (14.6%) involved petroleum vessels.
2.10         The present modes also have created considerable congestion in the country's tan on
infra   ure. Due to rapid economic growth, road, rail and port capacity has been stretched to the limit. The
Kyungin highway (the main road for asportg oil products to the Seoul metropoltan area), was designed for
42,000 cars per day, a limit reched in 1986. At present, it carries 82,000 cars per day. Similarly, the Inchon
port facilities were designed for 35 million tons of cargo a year, a limit that was reacbed in 1988. Already, the
cargo througt  of this port is 60 million tons per year. But, given the projected demand for petroleum
products, by year 2000, Korea will need to distribute 2 million barrels of oil products per day. Such an increase
can only exacerbate the congestion problem.

2.11          The proposed project should resolve many of these problems. With regard to congestion, the
mimber of coastal vessels will decrease by 44%, and the rail tankers by 88%. While the number of trucks wil
only be reduced by 25%, those that remain will cover short distances in limited areas. In terms of safety, the
pipei should reduce the road traffic in Kyungin highway alone by 2,700 trucks per day by year 2000Y1' The
economic benefits as well as the nironmental and safety benefits reswlting from the reduced number of vessels,
rail tankers and trucks, are discussed in Chapter VI.
E. Leons from Previous Bank Ibnvolvemen
2.12          The Bank has played a major role in Korea's development through a diversified lending program
that has involved over 100 operations, several of which were for power projects. Of these only one loan was for
the petroleum sub-sector, for a Gas System Expansion Project that became effective in March 1992. Although
it is too early to derive any lessons from this last operation, Bank experience in Korea with power projects has
been exemplaty vwth regard to the efficiency with which they were implemented.
F. Ratinae for Bank Involvement
2.13          The rationale for Bank involvement in the project needs to be discussed in relaton to Korea's
gaduation. In August 1991, when the Bank and Government developed plans to phase out Bank lending by
1995, they agreed on an aggregate level of lending during this period, as well as on a range of amual lending.
It was also agreed that Bank lending must have significant value-added benefits and a major impact on sectoral
policies, in order to justify Bank participation. Namely, priority areas for Bank operations would be those in
which the Bank could provide value apart from   ansferng fiani resources. At the same time, as incomes
and urbanizaton have increased, the Govermment has been pressed to address social and environmental concerns
while contRing to upgrade inauctu  and manufacturing technologies to enable industry to develop more
sophisticated products for export. Therefore, Bank operational work is now focused on: (a) supportng specific
areas of high-priority infrasuucttre investment with technology transfer and institutional development; (b) further
lberizng the financial sector; and (c) addressing social and envnmetal issues.
2.14          After several rounds of discssions in which the county's priority needs (including an efficient
petroleum distribution system) were assessed in the context of Bank's criteria, an energy project was proposed
that contais substantial policy objectives, including an increase in the sector's efficiency, improved
environm al quality and safety standards, and greater reliability of petroleum supply. The proposed project
fits well with Bank criteria.  While its economic befits (lower transortation costs) and enviromnental and
safety benefits (redced air and marine pollution and decreased road and rail accidents), and supply benefits (the
more reliable pipeline vers existing modes of tranwsport) could be achieved regardless of Bank involvement,
other critical benefits-such as inreaiDng the sector's efficiency, raising the level of environmental and safety
standards in the country's oil industry during thne construction and operation of the new infrtuct  (and
similar inrastuctr in future), and strengting the capabilities of the sector's institutions-would probaily not
mateialize.
2.15          With respect to improwvng sector efficncy, the Bank encouraged the Government to develop a
plan that sets forth policies and actions to promote efficient use of energy through appropriate conservation
measures. To this end, the Bank, MOER, and DHOPCO prepared joint terms of reference for the proposed
Energy Conservation study, and the resulting action plan will be implementd by the Government (para. 1.29).
The Goverment and DHOPCO have earmarked US$1.5 mitlion of the proposed loan to carry out phase I and II
(of the study). With respect to the environment and safety, through its involvement, the Bank has already
1/ Assuming tank capact of 100 bbl.



-18-
significandy contibuted to strengtening DHOPCO's capabilities and hence raised the level of safety and
environmental standards in the county's oil industry. Some examples include the followmng: (a) it required
DHOPCO to develop well-designed spll-contol plans that include trained teams and clean-up equipment that can
respond immediaty n the event accidents occur near rivers and lakes along the pipeline routes; (b) it alened
DHOPCO to the potential for high-risk accide;ts in the terminals and along the pipeline routes, which led
DHOPCO  to develop disaster contingency plans that incude emergency teams, routing-drill praces,
coordination with public emergency response services, and acquisition and installation of stationay and mobile
fire fighting, fire detection and rescue equipment; and (c) it helped DHOPCO identify the high traffic loads
around the Seoul termial. As a result of this last concern, DHOPCO changed the project design to cope with
the large nmber of tmcks and people (changes involved access roads and facilities for drivers). These concems
have been incorporated in a high- quality envroental and hazard assessment report which will be used by all
participaws, including new enras (para. 3.8).  Furdter, as the result of Bank involvement, DHOPCO has
agreed that the proposed pipeline will continue to be available to all interested parties, hence pavmg the way for
greater private sector participation and increased competition. Finally, deregulation measures related to energy
conservation progras will also contribute to greater sector efficiency (para. 1.33).
2.16          The Government's agreement to carry out a major sudy on energy conservation and finance its
costs, and moreover, to submit an action plan for energy conservation as a condition of Bank loan approval,
clearly demonstates its desire for Bank assistance in sector analysis and policy formulation, particularly in those
areas where the Bank is able to bring the benefits of broader experience.  Fuhermore, the borrower's
willingness to make significant changes to the EA report and comply wt!h Bank-prescribed envomental
mitigation plans and safety standards, is another indication of Korea's interest in the Baks non-monetary
assistace.
2.17          Inde, Bank involvement will help the Government address these critical areas (conservation,
dergulton, environment and safety) which might otherwise not receive proper attention until after Korea's
grduation, paruarly as the Bank is now the only offrcial source of exteral assistance and advice (since ADB
and OECF are no longer active in the country). Not only will Bank involvement ensure that energy conservation
programs, envirormental mitigation plans, guarantees for the open use of the pipeline and institutional building
within the project entity be implemented, but the internalization of these actions will also have significant value-
added benefits. Without these value-added benefits resulting from Bank involvement, Korea would simply
constrct a pipeline.



Chapter m
The Project
A.  P        ,d
3. X         The pre-feasibility study for the proposed project (in the form of a route survey) was conducted
in April 1980. This was foUowed by feasibility and basic engineng studies, carried out in 1983 and 1984
respectively. In Decmber 1989, the National Assembly enactd the Oil Pipeline Law and which took effect in
1990; this law provided that the project be icluded in the sixth and seventh five-year plans. Subsequently, a
more detailed design was carried out by a joint venture of internationa and Koran consults, which led to the
constuction of 30 kilometer segment, in Kyungin section.
B. Project Obiective
3.2          The objective of the project is to improve the efficieney of Korea's energ sector and enhae
the reliabilit of petroleum supply. This will include: (a) establishing a more effic   and reliable petroleum
suply and distrbution system through the construction of a pipeline network; (b) improving envionmental
quality and saety standards by reducing air and water pollution and by reducing rail and road hazards; (c)
developing an appropiate energy conservation progm  (with a strategy to sustain it); and (d) improvig sector
institudons by stengthening the financial, operational and managerial capaies of DHOPCO.
C. Project Desitl
3.3          The project consists of three parts:
(a)    An approximately 1,000 km pipeine system to transport petroleum products. The network will
include an east-north tunkline connecfting two eastern refinries (Yukong and Ssangyong) near
Pusan to Taejon (300 kIlometers); a west-north trunkline connecting the Honam refinery at
Yeochon to Taejon (275 kilometers); and two paralel pipelines from Taejon to Seoul (141
kilometers each). The proposed network also includes two short segments, one comecting the
Kyung-in refinery at Inchon to Seoul and Kimpo, and another linking Kwangju to Kolsung. In
addition, the system includes storage tanks, pumping stations and loading and unloading
facilities. The system is designed to initally transport about 500,000 bpd of light (clean)
products or about 55% of total oil consumed domestically. (Other petroleum products, such as
fuel oil, will continue to be shipped through the existng system). Annex 3 gives a more
detailed description of this part of the project, including a diagram of the project facilities.

(b)    A major study on energy conservation that will include an action plan that can be subsequently
implemented by the Govemment. This is discussed in para. 1.29 and detailed terms of
reference for the Study are given in Annex 1.
(c)    Technical assistance to DHOPCO, which involves helping design and implement a management
information system (para. 4,10) and trainig DHOPCO staff in the critical areas of operations,

D. 8tatus of Project Premsratlon
3.4           The project is in an advaned stage of prepaon. A small section (30 km) of the network at
Kyungin is now complete and cperting; about 90% of the land and right-of-ways needed have been purd ed;
and, some of the engieerng specificaions (for equipment, termals, pump stations and ancillaries) and some
preliminary construction have been completed.  The Bank has reewed the project design and found it
satisfatory. Annex 4 provides a more detailed discussion of the project's technical and design features.
E. Contratual Asectand Plule Tadru
3.5           DHOPCO was established under the Article of Incorpoation of January 20, 1990. Based on
this Article and a subseque Joint Investment Agreement, the Government's equity participation in the proposed
project is 50.8%, while seven other private entities hold 49.2% of the shares (para. 4.3). The country's five
local refineries are among the seven private shareholders, collectively holding 41% of the shares (each 8.2%).
The Article of Incorporation states that the purpose of DHOPCO is to consttuct, operate and manage oil
pipelines; transport and store oil products;  and lease or rent oil products' tasporaton   facilities and
equipment. Furthermore, Article 20 of the Oil Pipeline Law (law no.4215) states that the pipeline operator
shall not reject the request for oil transport from any user except when there are no operational facflities to
transport oil, or in case of natura disaster or inevitable accidents. Hence, the proposed pipeline could be used
by any entity. During negoiations, agreemen was reached with DHOPCO that it will continue to make the
pipeline available for use by any third party, subject to limitations provided in Law no. 4215 and the Regulaton
for Oil Transportation.
3.6           In August 1992, a "Reguation for Oil Transportation" was established and subsequenly
approved by the MOER in January 1993. Its purpose is "to regulate requirements for oil storage, handling and
trnsporttion by DHOPCO in accordance with the provisions of Oil Pipeline Law." The regulation requires the
"user' of the pipeline to enter into a ype of "take-or-pay" contract with DHOPCO. The contct would
guarantee DHOPCO a minimum annual quantty of oil for ranportation (by each user of the system). If the
actu  quantity taported is less than 90% of the contracual quat, DHOPCO will be reimbursed for the
difference. The regulation also provides for a "charge rate" for transportation as well the storage of oil. The
charge rate (tariff) for the Kyungin section (Inc:hon-Seoul) has already been approved by MOER, because the
construction of this segment is completedY The charge rate for the south-north section has not yet been
finaliznd because the construction is still in progress and some ,osts are beig revisd. The pipeline tarff will
be set so as to be competitive with other modes of tranwsport yet yield a rate of reurn of at least 12% e
DHOPCO's investment. It will be based on a model 1 which takes into account projected future demand, ti a
refineries' optimiation of the different tansport modes, the projected quantity of oil htanported and stored, and
DHOPCO's long run marginal cost. According to the model, the estimated minimum tariff for the entire
network in 1995, when the project is complete, will be W1.80 per barrel-km for oil transportation, and W268
per barrel for oil storage. The current transportation costs for vessels. rail tankers and road trucks is W2.37,
W3.53 and W5.96 per barrel-km, respecdvely. Applying the above pipeline tariff (W1.80 and W268), the rate
of return on DHOPCO's investment will be 12.5%.
[i  The approved rate for this segment of the network is 3.20 Won per barrel-km, for oil tansporation, and 272.6 and 76.8 Won per
barrel for oil storage in North Tenninal and Khnpwco Termnal, respectively.
2/ The model, Optima Pipeline Tariff Determination, was prepared for DHOPCO by KEEI, and k has been reviewed by the Bank.

3.7           DHOPCO prepred a comprehensive enviromental assessment (EA) report which was reviewed
by the Bank over an eight-month period. The major environmental inpacts of the project, both during
constuction and aftwards (such as on the ecosystem, land use, air and water quality, noise and vibration
levels), have been fully evaluated and appropnate mitgation plans have been developed consistent with Bank
procedures and guidelines. Alternatives for terminal locations, pipeline routes and pump station sites, as well as
for waste water treatmen technology, have also been analyzed in detil, and optimum designs have been selected
accordingly. In addition, impacts from accidental fires have been studied and the project design provides for a
safe distance (for tank farms) to minimize the fire hazard. DHOPCO has also emphasized safety concerns,
including setting appropriate procedures in case of oil leaks. A more detailed discussion of potential
environmental impacts of the proposed project and the recommended mitigation plans, as well as the required
actions for evaluations and monitoring activities, are provided in the EA summary report and elaborated in the
full text of the EA report.
3.8           The potential adverse environmentl impacts of the proposed project are relatively minimal. As
mentioned in para. 6.4, the project significandy improves the environment and raises safety standards. In
additon, a comprehensive EA report has been produced for the project consistent with intnational guidelines
as well as Bank guidelines. This report is the first for a pipeline project in the country, and thus provides the
framework for environmental and safety standards for subsequent projects of this type. In particular, the report
was substntialy enhanced through the Bank's requiremes to improve safety standards and produce an
environmental mitigation plan. (Examples of these improvements are presented in para. 2.15). During
negotiations agreement was reached with DHOPCO that it will implement the requirements of EA and that the
evromenta and safety guidelines resulting from the EA report will be adhered to by the entire industry
associated with the use of the proposed pipeline, including new entrants.
G. Project Imlemet and Schedule
3.9           DHOPCO is fully responsible for implementing the project and is able to carry it out
successfully. It has recrited a qualified and experienced cadre and has access to a large number of local
engineering and construction firms with extensive inational experience in executing similar projecs. (Annex
5 provides the organizational chart for project implementation).
3.10          The project design is based on a feasibility study by a foreign fimn worldng in conjunction with
a local engineering finm. The two also collaborated in preparing the basic design. The project was divided into
four regions: Metropolitan area, the Middle area, Youngnam area and Honam area. Four engieering firms
(Byucksan, Daelim, Dongah and Hyundai), one for each area, were selected through a two-step procedure based
on qualifications and bid prices, to undeake the detailed engineering.  (The selection procedures were
satisfactory to the Bank). The work has been completed and the firms have been retained to finish the
construction supervision and other implementation tasks needed to complete the project in their respective areas.
DHOPCO will also hire assistants in specialty fields by direct appointment. All local engiering costs will be
financed by DHOPCO.
3.11          DHOPCO has scheduled the project for completion by the end of 1994. Despite the advanced
project preparation and ongoing construction, this objective may not be achieved. The major constraint is that
most of the long lead-time delivery equipment is to be financed from the proposed Bank loan and Board
presentation is scheduled for the end of May 1993. Therefore, the Bank has estimated the project completion
date at June 30, 1995 which should be feasible barring unforeseen obstacles. Annex 6 shows the project
implementation schedule.

3.13           The cost esfimate is based on end-1991 prices which were derived from actual equipment,
material and labor costs and conacts' cost data adjusted for inflation. The physical contigency has been
esmated at 7.5% of the base cost for the part of the project which has not been constuced yet. The 7.5%  is
amved at by using different physical contnencies for different components of the project, rnging from 3% for
engineering to 10% for consucton. The price contingency for the foreign cost compoen  of the project is
based on Bank-projected intational price increases; local cost components are based on Bank-projected
inflation rates in Korea. The average price contngency derived on this basis is 3.45%, and it assumes that 6%-
7% of capital coss will be disbursed in 1995. The interest during construction is calculated on DHOPCO's
financing plan, which applies appropriate interest rates and the grace period of each lender (para. 5.9), and
assumes that interest will be accrued only after funds are disbursed.

3.14           Table 3.2 provides the project fiancing plan. As shown, approximately 95% of the equity
capital has already been paid by the shareholders. The remaning 5% is scheduled to be paid in the third quarter
of 1993. Except for the proposed Bank loan of US$120 million, approximately 20% of the project's borrowing
iremen  have already been received and the baance has been secured. The proposed Bank loan would be
made to the Goverment of Korea, which will on-lend its proceeds to DHOPCO under a Subsidiary Loan
Agreement satisfactory to the Bank. The signing of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement is a condition of loan
effectiveness. The Bank loan proceeds would be on-lent to DHOPCO on the same terms and condtions as the
Bank loan to the Government. Considenng that DHOPCO is bearing the foreign exchange and intrest rate
risks, and given that it is paying for the Government's energy conservation study (US$1.5 million), the effective
costs of Bank funding to DHOPCO would be close to market rates. The Bank loan would be for a period of 15
years, including 5 years of grace at the Bank's standard variable interest rate. The loan would finance 90% of
the estimated foreign exchange expendirs, or 16% of total required fiancing.

3.17            Except for those items that can be obtained through loca and intaonal shopping (para
3.18), all goods financed by the Bank would be procured th              international competitive bidding (ICB)
according  to  the Bank's prom       en  guelines and  using  the Bank's standard  bidding  documents.
Approximately 15 bidding packages totalling US$198.6 million would constitute the procurement rquirig ICB
procedues.  A margin of preference of 15% of the CIP price (or the percentag  of customs duty and other
import taxes if lower than 15%) will be granted in bid evaluation to goods mamnfacatred in Korea with a
domestic value-added equal to at least 20% of the ex-factory bid price.



-25-
3.18          Off-thewshelf, readily available goods (e.g. pipeline valves and constuction materials) having a
per item value of no more than US$200,000 would be eligible for procurement through local and international
shopping in an aggregate amount not to exceed US$5.0 million. A minimum of three price quotadons for each
item would be required.
3.19          The proposed loan would include one civil works contract in the amount of approximately
US$15 millic,. to be procured through local competitive bidding following procedures acceptable to the Bank.
It is unlikely that foreign contractors would be interested in a contract of this size in Korea; nevertheless, foreign
contactors will not be restricted from bidding.
3.20          Consultants for te al assistance, training and studies totalling about US$3.8 million would
be selected and appointed according to the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Conwultants.
3.21         All procrement packages estimated to cost more than US$1.5 million will be subject to prior
review by the Bank. The prior review process wil cover about 90% of the total value of Bank-financed goods
and services.
3.22         The esimated disbursement of the Bank loan is shown in detail in Annex 8 and summarized in
Table 3.4:

3.23          Disbursement of the loan is based on the assumption it will become effective on July 1, 1993.
t is planned that the proposed loan would be fuRy disbursed by December 31, 1995. A loan closing date of
June 30, 1996 is established to allow for late payments (such as retention money). The scheduled loan
disbusement is much faster than it would be if it were following the standard profile of the Bank's overall
pipeline subsector; this reflects the advanced stage of project implementtion. Retroactive financing equivalent
to 10% of the proposed loan is recommended for expenses incurred after July 14, 1992, mosdy for partial
payments of long lead- time delivery equpment and materials (such as high pressure pumps) purchased through
advanced contract  approved by the Bank, as well as for the cost of the energy conservation study.
3.24         The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed against the categories outlied in Table 3.5, below:

3.25         To facilitate disbursement, a special account in a fully converible currency would be established
with an authorized allocation of US$10.0 million, which is equivalent to about two months of average
disbursements. Replenishment of the specia' account would be made quarterly or whenever the account is drawn
down by about 50% of the initial deposits. Reimbursement for goods valued at less than US$1.0 million would
be made on the basis of statements of expenditure (SOEs). Documentation of SOEs would be retained by
DHOPCO and made available for review by Bank supervision missions. All other disbursements would be made
against ful doumentation.

3.26         The Bank would monitor the physical progress of the proposed project as well as the borrower's
financial and other performances, to ensure that al conditions of the proposed loan are satisfied. For this
purpose, the Bank would field an average of two supervision missions per year, durng the active project phase,
to review project implementation, inspect job-site activities and discuss issues with Government and DHOPCO
offlcials. In addition, DHOPCO would be required to forward periodic progress reports. During negotiations,
agreement was reacbed with DHOPCO regarding the format, content and frequency of these reports. The basic
requpment is the submission of quarterly progress reports for each project component and DHOPCO's anwal
financi and auditors reports as defined in para. 4.16.
3.27         Project supervision by the Bank would be coordinated through a supevision plan presented in
Annex 9. The plan will be confirmed with DHOPCO during loan negotiations. Bank supervision would require
a total of about 44 staff-weeks during the life of the project, of which about 12 would be at headquartes (to
review progress reports, procurement actions, correspondence, etc.) and 32 would be in the field. Supervision
would be carried out mainly by Bank technical and financial staff, which would include one energy conservation
and one environmental specialist. The borrower's contribution to project supervision would entail providig
inputs to the Energy Conservation Study and to training and MIS components, as well as providing information
and reports on the staus of project implementation, which would include updates on the progress in physical
works and on other aspects of the loan.



Chapter IV
The Bonrower
4.1           Daehan Songyugwan Kongsa, or Dachan Oil Pipeline Corporation (DHOPCO), was established
on Jamuay 20, 1990 following the enactment of the Oil Pipeline Project Law (Law No. 4215, January 13, 1990)
by the National Assembly. This law in turn conctized a Government policy decision of December 1989 to
create a naionwide oil pipeline, to be constructed and operated by a single company in which the Goernment
would hold over 50% of the shares. The objective of the pipeline was to establish an economical and efficient
oil transportation system, ease traffic congestion on existing transportation means, and furher enhance the safety
and secmrity of the distribution and supply of petroleum products. The pipeline invesMent decision was the
result of ten years of Government planning and of three separate feasibility stxdies (including by Korea Kaiser
and Dongah Engieeing).
4.2           In order to undertake the construction and subsequent operation of a trans-national oil pipeline,
a joint investment agreement between DHOPCO's shareholders wa sipged on January 15, 1990, establishing a
joint stock company as provided for in Korea's Commercial Code. According to its Articles of Incorporation,
DHOPCO's mission is to constuct, operate and manage the oil piptline; transport oil products and provide for
their storage; lease and/or rent petroleum products transportation faciWes and equipment; and engage in other
related busiess as required to conduct the above activiies.
4.3           Authorized capital stock consists of 17 million shares, par value W10,000, of which 16,995,000
shares have been issued as of December 31, 1992. The company's paid-in share capital as of that date was
W169.9 billion, with an ownership structure as shown in Table 1 below.

4.4           DHOPCO management is vested in its Board of Directors, which decides on all importa
maters related to business operations. The Board consists of not less than 3 and up to 15 directors, including
the representative director and President and one auditor. The MOER can recommend 8 standing or non-
standing directors, including the representave director and Presnt, and the auditor. Each of the seven
companies involved can recommend a non-standing director.
4.5           The President of DHOPCO is appointed and subject to dismissal by the President of Korea at
the reco       n of the MOER. As chief executive officer, the President of DHOPCO represents DHOPCO



-28-
on the Board and manages day-to-day business affais. Board meeigs are also attended by DHOPCO's
Standing Auditor, who is appointed by the President of Korea at the recommendation of the MOER, after
consultation with the Minister of Finance. The Standing Auditor is not a member of the Board, but may, at his
iniiative, express his opinions at any Board meeting. Under the President are 2 Senior Managing Directors, one
responsible for planning and administaton and the otber for the project and operations.  An audiing
department, separate from the rest of the organzation, reports to the President. The Senior Managing Directors
in tun oversee 3 Managing Diectors in total, responsible for adnision, the project and operations. Five
field offices, presenly responsible for overseeing pipeline constuction, cover the Kyungin, South Seoul,
Cental, Youngnam and Honam regions.
4.6           As of December 1992, total staff numbered 213 individuals; at full operation, total staff are
expected to number around 500 individuals. In 1992, 34 staff were engaged in planning and administrative
activities; 18 staff in accounting and finance; 21 staff were employed in constnction and project activities; ad
124 in operations, including the 5 field offices. The central controls department consisted of 8 staff, while 6
were employed in auditing. At full operation, the expected composition is around 140 individuals at assistant
manager rank and above, and around 360 staff. DHOPCO's future organizaional chart, at full operation (see
DHOPCO's organizational chart) reflects the shift from constucti  to operations that will take place. The
major change occurs in the costuction area: the two departments currenty under the Construction Managing
Director (Land Affairs and Engineering), are slated to disappear once pipeline operations commence and will be
replaced by departments responsible for the Project and for Constuction; the Managing Director will then be
responsible for the Project. The field offices, currently responsible for construction and reporting to the
Construction Managing Director, will be trnsformed into regional offices for operations and witl report to the
Operations Managing Director.
4.7           The company's present organization appears to be suited to the constrction activity it is
underaing. Staff are competent, as evidenced by the level of preparedness for project implementation. Many
staff are drawn from other public enterprises. The President was formerly the vice-president of PEDCO and the
president of KOPCO (Korea Petoleum Company). Both the executive and non-executive directors are also
drawn from pubhc and private companies active in the petroleum and construction business. In addition, some
staff have been drawn from the Hankuk Oil Pipeline Corporation, which is the other oil pipeline operating
company in the county. At that company, staff had developed, implemented and operated a similar pipeline
project, and DHOPCO has benefitted from being able to hire this group of staff. With this relevant previous
experience, DHOPCO staff possess the skills required in both the construction and the operation of a pipeline.
The projected organzional chart also appears to be well sutd to the operation of the pipeline, once it is
cons;tucted.
C. Operatins and Mngaement
4.8           Anual Budgetmg Procedures. Each DHOPCO department submits a draft budget for the
following year in October of the current year to the Planning Departmnt, which assembles the final budget and
makes allocations among the various departments. The resulting draft budget is then approved by the President
of DHOPCO and sent to the MOER's Petoleum Supply and Demand Division for approval. This ncmally
takes place in mid-November. MOER approval usually takes two weeks, and the approved budget is subiitted
to the company's Board of Directors in early December for final approval and acceptance.
4.9           Financial Planninr. DHOPCO does not, as yet, undertake systematic financial planning. To a
large extent, this stems from the fact that the company has a limited mandate, and a mission that is, at present,
confined to the construction and operation of an oil pipeline. While it does operate in a competitive environment
(refineries have various transportation altrnatives available to them for their petroleum products), its assigned
role is more that of a regulated public utility than that of an idependet, commercial endty. Its financial
planning and budgetary procedures are correspondingly designed. Nonetheless, staff involved in the plamning
and financial (including internal auditing and conrrol) funcdons would benefit from short training programs



-29-
tailored to their specific needs. A core of well tained staff in these key areas would also enable the comn " to
better access and exploit other business opporumides in the fture (para. A.20).
4.10          Mana&ement Information Systems (MIS). In accordance with DHOPCO's general needs and
strategy, a computerized information system which would provide management with operating and financial
information without a time-lag would be required. To address the management informaton needs which will
surface when the oil pipeline is operational, a modem, computer-based MIS should be installed, starting with a
real-me core which would contain those elements which relate direcdy to planning, control and monitoring of
operaions through an Operations Information System (OIS). The primary objectives of the OIS would be: (a) to
develop, monitor and execute the oil pipeline network opeting plans and system maintenamne activities; (b)
plan, control and evaluate commercial operating strategies; and (c) monitor and control operating financial
performance and accounting systems.
4.11         The OIS should be an integral part of the comprehensive MIS, specially with respect to
hardware compatibiLty and file access/data interchange. In this regard, DHOPCO should expect to use the OIS
design structre and format as a basis for the development of the additional MIS components. The QIS should
be based on a modular concept for both hardware and software to allow for the efficient phasing of the overall
development from the standpoint of financial as well as technical resources. DHOPCO's general accounting
system should be included in the comprehensive MIS development.
4.12          DHOPCO plans to set up its MIS in three phases. The first phase, planned to be implemented
by 1995, covers operational control and processing of transactions. In this phase, the basic MIS plan will be
defied, followed by applications development in finance, payroll, personnel management and pipeline
information management. In the second phase, planned for the 1996-1997 period, the MIS will be integrated by
functional groups, and the OIS system will be expanded. In addition, the information base for petroleum
distribution will be fnalized. In the third phase, the focus will be on strategic planning, and on the full
integration of the various databases created in the preceding phasus.
4.13         The nucleus of a staff capability to organize the MIS was established at DHOPCO in early
1992, and presently consists of 6 individuals. By 1995, DHOPCO estimates that a total of 20 staff will be
required to implement and operate the planned MIS. DHOPCO's planned strategy for developing its MIS
capabilities is saiisfactory to the Bank. The proposed project will support the first phase of MIS development as
described above. A more detailed description is given in Annex 10. For this purpose, a sum of US$500,000
has been allocated for the basic design of the MIS. Agreements was reached with DHOPCO during negotiaions
on the basic terms of reference and timing for carrying out of the first phase MIS development
4.14         Accoumfnn  System. DHOPCO keeps its accounts in accordance with financial accountig
standards, approved by the Minister of Finance and promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission of
Korea (first promulgated on December 23, 1981; subsequently revised on three occasions, the last of which was
March 29, 1990). These standards, which are in general similar to internationally accepted accounting
standards, establish accounting and audifting principles and reporting standards for companies subject to the
External Audit of Joint Stock Companies Act. DHOPCO has hired a competent accounting staff and is able to
deal with accounting matters in a timely manner.
4.15          Internal Auditin. DHOPCO's intemal auditing department consists of 6 individuals. An
internal audit of each DHOPCO department is conducted at least once a year. This audit covers admmistrative
(defined as accountig and financial matters) as well as technical (defined as matters relating to the pipeline
construction at this stage and to be extended to pipeline operation in the future) aspects. In addition to these
regular audits, DHOPCO's auditing department is expected to carry out special audits as and when required by
management. An example of such an audit, carried out recendy by the auditing department, concerns the
welding procedures used in the pipeline construction in the Kyungin area (Seotl-Incheon leg of the pipeline).
This audit was ordered by the president of DHOPCO. DHOPCO's internal auditing staff appears well-motivated
and aware of its responsibilities. In keeping wi; the construction phase of the pipeline to date, the bulk of these
staff have eng_imring backgrounds. Once DHOPCO commences full-scale pipeline operations, the internal



-30-
auditing functon could be suntheined by recrndting conventionly trained and exrieced aiditors to
reiforce the coverage of financial issues.
4.16          Ex          Amd=. Under Korean law, a stock compay whose assets in the previous business
year exoeed Won 400 million is required to undergo an exta audit by a private, idependen Charte   Public
Accountant. DHOPCO's accounts are audied by the Tong Lin Accounting Compan, a reputable Korean firm.
The audit is generally carried out in February of a given year for the accounts closed on December 31 of the
preceding year. The audit examines DHOPCO's accounts for their conformity with Korean generally accepted
accounting principles, which are in general similar to internationally accepted audiing standards. DHOPCO's
exenal audits for the years ended December 31, 1990 and 1991 were fully satisfactory. During negodaions
agreements was reached with DHOPCO that it will contnue to employ idependen auditors acceptable to the
Bank and sbmit to the Bank certified copies of its audited financial stements togedter with the auditor's report
not later than six monts after the end of each fiscal year.
4.17          In addition to the idependent audit, corpoaions that are affiliated to Government ministries are
audited by the auditing department of the parent mity. Such an audit was caried out in Septmber 1991 for
the 1990 accounts and in May 1992 for the 1991 accounts by the MOER's auditing department. Finally, the
Board for Audit and Inspection, attached to the President's office, is authorized to carry out audits of any
corporation that is over 50% owned by the State as and when required. In any given year, however, only one
of these two foms of Govermnent audit is carried out.
4.18           aes. Every corporation which is headquarered in Korea is assessed a corporation tax.
DHOPCO's corporate income tax rate is 36.55%, assessed on anmnu income. However, losses in any given
year can be can ed forward for tax purposes for the following three yeas. Customs duties and tariffs are
assessed on all imported items according to the prevailing tariff schedule. In DHOPCO's case, the imported
item consist mainly of machinery, for which the 1993 duty rae is 9% on the CIP price of the item in questio
A value-added tax is applied to goods, services and all imported items. The VAT rate applicable to imported
items is 10%, assessed on the duty-paid price. In addition, a special tax is assessed on con ners (in effect since
Jamnuy 1, 1992).1'
4.19          Insurance. DHOPCO carries the following insurance policies: (a) central control building
insurance policy (over US$4 milion); (b) fire insurance policy, covering facilities (US$37 million at present,
projected to rise to around US$353 million once the North-South section is completed) and ofi iventory
(US$24.5 million, projected to rise to over US$168 million once the pipeline is fully operational); (c) machinery
insurance policy, covering storage tanks, electric and computerized machiney (US$19.5 million at present,
projected to rise to close to US$181 million once the North-South section is completed); and (d) commal
general liabiliy policy, covermg legal liability to third parties arising out of ownership, maienan  and/or use
of the insured pipeline facilities, including loading/unloading facilities (US$10 million per occurree at present
for the Kyugin section, and rising to US$60 million once tie North-South section is operational). However, to
ensure the adequacy of the liability insurance coverage, agreement was reacied with DHOPCO that it shall: (i)
employ, not later than January 1, 1995, insurance consultants, under terms and condition sadsfactory to the
Bank, in order to assess the project risks; (ii) furnish to the Bank for its review and comment, the report by such
consultant containing their findings and recommendations; and (iii) not later than June 30, 1995, take al
measures necessary to ensure adequate insurance coverage against such risks.
4.20          Tran Needs. Very few of DHOPCO's staff have received training overseas in their specid
area of responsibiLity. In 1990, 3 electrical and mechanical engmeers were trained in the US on the SCADA
system and current plans include training 2 enginers in oil m uing systems and 2 in oil pumping technology.
Training needs can be classified in three categories: operational, financial and managerial. On the operational
side, DHOPCO staff are technicaly competent and would benefit primarily from short-term, non-degree courses
in areas such as pipeline technology, dispatching and interface, and quality control for petroleum products. In
1/ Ihis tax is Won 20,000 for a 20 foot container, and Won 40,000 for a 40 foot conainer.



-31-
addition, short seminas on specific topics such as work control usig the computer, pipelie coating technology,
pipeline hydruics, etc. would be useful. On the financial and managerial side, short-tem courses in taxation,
personnel and financial manalgement, including billing and internal auditing procedures, would be useful. In
addition, DHOPCO management has expressed an interest in training around 10 staff in long-erm degree
couses in the US and Europe. This traing would cover business administration, economics, international
contract law, and engineern.
4.21          The program of overseas traiing will lay the foundation for DHOPCO to secure a fully trained
and competent staff to manage the extensive oil pipeline network. However, DHOPCO will have some 500 staff
when it is fully operational, not all of whom can be sent on an overseas training course. DHOPCO would need
to er iblish in-house training progms to provide or-going traning for its technical, finacial and managerial
persomel. Such a program would also be useful for periodically updating staff lnowledge on new technologies
and systems. Trainiag could be provided by both local and foreign experts. Training materials prepared in
Korea would maximize dissemination of management concepts, techniques and procedures. In this regard, it
may be useful to associate foreign pipeline companies in the training programs, partcularly in the technical
fields.
4.22          The Bank and DHOPCO discssed the latter's traing needs, and agreement on a tentative
ining program has been reached. Annex 11 provides the description of the tentative program. However,
DHOPCO's training needs will be better defied by the end of 1993, when recruitment for operions is
scheduled to be completed. A sum of US$1.5 million in the proposed loan has been allocated for traini  to
stenghe DHOPCO's operational, financial and managerial capabiLities. During negotaions, agreement was
reached with DHOPCO regarding the timing for preparaton and implemenion of a detailed training program
satisfactory to the Bank.

5.1           The pipeline is being constucted in two phases: the first phase concerns the Kyungin section
(Seoul-Inchon/Kimpo area), whereas the second phase concems the north-south section (Seoul-Taejon-Ulsan-
Onsan leg and the Seoul-Taejon-Yeocheon leg). Given the vety recent establishment of the company, a fmnancial
analysis of past performance is not meaningful. The first year of operation was 1992, when the Kyungi section
became partially opeatioA. The first fll year of operation, with both sections fully operational, is exectd to
be 1995.
5.2           The company's audited statements for 1990 and 1991, and preliminary statements for 1992, are
shown in Annex 12, and in Table 5.1 in US dollars. As of December 31, 1992, its total assets amounted to
W255 billion (US$327 million equivalent). Annual sales in 1992 were only W6.7 billion (US$8.7 million),
reflecting the start-up of operations on the Kyungin section.

5.3           As can be seen in the above table, DHOPCO had no revenues from operations in the first two
years of its exitenc. In 1992, partl pipeline operations commenced on the Kyungin section. In that year,
DHOPCO earned a rate of return of 5% on average net fixed assets. DHOPCO does not take tide to the oil it
trnspor, as a resut of which its operatig expenses are limited to the provion of transport, while revenes
concern transport and storage fees.

5.5          DHOPCO's assets to date have largely been financed by equity, which explains the very low
debt:debt & equity ratio. The long-term debt contracted consists primarfly of a loan from the Petroleum
Business Fund (76% of total long-term debt), which is payable over a 10-year period. Other loans outnding
as of December 31, 1992 include W2 billion from Treasury Lo    and Investments Special Accounting (10
years); W5 bilion from Korea Development Bank Industry Facilit (10 years); and W2.1 billion equivalent
foreign cumrrency loan from Korea Exchange Bank (7 years).
5.6          DHOPCO's liquidity position is vety high, although the current ratio has declined from 1990.
Even so, it was in excess of 13 in 1992. This situation is projected to normalize, however, oce DHOPCO
commes full-scale pipeline operations. The company's debt semvice coverage ratio was 1.8 in 1992,
explained by the relatively low debt service burden in that year.
B. Invemnt Proeam and F*inau     Plan
5.7          DHOPCO's investment program during 1990 to 1995 consists of the proposed project described
in Chapter 3. Total expendures for the pipeline are estimated at W632 billion (approximately US$810 million).
This program includes the Kyungin section of the pipeline (US$81 million), most of which has already been
completed, as well as the north-south section of the pipeline (US$729 million). While at present the enie
investment program is the proposed project, the Bank will require that it review any addional investment to
ensure that DHOPCO maintains a strong capital stnzture. During negotations, agreement was reached with
DHOPCO to cany out a joint annual review of its investment program with the Bank no later than December
31 of each fiscal year until the project is completed.

5.9          As of end-1992, DHOPCO's capital of W169.9 bilion (US$218 million) was subscribed by the
Govement (50.8%), the five refineries (8.2% each), Korean Airlines (4.1%) and Kwang Ju Express, a
consuction and tansport company (4.1%). The balance of the authorized capitl will be paid in 1993, and is
expected to be disributed among the same sharholders in a way as to maintain the present share-holding
scture. Equity accounts for 30% of the capital investment program. Internal cash generation is expected to
improve after 1995, when the pipeline becomes filly operational. Unti then, internal cash generaon is
expected to basically cover the increase in working capit required, while capital expendir  will be financed
through the equity contibutions and borrowing. Projected borrowing, shown in Annex 13, include lans from
domestic and foreign banks with mautides of 7 years, a loan from the Petroleum Business Fund with a maturity
of 10 years, Treasury loans with a maturty of 10 years, a loan from the Korea Development Bank Industry
Facility Fund, with a maturity of 10 years, and the proposed IBRD loan with a maturity of 1S years.

underlying these projections are presented in Annex 13. Key financial indicators are presented in Table 5.4
below. In interping the ratios shown, it should be borne in mind that DHOPCO will become fully operational
only in 1995; the years 1993 and 1994 should therefore be considered the start-up period, for which a
conventional ratio analysis is of limited value.

5.11             DHOPCO's policy is to set pipeline tariffs that are competitive with alternatiVe modes of
transport, on the one hand, and that yield a minimum rate of return on DHOPCO's investment of around 12%
when fully operational, on the other.  This tariff structure is embodied in a contractual relationship that
DHOPCO will enter into with oil refineries (see Chapter 111, para. 3.6). Revenues are generated both through
oil transport and oil storage in DHOPCO facilities. The projections of quandties transported and stored are
based on the results of a model which takes into account the expected future demand for oil products in the
country, the refineries' opdmization of the different transport modes available (pipeline, ship, rail or truck), and
DHOPCO's long-run marginal cost. Tariffs are assumed to be adjusted annually to keep up with inflationY
DHOPCO's revenues for the fist year of full operation would be WIl 1 billion, and are projected to increase to
W217 billion in 2002. DHOPCO earns increasing rates of return on average current net value of fixed assets,
as can  eseen in Table S.4Y
5.12             The major recurrent expenditure in the income statement is electricity for pipeline operations,
followed by O&M, as can be seen from the projected statements shown in Annex 13. Depreciation accounts for
close to 50% of total operating expenses. Interest on borrowing is also a significant expense, reaching a peak in
1996 and declining thereafter as DHOPCO begins repayment of principal.
5.13             Since DHOPCO does not take title to the oil that is being transported, this reduces DHOPCO's
need for working capital, since its inventories and stocks are limited to certain spare parts and equipment for
pipeline operations. DHOPCO's receivables and payables have similar terms; however, current assets are
consistently in excess of current liabilities, with the result that the current ratio is at least 1.9 throughout the
projected period.
5.14             The financial projections show that DHOPCO starts generating significant surplus cash once full
pipeline operations commence. Since DHOPCO does not, at present, envisage further investments beyond the
proposed pipeline, this surplus cash could be used to pay off DHOPCO's high cost debt (commercial
borrowing), provided that sufficient cash balances are maintained to keep the current ratio at 1.5. Alternatively,
I/ Current Bank projectionsare 6% for 1993 5.5% for 1994 and S% per annum for 1995 and beyond.
(/ The rate of return shown in Table 5.4 is calculated by dividing DHOPCO's projected net operating income by the average current net
value of fixed assets for the year in question. Net operating income is total operating revenues less operating expenses, including
depreciation but excluding interest and other charges on debt. The average current net value of assets is obtained by deducting accumulated
depreciaton from the avetage gross value of fixed assets. The average gtoss value of assets is taken to be one half of the sum of gmss
assets in operation at the beginning and at the end of the year, as revalued annually.



-36-
DHOPCO would be in a strong position to pay dividnds to its shareholders beginning as early as 1995,
depnding on its debt repayment policy. DHOPCO would also be in a strong position to undertake future
pipeline expsions or other related investments.
5.15          The total investment program for full pipeline implementation amounts to US$809.7 million, of
which some US$312 milion have already been committed. In light of the substantial investment that remains to
be undertaken, and given that the company will not be fully operational till 1995, a high level of self-financing
cannot be achieved until that time. DHOPCO's main challenge will be to maintain a strong balance sheet as it
carries out the remaining investment program over the 1993-95 period. However, its equity position is strong,
and even with the increased borrowing that will be required to finance the investment, DHOPCO's
debt:debt&equity ratio is projected to remain below 70:30.
5.16          To ensure that measures are taken to mamtain a strong capital structure and sauisfactory
liquidity, during negotiations agreements was reached with DHOPCO that it would not incur any further debt if
such additional debt would raise its total indebtedness to more than 70% of its total capitalization, and that it will
maintin a current ratio of at least 1.2.
5.17          As can be expected in the start-up phase, DHOPCO's debt service coverage ratio is erratic in
the inidal years of pipeline operation, as additional debt is contracted to pay for the investment program, and
until pipeline operations start generatng revenues. Once full pipeline operations start, DHOPCO should not
have major difficulty in mainining a debt service coverage ratio in excess of 1.2. With a view to ma _iaining
the debt service coverage ratio at acceptable levels, dunng negotiations agreement was reached with DHOPCO
that it would nr. incur any additional debt unless a reasonable forecast shows that its estmated net revemnes after
expenditu   for each year during the term of the debt to be inurred shall be at least 1.2 times its total estmated
debt service requirements from 1995 onwards.



Chapter VI
Project Benefits and Risks
A. Beneits
6.1           The project will yield signficant economic and envirnenl benefits, as well as unquantified
beefits resulting from enhancing the reliability of supply and indirect benefits to other sectors. Omce the project
is completed, Korea's entire supply of light petroleum products (gasoline, jet fuel, kurosene and diesel).
represeting over 50% of country's total petroleum consumption, will be transported though this pipeline
system. The pipeline will replace all coastl vessels, rail tankers and road trucks now used by the refimeries for
ansporn light products to the 'direct sales" depots and the "sales agents" (para. 2.7). Only fuel oil and LPG
will condnue to be shipped through existing modes.
6.2           Economic Benefits The project's economic benefits are derived from saving associated with
transportn petroleum products via the proposed pipeline versus existng modes. Based on projected demand,
cost analyses were conducted on "with pipeline" and "without pipeline" scenarios. "Without pipeline" costs
were calculated considering total costs connected with expanding the existing system (vessels, rafl, road and
small Pipeline nework) in order to tranwsport the forecasted volume of light products which will be moved by the
proposed pipeline. The "with pipeline" scenaio includes project investnt and operatimg costs incluing
physical coningeni  but excluding price congencies. Under both scenaios, internal costs such as taxes and
duties have been excluded. With respect to an alternative use of the land required by the pipeline, it is assumed
the price paid for it reflects its economic value. These cost savings are estimated for both segments of the
pipeline (Kyung  and North-South).
6.3           The economic rate of return calculated on this basis is about 14.5%. Annex 14 provides a
diled analysis of the econmic rate of return including the assumptions underlying the calculation.  The
sensivity of this rate of return was tested with respect to changes in key assumptions. The table 6.1 shows the
results of the analysis.
Table 6.1: Senstiviy Analysis

Base Case                                                                        14.50
(a)    pipeline operating costs up 10%                                           14.2
(b)    pipeline capital costs up 10%                                             13.3

6.4           Fial Rate of Retnrn  The prqect's fincial (intal) rate of return (FRR) is 12.5%. (See
Annex 14 for a detailed analysis). The project revenue is derived based on the proposed minimm tariff, namely
1.80 Won per barrel-km to transport product  and 268 Won per barrel to store them. The investme  and
operadtng cost used to clcte the FRR are those for the economic analysis of the project, but include price
contingencies as well as taxes and duties. The resulting FRR, 12.5%, simply confirms that in order for
DHOPCO to attain at least a 12% rate of retr  the minimum tariff needs to be set at 1.80 Won per barrel-km
and 268 Won per barrd, respectvely, for transportation and storage of products, as is currendy proposed.
6.5           Environmental Bmefus. There are also direct enviment  and safety beneits that have not
been quantiied. These include a reduction in (a) air polution, mainly from the trucks, but also from the rail
tankers; (b) marine pollution, from oil leaks of the vessels and firom the loading and unloading port facilities;
and (c) road and rai  hazrds, from accidents involving truc  and rail tabkers. It is estiad that S02
emissions from the present modes of transport are about 6,000 tons per year, and the proposed project will
reduce these to 2,000 ton per year. With respec to NO, emissions are now about 11,000 tons; and will drop to



-38-
3,000 tons. Regarding CO2 levels, the proposed project will reduce emissions from 991,000 tons per year in the
present system, to 291,000 ton per year. It is important to note that while these reductions represent 2%-3% of
the pollution emissions nationwide, in the Seoul metropolitan area, where the air pollution problem is most
acute, the improvements will be much greater, because 40% of the country's consumption occurs in that area
and trucks are the predominant mode of transporting petroleum products.
6.6           In addition to its environmental benefits, the proposed project significantly reduces road and rail
accidents. Whie it is difficult to confirm the number of accidents involving petroleum trucks and rail tankers,
the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) estmates that if the accident index for trucks is 1.00, it is
0.347 for rail tankers and 0.0006 for pipeline. Thus, the pipeline will dramatically reduce the number of
accidents. Further, the construction of the pipeline will have a significant influence on reducing the shipping
accidents of tankers and oil leaks (paras. 2.9 and 2.1).
6.7           Finally, there are substantial indirect benefits which have also not been quantified. These
include (a) a more timely and reliable petroleum sup,ply to other sectors; (b) reduced wear and tear, and
therefore, capital investment, in the highway system; c) less congestion of port facilities (para. 2.11), which
reduces both demurrage charges and investment costs; and (d) greater efficiency in the sector due to
implementing energy conservation measures, allowing the pipeline to be used by all companies, and
stengtming the project entity.
B. Risks
6.8           The project-specific risks are minimal. The risk of cost overruns and implementation delays has
been taken into account in the project sensitivity analyses and the result shows that the project economic viabiLity
is robust. The land and rights-of-way have already been acquired. The environmental risks such as adverse
impacts on the ecosystem, land use, water and air qualty, have been fully evaluated and appropriate mitigation
plans have been developed consistent with Bank guidelines. The environmental risks and the corespondin

1.         The consumption of commercl energy in Korea was about 100 million tons oil equivalent
(toe) in 1991, including petroleum products (57%), coal (23%), mnclear (13%), and LNG (4%). The
consumption has grown at an average rate of 11% per year over 1986-1992. The 1983 oil crsis, and the
severe implication this had for Korea's balace et payments, prompted the Goverment to revise its
approah to energy imports and reduce Korea's hit' arto almost exclusive reliance on imported oil. A new
straegy was developed in 1980 caing for, inter- ia, diversifying into alteative energy sources including
imorted coa, LNG and mnclear energy, and fostei  energy conservation.
2.         The energy intensily of the economy was reduced, partly through efficiency gains and energy
consraion, and pardy though a reduction in the relative share of energy-intmsive industries to the
advantge of light manufag. While the energy elasticity of GDP growth was above one during 1960s
and 1970s, the ratio dropped below one in early 1980s when the bulk of the industi activity was shifted to
higher tmchnology manufactring.
3.         Despite these efforts, the continuing rapid growth of the Korean economy has put mich
pressure on the nation's ability to cost-effectively meet its energy needs. The rate of energy consumption
during the last 5 years exceeded the economic growth rate, resulting in an increase in the energy elastcity to
GDP, to 1.55 in 1990. It is expected that the energy demand wil condmie to increase at a high rate, as the
economy grows and as the level of income and qualiy of life improve in the futue.
4.         Government's general goal in the sector is to bring about greater efficiency in the use of
energy while minimizing its impact on the environment. To this end, the government amended the
Rationalization of Energy Utilization Act, preparing a much stronger Act for the next five-year Energy
Conservation Plan and Programs (1992-1997). The program includes, among other things, promoting the
development of high-efficiency forms of energy utilization such as co-generation and odher cost effective
energy alternatives. In parallel, the government has asked Bank assistnce in studying ways to improve
energy conservation measures and to help manage energy demand growth in Korea.
Objective
5.         The objective of this initiative is to develop a plan setiDng forth policies and actions that will
promote the most efficient use of energy in Korea given the country's economic development needs and
evolving consumer demands.

Scope of Work
6.          The scope of work is divided in two phases. Phase I will provide (i) an estimate of the
potential energy savings through conservation efforts; (ii) a "road map" in the form of a prioridzed
conservation programs (plan of action) to be carried out mn Phase II; and (fii) terms of reference (TOR) for
work under Phase I. The submission of an agreed-upon Phase I report is a condition for Board presentation
of the proposed World Bank loan. Phase I will focus on a comprehensive analysis of the prioritized
programs, icuding deveopme   of dealed program  designs, the identfication of implemenaion
procedures and timetables, the appropriate mechanisms for monitoing and evaluatg the specific energy
conservation measmes, and recommendations for the insutions to be designated for program
tmplementation. A better definition of Phase II will be obtained at the end of Phase I.
Phase I
7.          The scope of work under Phase I would cover four main areas: (i) chancterzig energy use
m Korea; (ii) reviewig the exisdng conservation efforts and analyzing the reasons for the slowdown of
existing efforts; (iii) broadly identifying areas which would lead to reduction in energy demand with estimate
of the potenti  energy savmgs for each; and (iv) based on (i), (Hi) and (iii), developing a porintied
consevation programs, including the TORs, for Phase II. These are discussed in more detail below.
8.           Cbng energy use in Korea includes an analysis of Korea's historic energy use patterns
and a forecast of country's future energy demand through year 2010, by sector and type of fuel. The main
sectors to be covered are the industrial, power, commercial, residential and transport sectrs. The type of
fuel will be the major fuels used in each main sector. The likely future trends in fuel use and energy
intensity in each sector will be evalua   tang into account the existig sector-specific energy intsites,
the current and future (based on several agreed scenaios) energy pricing policy, possible technology-based
changes in industia energy intensities, cuto conservation efforts in Korea, private investment trends,
govemment plans for industial development, the socio-demographic changes in Korea that wil affect
energy-usmg equipment ownmeship and usage pattrns, and the growth in personal income per capita that
will affect residential energy use and demnd for trasport services (i.e., private auto and public transit).
9.          The review of the eme enersv conservation efforts in Korea should be carried out with a
view to assess the effectiveness of the Government's currnt energy conservation policies and to identify the
reasons for the apparent lack of effectiveness of the previously-enacted energy conservation measures. This
will require identifying national, regional, and local government policies directy and indirecly influencing
energy use and energy efficiency, and detmin   their effectiveness; the interaction of the energy policies
with other govemment policies; and how these interactions affect the intended results of the policies (e.g.,
are the costs and benefits of energy policy consistent with Government's industrial, environmental and trade
policies). The reasons for slowdown in energy conservation efforts in the private sector and government
policies that have reduced the effectiveness of both public and private energy conservation efforts need to be
identified. This will also include identfication of non-policy elements that have reduced the effectiveness of
conservation efforts, such as breakdowns in measurement, evaluation and enforcement of energy efficiency
efforts. To provide an external perspective, it wil be necessary to identify government policies/approaches
used in other countries to promote energy efficiency, and the effectiveness of such policies. This external
analysis would require examing what market forces broke down which required government intervention;
what are the measurable efficiency improvements from these policies; and what are the public and private
costs associted with these policies. The applicability and adaptability of other counties' energy efficiemny

10.        Ident  areas which wold lead to reducing enerm v demand - including suggesting currendy
available technological opportu s that could be employed to reduce demand- and MoantgJlth
es_imaed  otenial energy savings tbrough conservation efforts and efficiency gains.
11.        Based on the fidings in above, the end-product of Phase I should provide a direction, or a
road map, for energy conservation policy development in Korea, in the form of a prioritized conservation
programs to be fully evaluated in Phase I. The Phase I work will therefore include the development of
broad energy conservation staegies for various sectors, focussng on the need for and mechanisms for
increasing incentives for energy conservation measures. The broad strategy should be based on developing
a sound pricing policy in order to provide appropriate signals for the consumers and producers; increasing
consumer resporse by creating more competitive markets and developing more efficient technologies;
strengthening imiaon through energy conservation agencies in order to provide information services
on technology and financial options and to offer technica assisunce; and developing appropriate codes and
staudards. In the industrial sector, the strategy should address issues such as the restrcturing of industry
towards less energy-intensive industry, special supervision of energy-itensive industries, and rationalization
of management and operation. In the residenti  and commercial sectors, the strategy should consider
strengtheng the building standards for new buildings, establishing incentives to encourage -,onsumers to
pnuase energy efficient equipment, and monitoring energy- intensive buildings. In the tasport sector-
which requires greater emphasis becae the sector stll remams in an early stage with respect to energy
conservation acvities-the role of taxation on vehicles, energy-efficient tansportaton system, and supply of
energy saving devices should be taken into account. Furthermo, district heating and co-geneton systems
should be also analyzed, and the findings should be taken into account when designing the energy
conservation schemes. Phase I will also include preparing TORs and an estimate of the resources required
to carry out the work to be performed in Phase II.
Phase II
12.        Phase II would provide a detl  analysis of prioritzed conservation programs prepared in
Phase I, includig developing a sustainabl implementation strategy and time table for the recommended
energy conservation programs and the   rie montorng and evaluation mechanisms. As indicated, a
better definition for the scope of work under Phase H wil be developed at the end of Phase I. However, a
good example illustratng the division of work between Phase I and II is the development of an energy audit
program. While the need for detailed energy audits of industrial facilities as means to recommend efficiency
improvements will be identified in Phase I, Phase II efforts would further clarify the specific attributes of an
effecive auditing "program", elaboraig how the program would be designed and implemented, and
providing detaied montoring and evaluation requiements to ensure the program's continued effectiveness.
An example in the Residential and Commercial Sectors is the institution of building and equipment standards
that require the use of energy efficient technologies. Phase II would evaluate the cost effectiveness of
various standards based on an assessment of their costs and benefits, develop appropriate program designs,
itify appropriate implem aonmechm     and schedules, and descrbe monitoring and evaluation
reqhuiments
13.        It is expected that the answers to the following questions will be obtained in Phase II, building
upon the work in Phase I:

i)   &deMOfiagA: What pricing actions could be employed to reduce the energy demand;
what are the most critcal finacial and economic factors to include in ranking energy
conservation policy options; how should environmental factors be incorporated into
selection of energy options for Korea.
ii)  Implementation:  What policy actions are necessary to realize energy demand
reductions from technology options; how should tade policies be altered in order to
promote the use of the most efficient technologies; what institution should be
responsible for defining conservation-specific energy efficiency policies and what
should be the role of Ministry of Energy and Resources (MOER); and what are the
appropriate mechanisms for implementing conservation policies.
iii) MofronJk: What monitoring and evaluation mechanims are required to maintain the
efficacy of energy conservation efforts and who should be responsible for monitorng
and evaluating conservation implementation efforts, and imposing sanctions for non-
compliae with regulations
Resources and Schedule
14.        The cost of Phase I is esfimated to be US$300400,000. However, the consultants are
required to comment on the adequacy of the cost estimate. The consultants are also required to specify the
level of staffing and expertise to adequately carry out the study. The consulau   are expected to fidd a
misson to Korea immedately after receving a telex of inte, and at any event not later tan February 1,
1993. The work, including the final report, for Phase I is expected to be completed by April 1, 1993.

PETROLEUM DISTRIBUTION AND SECTOR MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
PIPELINE DESIGN AND TECHNICAL FEATURES
1.           The project comprises the _sttion of approximately 1000km pipg in diameters ranging
from 10 to 24 inches. The system is designed to transport four types of petroleum products (gasoline, jet
fuel, kerosene and diesel oil) from the country's five refineries located along the coast of Korea to terminals,
also part of the project, at Taejon and South Seoul. The terminals are equipped for providing the required
operating and also the storage and off loading facilities needed to supply products for distribution at the
respective terminals.
2.            System optimization and basic engineering were provided by qualified reuable international
and domestic engin    finns. Bank technical staff reviewed the system design and found it satisfactory.
The operating controls and monitoring equipment are sophisticated and highly computerized, however, the
Borrower's staff is experienced and should be able to master the system's intricacies without excessive
problems. Vaiances from the optimization studies were mostly due to the need to alter pipe routing becuse
of civic objections and environmental restrictions.
3.            The refinery distillation products are low sulfur diesel oil, kerosene, JP4 jet fuel and
unleaded gasoline. These four products will be shipped in batches from the refineries to the delivery terminals
over a common pipeline system consisting of two separate pipelines. When the batches are pumped through
the pipeline, interfaces will form at each of the product joints. The amount of product contamination (or
degraded) at the interfaces geneally increases as the number of batches shipped to the delivery termial
increases. Thus, the interface costs can be reduced by increasing the batch cycles which, however, requires
larger batch sizes. Optimum batch sizes were dermined by balancing the reduction in interface costs with
the required storage tankage costs. The maximum allowable mixing of two products is smmaized in the
following table.
Maximum Mixing Amount (Perent)
Gasoline           JP4              Kerosene           Diesel
Gasoline into                            0.645             0.056             0.022
JP  into               0.733                               0.146             0.058
wKerosene inio         0.763             3.000                               3.000
Diesel into            0.733             3.000              1.000
The batching sequence is: D iesel/Kerosene/JP-4/Gasoline. Because of the small size of the JP-4 batch, it
wiU be omitted from every alternate batch cycle.

4.            The main requirement for operating a pipeline with minimum bath contamination is
continuous operation with no abrupt changes il pressure or flow rate. 'This is the reason that the pipeline
system consists of two pipeliles. Continuous operationt is not possible when two pipelines are fed itito one.
S.            Between Taejon and South Seoul 'I'erminials the two pipelines will be laid side by side in a
commoin  trench. This design tcature will substantially decrease trentching costs, and it will reduce th right-
up-way cost by about a halt compared to separate pipe nrutes.

MIS Deeopment Plan
1.           DHOPCO plans to set up its MIS in three phases. The first phase will cover operational
control and tansaction proceing, and is expected to be implemented by 1995. The second phase will cover
management control and tactical plann, and will be implemented by 1997. The final phase will focus on
strategic planning, and will be implemented by 1999.
F-s Phas=
2.            The basic MIS plan will be defied m this phase. In addition to providing the blueprint for
MIS development, this phase will set up the basic MIS organ on, develop and implement applications in
the area of operationd control and transuction prmcessing.
3.           Equipment tat will be instled is a mainframe computer (expected in 1993), followed by
a local area network linking D)HOPCO work-stations.  In terms of software, the first set of applications to
be developed are in finance and accoung, and payroll. These are expected to be undertken in 1993. In
1994, applicaions for prso     management and pipeline informaton magement will be developed and
implemented. Finally, in 1995, applications for prent managemen and equipment mangment will
be implemented. Underlying these applications development is the setting up of a database manaement
system.
4.            The proposed project will assist in the design and implementation of the first phase of MIS
development Detailed terms of reference for this phase will be agreed upon at negotiatdons. A sum of
US$500,000 has been allocated for this purpose in the loan.
Second Phase
5.            In this phase, the objectives are to expand the MIS to the various DHOPCO fiuctional
groups; expand the operations analysis system; and set up an informaton system related to petroleum
distribution. Specific tass include developing an appropriate mapping system for the MIS; expandig the
mainrame; settig up an electronic mail system; and building up the database on petroleum distnbution. At
the end of this phase, DHOPCO will have a well-integrated operations information system and wfll have
developed several daxbases.
Third Phase
6.            The focus of this phase wil be to integrate the various functional databases that will have
been created in the preceding phases in order to develop an intgrated MIS that can be used for stategic
planning. This phase will involve unifying the various systems, setting up the network for global information
exchange, and ingratig the opeonal, accountig, financial and personnel databases. In additon, the



-56-
Annex 10
Page 2 of 2
perolem distribution information system will be exaded and integrated into tie DHOPCO MIS. This
datse could be a potential source of revenue for DHOPCO, since DHOPCO could provide, for a fee,
information on petroleum distibution and consumptio trends in the various parts of the county. Such
information would have commercial value to efias, disruos as well as to the marketing depment of
relatd industies.
7.           In order to enre that DHOPCO staff and managemet are fully conversant with dte
capabilities of the MIS, orientions and trainig courses will be provided at each significant step in the
development and implementaton process. Senior management involvement in the dedgn stage will also be
required, to ensure that the system responds to specifi management needs.

Tentve Trainn  Program
1.            An amount of US$1.5 milLion has been allocated for the purposes of providing trainig to
DHOPCO staff The basic priciples underlying the proposed training program are: (i) that it be flexible and
adapted to DHOPCO's evolving needs; (ii) that it provide a core of well-trained staff in the critical areas of
opaons, fiance and management; and (iii) that the reach of the program be as exensive as possible.
Consequently, the program combines shott-tem, specific interest courses with long-term, degree courses; it
also provides for a mix of trainn in-house, witn Korea and overseas.

2.            D       e .  Over the 1993-96 period, DHOPCO plans to send 9 staff to universities
i North Ameaica and Europe. The courses include MBA in intemational busness (2 persons); DBA in
finacial management (1 pson); MA in economics (2 persons); MS in chemical engineering (2 persons); MS
in mechanil egineing (1 pe). The cost of this traiing is estimated at US$720,000.
3.             N.e C              DHOPCO plans to send 3 persons to the United Stats for a year-long
course in pipeline technology. In addition, 6 month courses in pipeline systems, quality control for petroleum
products, taxation, finanl management and ponnel management are planned for 8 persons. These courses
would be primaily delivered in the United States. One or two persons may be sent to Japan to diversify the
knowledge base. The cost of this traing is eamated at US$200,000. The Bank and DHOPCO have agreed
to review the long-term jtrani  progams (both degree and nondegree courses) during the project
implementation, on a case-by-case basis.
Short-Term Training
4.            Qpons. Several short-term courses in the area of measuring flux, work control using the
computer, pipeline coating technology, securt facites for pipeline operadons, and pipeline hydrauLics would
be followed by DHOPCO staff in the projec time frame. These courses would generally be of 2-3 week
duration, and will cover a total of 21 staff, who will be sent to the appr    instuions in the United States.
On-thejob training, and in-house training programs are also planned in the operations area in order to expand
the reach of training to DHOPCO staff. These programs are intended to update staff knowledge on new
technologies and systems, and will be delivered by local and foreign experts.
5.            Finance. The emphasis here will be on proviing basic traning in finance and planning,
which is one of the gaps in DHOPCO's current staff profile. The topics to be covered include internal
auditig and control, financial planning, billing procedures and taxaion. These courses woultd be best
provided in-house or within the country (as, for example, through the Korean account   and auditing
profession). Courses in project evaluation, and financial analysis would be called for to enable DHOPCO to
position itself for undertking further pipeline expansions or reated investments.

6.            mu     m. In this area, dhe emphasis wil be on saegic planming. Rather than a fomal
course, a setior magement workshop, conducted by experieed management trainers, would be desirable.
Related topics for senior management traing nclude poel management and MIS (see Annex 10).
7.            The actual topics and modalities will be detened based on DHOPCO's pipeline operating
experiemne, and the gaps in knowledge that it is able to identify. An asessment of such training needs wl
form an integral part of Bak supervision efforts, particularly in the initial year of operation. In all areas,
one of the key objectives will be to develop training materials in Korean, to ensure their wide disseminaon.
The cost of the short-tenn training is es d at US$580,000.

PEI ROLEUM DISTRIBUTION AND SECTOR MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
Assumptions for DHOPCO's Fi c  Prjectioons
income Stateme
1.         Revenues are calcuated for the oil tawsport volume and the oil storage volume. The transport
distace and projctons of the quantities tansported and stored are based on a study entited 'Optimal
Pieli  Tariff Detmination" undertaken by the Korea Energy Economics Institute for DHOPCO. The
demand for pipeline usage is projected based on energy demand in the country, the refines' optmation
of the differe  transportation modes available, and DHOPCO's expected long-run marginal cost
(approximated by the average inremeal cost). The tranwort and storage tariffs would be proposed by
DHOPCO based on the price of competing camers, DHOPCO profitability targets, and the tariffs applied by
the other oil pipeline operator in the country; the final tariff decision would be taken ty MOER. DHOPCO
could instigate tariff adjustmens as and when required, but tariffs would usually be adjusted annually. For
the purposes of the projections, tariffs are assumed to increase at Bank's projected rate of inflaon for Korea
(6% for 1993, 5.5% for 1994 and 5% for 1995 and beyond).
2.          Mg_tri  costs are calculated based on the volumes pumped as well as other electricity
conumption. Electricity taiffs are assumed to increase at the rate of inflation.
3.         ILbag costs are calculated for operations staff and technicians, and are based on DHOPCO's
forecast of employment. The basic amnual cost for operations staff is W12 million, and that for technicians
is W9 million per person. The weighted average staff cost is W9.75 million per person (1992 pnces).
These costs are assumed to increase at the annual inflation rate.
4.           gmaLo  ad M an              include: m n , which is taken to be 1%  of net constction
costs per anmum for the terminals and pumpstations, and 0.5% of net construction costs per annum for the
pipeline, adjusted for annual inflation; insn,ce which is esfimated at 1% of net construction costs per
annum, and is adjusted for annual inflation; wadinit service, which consists of guards and supervising
foreman at the teminals and pumpstaions on a 24-hourbasis. 3 foremen and 31x3 guard shifts are required
for the termins, while 9 foremen and 9x3 guard shifts are required for the pumpstations, at an average
annual salary of W5.7 million (1992 prices); and gfhgT costs, which are those associated with miscellaneous
conmables and supplies and are estimated by DHOPCO at 0.5% of net construction costs, adjusted for
amnual inflation.
S.          G a Admin*          includes salary as well as health and other social costs for headquarters
and terminallpumpstation personnel. The average salary per staff at beadquarters is W16 million, and at the
teminas and pumpstations is W19 million (1992 prices). Health and social costs are calculated at 40% of
the totl salary.
6.                     is taken over a 20-year period on the value of gross fixed assets and applies to
euipmt, terminals and pipeline installations. A 10% salvage value is assumed for equipment.

7.          I       is calculated based on acual and anticipated loan terms. See Debt Schedule (Projecd
Financiai Statements, Section IV).
8.         Income, Ta    are calculated at 36.55% of income before taxes. Note that a loss in any given
year can be offset against profits for three subsequent years.
Balaee Sheet
9.          Cash is derived from te Sources and Uses of Funds Statement (Secdon I of the Projected
Finanial Statements).
10.        Accounts Receivable are equivalent to one mont's sales revenue, reflecting a 30-day billing
cycle.
I1.        Inventories and Stocks are related to assets in operation and are taken to be 0.4% of net fixed
assets. Oil inventories are nil, given that DHOPCO trsports the product without actually taking possession
Of it.
12.        Other Current Assets are advance payments, prepaid expenses and refundable value-added tax,
taken to be 0.25% of sales.
13.        Gross Fixed Assets are derived from DHOPCO's investment program. From 1996 onwards
(once the invesuent program is implemented), assets are iated at the projected inflation rate of 5% per
annum. This real asset revaluation is reflected in the revaluation reserve.
:4.        Work nm rojz    is transferred to Gross Fixed Assets on completion of each project
component. Th project is assumed to remain under work in progress through 1994, when the pipeline
consuction is expected to be completed.
15.        Oter Aswu include sundry items such as leasehold deposits, telephone and telex rights,
guarnee deposits on leases, and long-term loans to employees.
16.        Accnts           concern udlity bils, which are taken to be paid in the month following
receit.
17.        Other Current Liabilities include accrued expenses and income taxes as well as wifthokungs.
18.          a-m Debt is derived from the Debt Schede.
19.        Other Liablits are assumed to remain constant in real terms from their 1992 levels.
20.         Adjustent for Asset Revaluation was undertaken to obtain consistcy between project costs
from an engineering and tenical point of view relative to the book value of assets in 1992. This
adutment was required for the purposes of the projections on acowut of the exchange rate used in valuing
asset acquired up to 1992.

21.        Reained Eais are derived from the projected Income Statement.  No dividends are
expected to be distributed during the forecast period.
22.        Revaluation Reserve represents changes in asset value based on projected inflation (see para.
13).
Sources and Uses of Funds
23.        Principal Reavments on existing and proposed loans are based on the actual and anticipated
terms of these loans. The IBRD loan has a maturity of 15 years, including a grace period of five years.
The Petroleum Business Fund and Treasury loans have a maturity of 15 years, including a five year grace
period. The Koren Exchange Bank and other commercial loans have a matrity of 10 years, including a
tree year grace period. The Korean Development Bank Industry Facility Fund loan has a matunty of 25
years, with a five year grace period.
24.        Investm   Proram expenditures are projected to be funded in accordance with DHOPCO's
fumd-raising progam. Note that no furdier investment beyond the nationwide pipeLine is presenly planned.

PETROLEUM DISIBUTION AND SECTOR MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
Ecoic Analysis and Underlying Assumptions
1.          The basis for economic analysis of the project is the forct of demand for light petroleum
products (gasoline, jet fuel, kerosene, and diesel oil) for 1993-2013. As discussed in chapter II, the forecast
is based on a model prepared by KEEI, taking into account key economic indicators and sectoral growth
parameters The Bank has reviewed the model and the basis for KEEI's forecast, and is satisfied with
KEEI's assumptions and approach.
2.          The project's economic benefits are derived from cost savings associated with ansportin
petroleum products via the proposed pipeline versus existng modes. Cost analyses were conducted on "with
piine" and "without pipeline" scenarios. "Without pipeline" costs were calculated considering total cost
connected with expanding the existng system (vessels, rail, road and small pipeline network) in order to
transport the forecasted demand of light products which will be transported by the proposed pipeline. It was
assumed that the present share of transport modes would ramain unchanged through the forecast period.
Since the transport cosu by vessels, rails and trucks are based on unit costs expressed as "charterage",
"tariff" and "rate' per barrel per kilometer, they include the capital investment costs associated with each
mode. With respect to costs for the pipeline under this scenario, it was assumed that the existing pipeline
would accommodate its inreased share of transport without additional capital investment, and that it will
have the same operaing costs as the new pipeline. Thus, the costs of four transport modes were used to
calculate the total costs under "without pipeline " scenario, had the existing system been expanded to meet
the projected demand, which is now planned to be tansported by the proposed pipeline.
3.          The costs of the "with pipeline" scenario include project investment and operating costs with
the fornmer including physical contingencies but excluding price contingencies. The pipeline operating costs
include the cost of electricity, labor, mantance, insurance, and general administration cost. The pipeline
operating costs correspond to those currendy being incurred by DHOPCO, in operation of its existing
pipeline facilities in Kyungin section. Under both scenarios, internal costs such as taxes and duties have
been excluded. With respect to an alternative use of the land required by the pipeline, it is aumed the
price paid for it reflects its economic value. These cost savings are estimated for both segments of the
pipeline (Kyungin and North-South).
4.          The economic rate of return calculated on this basis is about 14.50%. The sensitivity of this
rate of return was tested with respect to changes in ey assumptions. Table 6.1 of the text shows the results
of the sensitivity analysis.
