agro-ecological zoning, rural extension, agricultural\n            research and input supply; (b) the improvement of physical\n            infrastructure, including consolidation and expansion of\n            crop storage and drying capacity, and the improvement of\n            municipal roads and establishment of a road maintenance\n            capability; (c) the strenghtening and expansion of education\n            and health facilities and services, and construction of\n            community centers and rural water supply systems; and (d)\n            establishment of project management
