Government in strengthening educational administration and\n            planning; improving the allocation and management of sector\n            resources; meeting some of the most serious shortages of\n            skilled workers and middle-level staff in the modern sector;\n            and upgrading training for lower secondary school teachers.\n            It would also help reduce the drain on the education budget\n            stemming from excessive employment of expatriate secondary\n            teachers. The project would provide: construction,\n            furniture, equipment, technical assistance, and scholarships\n            for a Vocational Training and Upgrading Center, Maritime\n            Training Center, and Lower Secondary Teacher Training\n            College; technical assistance for the planning department of\n            the Ministry of Education; equipment, technical assistance,\n            and staff training for an organization and management unit\n            in the Ministry of Education; and furniture, equipment, and\n            specialist services for the project unit. The project also\n            includes operating expenses for all these institutions\n            except the vocational center."}, "docdt": "1982-02-10T00:00:00Z"}
