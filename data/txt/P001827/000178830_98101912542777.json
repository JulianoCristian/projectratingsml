will assist the Government in strengthening\n            educational administration and planning; improving the\n            allocation and management of sector resources; meeting some\n            of the most serious shortages of skilled workers and\n            middle-level staff in the modern sector; and upgrading\n            training for lower secondary school teachers. It will also\n            help reduce the drain on the education budget stemming from\n            excessive employment of expatriate secondary teachers. The\n            project will provide: construction, furniture, equipment,\n            technical assistance, and scholarships for a vocational\n            training and upgrading center, maritime training center, and\n            lower secondary teacher training college; technical\n            assistance for the planning department of the Ministry of\n            Education; equipment, technical assistance, and staff\n            training for an organization and management unit in the\n            Ministry of Education; and furniture, equipment, and\n            specialist services for the project unit. The project also\n            includes operating expenses for all these institutions\n            except the vocational center."}, "docdt": "1982-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
