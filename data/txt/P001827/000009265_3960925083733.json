The credit was closed on December\n            31, 1988, 27 months behind schedule. The credit was not\n            fully disbursed and the undisbursed balance of SDR 74,422\n            was cancelled July 13, 1989. Bank supervision, particularly\n            with respect to education/training matters, should be\n            strengthened so that corrective measures can be taken\n            quickly and, if necessary, the project's scope or\n            content can be adjusted if project objectives clearly cannot\n            be met. Local supervision capacity, particularly of\n            educational aspects, should also be strengthened. Strict\n            requirements for project monitoring and evaluation,\n            including all educational aspects, should be established and\n            workable mechanisms put in place to satisfy the monitoring\n            and evaluation (M&E) requirement. To provide\n            professional backstopping and oversight, a full-time\n            education/training specialist should be attached to the\n            project unit. Discussions on co-financing should be\n            initiated during the early stages of project preparation so\n            that co-financiers assume ownership of the component(s) to\n            be co-financed. If the availability of co-financing is\n            essential to the coherence o f project design,\n            cross-effectiveness clauses linking the various financing\n            agreements should not be waived simply in order to speed up\n            credit effectiveness. Rather, related covenants and\n            agreements should be enforced to safeguard the design concept."}, "docdt": "1990-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
