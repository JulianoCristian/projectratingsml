                         Program Development Objectives
                         Program Development Objective (from Program Document)

                         The objective of the proposed operation is to support the government's efforts to advance its strategy for adaptation to climate change in the water sector by
                         strengthening institutions, regulations and monitoring capacity in integrated water resources management, as well as incorporating incentives in the normative
                         frameworks and financing mechanisms of various water sub-sectors. The proposed DPL supports the government#s policy commitment to adaptation to climate change
                         in the water sector, including the allocation of institutional and financial resources and strengthening of monitoring and evaluation capacity. Reduced water availability
                         and poor water quality are two of the main factors affecting future growth and development in Mexico. Key to addressing these development challenges is the enactment
                         of measures to adapt to climate change whose aim is ensuring proper water resources management through appropriate regulations, norms, institutional reforms, and
                         financial mechanisms. The operation will support the GOM's efforts to foster adaptation to climate change in the water sector, contributing to long-term sustainable
                         growth and protecting the most vulnerable populations.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The progress of implementation for this DPL is Moderately Satisfactory. Nearly all end targets have been met so far and important advances have been recorded in all policy areas,
                         however, some areas including implementation of regulations have experienced some delays. In some areas, the Government of Mexico has conducted additional activities that
                         strengthen and add on to original activities planned in the DPL, showing their strong commitment to the policy program on Climate Change and Water Adaptation.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Progress in implementation of the policies supported by this DPL regarding Adaptation to Climate Change in the Water Sector is considered Moderately Satisfactory on the basis of
                         the progress shown by indicators reported by CONAGUA's Information System. Most of the end targets have been met so far or are expected to be met by the end of the year.
                         Activities concerning water treatment and implementation of regulations have experienced some delays and bottlenecks, but these are hoped to be resolved in the coming months.
