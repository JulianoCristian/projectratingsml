                         Program Development Objectives
                         Program Development Objective (from Program Document)

                         The objective of the proposed operation is to support the government's efforts to advance its strategy for adaptation to climate change in the water sector by
                         strengthening institutions, regulations and monitoring capacity in integrated water resources management, as well as incorporating incentives in the normative
                         frameworks and financing mechanisms of various water sub-sectors. The proposed DPL supports the government#s policy commitment to adaptation to climate
                         change in the water sector, including the allocation of institutional and financial resources and strengthening of monitoring and evaluation capacity. Reduced
                         water availability and poor water quality are two of the main factors affecting future growth and development in Mexico. Key to addressing these development
                         challenges is the enactment of measures to adapt to climate change whose aim is ensuring proper water resources management through appropriate
                         regulations, norms, institutional reforms, and financial mechanisms. The operation will support the GOM's efforts to foster adaptation to climate change in the
                         water sector, contributing to long-term sustainable growth and protecting the most vulnerable populations.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         It should be noted that progress so far has been important in all policy areas of this DPL and hence, the rating has been satisfactory. CONAGUA➂ 's evaluation capacity has been
                         strengthened through implementation of a modern Information System, that is used as a decision tool for Internal and External Monitoring, Reporting and Evaluation (such as the
                         Climate Change Special Program - PECC - and the National Development Plan).
