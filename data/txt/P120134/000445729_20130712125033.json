        to development outcome was moderate; bank performance was\n            satisfactory; and borrower performance also satisfactory.\n            Some of the lessons learned included: the operation's\n            policy content and prior actions should reflect the\n            borrower's own program and priorities developed with\n            the benefit of a national policymaking process that involves\n            broad public consultation. Sustained engagement on the part\n            of the bank is critical to effectively support reform\n            processes over the medium and long term. Prior actions\n            should be limited to a few key policy and institutional\n            reforms. The operation's outcomes should also reflect\n            the borrower's program objectives and monitoring\n            capacity and, like the prior actions, should be limited to a\n            few key, measurable indicators. And the strategy of focusing\n            primarily on achieving a paradigm shift within the flagship\n            water agency proved highly effective to mainstream climate\n            change adaptation into the water sector."}, "docdt": "2013-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
