(ii) establishment of rural\n            rainfed tree plantations, of which 1,500 ha would be in\n            family plantations and another 1,500 ha would be in rural\n            community plantations; (iii) improvement in productivity and\n            management of about 10,000 ha of existing natural forests;\n            (iv) financing an applied forestry research program; (v)\n            establishment and operation of a training center to provide\n            refresher courses for forestry agents; (vi) strengthening\n            the Forestry Department by providing a high level forestry\n            economist and consultants for the Planning Division of the\n            Forestry Department and establishment at Kaffrine of a\n            Project Operations Unit (POU); and
