INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
To the Management of Energy Loss Reduction Project and Emergency Energy Recovery Assistance Project:
We have audited the accompanying special purpose project financial statements of Energy Loss Reduction
Project (Electricity Component), financed under Financing Agreements Credit No. 4093-TJ, Grant No. H 178-
TJ, Grant No. 757-TJ. Grant SECO and contribution of OSHC Barqi Tojik and the Emergency Energy
Recovery Assistance Project, financed under Financing Agreements Grant No. 372-Ti and Grant No. 566-TJ
(the "Project") which comprise the statement of financial position, the statement of cash proceeds and
disbursements, the statement of uses of funds by project components, the statement of special account for the
year ended December 31. 2014 and for grace period ended April 30, 2015, and a summary of significant
accounting policies and other explanatory information (the "special purpose project financial statements").
Management's responsibility for the special purpose project financial statements
Management is responsible for the preparation of these special purpose project financial statements in
accordance with International Public Sector Accounting Standard "Financial Reporting Under the Cash Basis
of Accounting" (the "IPSAS") issued by the International Public Accounting Standards Board of the
International Federation of Accountants, and the World Bank's Financial Management Sector Board's
"Guidelines: Annual Financial Reporting and Auditing for World Bank Financed Activities" (the "WB
Guidelines"), and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of
the special purpose project financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud
or error.
Auditors' responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these special purpose project financial statements based on our
audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those standards
require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance whether the special purpose project financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the
special purpose project financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditors' judgment,
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the special purpose project financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal
controls relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the special purpose project financial
statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. An audit also includes
evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the special purpose project financial
statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
audit opinion.

Opinion
In our opinion, the accompanying special purpose project financial statements are consistent, in all material
respects, financial position as at December 31, 2014 and grace period ended April 30, 2015 and cash proceeds
and disbursements, uses of funds by project components and statement of application for the year ended
December 31, 2014 and grace period ended April 30, 2015 in accordance with International Public Sector
Accounting Standard "Financial Reporting Under the Cash Basis of Accounting" (the "IPSAS") issued by the
International Public Sector Accounting Standards Board of the International Federation of Accountants, and
the World Bank's Financial Management Sector Board's "Guidelines: Annual Financial Reporting and
Auditing for World Bank Financed Activities" (the "WB Guidelines").
Basis of accounting and restriction on distribution and use
Without modifying our opinion, we draw attention to Note 2 to the special purpose project financial statements
which describes the basis of accounting. The special purpose project financial statements are prepared to assist
the Project to comply with the requirements of the World Bank. As a result the special purpose project
financial statements may not be suitable for another purpose. Our report is intended solely for use by the
management of the Project and the World Bank should not be distributed or used by anyone other than these
specified parties.
