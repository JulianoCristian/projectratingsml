When there is rei       evidence  incurred       from impairment, the amount        is
as a ditTerence     book value and discounted expected future cash flows (without expected future
credit       not     incurred).

Present value       expected future cash          are discounted at initial              interest rate of the
financial asset. If the interest rate of borrowing is a floating rate, the discount rate for impairment loss
calculation is current                     rate.

statement of financial position if there is not evidence of recoverability of such and all available
security was sold or transferred to the Group. If during the subsequent period the amount of calculated
losses from impairment increases or decreases as a result of an event taking place after recognition of
impairment, the amount of losses recognized increase or decrease by means of reserve account
adjustment. If the subsequently the write-off of value of financial asset recovers, the amount of
recovery recognized as decrease of finance costs in the consolidated statement of comprehensive

Financial investments, available-for-sale

The Group performs the annual assessment for impairment indicators for the investments held-for-
sale.

If the investments in equity instruments, classified as available-for-sale, the reliable evidence of
impairment would be significant and continuous decrease in fair value of the investment below its
initial acquisition cost. The significance is measured in comparison to initial acquisition cost,
continuous means the comparison to the period, when decrease below initial acquisition cost took
place. When reliable evidence of impairment is identified the amount of comprehensive loss,
calculated as difference of book value and current fair value, less any other impairment loss
recognized in the statement of comprehensive income, the loss is reclassified from other
                        to the            statement

Impairment of non-financial assets

The Group performs the assessment of impairment indicators             the assets at each reporting date. If
such indicators exist or if there is a requirement to perform impairment test, than Group perform the
                                  asset. The              amount of         asset or
cash flows ("CGI") is higher of fair value of the asset (CGI) less cost to sell and value in use of the
asset (CGI). Recoverable amount is determined for separate asset, except for cases, when such asset
does not generate cash flows, which dependent on cash flows generated by other assets or group of
assets. If the book value of the asset or CGI exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is impaired and
written off to recoverable amount. When estimated value in use future cash flows are discounted at
the discount rate before taxation, which reflects the current market estimate of time value of money
and risks related to the asset. When determining fair value of the asset less cost to sell recent market
deals (if any) are taken into account. If no such information is available, appropriate valuation model
is used. These calculations are supported by valuation coefficients, market prices of freely convertible
shares of the subsidiaries or other available indicators of the fair value.

If the book value of the asset or CGI exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered as
impaired and written down to recoverable amount. Under assessment of value in use the future cash
flows are discounted at the rate net of tax, which reflects the present market value of cash flows and
risks inherent to the asset. Under assessment of the fair value less cost to sell, the recent market
transactions (if were existent) are taken into consideration. If no such transaction took place the
relevant valuation model is applied. These computations are supported by estimated coefficients,
active market quotes of subsidiaries shares and other avai !able indicators of fair value.

Impairment losses from ongoing activities (including inventory impairment) are included in the
consolidated statement of comprehensive income as a component of those expenses, which are related
to the            the asset, except              revalued real estate if revaluation was         in
other comprehensive               In       cases the impairment loss is deducted from other
comprehensive income to the extent the revaluation gain was recognized.

The Group performs assessment         indicators whether indicators of impairment loss still exist or
decreased on an annual basis. If such indicator exist the Group assess the recoverable amount of the
asset or cash generating component. Previously recorded impairment losses recovered            if the
changes in applied estimate of the recoverability of the asset, since most recent impairment
recorded. The recovery is limited to the book have not exceeding its recoverable amount as
not exceeding book value less depreciation, which would be charged if such impairment
not be recorded. This recovery of      is included in the statement of comprehensive income.

5.   CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND PROFESSIONAL JUDGEMENTS IN
     APPLYING ACCOUNTING POLICY

     The Group makes estimates and assumptions that affect within the next financial period the amounts of
     assets and liabilities recognized in consolidated financial statements. Estimates and judgments are
     continually evaluated and are based on management's experience and other factors, including
     expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management
     also makes certain judgments, apart tl·om those involving estimations, in the process of applying the
     accounting policies. Judgments that have the most significant impact on the figures recorded in the
     consolidated financial statements and estimates that can cause a significant adjustment to the carrying
     amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial period include:

the budget for the next five years and do not include restructuring activity, in conducting of which the
Group does not have obligations or significant investment in future, which will improve the asset tested
for impairment of cash generating unit. The recoverable amount is most sensitive to            discount rate
      in                                                                    inflows               rate,
for extrapolation. More information about the key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount
of the various units, generating cash, including sensitivity analysis, is provided in Note 31.

Taxes

There is uncertainty in respect of interpretation of complex tax legislation, changes in tax laws, as well as
the amounts and timing of future taxable income. Given the wide variety of operations, as well as the
long-term nature and complexity of existing contractual relations, differences between the actual results
and the assumptions made, or future changes in these assumptions could result in future adjustments of
already reported amounts of revenues and income tax expenses. The Group does not create provisions for
the possible results of tax inspection conducted by tax authorities in the countries in which it operates. As
the Group estimates the occurrence of litigation in connection with the tax laws and the subsequent
outflovv of funds as unlikely, contingent liability is not recognized.

Deferred tax assets are recognized for all unused tax losses insofar it is probable that taxable profit will be
available against which tax losses can be utilized. for determination the amount of deferred tax assets that
can be recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on probable period of and amount of
future taxable profit, and tax planning strategies, significant management judgment is required. Tax
planning opportunities that could serve as a partial basis for the recognition of deferred tax assets in
respect of these losses are not available.

The fair value tiffinancial statements

 In cases when the fair value      financial instruments and financial liabilities recorded in the consolidated
statement of financial position can not           derived from active markets, they are determined
valuation techniques, including discounted           flow model. As a source data for these models is
 information from observable markets, but in those cases           this is not feasible, a certain proportion of
judgment is required to determine fair value. The judgments include considerations of such                    as

IFRS 9 Financial Instruments

!FRS 9 Financial Instruments, issued in November 2009 and amended in October 20 l 0, introduces
new              for the                  measurement of         assets
and

Key requirements of !FRS 9:
•    All recognised financial assets that are within the scope of lAS 39 Financial Instruments:
     Recognition and Measurement to be subsequently measured at amortised cost or fair value.
     Specifically, debt investments that are held within a business model whose objective is to collect
     the contractual cash flows, and that have contractual cash flows that are solely payments of
     principal and interest on the principal outstanding are generally measured at amortised cost at
     the end of subsequent accounting periods. All other debt investments and equity investments are
     measured at their fair values at the end of subsequent accounting periods. In addition, under
     !FRS 9 Financial Instruments, entities may make an irrevocable election to present subsequent
     changes in the fair value of an equity investment (that is not held for trading) in other
     comprehensive income, with only dividend income generally recognised in profit or loss.
•     With regard to the measurement of financial liabilities designated as at fair value through profit
      or loss, !FRS 9 Financial Instruments requires that the amount of change in the fair value of the
      financial liability, that is attributable to changes in the credit risk of that liability, is presented in
      other comprehensive income, unless the recognition of the effects of changes in the liability's
      credit risk in other comprehensive income \-vould create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in
      profit or loss. Changes in fair value attributable to a financial liability's credit risk are not
      subsequently reclassified to profit or loss. Previously, under !AS 39 Financial Instruments:
      Recognition and Measurement, the entire amount of the change in the fair value of the financial
      liability             as at                                        recogn      111        or

The Group's Management anticipates that IFRS 9 Financial Instruments in the future may not have a
significant impact on amounts reported in respect of the Group's financial assets and financial
liabilities. However, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate the effect of !FRS 9
Financial Instruments until a detailed review has been completed.

     IFRSs. Amendments to IFRSs include:

     Amendments to lAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation

     The amendments to lAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation clarifies that income tax relating to
     distributions to holders of an equity instrument and to transaction costs of an equity transaction should
     be accounted for in accordance with lAS 12 Income Taxes. The Group management anticipates that
     the amendments to lAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation will have no effect on the Group's
     financial statements as the Group has already adopted this treatment.
     All other Standards and Interpretations are not applicable to the Group's operations. Management
     believe the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations will not have a significant impact on the
     results of the Group's operations.


7.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

     The parties are considered as related if one party can control the other party, under common control or
     can exercise significant influence over decision making process in relation to its operations or
     exercise joint control. Determining whether parties are related includes the assessment of relations of
     parties, and not only legal form. The information on the Company and ultimate shareholder of the
     Group are disclosed in Note l.

 l                     control

The Republic ofTajikistan has acceded to the Kyoto Protocol and ratified it on 22 November 2008.
After the ratification of Kyoto Protocol coordination is assigned to Committee for environmental
protection under the Government of the Republic ofTajikistan.

Legislation for environmental protection in the Republic of Tajikistan is in the process of
development and government agencies continuously revising standards for the application of such
legislation. The Group periodically evaluates its obligations under environmental regulations. As
obligations are defined, they are immediately defined in the consolidated accounts. Potential liabilities
that may arise as a result of changes in existing regulations, litigation in civil cases or legislation can
not be estimated with any certainty, but could be significant. Under the existing system of control and
penalties for non-compliance with the existing legislation, Management believes that at the moment
there are no significant liabilities related to environmental damage.

(f) Litigation

During the year the Group was involved in a number of litigations (as a claimant and defendant)
arising in the ordinary course of business. In Management's opinion at present time there are no
pending legal proceedings or other claims, finishing of which could have a material adverse effect on
the financial results and financial position of the Group, or which would not have been accrued or
disclosed in these consolidated financial statements.

(g) Technical risks

Reconstruction of the electric power industry is dictated by the current situation in the energy sector
due to the rapid deterioration of the technical condition           the fixed assets of the Group.
Implementation of current and capital repairs is not enough; new construction, rehabilitation,
reconstruction and technical re-equipment is required in accordance with technical progress.
Thus technical      of impairment is h

Market risk

Market risk is a risk of possible fluctuations of the fair value of future cash flows as a result of
changes in market prices. Market prices include four types of risks: interest rate risk, currency risk,
risk of price change and other price risks. Financial instruments which are subject of market risk
include loans, deposits, investments held for sale.

Risl\. of price changes

Risk of price changes is the risk or uncertainty arising from possible changes in market prices and
their impact on future performance and results of operational activity of the Group.

Price decrease can lead to decrease of net income and cash flows. Maintaining low prices for an
extended period of time can lead to a reduction in activity and may ultimately have an impact on the
Group's ability to fulfill its obligations under the contracts. Management estimates the decline as
hardly probable and Group does not use derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to this risk.

The Group enters into long-term contracts for products supply on standard commercial terms; thereby
the Group is not exposed to the risk of loss of revenue due to price increase on the market

Interest rate risk

Interest rate risk is a risk that the       future       flows    financial instruments will fluctuate
because of changes in market interest rate risks. Risk      changes in market interest rates relates
primarily to the Group's long-term debt                floating interest rates.

As at 31 December 2012,          I 00% of the Group's                      have   fixed   interest   rates

Currency risk

Currency risk is a risk that the fair value   future      flows    financial instruments will fluctuate
due to changes in exchange rates. The Group's exposure to                  currency            rates is
stipulated primarily due to Group's                      (when        or expenses are denominated in
currencies, other than the functional currency of the Group), as well as the Group's net investment in

Aluminum Plant (T ADAZ), which is currently controlled by the Government of the Republic of
Tajikistan. Only 4.3% of accounts receivable is accounted for Tajik Aluminium Plant.

The carrying value of accounts receivable, net of allowance for bad debt, represents the maximum
amount exposed to credit risk.

Need for impairment recognition is reviewed at each balance sheet date, individually for each large
entity. In addition, the amounts due from a large number of individuals are grouped into
homogeneous groups and assessed for impairment on a collective basis. The calculations are based on
the information on actual losses incurred in the past. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the
reporting date is presented by the book value of each class of financial assets. The Group does not
have the property received as security for the debt owed to it.

Although collection of receivables could be influenced by economic factors, management believes
that there is no substantial risk of loss beyond the provision for impairment of receivables.

Liquidity risk

Group exercises control over the risk of shortage of funds using a recurring liquidity planning tool.

The Group's objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through
