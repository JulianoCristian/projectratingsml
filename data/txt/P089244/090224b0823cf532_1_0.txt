                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Several project activities were successfully completed in the past months, including supply of additional 47,000 electricity meters, distribution poles and cables, computers and
                         accounting software, as well as supply and installation of electricity distribution substations that have improved reliability of power supply in Dushanbe. However, project
                         implementation faced delays related to the installation of 47,000 electricity meters in Dushanbe and transitioning from the existing electricity billing system in Dushanbe to a modern
                         multi-functional billing system, and implementation of the Nurek HPP Rehabilitation and Sedimentation Studies. Also, little progress has been achieved so far by the implementing
