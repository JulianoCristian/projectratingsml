Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The Energy Loss Reduction Project (ELRP), including addtional financing that became effective in 2012, has been under implementation since 2005
 and will close, as planned on December 31, 2014. It pursued two objectives: (I) to assist in reducing the commercial losses in the electricity and gas
 sectors, and to lay the foundation for the improvement of the financial viability of the electricity and gas utilities in a socially responsible manner; and (II)
 to assist in the viability assessment of the proposed Rogun HEP in Tajikistan.
 The first objective was fully achieved in the gas sector by the end of 2012. However, the only source of gas in Tajikistan – gas imports from Uzbekistan
 – stopped by the end of 2012 due to political and commercial reasons. As a result, the national gas company TajikTransGas has been effectively out of
 operation since the beginning of 2013.
 In the electricity sector, the first objective was substantially achieved with respect to laying the foundation for the improvement of the financial viability of
 the electricity utility Barki Tojik (BT). Electricity tariff adjustments and improvements in cash collections allowed BT to make significant progress towards
 cost recovery, as well as improve transparency of its operations in the past years through conducting an annual audit and making its results available to
 the public. In response to auditors’ comments, BT commissioned several studies under the project, including evaluation of the company’s fixed assets
 and inventory, and evaluation of payables and receivables. Their outcomes prepare the ground for an audit opinion on the BT financial statements in the
 coming years. The bulk of electricity meters supplied under the project will be installed by the project closing date. The balance of the supplied meters,
 as well as the completion of a billing and development of a commercial management systems will be supported under the proposed Tajikistan Winter
 Energy Project (WEP), for which an advance is expected to be obtained and become available by early 2015. These activities will help BT to make
 further progress in reducing losses and improving transparency and accountability of its operations. The WEP will also support completion of the Nurek
 Hydro Power Plant rehabilitation, dam safety, and sedimentation studies, initiated under ELRP.
 The second objective has been fully achieved despite the significant complexity of and challenges facing the task through a concerted diplomatic effort
 and high quality process that was supported and managed by a strong multi-disciplinary Bank team with expertise in all areas needed for a large hydro
 power assessment. Credibility of the studies was further validated through the thorough review of the studies by two independent Panels of Experts that
 were funded and managed by the Bank.The Bank used its convening power to put together a structured consultation process with the stakeholders and
 the five riparian countries that provided international recognition to the results of the studies.

         Comments
         The higher than expected losses are mainly caused by a significant increase in electricity consumption in winter months that
         causes overloading of the electricity network, and subsequently excess losses. Electricity consumption went up in winter because of
         continued deterioration of district heating and lack of gas availability. In these circumstances, the population of Dushanbe extensively uses
         electricity for heating purposes. However, it should also be noted that the reliability of data on electricity losses has been problematic from
         the project outset and losses, were likely significantly underestimated at the time of setting the target level.

         Comments
         On July 1, 2014, the BT tariffs were increased by 15% for all customers, except TALCO whose average tariff was raised by about 57%. As
         a result, the weighted average retail tariff for the first 10 months of 2014 reached 11.3 diram/kWh or about 2.2 US cent/kWh. It is expected
         that the BT weighted average tariff for 2014 will further increase since the new tariffs were made effective in the middle of 2014 and the
         winter tariffs are higher than the summer ones for some consumer groups. The weighted average tariff for October reached 14.9 diram/kWh
         or about 2.9 US cent/kWh.

         and political reasons. Due to non-availability of gas, it was not possible to measure the indicator during 2013-2014.

         Electricity sales target exceeded. Electricity sales in Dushanbe for the 11 months of 2014 exceed the target for the 12 months of the
         year. This became possible due mostly to improved billing practices and increased consumption in winter.

               That target was fully achieved by the end of 2012. It may be noted that the target of 160,000 meters, which was provided under the FA,
               was found to be overestimation after the start of project implementation. As such the target was revised to 144,000. Total meters delivered
               were 143,790, out of which 93,055 were provided under ELRP funding and remaining 50,735 were provided directly by TajikTransGas from
               its own resources.
