                  Given that power supply costs in Tajikistan are predominantly in local currency, the

1 Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country Context. Tajikistan is a land-locked country with eight million inhabitants. It gained
independence from the Former Soviet Union (FSU) in 1991. The sudden loss of transfers from
the FSU coupled with a civil war that prevailed from 1992 to 1997 severely affected economic
growth. After the peace agreement in 1997, the Government of Tajikistan (GoT) embarked on a
program of reforms with the assistance of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World
Bank. As a result, GDP growth turned positive with growth averaging about 10 percent per year
during 2000 to 2004. Nevertheless, at the time of project appraisal in 2005, Tajikistan remained
the poorest country in the Europe and Central Asia Region, and one of the poorest globally, with
a ranking of 110 among 174 states based on an assessment of the human development index.

Sector Context. After independence, Tajikistan’s power sector retained its former interconnections
with the Central Asia Power System (CAPS), which operated as a synchronous regional grid.
Hydro-rich upstream countries (Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan) provided electricity in summer on a
buy-and-sell basis for electricity generated by fossil fuels in downstream countries (Kazakhstan,
Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan) in winter. During the 1990s, this system began to deteriorate and
eventually collapsed in 2008-9, creating energy imbalances and demand for greater self-
sufficiency in each country. Tajikistan’s energy sector could not meet demand in winter for
electricity and heating yet it possessed significant electricity surpluses in summer that could not
be exported. According to estimates, Tajikistan possessed vast amounts of hydroelectric resources,
about 40,000 MW (with an energy potential of 527 billion kWh), of which only about 10 percent
were exploited. The country also had considerable coal deposits, with reserves estimated at about
700 million tons, and a large part of it with very high calorific value of about 7,000 kilocalories
per kilogram. The electricity sector in Tajikistan accounted for about 5 percent of GDP, and
electricity was the most important input for the two most exported commodities – aluminum and
cotton. The country was heavily dependent on hydroelectric power installations which supplied
about 99 percent of the country’s power supply. As regards electricity consumption, TALCO, the
aluminum smelter, consumed about 43 percent of total power supply, households about 28 percent,
and the irrigation sector about 12 percent. In the natural gas subsector, supplies were dominated
by imports – about 98 percent – from Uzbekistan. Residential consumption accounted for about
14 percent of consumption with the industrial and commercial sectors consuming the remaining
86 percent. Critical issues faced by the energy sector included:
      lack of investments leading to severe deterioration of the physical infrastructure, resulting
       in high network losses and reduced reliability;
      very low levels of tariffs in relation to cost of supply, which also contributed to increased
       consumption and an imbalance between demand and supply; .
      high levels of commercial losses due to insufficient metering and lack of a commercial
       culture in the utilities;
      resulting low financial viability of the sector utilities and financial resource constraints;
      shortages of energy supply especially in the winter;
      overdependence on the electricity system;
      sub-optimal exploitation of the country’s energy potential;
      capacity constraints at professional and managerial areas in the key sector entities;


                                                1
        inadequate financial management (FM) capacity and base-line financial data on BT and
         TTG.

Strategy of the Government. Recognizing that the situation in the sector was not sustainable,
from 2003 onwards the GoT started initiating a number of measures to improve the cost recovery
of energy services, starting with increases in the levels of electricity and gas tariffs, and withdrawal
of subsidies to privileged groups. This was followed by the development of a comprehensive
strategy, with the assistance of the World Bank, for developing the electricity and gas sectors over
the medium term. The GoT conveyed this strategy to the Bank in a Letter of Energy Sector
Development Strategy (LESDS). The Energy Loss Reduction Project (ELRP) was an integral part
of this development strategy. The strategy took a two track approach.
    The first track was focused on the domestic energy market and included a set of policy and
     investment measures to bring the sector to reasonable operating conditions while improving
     financial viability. The policy measures included (i) implementation of a Medium Term
     Tariff Policy covering both gas and the electricity sectors; (ii) a Social Protection Policy for
     Energy Services to improve effectiveness and better targeting; and (iii) an Institutional
     Reform Policy for the energy sector to improve transparency and efficiency of operations,
     enable electricity trade, and pave the way for further private sector participation in the sector.
     The prioritized investment measures included implementation of an energy loss reduction
     program in the electricity and gas sectors, implementation of an energy efficiency program
     and demand side management program, and over the medium term, a gas and electricity
     network rehabilitation program.
    The second track was focused on increasing electricity exports first using existing seasonal
     surpluses in the summer and developing new hydroelectric capacities for exports to countries
     like Afghanistan, China, Iran, Pakistan, and Russia. The GoT also intended to develop new
     hydro capacities with foreign investors, e.g. from Russia and Iran.

Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank had been engaged in Tajikistan’s energy sector since
2001. It had helped introduce an innovative public-private partnership approach to electricity
sector development (Pamir Private Power Project). The Bank had helped the GoT to formulate a
development strategy for the energy sector (as described above) and carried out an Energy Utility
Reform Review. The ELRP was expected to be the first of the needed investment and institutional
interventions to help the realization of the strategy. The Bank was also playing a lead role in
regional approaches to energy and energy-linked water issues which were central to Tajikistan’s
long-term sectoral, as well as overall, development strategies. Finally, the Bank was working
closely with other development institutions, particularly the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the
IMF and the Swiss Government’s Development Agency (SECO) to coordinate the assistance to
the sector. The ELRP, by focusing on commercial operations in electricity and gas distribution,
complemented the activities of other development partners who had focused mainly on electricity
generation and transmission, with no support for the gas sector.

The objectives of the project were to assist in reducing the commercial losses in the electricity and
gas systems, and to lay the foundation for the improvement of the financial viability of the
electricity and gas utilities in a socially responsible manner.

The key performance indicators were the following:

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
    reasons/justification

In response to a request from the GoT, in February 2011 the Bank’s Board approved a project
restructuring to enable financing of the preparation of Techno-Economic and Environmental-
Social Impact Assessment Studies for the Rogun Water Resources and Hydroelectric Project
(Rogun HEP). With this addition, the PDO were revised as follows: The development objectives
of the project are: (i) to assist in reducing the commercial losses in electricity and gas sectors, and
to lay the foundation for the improvement of the financial viability of the electricity and gas
utilities in a socially responsible manner; and (ii) to assist in the viability assessment of the
proposed Rogun HEP in Tajikistan.

                                                  3
In supporting the amendment of the PDO, the Bank recognized that the development of
hydropower storage projects in Tajikistan had the potential to alleviate chronic winter energy
shortages that led to annual economic losses of 3 percent of GDP and brought hardship to seventy
percent of the population. At the same time, additional generating capacity for the winter would
create surplus energy in the summer, which, if exported, could generate revenues for many of the
development needs of Tajikistan and provide clean energy and water management benefits for the
broader region. Since Rogun HEP was one of the largest candidate projects, its study would have
valuable inputs for the future development of hydro-electric power in the country. However, given
the project’s location on a geopolitically strategic and seismically active juncture of the Vakhsh
River, an international waterway (as defined under the Bank’s Operational Policy 7.50), the Bank
understood that a potential project would raise safety, environmental and social concerns, both
within Tajikistan and among riparian countries (Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan,
Afghanistan, Kyrgyz Republic and Kazakhstan). The Bank also recognized that the examination
of the project’s viability would take place in a political dynamic of increased nationalism, resource
conflicts and declining regional cooperation.

The proposed Rogun HEP is a partially-completed structure that was initiated in the 1970s, when
Tajikistan was a republic of the Soviet Union. It is a large, technically complex project that was
conceived as part of a cascade system to serve irrigation and energy generation purposes in a
regional system without national borders. The purpose of the Bank involvement was to ensure an
unbiased, impartial and transparent evaluation of the benefits and the risks according to
international standards. The Bank limited its intervention in the restructuring to financing for
execution of the Assessment Studies as an input to decision-making on a possible project. Thus,
it purposefully excluded financing of construction for the Rogun HEP. At the same time, as noted
by the Inspection Panel in its December 2010 report, the Bank satisfied the requirements of O.P.
4.01 by financing the work of two independent Panels of Experts (PoEs) to provide an unbiased
opinion on the assessment studies. In this context, the Bank had written letters in September 2010
to the heads of the governments of Tajikistan and the riparian countries, explaining the scope of
the World Bank’s involvement, while outlining how international standards required by the World
Bank and reviewed independently by the PoEs would ensure a transparent process with adequate
opportunities for riparian input.

The RVP’s letter of September 2010 to the President of Tajikistan set out the envisaged approach
and process for undertaking and reviewing the studies, including assuring the technical quality and
independence of the studies, addressing concerns and suggestions of the riparian countries, and
ensuring the level of international scrutiny expected by the international community. Key
components in the process were:
   (i) involvement of the Bank in consultant selection and management;
   (ii) realization of additional studies by the Bank;
   (iii) establishment of Panels of Experts (PoEs) contracted and financed by the Bank;
   (iv) structured riparian consultations; and
   (v) definition of key milestones and timeline.

In addition, there were two further conditions for the Bank’s continued involvement: (i) no river
diversion (construction of coffer dam) by Tajikistan unless the assessment studies, reviewed by
the PoEs, determined the feasibility of a 70 meter facility and the results had been shared with the


                                                 4
riparians; and (ii) continued compliance by Tajikistan with all Bank operational and safeguards
policies.

The proposed Assessment Studies were to evaluate the benefits, risks and overall viability of the
proposed Rogun HEP and identify measures to address potential impacts. The studies were to
consist of (i) a techno-economic assessment (TEAS) covering the engineering, geologic and
financial/economic aspects of the Rogun HEP, and (ii) an environmental and social impact
assessment (ESIA).

In addition to the change in the PDO discussed above, the other changes under the February 2011
restructuring included: (i) the results framework of the project was updated to capture the changes
since the project was approved in June 2005, and (ii) the Environmental Safeguards category of
the project was changed from B to A.

The performance indicators after the February 2011 restructuring were further revised under the
Additional Financing approved in February 2012 (Section 1.7 below). The revised indicators were
the following:

the actual experience in obtaining reliable data, and (ii) addition of new indicators to reflect the
added activities after the restructuring. Accordingly, (i) two new indicators were added (numbers
4 and 7 above) and two were dropped (the last two in the above table) due to difficulties in
obtaining reliable data.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The intended beneficiaries of the project were not clearly identified in the PAD. However, the
direct beneficiaries of the project are (i) the two utilities BT and TTG through the institutional
strengthening and improved commercial and financial performance enabled by the investments
and technical assistance funded under the project, and (ii) the GoT through the technical assistance
funded under the project. Through the improved performance of BT, the project also indirectly
benefited electricity consumers, particularly in Dushanbe, and through the improved performance
of TTG, the consumers of gas in Tajikistan. Under the restructuring that added the Rogun studies,
other major beneficiaries were the Project Management Group for Construction of Energy
Facilities, the Rogun Joint Stock Company, and the Resettlement Unit set up by the Government.
All these entities benefited from the substantial experience gained in the process of the design and
carrying out of the studies, including those in relation to resettlement issues and preparation of
related documentation. In light of the strategic significance of the proposed HEP, the project also
benefited stakeholders in Tajikistan and riparian countries who participated for the first time in a
public consultation process for a major investment project in which international standards set the
benchmark for decision-making.

1.5 Original Components

The project consisted of the following components:

Electricity Component
   (a) Supply and installation of approximately 160,000 electricity meters and related equipment
       and materials for consumers in the Dushanbe Electricity Network;
   (b) Design, supply and installation of automated billing systems for the Dushanbe Electricity
       Network; and
   (c) Technical assistance to BT for (i) engineering, management and supervision; (ii)
       implementation of a financial management improvement program and independent
       auditing; (iii) development and establishment of an industry-standard electricity exports
       contract; and (iv) financial and legal advisory services for the development of new
       hydroelectric projects aimed at electricity exports.

Gas Component
   (a) Supply and installation of approximately 160,000 gas meters and related materials to
       complete TTG’s gas metering program;
   (b) Supply and installation of laboratories for gas meter calibration, testing and quality control;
   (c) Design, supply and installation of automated billing systems for TTG; and
   (d) Technical assistance to TTG for (i) engineering, management and supervision; (ii)
       implementation of a financial management improvement program and independent
       auditing; and (iii) development and establishment of an industry-standard gas imports
       agreement.



                                                 7
Government Component

Technical assistance to the Government for:
   (a) Implementation of electricity and gas tariff policies;
   (b) Implementation of social protection policies for energy reforms;
   (c) Monitoring and evaluation of the performance of BT and TTG:
   (d) Streamlining the interaction between energy consumers and the Borrower’s agencies
       involved in technical and economic regulation of energy supply.

1.6 Revised Components

Under the February 2011 restructuring, the following modifications were made:

Electricity Component. The quantity of electricity meters was increased by about 10,000 to a
total of about 170,000. However, it was expected that the overall contribution of IDA financing
for this component would not change significantly since there were cost savings in the purchase
of the meters.

Gas Component. In 2006, the metering requirement was reviewed by the implementing agency
(TTG) and the overall requirements reduced to 144,000 meters. These were procured and most
had been installed by December 2012. About 93,000 meters were financed from the IDA credit
and the remaining from Government funds. To utilize the saving under the IDA credit, additional
quantities for bulk meters, laboratory equipment and chromatographs were included. The
development of an industry-standard gas import agreement was dropped because TTG was not
able to reach agreement with Uztransgaz (the sole gas supplier to TTG) with regard to changes to
their existing gas supply agreement.

Technical Assistance Component. The scope of the component was expanded with the inclusion
of the Rogun HEP Assessment Studies. These included: (i) a Techno-Economic Assessment Study
(TEAS) to assess the overall design, operations and economics of the Rogun HEP and (ii) an
Environmental and Social Impacts Study (ESIA) to review resettlement, water management
implications, and construction and operations-related environmental and social impacts.

1.7 Other significant changes

The State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) on behalf of the Swiss Confederation had
agreed to be a co-financing partner for the project. In March 2007, an Administration Agreement
(AA) (Trust Fund No. 070521) in the amount of US$ 4.1 million was signed between IDA and
SECO, with a closing date of December 31, 2012. The agreement was subsequently extended to
December 31, 2014. In October 2011, a Grant Agreement (GA) (Trust Fund No. 096573) in the
amount of US$ 4.1 million was signed between IDA and the Republic of Tajikistan, with a closing
date of August 31, 2012. This Trust Fund was used to finance (i) purchase of equipment and (ii)
technical assistance. The closing date of the GA was extended to August 31, 2014. An amount
of US$ 3.81 million was disbursed and the remaining balance of US$ 0.29 million cancelled in
November 2014.


                                                 8
Separately, under a direct financing, SECO provided an amount of US$ 3.90 million for financing
of (i) design, procurement and installation of billing systems in BT and TTG and (ii) provision of
technical assistance, on a parallel financing basis. The direct financing closed on June 30, 2012.
At the time of closing, the fund had disbursed US$ 4.22 million (US$ 2.50 million to BT and
US$ 1.72 million to TTG)1. The components financed by SECO under its direct financing and
through the Trust Fund managed by the Bank are listed under Annex 7

Under the February 2011 restructuring (discussed above in Section 1.3), while there was no change
in the overall project cost, savings of about US$ 3 million under the Gas Component were
reallocated to the Technical Assistance Component to finance the start of work on the Rogun HEP
Assessment Studies. The Restructuring Paper had also indicated that additional financing would
be necessary to enable completion of the Assessment Studies. The amount of the required
additional financing was to be determined after further estimation of the needs.

In February 2012, the Bank’s Board of Directors approved an Additional Financing for the ELRP
in the amount of US$ 18 million (Grant Number H757-TJ), without any change in the PDO. The
Additional Financing was required to: (i) cover the financing gap (US$ 7.5 million) for completing
the assessment studies for the Rogun HEP; (ii) scale up of the metering program in Dushanbe
(US$ 5 million) to enable increased billing and higher revenue collections 2 ; and (iii) finance
preparation of Strategic Studies and Advisory Support (US$ 5.5 million) including (a) a study for
the assessment of the rehabilitation and sediment management measures for the Nurek
Hydropower Plant (HPP); and (b) provision of advisory support needed by the Government for
the preparation of electricity export arrangements such as the CASA 1000 project. The project
closing date was extended to December 31, 2014. The additional financing became effective on
August 31, 2012.

In June 2013, on the request of the Government, the Regional Vice President (RVP) approved a
restructuring to retroactively3 extend the closing dates of the Administration Agreement (AA)
(Trust Fund No. 070521), as amended, which closed on December 31, 2012 and the Grant
Agreement (GA) (Trust Fund No. 096573) which closed on August 31, 2012.

In October 2014, the Country Director (CD) approved a restructuring to enable changes to the
Financing Agreement of the Additional Financing (Grant H757 TJ) for the ELRP to: (i)
retroactively cover the financing gap for the completion of the Rogun HEP Assessment Studies,
(ii) address the needs of the Rogun Implementation Group to procure office and
telecommunications equipment for enhanced coordination on technical studies, (iii) retroactively
cover Incremental Operating Costs such as travel, lodging and per diem costs incurred for

 Figures are as reported by SECO; the difference between the original allocation and the post-completion figures
could be due to exchange rate effects.
2
  Scale up activities also included the distribution system such as replacement of substations, poles, cables and
associated equipment.
3
  Retroactive extension of the closing date of the AA and the GA was done to more closely align with the closing
date of the IDA financing and thus to allow for the utilization of the remaining SECO Grant funds which was critical
for achieving Project related objectives.


                                                         9
participation of Government officials in the technical discussions on the assessment studies; and
(iv) cover training costs for project-related study tours, training courses, seminars, workshops and
other training activities.

For the original IDA credit, at credit closing in December 31, 2012, an amount of US$ 18.11
million had been disbursed and the balance of US$ 0.49 million was cancelled.

For the Additional Financing, which closed on December 31, 2014, an amount of US$ 14.66
million had been disbursed and an amount of US$ 2.59 million4 was cancelled on December 31,
2014.


2 Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Soundness of the Background Analysis. In preparing the ELRP, the Bank benefited from the
information collected and sector knowledge gained from its earlier and ongoing operations and
sector work in Tajikistan. The Bank had been involved in providing technical assistance to the
Government in preparing a development strategy for the energy sector and had carried out an
Energy Utility Reform Review. The Bank had also prepared a Regional Electricity Export
Potential Study in Central Asia. The Bank was able to draw on the considerable informational
database and analysis in these studies as background and complementary material in developing
its analysis for the ELRP. Regarding the analysis specifically for the ELRP, the Bank carried out
extensive assessments of the prevailing situations in BT and TTG in regard to their commercial
and financial operations based on the data that were available at the time. Analytical conclusions
and performance indicators, including baseline values, were established on this assessment and
data. Experience during implementation has shown, however, that there were several
shortcomings in regard to the reliability of the original data which impacted the estimation of the
baseline values and some of the projected performance indicators. Based on the experience, the
performance indicators were updated and modified during project restructurings.

Assessment of the Project Design. The project was consistent with the objectives of the Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) approved by the Board in February 2003.The 2003 CAS had three
priorities: (i) improving services to the people; (ii) building institutions needed for a market
economy; and (iii) fostering Private Sector Development. With its focus on the energy sector,
which was the backbone of the economy, the ELRP contributed to all the three strategic objectives
by helping improve the quality of service delivery and financial viability of the sector utilities, a
necessity for social well-being as well as for private sector development, and by initiating
institutional reforms in the energy sector. The ELRP was also consistent with the 2004 Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Tajikistan and addressed one of the three strategic objectives of the
CPS, namely, to improve the delivery of energy services and exploit the country’s hydropower
potential.

 The amount stated was cancelled as some of the activities under the additional financing could not be completed.
These included the two studies for the Nurek HPP, the contract for the FMIP for Barki Tajik and installation of meters.


                                                         10
Project design followed a pragmatic approach, taking into account (i) the specific situation
prevailing in Tajikistan including the activities of other development institutions (e.g. ADB) that
were providing assistance to the energy sector and (ii) lessons learned from relevant experience in
Tajikistan and also from other countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). The
Bank’s Annual Country Portfolio Performance Reviews (CPPRs) had revealed slow
implementation progress due to procurement delays, counterpart funding issues, and low bidder
response to invitations to bid. Project design included a number of steps to address these issues:
(i) upfront preparation of procurement related documents to ensure that contracts are signed early
in the implementation phase; (ii) maximizing the IDA financing share to the extent possible within
the approved Country Financing parameters; (iii) making procurement packages sufficiently large
to attract bidder interest; and (iv) resorting to local contracting where relevant (e.g. meters
installation). However, in hindsight, the targets set for implementation proved to have been rather
ambitious taking into account the limited exposure and capacity of the two implementing agencies
at that time in project management operations to meet Bank expectations.

With regard to policy issues, the Bank’s experience in some other CIS countries had shown the
difficulty in proceeding with several reform elements concurrently: e.g. financial viability (tariffs
and collections improvement), unbundling and privatization. Particularly, experience had shown
that radical restructuring of a utility before achieving reasonable financial viability and improving
collections could lead to larger problems.

Based on the above, the project design approach taken was that the reforms in Tajikistan should
be sequenced. Taking into account that other lenders (e.g. ADB) were already financing
investments in the electricity generation and transmission sectors, the ELRP chose to focus on
helping the utilities improve their commercial and financial viability by providing the necessary
tools (e.g. metering, billing and collections systems, financial accounting and reporting
improvements) and providing relevant associated technical assistance in these areas. It also
provided technical assistance to the GoT to help monitor and facilitate implementation of the
project.

Government Commitment. Government commitment to the project was substantial as evidenced
by the following actions:
   (i)    With the help of the Bank, the GoT prepared a development strategy for the energy sector.
          Main elements of this strategy were incorporated in a Letter of Energy Sector
          Development Strategy (LESDS) dated March 18, 2005 that the GoT signed as part of the
          preparation of the ELRP (discussed earlier in Section 1.1 above).
   (ii)   During the preparation of the ELRP, the GoT took a number of upfront steps to improve
          the situation in the electricity and gas sectors including (i) starting to gradually increase
          electricity tariffs and increasing gas tariffs to levels close to cost recovery levels, and (ii)
          obtaining agreement from TALCO (aluminum smelter - the largest consumer of
          electricity in Tajikistan) to start paying its bills on time and in full.
   (iii) The GoT has been continuing to implement the agreed measures under the LESDS
         including progressive increases in electricity tariffs; by the end of 2014, the posted tariff
         had been increased by about 240 percent as compared to the (low) baseline level in 2004
         in US Dollar terms. The tariff (in nominal terms) went up from 1.48 Dirham in 2004 to
         15.90 Dirham in 2014 i.e. by 10.7 times. The tariff increase in real terms (i.e. after

                                                   11
         adjusting for the inflation in Tajikistan between 2004 and 2014) is almost 5.0 times the
         initial tariff.
   (iv) The GoT managed to attract Independent Power Producers (670 MW Sangtuda 1 and
        270 MW Sangtuda 2) to develop these valuable hydro power resources.
   (v)   The GoT took actions to improve the payments performance of the aluminum producer
         and other state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to BT.
   (vi) For carrying out of the Assessment Studies for the Rogun HEP, the GoT provided
        facilitating support including the establishment of a dedicated Project Management
        Group for the Rogun studies;
   (vii) The GoT agreed to the Bank joining in the contract negotiations between BT and the
         selected bidders to carry out the Assessment Studies. Prior to that, it also facilitated a
         separate review by the Bank of the contract proposals presented by the various bidders
         and of the evaluation reports prepared by BT.
   (viii) The GoT also set up a dedicated working group led by the First Deputy Minister of
          Energy to prepare the regional CASA-1000 project which aims at connecting the energy
          surplus Central Asia Region with the energy deficit South Asia region (Afghanistan and
          Pakistan). The action helped in concluding the price and commercial discussions for this
          project in April 2015 and attract sizable investment. The CASA project, which was
          approved by the Board on March 27, 2014, will upon its completion generate a sizable
          revenue stream for Tajikistan’s energy sector thus helping towards achievement of one
          of the ELRP’s development objectives i.e. laying the foundation for improvement of the
          financial viability of BT.

Participatory Approach. For the original project, the Bank participated along with the IMF and
the ADB (at the time the IFI with the largest financial commitment in Tajikistan’s energy sector)
in helping the GoT prepare the development strategy for the energy sector. As regards project
financing, the Swiss Government’s SECO joined as a co-financing partner in the ELRP. For
monitoring and evaluation, the Bank expected to work closely with the IMF since it was agreed
that the focus on energy sector reforms would be a joint responsibility in view of the high level of
Quasi-Fiscal Deficits (QFDs) in the energy sector.

For the Assessment Studies of the Rogun HEP, as described in Section 2.2 below, the Bank was
instrumental in increasing the level of participation and constructive cooperation from a variety of
stakeholders, both in Tajikistan and in the riparian states, including Afghanistan, Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyz Republic, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. The stakeholders included the Governments,
civil society groups, academicians and development partners working in the region. To support
consultations among riparian countries and with civil society the Bank mobilized support from the
multi-donor Central Asia Water and Energy Development Program (CAEWDP). By introducing
an evidence-based approach to decisions on the proposed Rogun HEP, the Bank also helped
address concerns of riparians that arose when construction of the unfinished Rogun HEP resumed
in 2009. Participation of project-affected peoples in local communities also increased as a result
of the environmental and social standards introduced by the ESIA.

Risk assessment. In general, with one exception as discussed below, the risks associated with the
project and the measures to mitigate them were adequately identified at project appraisal. The

                                                12
overall risk rating for the project was High. The main areas of high risk were correctly identified
as (i) timely implementation of adequate electricity tariff adjustments, (ii) timely and adequate
payments of their dues by TALCO, other State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and budget
organizations, and (iii) procurement/contracting risks. Despite actions pursued with the GoT and
the implementing agencies (BT and TTG) by the Bank during supervision and implementation
support missions, progress in all these areas was slower than targeted, mainly due to considerable
weaknesses in overall financial management of the SOE sector that was exacerbated by capacity
constraints and political economy conditions.

Under the February 2011 restructuring and the February 2012 Additional Financing, the overall
risk rating was High. The main risks were well identified and included the following:
   Riparian concerns about the Assessment studies process could exacerbate regional tensions,
    impede or delay the studies, posing a reputational risk for the Bank and to regional stability
    more broadly;
   Non-acceptance of the recommendations of the consultants or PoEs could negatively impact
    the credibility of the process and force the withdrawal of the Bank;
   GoT may not comply with the covenants agreed as part of the ELRP restructuring related to
    river diversion and resettlement;
   Lack of transparency and weak oversight create a high risk of corruption;
   Fiduciary systems and control mechanisms are weak;
   Unfavorable global shifts may reduce remittances and increase energy and food prices;
   Inability of the GoT to manage the Assessment Studies within the budget and time;
   Governance related risks affecting procurement and financial management.

The risk mitigation measures for these risks were well considered and proved effective given the
successful outcome of the studies.

Risks relating to the Rogun Assessment Studies and mitigation measures had been anticipated in
the RVP’s September 2010 letter to the heads of riparian governments and the President of
Tajikistan. Additional mitigation measures were agreed with the Government of Tajikistan prior
to the declaration of effectiveness to assure stakeholders in Tajikistan and the region that the
Government of Tajikistan was committed to follow international standards throughout the
assessment process. The Government fully adhered to all measures, which contributed to the
successful completion of the studies in August 2014.

Overall, in retrospect, one risk that was not foreseen at appraisal was that related to the continued
availability of adequate quantities of gas based on imports. The stoppage of gas imports starting
from the end of 2012 was due to reasons beyond the control of the project implementing agencies.
Although gas imports had stopped, discussions between the two parties (Tajikistan and
Uzbekistan) were still continuing. The Bank decided therefore not to proceed with a restructuring
of this component pending a possible resolution of the situation. However, given that the stoppage
of gas imports was adversely affecting the electricity sector by creating an overload on the network,



                                                13
particularly in the winter months, the Bank initiated studies that identified measures to help BT to
cope better with the issues resulting from the increased demand placed on the system.

2.2 Implementation

The project was approved by the Bank’s Board in June 2005. The IDA credit became effective in
December 2005. The February 2011 restructuring of the project occurred after a delay of several
months pending the putting in place of the detailed processes outlined earlier in Section 1.3. During
this period the Inspection Panel received a request from an environmental interest group in
Uzbekistan that raised concerns regarding the downstream impacts of the construction, operation,
and possible failure of the proposed Rogun project. The Inspection Panel decided not to pursue
the case, noting that the Bank was not financing construction of a project, but examining many of
the exact concerns raised by the applicants.       The Inspection Panel also observed that Bank
Management had integrated feedback from riparian states during consultations into the Terms of
Reference (ToRs) for the studies.

The Additional Financing grant was approved in February 2012 and became effective in August
2012. The Government requested an extension of the effectiveness deadline in order to meet the
specified conditions of effectiveness, including additional measures to mitigate risks. The Project
Appraisal Document (PAD) had identified SECO as a co-financier for the project; the
Administration Agreement between SECO and the Bank was signed in April 2007 (para 1.7). The
SECO grant was signed between the GoT and the World Bank on July 25, 2013 and became
effective on August 31 2013. A separate Mid-Term Review (MTR) for the project was not
undertaken given that detailed project reviews were undertaken for project’s restructuring and
additional financing in 2011 and 2012.

During the implementation period, major changes took place with regard to TTG’s status and
operations which impacted on the progress of the gas component. As a result of organizational
changes to bring greater efficiency, Tajik Gas (the original beneficiary) was restructured in 2009
and the new company was named Tajiktransgas (TTG). The main function assigned to TTG was
the operation of the Southern and Northern gas transmission systems. The gas distribution
pipelines were transferred to thirteen local distribution companies. In addition to the distribution
companies, TTG also supplied gas to large industrial consumers – TALCO, Tajik Cement, the
Dushanbe Combined Heating Plant (CHP), and the fertilizer plant. Also, some automobile gas
filling stations were connected directly to TTG’s transmission system. However, at the end of
2012, gas imports from Uzbekistan virtually stopped. Since then, TTG had to face significant
challenges and its operations were severely affected5..

The force majeure change in the gas component also impacted indirectly on the electricity
component. Customers partially substituted electricity for gas, contributing thereby to an overload
on the electricity supply system. The situation exacerbated the winter energy deficit as customers
relied more heavily on electricity for heating, which could not fully compensate the unavailability
of gas supplies.



5
    As a result, it has been difficult to measure and compare the gas related targets under the project since 2012


                                                            14
Electricity Component

Supply and installation of meters: The implementation of the meter installation activities under
the original project was completed by December 2011 as compared to the (rather ambitious)
anticipated target of December 2008. Delays in implementation in the early years of project were
due to (i) the initial difficulties of the implementing agency (BT) in timely and adequate execution
of procurement related actions, e.g. bid documents, bid evaluation, contract negotiation and
signing, etc. and (ii) installation related problems, including weaknesses in the capacities of the
selected contractors. The project financed the services of a Procurement Specialist to help BT
with procurement implementation which progressively helped in improving the preparation and
execution times. To speed up installation, BT undertook some of the installation work through its
own staff.

Design, installation and implementation of billing and collection system: The implementation
of this component was supported under direct financing from the Swiss grant. The selected system
was SAP based. Although the installation work and the Dushanbe related data transfer under this
component was completed, it had only been partially implemented when the Swiss direct financing
closed in 2012. Following the closure of the SECO direct financing, the Bank made efforts to help
BT make the SAP system operational. Specifically, the Bank helped to develop terms of reference
(TORs) for a consultancy aimed at evaluating the residual volume of works and preparing bidding
documents for them. Also, to ensure the compatibility with a billing system that was planned under
an EBRD supported project in the Sugd region, the Bank agreed with EBRD to include the above
mentioned TORs in the contract with a consultant selected to work on the billing systems selected
for the Sugd project. Subsequently, it turned out that the consultant was not sufficiently qualified
to work with the BT SAP billing system, and the Bank advised BT to hire certified SAP experts.
They estimated that the costs for making the system operational, tailoring it to BT needs and
training BT staff would be about US$ 1.5 million (without taking into account the costs of license
updates and new licenses), and would take 12 months for completion. Because of the high costs
associated with completing the SAP system, the Bank recommended that BT should take stock of
the billing systems already in use at BT branches with a view to developing a cost-effective billing
systems solution for the company. To this end, BT hired a consultant that recommended to tender
out supply and installation of a commercial management system (which besides billing also
includes other critical commercial functions), in order to obtain a cost-effective, but also
comprehensive solution. The Bank is likely to keep supporting BT in this area under the proposed
WEP.

Technical assistance: The PMG benefited from the services of (i) Procurement Specialists and
(ii) consultants to help BT with the design and implementation of the FMIP; this included local
consulting firms as well as the services of an international consultant, funded by IDA under the
project. Engagement of procurement specialists helped to achieve more timely preparation and
completion of procurement activities. The FM system specialists helped to strengthen the PMG’s
financial management and reporting capabilities. Consultants assisting with the development and
implementation of the FMIP helped BT to substantially achieve most targets by project completion
although the rate of progress was slower than envisaged for the reasons indicated in the following
section. Consultants were also engaged through the Swiss grant to assist the PMG in project
engineering, management and supervision (PEMS) and (ii) design, procurement, installation and
commissioning of a billing system. For the reasons discussed in the preceding section, the


                                                15
technical assistance in relation to the billing system was less effective than envisaged. At project
completion, work had been initiated on the preparation of the Rehabilitation and Dam Safety and
Sedimentation Studies for the Nurek HPP. These two studies were contracted in August and
November 2014 respectively and are targeted for completion in 2015. Consultancy support was
provided to the Ministry of Energy and BT that aimed (i) to increase public understanding of the
energy sector and the significant challenges it faces, and (ii) inform the public on BT’s
accomplishments, as well as on-going and planned activities to improve performance, recover the
consumers’ trust, and the public image of the company, aimed at gaining public support for future
reforms, including required tariff increases.

Financial Management Improvement Program (FMIP): Preparation and implementation of the
FMIP was an ongoing process through most of the project implementation period. By the closing
date (December 31, 2014), a large number of the identified actions had been carried out, but some
items could not be completed as indicated below.

BT submitted a Financial Management Action Plan in June 2009. However, implementation of
the FMIP was affected at various times by (i) staffing issues in BT (absence of a FMIP coordinator,
turnover of trained staff), and turnover of key staff in the local consultancy firm; and (ii) prolonged
absence of the selected international consultant due to payment disputes (in regard to tax liabilities)
with BT. Also, the extent of the work was large and challenging given that BT’s operations were
spread over the country with about thirty subsidiaries and branches.

With the help of the technical assistance under the project, substantial progress was achieved in
regard to improving BT’s financial management related capabilities. BT contracted a regional
consulting company to provide training in accounting and financial reporting to a large number of
its staff engaged in these activities. Bank FMSs have confirmed that BT is proceeding well with
the transition to IFRS based accounting and reporting. It has also set up the recommended 1C
based accounting systems and has made progress in addressing issues that had been identified in
audit reports.

Gas Component

Supply and installation of meters: This sub-component was largely completed by 2011. Overall,
implementation was seriously affected by the stoppage of gas imports from Uzbekistan at the end
of 2012.

Supply and installation of laboratories for gas meter calibration, testing and quality control:
Two sets of testing equipment for calibration were delivered; one was installed at Tajikstandart
and the other was installed in the existing laboratory in Dushanbegaz. TTG decided not to purchase
the testing equipment (chromatographs) which would determine the quality of gas.

Design, installation and implementation of billing and collection system: This sub-component
was largely completed by TTG through direct financing under the Swiss grant. The billing systems
were supplied and installed under the contract and had started to be operationalized. Given the
unavailability of gas in the TTG’s network the billing system is not being fully utilized.




                                                  16
Technical assistance: As in the case of BT, TTG’s PMG benefited from the services of (i)
Procurement Specialists and (ii) consultants to help BT with the design and implementation of the
FMIP; this included local consulting firms as well as the services of an international consultant,
funded by IDA under the project. Engagement of procurement specialists helped to achieve more
timely preparation and completion of procurement activities. The FM system specialists helped
to strengthen the PMG’s financial management and reporting capabilities. Consultants assisting
with the development and implementation of the FMIP helped TTG to substantially achieve most
FMIP-related targets by project completion. Consultants were also engaged through the Swiss
grant to assist the PMG in project engineering, management and supervision (PEMS) and (ii)
design, procurement, installation and commissioning of a billing system. TTG’s billing system
was successfully installed and was being operationalized but progress after 2012 was affected by
the serious change in TTG”s operating circumstances.

Financial Management Improvement Program: With the help of the technical assistance
provided under the project, TTG had achieved most of the targets under the FMIP. Assessments
have confirmed that TTG had completed the transition to the International Financial Reporting
System (IFRS) and had started producing statements in accordance with IFRS reporting
requirements. TTG also completed maintenance of the financial management system according
to IFRS utilizing the prescribed 1C software. The study for valuation of fixed assets recommended
by the auditors following the 2010 audit was completed. TTG also completed the 2011 and 2012
entity and project audits. Implementation of the FMIP was progressing well until 2012 but was
affected thereafter by the stoppage of gas imports in 2012.

Government Component

Viability assessment for the Rogun HEP. The Assessment Studies (TEAS and ESIA) were
successfully completed by August 2014 despite the several significant challenges and risks faced
during the preparation, including those stemming from the political complexity of the issue. The
Bank’s involvement in the entire process was crucial and it is unlikely that the successful
completion of the studies would have been possible without close Bank engagement, additional
activities undertaken by the Bank, and adherence by the Government of Tajikistan to high
international standards. There was acknowledgement from several key stakeholders in regard to
the high quality of the studies and that the preparation process had met the expected international
standards of best practice. Key milestones in the preparation and review process are given in
Annex 6.

The comprehensive approach and process put in place by the Bank and the Government were key
factors in the completion of the studies in accordance with best practice standards and to the
satisfaction of the principal stakeholders. Nevertheless, some significant challenges arose that
were not entirely foreseen initially. These included the full extent and complexity of the issues
to be addressed, and the resources (monetary and staff) that would need to be committed, keeping
in mind (i) the importance of the studies for the GoT, local communities, riparian states, as an
element influencing international relations in the region, and (ii) the reputational risk involved for
the Bank. The ToR initially provided were later assessed to require further elaboration following
consultations with riparian governments and civil society organizations. To ensure high quality
independent reviews of the quality of the work to be undertaken by the consultants carrying out
the study, the Bank established two independent Panels of Experts (PoEs) to deal with the TEAS


                                                 17
and ESIA respectively. During preparation, key steps in the process were preceded and followed
by extensive discussions among principal stakeholders, including the riparian states that could
potentially be affected by the Rogun HEP. This included the finalization of the terms of reference
(ToR) for the consultants who carried out the studies. The international competitive bidding (ICB)
process for selection of the consultants for the two studies was closely supervised by the Bank.
The Bank team participated as observers in the contract negotiations between BT and the selected
consultants. Contracts were placed in February-March 2011 and inception reports delivered in
May 2011. The inception report was discussed at a meeting of the riparian states in May 2011 in
Almaty. In total, between 2011and 2014, five joint consultative meetings were held with the
principal stakeholders, which received support from the Central Asia Water and Energy
Development Program (CAEWDP). As work progressed, additional issues were discovered, e.g.
geological and geotechnical, that needed further discussions and amendments to the work of the
consultants. These aspects also raised challenges for the timely completion of the work and
additional cost, e.g. (i) timely provision of the required decisions and additional information
requested by the consultants from the concerned GoT agencies, (ii) resulting expansion of the work
of the consultants, (iii) timely amendments to the consultants’ contracts, and (iv) additional funds
required to finance completion of the work. Progress was also affected for some time by changes
taking place in some of the key government ministries. However, these issues were progressively
resolved through sustained proactive commitment by the Bank and GoT. Additional funding
required for the two studies was provided through the Additional Financing credit. At completion,
the final estimated cost of the studies was about US$ 10.7 million as against the initial allocation
of about US$ 3.0 million under the project at the time of restructuring in February 2011.

To ensure highest quality and inclusiveness of the process and considering the political sensitivity
of the proposed project, the Bank also undertook the following additional measures:
     Regular consultations with highest level of the governments in all five riparian countries,
        recognizing the regional nature of the engagement and ensuring that all views were taken
        into account. Convening a first of its kind meeting of First Deputy Prime Ministers of five
        countries immediately after the final riparian consultations to discuss findings and potential
        ways forward at the highest political level, help diffuse potential tensions, and highlight
        international experiences in regard to cooperative water management
     Regular consultations with key diplomatic partners in the framework of the Informal
        Contact Group of Partners on Water and Energy Issues in Central Asia to foster
        coordinated messages from the international community regarding water and energy
        management and promote continued regional dialogue
     Issuance of a separate World Bank Note on Rogun summarizing the key findings of the
        assessment studies and identifying additional issues for consideration. These relate to
        domestic reforms in the energy sector and public finance management, the importance of
        regional dialogue, and the potential for a cooperative mode of operation that could benefit
        both upstream and downstream countries.
     Monitoring of construction site and budget expenditures to ensure that no new construction
        would take place until the studies were completed and publicly consulted with riparian
        countries, as described in para 2.3 below. Similarly, monitoring of resettlement activities
        initiated before the studies, to ensure consistency with international good practice to the
        benefit of affected communities, as described in section 3.6 below.




                                                 18
Other Technical assistance: Consultants, funded under the IDA credit, were engaged to carry out
the preparation of the TEAS and the ESIA (as discussed above). Consultants were also engaged
to provide advisory services pertaining to financial, legal and technical matters for the
development of new hydroelectric projects and new transmission projects aimed at electricity
exports. In addition, legal and commercial advisors were retained by the Government to assist it
in review and negotiations relating to CASA-1000. Given the four country negotiations, the deal
required prolonged deliberations and patient discussions among the parties. However, the result
has been positive as the principles of the deal and the prices were finalized at the Inter-
Governmental Council meeting of the four CASA countries in December 2014. The fees of the
advisors for the remaining preparatory work are being funded under a trust fund through the
CAEWDP6. To help the GoT to refine its social assistance policy, the Bank provided advice and
support through analytical work and studies including Delivering Social Assistance to the Poorest
Households (2011); Poverty Assessment (2009); and Assessment of Household Energy
Deprivation in Tajikistan (2014). These are expected to contribute to further development of the
GoT’s social assistance policy, including in regard to aspects related to the energy sector.

Project Management

Project management was rated as Moderately Satisfactory over most of the implementation period.
Initially project implementation was assigned to the Technical Support Group (TSG) in the
Ministry of Finance but after three months it was transferred to the respective Project Management
Groups (PMGs) which had been established in BT and TTG. The project provided for technical
assistance through the services of procurement, financial management, and legal specialists to
support the PMGs. Implementation progress at both BT and TTG was initially affected by
procurement delays as a result of the relative lack of experience of the PMGs with Bank procedures.
With the assistance of Procurement Specialists funded under the project, these issues were
progressively resolved by 2010. However, from time to time, personnel issues (e.g. absence of
coordinators, turnover of trained personnel) continued to affect the capacity of the PMGs. The
inadequate pool of skilled persons in the country created challenges for the management of these
entities in selecting appropriate replacements. For the BT PMG, which was also responsible for
implementing the work for the Rogun Assessment Studies, the project management capacities
were stretched until reinforcements could be provided through additional technical assistance.
Financial management was an issue for a substantial part of the implementation period,
particularly for BT, due to (i) delayed audit reports, particularly entity audits (ii) insufficient
progress in addressing issues agreed to be resolved under the FMIPs, (iii) deficiencies in the
periodic financial management reporting, (iv) quantum of work involved due to dispersed
subsidiaries, and (v) turnover of trained staff. Although the quality of progress reporting and
Financial Management Reports (FMRs) improved over time, there were still deficiencies in
reporting and in timely submission. The Bank intends to continue to support improvements in
these areas either through the proposed WEP or other initiatives.

The Project Development Objectives (PDO) ratings were as follows: Satisfactory up to 2010;
modified to Moderately Satisfactory in June 2011; modified to Moderately Unsatisfactory in April
2014; and modified to Moderately Satisfactory in December 2014. The Implementation Progress
(IP) ratings were as follows: Satisfactory up to December 2009; modified to Moderately
Satisfactory in July 2010 reflecting issues in procurement and financial management; modified to
Moderately Unsatisfactory in April 2014; and modified to Moderately Satisfactory in December
2014. The downgrading of the PDO and IP ratings to MU in April 2014 was conservative and
largely influenced by the delays in completion of the metering program, billing system, and FMIP
sub-components under the electricity component as well as delays towards contracting of the
consultants for studies for the Nurek HPP. At that time, the Rogun Assessment Studies had not
been completed and therefore were not fully reflected in the ratings. The upgrading to MS in the
final ISR (December 2014) seems appropriate in view of the facts that (i) the PDO have been
achieved or substantially achieved for all the components (including the gas component up to 2012
when TG’s operations were affected by factors beyond its control); (ii) there was significant
progress made by BT towards completing the lagging components; and (iii) the highly satisfactory
completion of the Assessment Studies. The weighted average scoring for the components under
the original project and those added under the Additional Financing supports the MS ratings.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The rating for M&E was Moderately Satisfactory over most of the implementation period.

M&E design: The monitoring indicators selected at project appraisal were relevant to the
achievement of the Project Development Objectives. However, during implementation, it was
found that they did not specifically cover some important aspects of the project outputs and
outcomes. Thus, a new indicator Electricity Billed in Dushanbe was added under the Additional
Financing. Under the Additional Financing, the original baselines set for some indicators
(reduction in unaccounted for losses, collections in cash against billed amounts) were considered
to be questionable because they were based on measurement through equipment at the start of the
project that was of lower efficiency than the later replacements under the project. The targets were
revised accordingly. Also, the indicator in regard to Contribution to Investment was dropped for
both BT and TTG and a new indicator Short-Term Cost Recovery was added for BT as a covenant
under the Project Agreement.

M&E implementation: As indicated above, some modifications were required to be made to the
M&E indicators. With the changes, both the quality and timeliness of the data collection and
reporting improved. The implementing agencies (BT and TTG) provided quarterly progress
reports. (In the case of TTG, M&E functions and progress reporting progressively declined after
the stoppage of gas imports in 2012). Initially, there were substantial weaknesses both in the
timeliness and quality of the reporting. With the feedback and advice of the supervision team,
both the quality and the timeliness of reporting improved over time though some weaknesses
remained at project closing. This included the completeness and consistency of information
reported in regard to cumulated project costs and financing. In relation to the studies for the Rogun
HEP, a detailed schedule for implementation was prepared. Both BT and GoT’s PMG for the
construction of energy facilities monitored the deliverables from the two consultants who were
responsible for providing detailed progress reports. The Bank’s involvement helped ensure that
the reports of the studies were timely delivered and the process for finalization of the reports was


                                                 20
efficiently managed. The consultation process was effectively completed, which included five
meetings and involved active participation of principal stakeholders including the GoT, riparian
states, consultants, PoEs and the Bank.

During the Rogun Assessment studies, an additional monitoring mechanism was introduced at the
Rogun site to assure stakeholders that no new construction would take place until the studies were
completed and publicly consulted in riparian countries. The mechanism included agreement
between the GoT and Bank on a schedule of acceptable safety measures and expenditures that
were summarized in monthly reports by the implementing agencies and monitored through on-site
inspection by Bank experts. The Government fully adhered to the agreed schedule of works
throughout the duration of the studies.

M&E utilization: Data on procurement planning and execution was used to follow the progress
of the project and address issues in regard to implementation. Reporting on the performance
indicators was used during project supervision to identify issues and discuss remedial actions.
Cost savings identified in different components were reallocated to other essential items. To help
BT deal with its difficulties in reducing electricity losses caused by the overload resulting from
the consumers’ switch from gas to electricity after the stoppage of gas imports in 2012, the Bank
assisted with the preparation of studies to identify and develop ways of improving the situation,
particularly in the winter season. Information from the M&E system in regard to indicators, such
as short term cost recovery for BT, was used to monitor compliance with covenants.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

(a) Safeguard Compliance

The rating for Safeguards was Satisfactory over the project implementation period. The Recipient
and the implementing agencies were in compliance with the agreed safeguard policies both under
the original Grant and the Additional Financing. Originally, the project was given an
environmental category B (Limited Assessment) as it was assessed to have only a limited impact
on the environment. The original project did not involve significant civil works; and the main
activities were installation of electricity and gas meters, and supporting materials. Because no
new installations were carried out, the main impacts were largely temporary, localized and
restricted to the sites of the existing energy infrastructure.

Under the Additional Financing, the environmental category was changed to A to reflect the
potential impacts of the proposed Rogun HEP for which the Assessment Studies were being
undertaken under the project. The IDA credit and Additional Financing grant, and the SECO grant
did not fund any construction related activities under the project.

(b) Fiduciary Compliance

Financial Management. The rating for Financial Management was downgraded to Moderately
Unsatisfactory starting in 2010 but was upgraded to Moderately Satisfactory in 2014 reflecting the
substantial progress made in implementing the FMIPs. As indicated above, initially there were
delays by BT, and to a lesser extent, TTG, in submission of project audit reports. Further, there
were deficiencies in the quality and timeliness of financial management reporting to the Bank.


                                               21
Support for institutional strengthening and training to the relevant financial management staff in
BT and TTG was provided under the project. With regard to the FMIPs, as indicated earlier in
Section 2.2, after early delays, there were progressive and significant improvements. The technical
qualities of the financial statements of the two entities have progressively improved.

Procurement. The ratings for Procurement were Moderately Satisfactory over most of the
implementation period. Procurement under the project was done in accordance with the Bank’s
Procurement and Consultant Guidelines and Standard Bidding Documents were used. For the
Swiss grant that provided direct financing, procurement was tied to Swiss sources. There were
some delays in procurement as discussed above (under Section 2.2) which were progressively
resolved with the help of technical assistance provided under the project.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

For BT, although most of the planned activities were completed by the closing date, some
remained to be completed. These include: (i) completion of meters installation; (ii) commissioning
of the billing system and (iii) some FMIP-related activities (valuation of assets and assessment of
receivables and payables). BT is at present attempting to complete these activities from its own
resources but funding gaps may emerge. BT has requested the Bank to provide financial and
advisory support under the WEP-PPA. Under the proposed WEP which is currently planned for
Fiscal Year 2017, the Bank intends to continue to provide financial and technical assistance
support to BT to enable it to consolidate the progress made under the ELRP, and to further
strengthen its technical and commercial operations.

With regard to further progress in achieving the financial viability of BT in a socially responsible
manner, this issue is now being pursued by all the active donors to Tajikistan though the Donor
Coordination Council (DCC). The GoT has been approving increases in BT’s tariffs at regular
intervals and the Bank plans to continue to follow up on progress, and provide support as needed
for strengthening the tariff policy, taking into account social impact concerns, through the WEP.

BT and GoT will also benefit from the several initiatives, including studies and advisory services,
supported by the Bank and other IFIs to assist the GoT in the further development of the sector.
Important studies and analysis have been carried out, including an energy efficiency audit of
TALCO, the largest electricity consumer, and others under the Central Asia Energy Water
Development Program (CAEWDP). These include: (i) Tajikistan’s Winter Energy Crisis: Supply
and Demand Alternatives (November 2012) and (ii) Assessment of Household Energy Deprivation
in Tajikistan (June 2014). A study on Tajikistan: Long Term Sustainable Energy Sector Strategy
& Continuing Role of CAEDWP is in process (Draft report, December 2014). These studies
provide a good foundation for the Bank’s and other IFI’s continued dialogue with the GoT with
regard to securing further improvements in the energy sector. Some important points emerging
from the studies are: (i) electricity tariffs in Tajikistan are among the lowest in the region7; (ii)
estimates of the marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) show that the MWTP in Tajikistan is about


7
  Electricity tariff levels for consumption levels below 75 units as well as for levels higher than 75 units are much
higher in some other countries with GDP per capita levels comparable to Tajikistan e.g Tanzania and Nepal. In the
year 2007, the household consumer tariff in Tajikistan was one third of the tariff that prevailed in Afghanistan.


                                                        22
USc 7 per kWh in 2011 prices (as compared to the prevailing average tariff of USc 2.04 per kWh
in 2014) and there is substantial room therefore for further increases in electricity tariffs; and (iii)
the GoT’s subsidy schemes need to be better targeted to assist the poor households – the present
tariffs provide an across-the-board subsidy to electricity consumers regardless of actual need on
affordability grounds.

For TTG, a return to financial viability will depend upon its return to normal operations if and
when the current situation in regard to gas imports is resolved. The GoT has been pursuing some
options including expanding the gas exploration activities in Tajikistan. As part of the WEP the
Bank will agree with the Government on a strategy for safeguarding and maintaining the gas assets
procured under the Project.

With regard to the Rogun studies, the Assessment Studies provide the GoT with a wide range of
actions to be taken towards completing the process before it decides to proceed with the
construction of the Rogun HPP. The two PoEs closely followed the studies as they progressed,
scrutinized the consultants’ recommendations and emphasized that the recommendations of the
consultants need to be followed during the next stages of the project. The Bank brought together
a separate report which included the key findings of the assessment studies and identified
additional issues for consideration. These relate to domestic reforms in the energy sector and
public finance management that are consistent with the Bank’s on-going dialogue in Tajikistan,
and to the importance of regional dialogue for a successful project. In addition, the report
suggested that GoT may wish to explore a cooperative mode of operation that could generate
additional mutual benefits for both upstream and downstream countries. Together with the results
of the studies carried out by the Borrower’s consultants, the reports of the two PoEs as well as the
Bank’s report were shared with the GoT and principal stakeholders, and publicly disclosed.


3 Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Rating: Substantial

The relevance of the objectives is rated as Substantial. Both the original PDO and the revised
PDO were clear and focused on outcomes for which the operation could be held accountable given
its duration, resources and approach.

Original Project: The objectives of the original project were clear, realistic and relevant in terms
of Tajikistan’s development plans and priorities for the energy sector. The objectives were
consistent with the CAS in effect at the time of appraisal and remain consistent with the Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) for the period FY2015-FY2018.

Under the current CPS (FY2015-FY2018) approved by the Bank’s Board in June 2014, the
strategic goal is to help reduce extreme poverty and promote shared prosperity by expanding
opportunities for the private sector and excluded groups, thus supporting transition to a new growth
model. CPS support would be provided through targeted interventions organized around three
broad areas of engagement or pillars, as follows:


                                                  23
       Strengthen the role of the private sector. The objective is to create enabling conditions to
        expand micro, small and medium-sized enterprises and thereby create jobs. Joint IDA-IFC
        work will reduce transaction costs for business, increase access to finance, and increase the
        reliability of electricity supply. Growth opportunities will be targeted in agribusiness and
        improvements in the regulatory environment for mining. ;
       Social inclusion. The objective is to improve delivery of basic social services (social
        protection, water and sanitation, primary health care), while expanding access to higher
        education for youth from poor families, and to land rights for women, thus increasing
        opportunities for productive employment.
       Regional connectivity. The objective is to expand access to regional markets and global
        information and knowledge through infrastructure improvements (including
        telecommunications), thus diversifying economic opportunities.
The design and implementation of the original project were relevant in terms of Tajikistan’s
development priorities and priorities for the energy sector. The project components were well-
considered and relevant to meet the stated PDO. The technical assistance provided was relevant
for institutional strengthening of the implementing agencies and helping them with the execution
of the project. Implementation was also relevant although, for the reasons explained earlier in
Section 2.2, not all the envisaged results could be obtained by the closing date of the IDA
credits.
Revised project: The objectives of the revised project were also clear, realistic and relevant in
terms of Tajikistan’s development plans and priorities for the energy sector, and remain
consistent with the current CPS (FY2015-2018). Hydroelectric resources are a major energy
asset in Tajikistan and their proper development is a matter of high priority under the national
development strategy for the energy sector. A proper, well-considered assessment of the Rogun
HEP is therefore of high relevance in the context of the national priorities.
The design of the assessment studies provided for a careful, step-by-step process, involving
consultations at various stages between the principal stakeholders. The structure and contents of
the TEAS and ESIA were the outcome of detailed deliberations, including evaluations by the
POEs. Particular attention was paid to safeguard issues, including possible resettlement impacts
and policies.
The implementation of the assessment studies followed a detailed, structure process as described
earlier in Section 2.2.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Rating: Substantial

The Project Development Objectives (PDO) were to: (i) assist in reducing the commercial losses
in the electricity and gas systems, and to lay the foundation for the improvement of the financial
viability of the electricity and gas utilities in a socially responsible manner; as well as (ii) to assist
in the viability assessment of the Rogun HEP.

Note: For unaccounted for electricity in Dushanbe, during implementation, the baseline values were found to be based
on unreliable information. The Additional Financing provided revised values of the targets for the indicators.



The efficacy of the project is rated as substantial based on substantial efficacy for the electricity
component, modest efficacy for the gas component, and high efficacy for the Rogun technical
assistance component.

Regarding the objective of laying the foundation for the improvement of the financial viability of
the electricity and gas utilities in a socially responsible manner, as seen from the outcome
indicators presented above, the PDO were partially achieved.

 For BT, as indicated in Section 1.3 above, the baseline indicators regarding reduction in accounted
for electricity estimated at appraisal were found to have been based on unreliable data. The
indicators were therefore re-set under the February 2011 restructuring and a new indicator
(increase in billed sales volume for Dushanbe) was introduced. In addition, due to difficulties in
reliable estimation of the contribution to investment indicator set at appraisal, this indicator and


                                                        26
the related financial covenant were dropped, and two new covenants included that called for the
GoT to (i) take all necessary actions, including increases in tariffs, to enable BT to reach short-
term cost recovery for 2013 onwards, and (ii) ensure full payments by budget entities for electricity
purchases. Neither covenant was consistently met, but BT and GoT have been taking some
measures to achieve compliance. This includes a GoT decree that imposes restrictions on non-
monetary payments for electricity, cancelling a portion of BT’s tax arears, and reducing BT
payables and receivables through offsetting schemes. BT’s tariffs were also increased in mid-2014
by about 15 percent with an increase in the TALCO tariff by about 57 percent. These steps enabled
BT to improve its cash collections to about 75 percent in 2014.

Based on these revised indicators, BT substantially achieved meeting the targets: (i) reduction in
commercial losses – 83 percent of the target; (ii) posted tariff – 85 percent of the target; (iii)
collection in cash as percentage of billed consumption in Dushanbe – 84 percent of the target; and
(iv) increase in billed electricity sales in Dushanbe – 120 percent of the target. Regarding reduction
in unaccounted for electricity, BT was able to achieve improvements until the end of 2012.
Thereafter, new factors such as the stoppage of gas imports from Uzbekistan (which accounted for
over 90 percent of gas supply in Tajikistan) led to electricity consumers switching from gas to
electricity. This led to an overload on the electricity system which increased the electricity losses.
Electricity consumption in winter went up significantly because of the lack of gas heating and the
continued deterioration of district heating facilities. At project closing, the electricity losses were
around 17.5 percent against the target of 14.5 percent. Nevertheless, the significant improvements
achieved through the metering and the billing systems, when they become fully operational, are
expected to enable BT to revert to achieving further reductions in commercial losses.

The project provided for important actions towards reaching eventual financial viability. BT
improved its cash collection performance and its short term cost recovery levels although it has
not achieved full cost recovery. The GoT continued to increase the posted tariffs at intervals, but
the levels remained below cost-recovery levels due to the GoT’s concerns with the social impact
on households. Overall, although the targets were not fully achieved, the actions taken under the
project, including the design and implementation of the FMIP, are expected to assist BT to reach
financial viability sooner than would otherwise have been the case.

Implementation of the measures to improve BT’s financial viability was carried out in a socially
responsible manner. Both the GoT and the Bank were mindful of the social impacts of the
measures, including the increases in BT’s electricity sales tariffs. The Bank initially focused on
adequate protection for the customers in the Gorno-Badakshan Autonomous Oblast (GBAO)
region which is the poorest region in Tajikistan. Under an earlier project, a grant of US$ 5 million
was obtained from SECO and administered by the Bank. The grant was used for subsidizing
electricity payments by poor customers in the GBAO region through a life-line subsidy. The
affordability implications for low-income customers were also kept in mind under targeted studies
by the Bank8. An important finding was that, in 2014, expenditures on electricity by the poorest

 The studies included the Tajikistan’s Winter Energy Crisis Studies (November 2012) and Assessment of Household
Energy Deprivation in Tajikistan (June 2014)



                                                      27
10 percent quartile in Tajikistan was below 5 percent of household expenditures even in the heating
season when the demand for electricity is much more except for Dushanbe where it was about 9
percent. Another important finding was that the marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) in Tajikistan
was about USc 7 per kWh in 2011 prices which is substantially higher than the average tariff of
USc 2.04 per kWh prevailing in 2014, indicating a willingness by households to pay higher prices
for reliable and sufficient electricity services. The Bank team has decided to focus on finding
solutions to meet the social obligations through developing economic solutions for energy
requirements of rural areas during the winter season9. The Bank is also engaged in a dialogue with
the GoT on the provision of targeted subsidies.

For TTG, significant progress was being made in meeting the outcome indicators until the end of
2012. Thus, as of 2010, TTG had reduced the ratio of unaccounted for gas from 25 percent in
2004 to 10.3 percent in 2010 (the target for 2010 was 6 percent). For 2010, TTG exceeded (104%)
the target with regard to collections in cash from billed sales by successfully collecting some of
its arrears. Post-2012, TTG’s operations were severely curtailed with the stoppage of gas imports.
Nevertheless, as in the case of BT, the interventions under the project, including the improvements
through the FMIP, are expected to help TTG to operate with financial viability if and when its
operations revert to normal in future.

Regarding the PDO to assist in assessing the viability of the Rogun HEP, as discussed above in
Section 2.2, the Assessment Studies were satisfactorily completed by August 2014, and have been
acknowledged by various stakeholders and international observers, including from the United
Nations and the European Union, to have met high standards of quality and international best
practice. The Assessment Studies, and associated related work done during their preparation, are
expected to provide a vital input into decision-making in regard to viable power generation options
not only for Tajikistan but also have important implications for regional policy at large, given the
cross-boundary nature of the Rogun HEP’s operations.

Based on the foregoing, the assessment of the achievement of the PDO has been carried out using
a split evaluation based on the original and revised project indicators (PI), in accordance with the
ICR guidelines. The results are summarized in the table below.

                                                                 satisfactory

3.3 Efficiency

Rating: Modest

The overall efficiency of the project is rated as modest. Project costs were reasonable with regard
to the investments undertaken and the targets achieved at project completion. The indicators of
economic and financial viability were lower than the levels estimated at appraisal but nevertheless
remained at satisfactory levels.

Project cost and implementation schedule: At the appraisal of the original project, the total project
cost was estimated at US$ 30 million of which the electricity component accounted for about
US$ 17.2 million, the gas component for about US$ 12 million, and the Government technical
assistance component for about US$ 0.8 million. The project was to be implemented over a six
year period with a completion date of December 31, 2011 and a credit closing date of June 30,
2012. Under the Additional Financing approved in February 2012, US$ 9.25 million were added
to the electricity component, including US$ 5 million for scaling up of the metering program, and
the balance of US$ 4.25 million for additional technical assistance activities. The total allocation
for the electricity component was thus increased to about US$ 26.5 million. The credit closing
date was extended to December 31, 2014.

After significant initial delays, implementation of the activities planned under the original project
took a year longer than expected. By the closing date, most of the planned activities were
substantially completed with the exception of the completion of some FMIP-related activities in
BT. TTG substantially completed the physical implementation of its component by 2011 but post-
2012 its operations were severely affected by the stoppage of gas imports from Uzbekistan. Under
the Additional Financing, most activities were completed by the closing date of December 31,
2014 with the exception of some related to BT – (i) installation of the additional meters under the
AF; (ii) studies related to rehabilitation, dam safety and sedimentation at the Nurek HPP; and (iii)
some remaining FMIP-related activities (valuation of assets and assessment of receivables and
payables). The above list excludes the billing system as it was financed by a direct financing from
SECO.

At project completion in December 2014, the total project cost is estimated at about US$ 44.2
million of which US$ 20.4 million for the electricity component, US$ 11.7 million for the gas
component, and US$ 12.1 million for the Government technical assistance component.

Economic and financial viability: Indicators for the electricity and gas components as estimated
at project appraisal and re-estimated at project completion are summarized in the Table 4 below.
Details are given in Annex 4.

Post-completion estimates are provided or the electricity component. No estimates were prepared
for the gas component given the drastic changes in TTG’s operating circumstances which were
beyond its control.

The post-completion estimates are lower due to (i) the longer implementation period, (ii) slower
than projected progress in reducing unaccounted for electricity (losses), and (iii) slower than
projected increases in billed sales in Dushanbe in the earlier years of project implementation.
However, they remain at acceptable levels indicating the substantial contribution of the project to
improving commercial and financial viability.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Based on the discussion in Sections 3.1 to 3.3, the overall outcome is rated as Moderately
Satisfactory because both the original project and the revised project are assessed to have (i)
substantial relevance with regard to the current CPS and the GoT’s national power strategy, (ii)
substantial efficacy in meeting the PDO in regard to reduction in commercial losses and laying
the foundation for improved financial viability in the electricity and gas sectors, and high
efficacy in meeting the PDO in regard to assessing the viability of the Rogun HEP, and (iii) have
modest efficiency with, lower than appraised, but still satisfactory indicators.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

The successful completion of the Rogun Assessment Process, under the Additional Financing, i.e.
the TEAS and ESIA and related activities including consultations among riparian Governments,
with civil society, and within the international community, as well the identification of key
additional issues and potential win-win approaches in the World Bank report, is a strategically
significant outcome, with long-term implications both domestically and regionally.

Domestically, through the technical assistance and advisory support provided to GoT, an
interdisciplinary team of officials acquired practical training in modern methodologies for
assessment of major investment projects under changing climatic conditions. This enhanced
capacity     would enable better decision-making in regard to operations important not only for
Tajikistan but for the region as a whole, including in particular the neighboring riparian states that
could potentially be affected by the operations of the proposed Rogun HEP.




                                                 30
Regionally, through the multi-country consultation process, a representative group of civil society
organizations, technocrats and policy-makers was invited, for the first time, to comment on the
technical, economic, and environmental parameters of a major hydropower project in a
neighboring country. The transparency and evidence basis of the process, with the participation
of eminent independent experts, set a standard of openness for decision-making in the region. In
June 2014, key diplomatic partners issued public statements of support for the Rogun Assessment
process, highlighting its transparency, inclusiveness, and independence. In July 2014, soon after
the final riparian consultation, the Bank convened a high level meeting of First Deputy Prime
Ministers which was attended by all five countries, helped diffuse potential tensions, and
highlighted international experiences with cooperative water management. The Bank’s convening
power and reputation for high international standards contributed to the credibility of the process,
while the adherence of the GoT to these standards during an on-going winter energy crisis
demonstrated the commitment of the country’s leadership to pursue a cooperative approach to
hydropower development.

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The project targeted improving the commercial operations and financial viability of the two
implementing agencies BT and TTG. The direct beneficiaries of the project interventions were
BT, TTG and the GoT. However, with regard to electricity, the electricity consumers in Dushanbe,
and in regard to gas, the consumers of gas in Tajikistan, are expected to benefit from the improved
metering and billing enabled by the project through (i) the greater accuracy and transparency in
consumption and billing, and (ii) the gradual improvement in the utilities’ financial viability which
should also enable them to improve reliability and levels of service. For Dushanbe, the project
benefits are estimated to reach about 810,000 persons, including about 365,000 women (46 percent
of the total). The GoT is continuing to develop its social protection schemes as it had undertaken
to do under the LESDS, including with regard to the impact of energy costs on households, but
further progress is required as has been indicated under studies supported by the Bank (Section
2.5 above).

The Bank’s involvement in the Rogun Assessment Studies helped to increase the knowledge of
international best practices within the Resettlement Unit and further helped improve the
resettlement practices of the Resettlement Unit. The Bank’s support focused on the resettlement
of so-called Stage 1 resettlement which includes seven villages located near the construction site,
six of which had to be relocated for safety reasons. Throughout the duration of the studies, the
Bank advised the Government in the preparation of resettlement instruments and monitored
resettlement activities and provided advice on how to meet international good practices to the
benefit of affected communities. This advisory and monitoring work continues after the project
has closed.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The project provided technical assistance to BT and TTG through consultants and training to help
them improve their project management and financial management functions. Progressively these
have resulted in some improvements in these areas although sustainability has been affected from
time to time by internal factors such as staff turnover and the need for the new staff to familiarize
themselves with the requirements. The project was instrumental in encouraging the Government


                                                 31
to prepare and start implementation of a comprehensive development strategy for the energy sector.
Technical assistance and advisory support provided under the project helped the GoT to establish
important policy and implementation related institutions, e.g. the Project Management Group to
oversee the work related to the Rogun studies. The PMG gained experience in the technical
management of complex studies for large hydropower projects.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Beneficiary surveys were not carried out under the project. The World Bank conducted in-country
consultations on the terms of reference with the country authorities and with civil society
organizations in all riparian countries from September 2008 to September 2009.10 The terms of
reference were revised to reflect comments received during the consultations. Key revisions
related to dam safety issues, particularly seismic risk, and trans-boundary water management. A
number of joint sessions between the Bank, the consultants who prepared the Rogun studies, the
PoEs, and the relevant Government agencies involved were carried out during the preparation of
the TEAS and the ESIA. Five multi-country consultations, including separate sessions for riparian
governments and 80 civil society organizations, were held during 4-6 week review periods for the
draft documents as summarized in Annex 6. The international diplomatic community was also
briefed on the status of the assessments following each consultation session. At the outset of the
process, the Government of Uzbekistan questioned the objectivity of the study and publicly
expressed opposition to the construction of a Rogun dam. In response to the Uzbek concerns, the
Bank agreed to play an enhanced role in order to assure the quality and independence of the
assessment studies and regularly briefed the Uzbek authorities on the progress of the studies and
the outcome of the consultations. The Uzbek authorities have made several written inquiries to
the Bank concerning the study findings. Those written queries from Uzbekistan and detailed World
Bank responses were all posted online. Uzbekistan participated in the fifth riparian consultations in
July 2014. Their comments and questions have helped strengthen the final reports.

4 Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

Based on the following, the overall risk to the sustainability of the project benefits is assessed as
moderate.

Technical risk. The technical risk is assessed as low. Regarding the metering component, all the
technologies introduced under the electricity and gas components are well-established and both
implementing agencies, BT and TTG, have substantial experience in operating electric power and
gas systems respectively. For the billing and collection systems, appropriate assistance will be
provided to BT under the proposed WEP.

Financial risk. The financial risk is assessed as moderate overall based on a moderate risk rating
for BT and a high risk rating for TTG. Under the energy reforms program, which includes the

Medium Term Tariff Policy, the GoT has been approving significant increases in the electricity
and gas tariffs. As a result, there has been progressive improvement in the financial situation of
BT. However, operating costs, including costs of fuel, have been rising as well, and BT has not
yet reached full cost recovery levels. Further progress is also required in increasing revenue
collection levels. In the case of TTG, good progress in increasing its financial viability was made
until 2012. Thereafter, with the stoppage of gas imports from Uzbekistan, TTG’s financial
situation deteriorated substantially. Progress towards reaching financial viability will depend upon
a solution to restoring TTG’s operations. The financial viability of the two companies will also
depend upon the tariff levels being progressively raised as needed to full cost recovery levels.

Economic risk. The economic risk is assessed as moderate overall based on a moderate risk rating
in the case of BT and a high risk rating in case of TTG. For BT, the main risk to continued
economic benefits is deterioration in its financial situation which would affect its operational
efficiency and financial viability. For TTG, the risk remains high pending a resolution of the
current situation in regard to gas imports.


5 Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated as Satisfactory. Project preparation included
a sound background analysis which drew on information collected and sector knowledge gained
from the Bank’s earlier and ongoing operations and sector work in Tajikistan including helping
the GoT develop a development strategy for the sector, preparation of an Energy Utility Reform
Review and a Regional Electricity Export Potential Study in Central Asia. The strategic sector
context and the project rationale were sound. Technical, financial and economic analyses for the
project appraisal were well-developed and detailed. The discussion in the PAD and the analysis
were well-supported by adequately detailed annexes. Institutional issues, including the envisaged
implementation arrangements were adequately treated, although, in retrospect, there may have
been some over-estimation of the capacity of the implementing agencies to absorb and internalize
the visualized improvements. Environmental, social and safeguard policies were adequately
treated. With regard to the M&E framework, some changes were required to be made during
implementation to address weaknesses in the baseline information.

For the Additional Financing, prior to agreeing to participate in the assessment studies for the
Rogun HEP, the Bank formulated a wide range of requirements regarding the process of managing
the studies.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory



                                                33
The overall Satisfactory rating is based on a weighted average of the Satisfactory rating for the
supervision of the components under the original project, and Highly Satisfactory and Satisfactory
ratings respectively for the supervision of the Rogun studies and non-Rogun related components
under the restructured project.

Project supervision was carried out regularly, usually in conjunction with the supervision of the
Energy Emergency Recovery Assistance Project (EERAP) until the closure of EERAP. This
enabled synergies given the complementarity of the two projects, particularly with regard to
following the progress of both projects in the wider context of the Government’s energy sector
reforms, and with regard to the institutional strengthening of BT and TTG. A total of 48
supervision missions were carried out during the project implementation period. The frequency
increased after the addition of the Rogun studies under the restructured project. The supervision
teams contained a good mix of staff from the Bank’s headquarters in Washington DC, the Bank’s
Country Office in Dushanbe, and some other Bank offices, which enabled the Bank team to be
quickly responsive to the needs of the counterparts. The supervision teams also included
specialized consultants as necessary (particularly for the Rogun studies).

The Bank supervision teams had appropriate skills mix and adequate budgets to effectively
monitor project supervision. The fiduciary specialists (procurement and financial management)
were regularly in touch with the implementing agencies to help resolve issues. Given the
difficulties faced in preparation and execution of the FMIPs, the FM specialists, which included
senior FM staff, regularly followed the progress in the implementation of the FMIPs and prepared
detailed financial management supervision reviews.

To help the GoT to refine its social assistance policy, the Bank provided advice and support
through analytical work and studies including Delivering Social Assistance to the Poorest
Households (2011); Poverty Assessment (2009); and Assessment of Household Energy
Deprivation in Tajikistan (2014). These are expected to contribute to further development of the
GoT’s social assistance policy, including in regard to aspects related to the energy sector.

The Bank’s performance in contributing to the successful completion of the Rogun Assessment
Studies, under challenging circumstances (as described earlier in Section 2.2), was highly
satisfactory. The Bank committed substantial monetary and senior staff resources as well as
managed and financed more than ten members of the PoEs and invested significant staff time and
resources in activities which go beyond regular project supervision, including creating a platform
for consulting with diplomatic partners, meeting regularly with highest government officials in
five countries, undertaking own analytical work as additional diligence to ensure the views of all
parties were taken into account and all cooperative options are explored, and convening first of its
kind high level regional meetings to diffuse tensions and discuss collaborative way forward. This
helped to facilitate successful completion of the studies, acknowledged by major stakeholders as
meeting international best practice standards As indicated earlier in Section 2.2, it is unlikely that
such a successful outcome, requiring participatory processes with major stakeholders, including
the riparian governments, would have been achieved without the Bank’s sustained and proactive
involvement.

Both Sector and Country Management closely followed the project’s progress as reflected in their
comments and the guidance provided to the supervision team in the project’s periodic


                                                 34
Implementation Status Reports (ISRs). Comprehensive reviews, both internal and external were
carried out in the context of the Additional Financing and the Restructuring, as they essentially
functioned as a Mid Term Review (MTR), exceeding the scope and outcomes of a traditional MTR.

c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Based on the Satisfactory ratings for quality at entry and for supervision, the overall Bank
performance is rated Satisfactory. In particular, the Bank’s performance in overcoming the many
challenges posed by the political complexity of the regional situation, and in enabling the
successful completion of the important Rogun Assessment Studies, was very commendable and is
rated Highly Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The GoT remained committed to the project providing funds and support as needed. During the
preparation of the project, the GoT, with the help of the Bank, prepared a development strategy
for the energy sector which was incorporated in a Letter of Energy Sector Development Strategy
(LESDS). It also took a number of upfront steps to improve the financial situation of the
implementing agencies (BT and TTG) by increasing tariffs and obtaining agreements from major
creditors of the utilities to clear outstanding dues and make timely payments.

For the preparation of the Rogun Studies, the GoT took a number of actions supporting and
facilitating actions including:
      agreement to a proactive management of the studies by the Bank;
      increasing budget allocations for the two studies based on the recommendations of the
       PoEs;
      enabling the participation of its teams in the various meetings that were regularly held to
       review the progress and results of the studies;
      operationalization of the PMG for the studies and enabling active support through experts
       from relevant ministries and agencies to interact with the consultants and review their work.
While the GoT has continued to implement the main elements of the LESDS, the rate of progress
for some of the elements continues to be slower than anticipated. With regard to approving
increases in electricity tariffs, the GoT continued to make increases in the levels of the tariffs (the
end of project level in 2014 was 240 percent higher than the base level in 2004). However, the
increased tariffs remained significantly below cost-recovery levels reflecting the GoT’s concerns
with the social impact of the increased tariffs on the households’ affordability. Furthermore, the
covenant with regard to ensuring timely and complete payments to BT by TALCO and other SOEs
was not consistently complied with.


                                                  35
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

There were basically three implementing agencies: the TSG in the MoF at the beginning of the
project in 2005 and, subsequently, three months later, BT and TTG since it was established that
the specific expertise required to deal with the technical aspects of the project would be more
readily available in BT and TG. BT was responsible for the implementation of the electricity
component and also the Rogun Studies component with the active support on the technical aspects
of the studies from the PMG for the Rogun Studies component. TTG was responsible for the gas
component.

BT, after some procurement and installation related delays in the early years of project
implementation, BT significantly improved its procurement capability and completed the
installation of the original planned number of meters well before the closing date. Some of the
additional meters to be installed under the restructured project remained to be installed at project
closing. With regard to achievement of the planned outcomes, including reduction in accounted
for electricity and revenue collections in cash, BT made gradual progress but was unable to reach
the planned targets at the time of project closing. With regard to strengthening its financial
management capability, preparation and implementation of FMIPs, BT made gradual progress but
some items remained to be completed at project closing. With regard to compliance with
covenants, BT was unable to consistently meet the financial covenant in regard to short term cost
recovery.

For TTG, the rate of progress in implementing its component and securing the planned outputs
and outcomes was progressing well until its operations were severely affected since the end of
2012 with the stoppage of gas imports from Uzbekistan.

Overall, the performance of the implementing agencies is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Based on the Moderately Satisfactory performance rating for the Government and for the
implementing agencies, the overall Borrower performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.


6 Lessons Learned
The main lessons learned under the project are the following:

   (a) Although technical assistance was provided under the project, the implementation targets
       set under the project for the early years proved ambitious in relation to the existing project
       management capabilities of the implementing agencies. In setting implementation targets,
       the Bank should make a realistic, even conservative, assessment of the ability of the
       implementing agencies to step up to the requirements, particularly where the agencies did


                                                36
   not have prior experience in implementing Bank projects and had limited availability of
   specialists, as in the case of this project. In the future there is a need for holistic political
   economy and governance analysis of the energy sectors, motivations for reforms, and
   support from interest groups. This would allow realistically assess the level of GoT
   commitment and risks. Civil society engagement, promoting transparency and
   accountability in the energy sector is critically important to promote demand for good
   governance and pressure for an improved service delivery.

(b) Similarly, although technical assistance was provided under the project, achieving the
    planned improvements in the financial management systems of the implementing agencies
    proved to take much longer than anticipated. The Bank should more realistically take into
    account the limitations posed by the prevailing environment in which the improvements
    are sought to be obtained, e.g. the prevailing national standards in relation to accounting
    and financial reporting and the degree of their divergence from international standards
    (IFRS), the existing capacity of the utilities in terms of adequacy of staff and training, the
    multiplicity of utility branches and the variety of the financial management systems in use,
    and the related capacity of the utility staff to absorb and internalize the improvements being
    carried out. In retrospect, a combination of these factors led to the delays in carrying out
    the FMIPs.

(c) In cases where important components of the project, e.g. the billing and collection systems
    under this project, are being financed through co-financing under parallel financing
    arrangements, the Bank needs to stay proactively involved in following the design and
    progress of the components and be ready to provide facilitation and other support to help
    resolve problems in a timely and appropriate manner.

(d) The successful outcome in the case of the technically demanding and politically complex
    Rogun assessment studies is a clear confirmation of the value added of the Bank’s
    involvement. Given the level of commitment, resources and expertise required, perhaps
    only the Bank could have successfully undertaken and facilitated such an exercise. The
    stakeholders attested to the value added by the Bank, its indispensable role as a neutral and
    honest broker, and the high quality of advice provided.. However, although the Bank was
    ultimately able to facilitate a very successful outcome to the preparation of the studies,
    there were a number of important lessons learned concerning such commitments which are
    of crucial importance to the Borrower and where the Bank faces significant reputational
    risk:

      Very substantial resources are required both in terms of the allocated Bank budget and
       from project funds to cover the costs of a large Bank Team, the extensive consultation
       process involved, the PoE’s costs, other consultancy related costs, etc. Adequate
       funding provision needs to be made upfront or the Bank has to remain ready to provide
       additional funds as needed in a flexible and timely manner.
      ToRs for such sensitive assignments require very careful preparation. Obtaining
       comments on the draft ToRs from the riparians was an important and useful step. The
       estimate of the time-frame for the study has to be based on a realistic assessment of the



                                              37
    work involved in meeting the ToRs. The extended consultation processes that are
    involved add significantly to the time requirements.
   The efficient management of such complex studies poses significant challenges. The
    decision to have an enhanced role for the Bank Team was critical for the eventual
    successful completion of the study. It is essential to have the requisite level of technical
    expertise (technical, environmental, social, economic and financial, macro and fiscal,
    legal, political economy, and external communications) within the Bank Team for the
    full duration of the study.
   The role of an independent PoE selected and financed by the Bank is essential for
    securing external credibility of the process and the results of the studies. The decision
    to have the PoE reporting to the Bank was critical for the credibility of the studies.
    Careful selection of PoE members is essential – each expert must be a recognized
    international expert covering one of the main fields of specialization, fully independent,
    and capable of working as an effective team member internally with the PoE and with
    the Bank Team.
   Selection of competent and internationally-recognized consultants is also critical. The
    consultants should be able to function independently – this requires a proactive role by
    the Bank Team during both the selection process and during the conduct of the studies.
   The extended public consultation process was very useful in disseminating the rigorous
    nature and the results of the studies by providing a formal mechanism for inputs from
    stakeholders, and for addressing concerns of stakeholders.
   For such complex projects which involve contentious issues, it is essential to build
    appropriate platforms for partnership, consultation and engagement. They should
    include a wide variety of civil society organizations (local, regional and international)
    and interested stakeholder governments and development and diplomatic partners, to
    bring the stakeholders to the table, generate productive discussions, and promote a
    process of transparency.
   Success with such sensitive, complex, and multi-country engagement requires
    readiness by the Bank to go beyond regular supervision of project activities under
    Client responsibility, and to pro-actively deploy a number of additional measures such
    as, in this case: (i) creating a platform for regular consultation with diplomatic partners
    at appropriate level, (ii) issuing Bank own report bringing new perspectives in addition
    to consultants reports, (iii) agreeing with Government on fundamental conditions that
    may seem to go beyond the scope of the project sensu stricto but prove essential for
    achieving the objective (ban on construction activities and related budget allocation
    during the studies) and on a process for continued monitoring of compliance, and (iv)
    using Bank access to highest political level and convening ability to promote continued

   Limited experience with World Bank policies and international practice lead to a slow
    uptake of certain principles. Upstream investments in rigorous capacity building can
    reduce delays and improve outcomes.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component A: Electricity
A.1. Supply and installation of approximately      All 215,835 meters have been supplied and nearly
160,000 electricity meters and related             80% or 171,904 out of them were installed including
equipment and materials for all consumers in       about 5,000 retained for replacement, by the project
the Dushanbe Electricity Network                   closing date. The balance of 43,931 meters will be
                                                   installed in 2015 under the WEP Preparation
                                                   Advance. More than 9,000 meters were installed in
                                                   the first four months of 2015.The target was revised
                                                   to 215,835 meters due to increased demand as a
                                                   result of inclusion of customers from parts of Rodaki
                                                   and Varzob districts.

                                                   maintenance of that system may not be the most cost
                                                   effective solution for the company and will make a
                                                   decision based on the outcomes of a review of the
                                                   various billing systems that are currently in
                                                   use/planned to be installed at BT sales branches. The
                                                   review would be supported under WEP in 2015.
A.3. Technical assistance to Barki Tajik           Moved to component C of the project.

Component B: Gas
B.1. Supply and installation of approximately      The target was fully achieved by the end of 2012.
160,000 gas meters and related materials to        The original target of 160,000 meters was found to
complete Tajik Gas’ gas metering program           have been over-estimated after the start of project
                                                   implementation and the target was revised to
                                                   144,000. The total number of meters delivered were
                                                   143,790, out of which 93,055 were provided under
                                                   ELRP funding and the remaining 50,735 were
                                                   provided directly by Tajiktransgas from its own
                                                   resources.
                                                   However, the only source of gas in Tajikistan – gas
                                                   imports from Uzbekistan – stopped by the end of
                                                   2012 due to political and commercial reasons. As a
                                                   result, the national gas company Tajiktransgas has
                                                   been effectively out of operation since the beginning
                                                   of 2013.
B.2. Supply and installation of laboratories for   Two sets of testing equipment for calibration
gas meter calibration, testing and quality         were delivered and installed. TTG decided not to
control                                            purchase the testing equipment.

B.3. Design, supply and installation of            The billing systems were delivered and installed.
automated billing systems for Tajik Gas            Commercial operations couldn’t take place as the gas
                                                   supplies to TTG had been restricted.
B.4. Technical assistance to Tajik Gas             Moved to component C of the project.

of energy supply                              improvements have been achieved in the areas of
                                              tariff adjustments and cash collection. The tariffs
                                              increased almost four-fold in the past ten years -
                                              from US 0.6cent/kWh in 2004 to US 2.04cent/kWh
                                              by the end of December 2014, which is close to the
                                              target of US 2.4cent/kWh.
                                              The original targets were revised under the February
                                              2012 Additional Financing. In local currency, the
                                              tariff increased from 1.48 Dirham in 2004 to 15.90
                                              Dirham in 2014 i.e. by 10.7 times. The tariff increase
                                              in real terms (i.e. after adjusting for the inflation in

                                              the 2004 level. Given that power supply costs in
                                              Tajikistan are predominantly in local currency, the
                                              tariff increases during the period have resulted in a
                                              substantial improvement in BT’s cost recovery
                                              situation as compared to that at the start of the
                                              project, thereby helping BT’s progress towards
                                              achievement of financial viability.

Annex 4. Economic and Financial Analysis

Project economic and financial analysis at appraisal

Economic analysis: An economic cost benefit analysis for the electricity and gas components was
carried out at appraisal. The period of estimation of the net benefits was from 2005 to 2023.

For the electricity component, the economic costs included the capital costs and the incremental
operating and maintenance (O&M) costs. The project’s economic benefits included (i) the value of
the increased supply of electricity to the customers and (ii) reduced or eliminated losses of the
electricity utility (BT). The key assumptions were in regard to (i) the Marginal Willingness to Pay
(MWTP), (ii) level of unmet demand in Dushanbe, and (iii) the rate of increase of tariffs. All
analysis was carried out in real terms with 2005 as the base year.

For the gas component, the economic costs included the capital costs and the incremental O&M
expenses. The economic benefits were the projected incremental sales due to the component which
were valued at the long-run average incremental cost (LRAIC) of gas supply estimated at US$ 66.8
per million cubic meters (MCM).

Based on the foregoing, the project’s base case Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) and
Economic Net Present Value (ENPV) were estimated as follows:

 Component                EIRR (%) ENPV (US$ million)

 Electricity component      18.0               14.3

 Gas component              40.3               13.1


Financial analysis: The Financial Internal Rate of Return (FIRR) and the Financial Net Present
Value (FNPV) were calculated based on the incremental costs and benefits with and without the
project. The valuation of the benefits in both cases was based on the respective estimated LRAICs
of USc 2.1 per kWh for the electricity component and US$ 66.8 per MCM for the gas component.

 Component                FIRR (%) FNPV (US$ million)

 Electricity component      67.4              54.7

 Gas component              40.3              13.1


Post-completion assessment of the project’s economic and financial benefits

The post-completion assessment of the project’s economic and financial costs and benefits has been
carried out for the electricity component. No assessment has been undertaken for the gas
component in view of the cessation of TTG’s normal operations starting at the end of 2012 and the
continuing uncertainty in resumption of gas imports.



                                                46
Economic analysis (electricity component): The post-completion cost-benefit analysis was carried
out utilizing the same methodology as that at project appraisal with an updating of the key
underlying variables (MWTP, level of unmet demand, and rate of increase of tariffs) based on
actual data, where available, for the period 2005 to 2014, and modified assumptions up to 2023.
The relevant cost-benefit streams are given in Table A.1 below. Details are in the Project Files.

The key assumptions are the following:

       MWTP: The appraisal analysis had assumed a gradual increase in the MWTP. More recent
        estimates of the MWTP were carried out in the context of sectoral studies undertaken in
        2011-2012; the MWTP was estimated at USc 7.0 per kWh in 2011 prices; for the re-
        estimation, an MWTP value of USc 5.0 per KWh is assumed based on an average of the
        original and new estimates.
       Level of unmet demand: Utilizing the appraisal methodology, the level of unmet demand
        was re-estimated based on actual data in regard to electricity generation, supply and losses
        in the period 2005 to 2014 with conservative projections of further loss reduction up to
        2023.

Based on the foregoing, the electricity component’s EIRR and ENPV are now estimated at 16
percent and US$ 3.6 million respectively as compared to the appraisal estimates of 18 percent and
US$ 14.3 million. The post-completion estimates are lower due to (i) the longer implementation
period, (ii) slower than projected progress in reducing unaccounted for electricity (losses), and (iii)
slower than projected increases in billed sales in Dushanbe in the earlier years of project
implementation.

Financial analysis (electricity component): The FIRR and FNPV were re-estimated based on actual
data for the period 2005 to 2014 and conservative assumptions for the period 2015 to 2023 in regard
to reduction in unaccounted for losses, increases in tariffs, and increases in billed sales in Dushanbe.

The post-completion re-estimated FIRR and FNPV are 49.0 percent and US$ 27.8 million
respectively as compared to the appraisal estimates of 67.4 percent and US$ 54.7 million
respectively. The post-completion estimates are lower than the corresponding appraisal estimates
for the same reasons as discussed above in the case of the EIRR and ENPV.

Post –Completion Financial Assessment of the Implementing Agencies

Prior to 2007, the financial situation of the two implementing utilities BT and TTG was weak due
to a combination of factors: (i) tariffs that were substantially below cost recovery levels; (ii) weak
revenue collections, and (iii) operating inefficiencies leading to high expenses. In addition, the
utilities suffered from weak financial management capabilities, including accounting and reporting
that diverged substantially from International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and
inadequate internal controls. As a result, the audit reports for both companies contained disclaimers
of opinion, i.e. the auditors were not able to offer an opinion on the reliability of the financial
statements.

In 2007, as a precondition to the preparation of the Energy Loss Reduction Project (ELRP), the
Government introduced an Energy Sector Development Strategy which included, among other
measures, an action plan to improve the financial viability of the energy utilities. The planned
measures included a Medium Term Tariff Policy under which the tariffs of the utilities were to be
raised progressively to cost recovery levels. The Government approved substantial increases in
electricity and gas prices: electricity prices were raised by 68 percent in 2007, 25 percent in 2008,
10% in 2009, 24% in 2010, and 4% in 2012. Gas selling prices were adjusted to cover the rising
prices of gas imports. The principal objective of ELRP was to reduce commercial losses in the
electricity and gas systems and enable the utilities to achieve financial viability. ELRP included
components to strengthen the utilities’ financial management capabilities, including by helping
them develop and implement Financial Management Improvement Plans (FMIPs) with the help of
local and international consultants.

For BT, despite the electricity tariff increases, the average price of electricity in Tajikistan currently
is only about USc 2.25 per kWh, which is the lowest among the Central Asian countries. Cost
recovery levels in Tajikistan have been estimated at about USc 4 cents per kWh, so the current
prices are at about 60 percent of cost recovery levels. The effect of the low prices is further
compounded by BT’s revenue collection levels which, despite significant improvement from about
45 percent in 2007 to 75 percent in 2014, are still relatively low. This has seriously affected BT’s
cash flow leading to inadequate levels of working capital to finance operations and maintenance
requirements. The situation was further affected by the insistence of BT’s foreign suppliers of fuel
and electricity on advance payments before deliveries were made. IN 2011, BT incurred a financial
loss of TJS 32.5 million; in 2012, it increased to TJS 300.9 million due to a sharp increase in total
expenses.

For TTG, in response to rising prices of gas imports, the Government has been adjusting the gas
selling price taking into account increases in import prices but TTG’s prices were still short of full
cost recovery levels at the end of 2012.

                                                   48
For both utilities, some significant improvements have been achieved under the FMIPs. Both
utilities have been strengthening their financial management staffing by recruitment and training.
Starting with the financial year 2010, both utilities have been moving towards financial accounting
and reporting under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). However, some other
weaknesses still remain and the Bank intends to continue to provide support to the utilities under
the proposed WEP to help them to further strengthen their financial management capabilities.

Annex 8. Summary of the Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The comments and remarks of Barki Tajik on the draft ICR of the project are given
below.

Barki Tajik as a whole shares the Bank's assessment on completion of the "Energy Loss
Reduction project" and consider that the following should be pointed out:

        1. Project Management
         Indeed, in the initial stage of the project implementation there were some delays
related to the insufficient experience of the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) in
implementation of the projects financed by IDA. It should be noted that it was the first
project for the PIU; and lack of experience in preparation of the tender documents, financial
statements and other necessary documents were playing a negative role in the project
implementation. However, thanks to the IDA continued support in training delivery and
provision of necessary consulting services to support the PIU, under additional financing
for the "Energy Loss Reduction project" there were practically no delays associated with
the PIU work. Successful management of the large contracts as "Feasibility studies" and
"Social and Environmental Impacts" of the project for construction of the Rogun
hydropower plant, requiring coordination of many aspects with a large number of parties
involved, is a clear proof of strong "Barki Tajik" Project Implementation Unit capacity.

       2. General Comments

        In general, the progress of the project implementation showed the complexity of
the project which includes a number of different studies.

        Out of the total volume of the project financing only 43.5% of the funds were
directly or indirectly related to the activities on energy loss reduction. The remaining funds
were used for the assessment studies of the proposed Rogun HPP (39%), the Financial
Management Improvement Program (8.2%), the studies related to the Nurek hydropower
plant (7.2%) and contracting consulting services to support the Working Group of the
Republic of Tajikistan on CASA 1000 project (2.1%).
        The immediate project implementation has shown that such a structure with a large
number of various activities and consulting services is difficult to manage.
        Also, in implementing projects with involvement of two or more implementing
agencies, as in this case they are JSC "Tajiktransgas" and JSHC "Barki Tojik", access to
the financial management database – Client Connection, in order to prepare applications
for withdrawal, and also to check the status of development it is required that on-line users’
accounts should to be created separately. In our particular case one joint account was
created for both implementing agencies. This fact led to additional stress in the monitoring
of component disbursement by the agencies in accordance with the financing agreement.
        It should be noted that after approval of the tender document package with the Bank,
at the stage of contract negotiations at the Bank experts’ request the terms of reference
were amended. Eventually it led to serious delays in the implementation of some studies.


                                             56
        We consider it necessary to take into account and use the valuable experience
gained in the implementation of the "Energy Loss Reduction project" in the IDA projects
in future.

  Statement attributable to the Spokesman for the Secretary-General on
                               Central Asia



The Secretary-General welcomes the publication by the World Bank on 17 June of draft
assessments on the proposed Roghun hydropower project in Tajikistan, which provide
important guidance for critical consultations among the region’s States on water and energy
issues. He recognizes the challenges of the countries of Central Asia to meet their
sustainable development and energy needs and appreciates the efforts of the World Bank
in leading the independent assessment.

The Secretary-General encourages the Governments of Central Asia to engage in a
constructive discussion on the management of trans-boundary water resources in line with
international law, and to refrain from unilateral actions. He believes that such a discussion
could lead to a sustainable, comprehensive solution that takes into consideration the
interests of all of the countries of the region. He invites all stakeholders to avail themselves
of the support offered by his Special Representative for Central Asia, Miroslav Jenča, and
the United Nations Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia
(UNRCCA).

                      Public statement by Russia on Rogun

Moscow hopes that the Central Asian countries will rely on experts' conclusions and try to
launch a direct dialogue to clarify the issues relating to the completion of the Rogun
hydropower plant (HPP) on the Amu Darya River in Tajikistan.

"More effort is needed to show the political will for cooperation, especially in resolving
problems - be they in the field of power generation or water accumulation - which affect
the interests of several countries at once. The Rogun HPP is exactly that case," Russian
Foreign Ministry spokesman Aleksandr Lukashevich wrote in his reply to a question from
the media regarding the international evaluation of the Rogun HPP project.
"Some countries in this region are located in the upper reaches of transboundary rivers such
as Amu Darya and Syr Darya. The others, in their lower reaches. It is clear that the countries
in the upper reaches can influence the volume of water received by the countries lowed
down the stream," Lukashevich was quoted on the ministry's website.
"Furthermore, water is used for various purposes. The upper reaches - Tajikistan and
Kyrgyzstan - are busying solving pressing tasks such as boosting their own energy security
with the help of hydropower generation. The lower reaches - Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan
and Uzbekistan - justly see water as a base for their economic and day-to-day activities.
For all these countries, water is a vitally important resource," the Foreign Ministry said.
"In a situation where there is mutual trust with a proper mechanism of controlling resources,
the interests normally are brought to 'the common denominator'," Lukashevich stressed,
noting that the Central Asian countries have signed around 150 accords and agreements on
that score.

He recalled that the project was designed in the USSR in 1978, as part of cooperation
between the Union's republics. During the post-Soviet period, mutual coordination in this
sphere waned. The regional countries are largely pursuing independent water and energy
policies. "Due to these circumstances, and in reply to calls and a formal appeal by the
parties involved, in 2010 the World Bank undertook to organize an independent appraisal
of how safe the completion and operation of the Rogun HPP will be for all the countries in
the region. The same year Tajikistan 'froze' its operations at the site," Lukashevich wrote.
He added that a draft of the experts' conclusion has been made available to all the parties
involved for studying. The World Bank is ready to take into account their possible
comments and additions before issuing the final version of the report.
"As far Russia is concerned in this matter, the World Bank has been regularly updating us
about progress in the experts' work. We take this information into account in our direct
communication with the concerned countries in Central Asia. We are very hopeful that
based on the experts' conclusions the regional countries will try to establish a direct
dialogue to clarify the issues of mutual concern. After all, there is simply no alternative to
cooperation," the Russian Foreign Ministry said.

"We are certain that the leaders of the regional countries will be wise enough to find a
worthy solution to this problem. Russia will only welcome this and is ready to assist, where
possible, if asked to do so by the concerned parties," the Foreign Ministry stressed.

"Russia is keen on seeing its close region's water use projects become 'platforms' for the
joint regional cooperation, not a 'wedge' broadening the gaps between the neighboring
countries," Lukashevich said, citing Kyrgyzstan's Kambarat HPP-1 project with Russia as
an example. "At the proposal of Russian President V. Putin, it has been opened for
participation to other countries in the region. The first session of the ad hoc working group
involved Kyrgyzstan and Russia, as well as Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. This 'initiative'
needs further boost. This is the only way to form mutual trust in such a 'sensitive' sphere,"
Lukashevich summed up.
