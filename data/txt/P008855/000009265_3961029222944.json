It is intended to\n            help maintain the momentum created under the Enterprise and\n            Financial Sector Adjustment Loan in reforming the banking\n            system, by enforcing the principles of these reforms in\n            three borrowing banks. A separate single currency loan will\n            be made to each of the three following borrowing banks with\n            the Guarantee of the Republic of Slovenia: (i) Nova\n            Ljubljanska Banka; (ii) SKB Banka; and (iii) Banka Celje."}, "docdt": "1996-07-03T00:00:00Z"}
