The Bank provided an important\n            role in this project. This project evolved so much from its\n            original form that it is difficult to know by what criteria\n            to judge it. Viewed strictly as an agricultural credit\n            project, it cannot be judged a success. The project also\n            provided valuable institutional strengthening to\n            Bankin'ny Tantsaha Mpamokatra (BTM); in fact, the\n            provision for professional external audit and related\n            consultancies made a significant contribution not only to\n            the survival of the BTM but also to the diagnosis and\n            assessment of the whole financial sector. The particular\n            lessons from the experience of this project include: a\n            viable way to provide financial services to\n            Madagascar's smallholders has not yet been developed\n            either in the formal or the informal sector. The Malagasy\n            agricultural economy is predominantly unmonetized; and\n            significant, stable increases in profitability and\n            production will be necessary before this changes."}, "docdt": "1989-05-22T00:00:00Z"}
