Government's policy to extend credit for smallholder\n            agricultural development, with BTM as the principal\n            intermediary. It would also strengthen BTM's managerial\n            and financial capability. Main project components: (a) loans\n            to smallholders for export crops, such as coffee, cocoa,\n            pepper, cloves, and vanilla plantations; for sugar cane\n            plantations; and for foodcrops (rice, maize, and\n            groundnuts); (b) loans on an experimental basis to farmers\n            and cooperatives for selected agricultural activities, e.g.,\n            vineyard establishment, steer stall-fattening, and\n            small-scale pig fattening; (c) training for BTM staff in\n            financial, managerial, and computer disciplines; (d)\n            creation and operation of about seven itinerant banks\n            (consisting of vehicles equipped for the purpose) to extend\n            BTM's activities in rural areas; (e) feasibility study\n            (3 man-months) for the establishment of a Data Base\n            Management system for BTM. The project would help to\n            increase production of crops, and would allow an increase in\n            net foreign exchange earnings through increased exports\n            (coffee, cloves, vanilla, pepper, cocoa, sugar) or reduced\n            imports (rice). It would also strengthen BTM as an\n            agricultural development bank."}, "docdt": "1980-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
