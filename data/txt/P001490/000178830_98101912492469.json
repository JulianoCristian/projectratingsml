   for Madagascar will support the Government's policy to\n            extend credit for smallholder agricultural development, with\n            BTM (Bankin'ny Tantsaha Mpamokatra - National Bank for\n            Rural Development) as the principal intermediary. It will\n            also strengthen BTM's managerial and financial\n            capability. Main project components: (a) loans to\n            smallholders for export crops, such as coffee, cocoa,\n            pepper, cloves, and vanilla plantations; for sugar cane\n            plantations; and for food-crops (rice, maize, and\n            groundnuts); (b) loans on an experimental basis to farmers\n            and cooperatives for selected agricultural activities, e.g.,\n            vineyard establishment, steer stall-fattening, and\n            small-scale pig fattening; (c) training for BTM staff in\n            financial, managerial, and computer disciplines; (d)\n            creation and operation of about seven itinerant banks\n            (consisting of vehicles equipped for the purpose) to extend\n            BTM's activities in rural areas; and (e) feasibility\n            study (3 man-months) for the establishment of a Data Base\n            Management system for BTM. The project will help to increase\n            production of crops, and will allow an increase in net\n            foreign exchange earnings through increased exports (coffee,\n            cloves, vanilla, pepper, cocoa, and sugar) or reduced\n            imports (rice). It will also strengthen BTM as an\n            agricultural development Bank."}, "docdt": "1980-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
