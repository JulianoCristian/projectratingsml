World Bank and\n            Borrower performances were highly satisfactory overall.\n            Theses were the lessons learned: to promote environmental\n            investments which otherwise may not at all, or only very\n            slowly, come about, the low cost-directed credit of the\n            Ekofund for the funding of air pollution abatement projects\n            was welcome, timely, and successful. And the successful\n            implementation of the air pollution abatement program (APAP)\n            component helped alert commercial banks to compete for this\n            market so that in the near future the program would no\n            longer be needed. It is important to carefully design such a\n            program, to keep procedures simple, to conduct regular\n            public relations campaigns, and to address potential\n            customers even directly. Also, the administration of the\n            program has to be carefully planned and implemented. This\n            could be achieved by launching a pilot phase on a limited\n            scope and choosing professional implementers. A lot of early\n            campaigning had to be done to provide knowledge about the\n            Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and to report the\n            multifold benefits which could be derived from relatively\n            small investments. This understanding is important since\n            constant and sustained cooperation with potential clients\n            and users for new systems, as well as sustained training of\n            future users, are essential ingredients for a successful project."}, "docdt": "2001-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
