Environment\n            Project are to: 1) reduce ambient concentrations of\n            particulate matter (for particles of less than 10 microns in\n            diameter) and sulfur dioxide along with the health damage\n            associated with exposure to air pollution; and 2) collect,\n            organize and manage information for development and land-use\n            planning, particularly in areas of Slovenia that are\n            experiencing rapid development. The project consists of two\n            major components: 1) an air pollution abatement component\n            which will provide fuel conversion loans to about 6,500\n            households and about 65 boilerhouse operators during the\n            three years over which the Bank loan will be disbursed.\n            These loans will be used to finance the conversion of\n            heating and hot water systems currently using polluting\n            fuels to the use of cleaner fuels; and 2) a geographical\n            information system (GIS) component which will include the\n            following: (a) the establishment of a central Geographical\n            Information Center; (b) the establishment of a market\n            development group to promote the use of GIS, to provide\n            training (in the use of GIS), to raise market awareness on\n            exchange of data and to provide assistance to regional\n            administrations, government agencies and departments, and\n            domestic and foreign industrial, commercial and service\n            users; (c) the establishment of formal standards (in line\n            with international standards) on data collection, use and\n            maintenance of data and quality assurance compliance group\n            to ensure that the information system operates in accordance\n            with international standards; and (d) the establishment of a\n            local training center in order to develop local expertise in\n            the operation of GIS."}, "docdt": "1996-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
