          support the implementation of the Tanzania Tropical Forestry\n            Action Plan (TFAP) by strengthening the capacity of the\n            institutions in charge of developing and implementing forest\n            and land policies and by increasing the participation of the\n            private sector and local populations in the management of\n            natural resources in Tanzania.  The project includes the\n            following components:  (a) strengthening of the natural\n            resources monitoring and forest policies; (b) strengthening\n            of land policies and institutions; and (c) strengthening of\n            regional and district forest services in Mwanza and Tabora\n            regions.  The first component will support the collection of\n            natural resource information and development of a natural\n            resource information system; development and implementation\n            of improved practices for royalty collection and for\n            afforestation based on private sector nurseries and active\n            participation from local people; and preparation of an\n            action plan for the long-term financing of the forestry\n            subsector.  The second component will support the\n            development of land policies and government's ongoing\n            program of village demarcation, titling, and registration;\n            and the third component will support the development of\n            regional forest management plans and associated forest\n            service reorganization and training."}, "docdt": "1991-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
