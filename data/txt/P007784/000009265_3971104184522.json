The main objectives of the project were: (i)\n            reform the State by reducing public employment privatization\n            and initiation of a comprehensive and longer-term public\n            sector reform program; (ii) improve financial intermediation\n            by increasing the efficiency of the public banks and\n            strengthening prudential supervision; and (iii) improve\n            incentives for private sector activity by increasing\n            transparency,reducing protection,  supporting resolution of\n            property disputes and improving labor policies. Bank's\n            performance was satisfactory. Borrower's performance\n            was satisfactory. The key lessons learned were as follows:\n            (1) the design of adjustment operations should be flexible;\n            (2) in countries with weak implementationc apacity, a high\n            degree of political polarization and weak democratic\n            institutions, conditionality should focus on a few key\n            priorities; (3) where the political discussion in the\n            country specifically questions the aims and rationale for\n            the adjustment process, International Development\n            Association (IDA) should be prepared, at the request and\n            with the express approval of the government, to participate\n            in the national dialogue; (4) reliance on quick-disbursing\n            adjustment operations to support public sector reformn,\n            especially institutional restructuring is questionable; and\n            (5) the one negative lesson that can be drawn involves the\n            Bank's readiness to work with the government on\n            alternatives to the closure of National Development Bank (BANADES)."}, "docdt": "1997-06-17T00:00:00Z"}
