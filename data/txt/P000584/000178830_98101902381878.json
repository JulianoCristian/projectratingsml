  will improve the provision of skilled staff in the\n            agricultural and health fields. Its main components include:\n            (a) construction and equipment of a primary teacher training\n            college; (b) in-service training of about 500 primary school\n            teachers; (c) provision of textbooks and teaching materials;\n            (d) construction and equipment of a paramedical school in\n            Moroni; (e) establishment of an agricultural training center\n            in Moheli; and (f) technical assistance. The project should\n            lead to improvements in the quality, efficiency, and\n            relevance of primary education; reduce the number of dropout\n            and repeater students; assist in training agricultural and\n            health manpower essential for economic and social\n            development; and aid in institution-building."}, "docdt": "1981-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
