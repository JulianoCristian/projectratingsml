jx)tential3ly negative and positi'-e effects on the eniromwnt froni implemenmion oF the propsed
infrastrucres at an ealy amf preventi e stage, in order to supwn the decision-mak{ing process with
the necessary informtion. The environment which will be affected by the s-called target
environment, should be regarded in its natural. economic and cultural-sociaf components. in order to
have a holistic approach when addressina- issues at stak-e
The ELA also ensures that in case anticipated negate effects are unavoidable, ad hoc mitigation
measues are proposed and impeented dig contuction of the infrmsucture. In this context it
is stressed that mitigation measures are an inkrtant component of design of the road schemes and
are related to standards on road traffic, safety, emwomental and economic temis.
The methodology adopted for carrving out the assessmen consisted in field visits to the location of
the road to collect data, followed by office work to refine findings and write the Report Meetings
%vith Albania officials from GRD. the inisty of Heakth CEP IMC and the ICP staff have played
an important part in the work executed

Aithoughn at present laws on specitic matters of'the environment ha\e not been enacted vet. tihe main
reference in this regard can be represented bv Law No 7ob47 dated 2i January 1993, (hereinafter
referred as the Law). enclosed as Annex 11 to the present document The Law refers to saeneral
clauses Chapter I L EIA (Chapter 2) W'rth re,tard to the latter it is to be noted that the preSent
document -points out that the Law-  identities CEP as the Authorit% empowered to require
environmental impact assessments in accordance With that Lav  for this type of intervention
Howeker. the MoH is the authority responsible for establishing the procedures regarding ELA
activities and the activities of individuals or leyal entities Chapter 111 deals w%ith the licenses to be
issued .or actix ities that affect the em. ironment. and a specific list of ,aid activities is oresented. Thie
La- then comprises Chapter IV (inspections of and information for the environmental situation).
Chapter V' (duties and rights of central and local institutions on envirronmental protection). Chapter
VI (responsibilities and related sanctions), and Chapter V-iI reporting final provisions
Homwex er it should be noted that the NloH from time to time issues documents otf -arious nature
such as -uidelines, provisions and re-ulations which also affect the activ-ities of CEP For this reason
a comnlete reviewt of relevant legrislation is not Possible- even if it is believed that the Law can be
taken as a nenchmark
Aknother lawv which is adopted in the execution of the ETA' is the Laxw on expropriation- required

4.1    Phvsical environment
The road passes in the Shkumbin river %alle- On its                                 e  a, the road passes diflierent geoloigwa
formations that sarv from Quaternary alluvial sediments to siliceous and carbonatic sediments from
Neov_emnc Fhvsh to Trias and metamorphic rocks. The geological conditions report and the climatic
and hvdrological conditions of the road are reDorted in the Technical report prepared bv ICP
4-2    Biological environment
The road to be implemented passes through a segment of river valley that despite human presence
has conserved a oood degree of biodiversitv in the remaining natural environments. It is worth
mentionine that while upstream of Elbasan in the Shkumbini river there hav e been identified 12' fish
species. immediatelv dow-nstream of it are present only 4. The Shkuumbir river vaHey servLes as
geographical border for the distnbution of some species but what is important in our case. it cuts
through natural migration wavs of big mammals like bear, wolf, jackal etc- At the same time. there is
a consistent population of amphibians that use the water environment for breedingF purposes on both
sides of the vallev
Reclaimed area in the Domosdova field (Prrenjas field area Km 60 - 64) represent a high degree of
human settlements for asgricultural purposes therefore there is a scarcity of bioloetical diversitv- which
is mostly represented by the common animal and vegetal species of scarce X alue
4.3    Socio-economic conditions of the studv area
The area is characterised bv a marginal agricultural actis ities in the small aliuxial fields on tile lood
plain with the exception of Domosdosa tleld wvhere atriculture is the rmaii, acti;its Crops are
represented by maize which is cultivated in farmed stnrps alternating to unfa-med strips and w-heat in
Domosdov-a area, whilst the rest of the land is left to extensiBe pasture for sheep and goats.
Additional economic activities are represented by a number of scattered shops sellinLy Loods oc
various nature. The area used to rely heavily for employment on mininm acti.ities that nave stopped
during the political changes. At the present there is a gireat degree ofunemple-ment %%ith an a&,raivC
income per capita that is amongst the lowest in Albania The remaining part of the resident
population is employed in economic activities in the towns of Elbasan. Librazhd and Prrenjas.
comprising shops ot various nature. ,sorkshops. etc

come from existing quarries located outside the project area the possible impacts are 'erv limited and
can be a%oided 3 *ith the use of bag houses. mechanical cyclones. etc- as prcr-nibed in the
requirements for nev concrete and asphalt plants
The road in its greater part is far from most of inhabited areas and sensitive receptors closer than
lOOm The most critical point is the sector of the road passifug across the Prrenjas and Labinot plain
where the .ic-iniix voith apartment tlats and houses is less than lOOm- \exertheless the area is also
rather nindy. this means that the atmosphere can be easily self-cleaned attaching limited importance
to this item
7.4. Mitigation measures against impacts on flora and fauna. (Table " 4)
From the project desism. underpasses connecting both sides of the road are scheduled on average I
every 2 km in correspondence of brid-es At the same time the prolects foresees 2-3 drainane
pipelines of 0 1 -2 m everv I kmn AJthou uh the communication ways (bridges and drainage pipelines)

situation mig!ht be ameliorated bv constructing firther underpasses-
The trespassinm- of the road should be avoided in critical spots by fencint (for bi.- mammals) and bv
the presence of drainage system located at each side of the road, which is arother mitigation measure
in place In the km XX [34 km trom  Qafe e Bushitj close to Kuterman hunting reserve it is
necessarv that the area is fenced at least I Om on both sides of the small v allev and proper wildlife

The cultural heritage is tlhe product of human acti%ir carried out throueh centuries and it may be the
case t!iat rurns mnd settlements of archaele-eical importance are present in the itudx- area
The present project does not aftect the kocal heritage w%ith the exception of t h  sinall mosque in the
immediate % icinitv of the Elbasan. Due to the vicinitv of the railroad restricting the w-idening of the
road this case has to be deat with special attention It is recommended that the road is diverted and
special attention should be given to neatiae effect. due to vibration during the construction phase.
From the landscape point of views- mitigation measures for high embankments vv-ill be provided,
through the plantins of native trees. shrubs and herbaceous plants The proxision of extensive tree
plantations in suitable areas on the rixer %ides is also important
7.8. Nliti_ation measures ag.tinst impacts on road s;afety. (Table 5 8y

lavout, road barrers are the most appropriate measures to be enforced. Setting up of speed limits
and related oatroilinu from the Police service is another effiective tool
An important point the authority is called to define for the safetv of road users is to discourage the
