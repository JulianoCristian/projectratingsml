Negative\n            environmental impacts and their mitigations include the\n            following: Reduce soil erosion by planting vegetation.\n            Minimize water pollution by building drainage systems and an\n            embankment. Abate air pollution by setting up vegetation\n            screens and using unleaded gasoline. Avoid animal road\n            crossings in order to prevent injury to animal species. Set\n            up vegetal barriers to alleviate noise pollution. Land\n            acquisition will proceed in accordance with existing laws.\n            Traffic and worker accidents will be mitigated by\n            establishig speed limits and police patrols. The report\n            concludes that no significant environmental impacts will be\n            generated by constructing the Fushe-Miloti-Lezha road."}, "docdt": "1996-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
