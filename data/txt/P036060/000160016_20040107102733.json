There are several lessons to be\n            learned from this Project. They include:  (1) ADMINISTRATION\n            AND COORDINATION OF THE PROJECT: The volatile Albanian\n            public service and its low-level salaries generated\n            continuous changes in the Project Implementation Unit (PIU)\n            at the start of the Project, with subsequent interruptions\n            and damaging consequences in the day-to-day administration\n            and coordination of the Project. The Project worked out this\n            situation through the establishment, in December 1999, of a\n            PIU composed of three competent private consultants (former\n            public officials) selected under public competition,\n            seconded by the expatriate project coordinator, and paid\n            with local market fees. This decision assured a better\n            administration and a more efficient coordination to the\n            Project. A lesson learned is to apply this PIU system\n            initiated under the Project to future projects.  (2)\n            CO-FINANCING AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT EFFICIENCY: To achieve\n            the potential benefits of donors' partnership, joint\n            financing should be sought. An alternative to joint\n            financing could be establishing - in every parallel\n            financing project - a contractual requirement for every\n            donor, guaranteeing the provision and delivery of its\n            contribution in accordance with the appraised Project\n            Implementation Plan.  (3) GENERATION OF EMPLOYMENT UNDER THE\n            PROJECT: The project provides important qualitative and\n            quantitative information on how to use road investment in\n            the fight against poverty, and on how to relate, in economic\n            and social terms, the overall economic feasibility of the\n            Project to the viability of alleviating poverty in the\n            Project area. In the future apply consistently, during\n            project implementation, the monitoring system used here.\n            Future comparisons would help to determine which\n            implementation procedure is the most efficient and\n            appropriate to generate local employment. An assessment of\n            the investment required to overcome the poverty status of\n            the project area through employment is also possible.  (4)\n            LAND EXPROPRIATION: A lesson learned under the Project is\n            not to make effective the provision of funds for any\n            component before all related expropriation issues have been\n            resolved, so implementation of the component can proceed\n            undisturbed. The recent establishment of an Expropriation\n            Department within the GRD with guidelines on the\n            expropriation procedures, is a Project achievement which\n            will facilitate the application of this lesson. (5) ROAD\n            SAFETY UNDER THE PROJECT: A lesson learned is that\n            establishment and immediate operational capacity of a\n            National Road Safety Council are required to achieve road\n            safety efficiency, and that initial operational funds should\n            be included in the Project. (6) PROJECT DATA BANK, PAVEMENT\n            AND BRIDGE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS: The establishment and\n            operation of a Road Data Bank, a Road Management System, and\n            a Bridge Management System, and the provision of technical\n            assistance could not take place because of lack of funding,\n            and no further action was taken until the end of the\n            Project. Under similar circumstances, contact other\n            traditional donors informing and persuading them of the\n            importance and urgency of pending Project needs."}, "docdt": "2003-12-16T00:00:00Z"}
