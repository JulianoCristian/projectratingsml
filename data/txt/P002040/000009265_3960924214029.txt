RADUNA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT - (LOAN 1711-UNI)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Kaduna Water
Supply Project in Nigeria, for which Loan 1711-UNI in the amount of US$92.0
million was approved on May 31, 1979. The loan was closed on December 31,
1988, three years behind schedule. It was fully disbursed and the last
disbursement was on July 7, 1989.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure Division of the
Western Africa Department (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III).
Part II was prepared by the Borrower after receiving Parts I and III from
the Bank.
Preparation of this PCR was started in October 1989 and is
based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report; the Loan, Guarantee, and
Project Agreements; supervision reports; correspondence between the Bank
and the Borrower; and internal Bank memoranda.

KADUNA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT - (LOAN 1711-UNI)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Evaluation Summary
Objectives
The Project Objective was to assist in improving the supply of
drinking water in the city of Kaduna by increasing the quantity, improving
the quality and ensuring a socially more equitable distribution of potable
water. More specifically, the project intended to eliminate shortages
caused by production constraints, double the distribution system to reach
at least 85 percent of the population and provide all connected consumers
with an uninterrupted supply of safe water and strengthen Kaduna State
Water Board's (KSWB) management capacity (para 3.01). To achieve this
objective, the project included new production, storage and distribution
facilities, operating facilities (workshops, offices, communications) as
well as institutional support (para 3.02).
Implementation Experience
The loan was approved on May 31, 1979, signed on July 16, 1979
and declared effective on July 22, 1980; closing date, originally scheduled
on December 31, 1985 was postponed until December 31, 1988, because of
repeated delays in project implementation. Three major factors seriously
hampered the project implementation schedule, i.e., (i) the political and
institutional instability in both Kaduna State Government (KSG) and KSWB,
throughout the implementation period; (ii) the lack of counterpart funds
during the first half of the implementation period (1980-1984); and (iii)
major procurement problems, resulting in long delays in physical
implementation (para 5.01).
KWSB's management capacity started deteriorating soon after
project start-up, when a number of qualified expatriates left without being
replaced by Nigerians. Later on, in September 1987, when Kaduna State was
split into Kaduna and Katsina States, KSWB lost a group of qualified
professionals and its management capacity worsened again (paras 4.02 and
5.03). In addition to poor management, XSWB's financial situation--which
was sound at appraisal--suffered from inadequate tariffs, lax billing and
collection procedures and the increasing failure of government to pay its
water bills. This deterioration was exacerbated by the sharp devaluation
of the Naira (para 4.05). For a long time, KSWB and KSG ignored the Bank's
recommendations to hire technical assistance in the most critical areas of
management (para 5.05).



- iii -
Results
Most of the physical facilities were completed at closing date.
The level of service in Kaduna City has manifestly improved, especially in
the low-income areas. But the lack of reliable indicators prevents
quantifying this improvement in terms of level of service (paras 6.01 and
6.02). Water quality also improved as a result of the construction of a
new treatment plant. However, water quality problems arising from the
small old treatment plant that was located downstream of the city still
persist (para. 6.03).
The project failed to strengthen the institution in the face of
severe economic dislocations facing the economy. Although profitable in
1978, KSWB accumulated financial losses throughout the project period.
Despite its limited role, technical assistance was able to produce a
significant impact in training and in commercial operations (paras 6.05-
6.07).
Sustainability
As a result of the deterioration of KSWB's management capacity
and financial situation, there is no reason to believe that the physical
infrastructure financed under the project can be operated on a sustainable
basis in a well-managed institutional environment as originally envisaged
in the project concept (para. 7.01).
Findings and lessons learned
Sone major lessons can be learned from this project:
(a) when needed, technical assistance should be clearly identified
at appraisal; more consideration should be given to local
technical assistance, as far as possible;
(b) a program for the reduction of unaccounted-for-water, including
training should be systematically included in any water project;
(c) a limited number of indicators should be carefully selected, for
implementation monitoring, as well as for evaluation of project
achievement; and
(d) greater attention should be given by Bank staff during
supervision to ensuring that tests of water quality are carried
out that include testing for heavy metals so that appropriate
action can be taken. This requires that satisfactory
arrangements are in hand for testing of raw water samples either
in-house or through contract.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PART Is PROJECT REVIEW FROM BANRK'S PERSPECTIVE
1. Project Identity
Project Name:        Kaduna Water Supply Project
Loan Number:         1711-UNI
RVP Unit:            Western Africa Department - Infrastructure Division
Country.             Nigeria
Sector:              Water Supply and Sewerage
Sub-Sector:          Water Supply
2. Background
2.01      Nigeria, with an estimated population of about 80 million at the
time of appraisal, is the most populous country in Africa. Kaduna State,
formerly North Central State, covered an area of 69,500 sq. km. before it
was split into Kaduna State and Katsina State in September 1987. In 1978,
the population of Kaduna State was estimated just over 6 million. The
population of the capital city was estimated at 650,000; projections for
years 1990 and 2000 indicate a total population of 1.5 and 2.2 million
respectively.
2.02      Water supply, in both urban and rural areas, in Kaduna State, as
in Nigeria overall, is the State's responsibility. The Kaduna State Water
Board (KSWB) established in 1971 is responsible for providing water for
domestic, industrial, and agricultural purposes throughout the State, the
Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources and Rural Development
(FMAWRRD) being responsible for planning and development of water
resources. Surface water is the only alternative in Kaduna State for urban
supply and dams are generally needed, since rivers are not perennial or
have little flow in the dry season. Kaduna River is perennial but a
storage reservoir (Kangimi Dam) was erected in 1978 upstream of Kaduna City
to release water when necessary.
2.03      The Kaduna State Government (KSG) gave high priority to
improving water supply and allocated about one-sixth of its capital budget
for the period 1975-1980 to KSWB for water supply projects. The level of
service in Kaduna District in the 1970s was high in low-density areas but
in high-density areas only 60 to 702 of the low income population had
access to piped water through private connections or public standpipes.
3. Project Objectives and Description
3.01      The project intended to assist in strengthening Kaduna City's
water supply system by increasing the quantity, improving the quality and
ensuring a socially more equitable distribution of potable water. Because



-2-
of the already large unsatisfied demand for water and the expected high
rate of population growth, the expansion of the water supply system
envisaged under the project was not supposed to meet total requirements.
However, the project intended to eliminate shortages caused by production
constraints, double the distribution system to reach at least 85 percent of
the population, provide all connected consumers with an uninterrupted
supply of safe water and strengthen KSWB's management.
3.02      Originally, the project was designed to be implemented over the
period 1979-1985, and included the following components:
(a) Water Supply Facility in the Kaduna City District
(i)     construction of a raw water intake in the Kaduna River
with a capacity of 300,000 cu.m.lday and a pumping
station with an initial capacity of 150,000 cu.m./day;
(ii)     construction of a water treatment plant with a
capacity of 150,000 cu.m.Iday;
(iii)     construction of six storage reservoirs and
installation of 16 pump sets;
(iv)     supply and laying of about 37 km of transmission mains
and 300 km of distribution pipelines, and installation
of 250 public standpipes in unserved areas; and
{v)     rehabilitation of the city's North waterworks (not
included in the SAR but mentioned in the Report of the
President)
(b)  Operating Facilities
Mi)     construction of new headquarters offices, central
workshop and meter repair workshop; and
(ii)     installation of facilities for communication between
the major KSWB offices and water supply facilities in
Kaduna and throughout the State;
(c) Institutional Support and Technical Assistance
ti)     strengthening of KSWB management and organization;
(ii)     expansion and improvement of formal and in-service
training; and
(iii)     provision of consulting services.
3.03      The total cost of the project for the 3riginal implementation
period (1979-1985) was estimated at US$158.4 million equivalent including
taxes and duties of US$4.7 million equivalent. The Bank's loan financed the
foreign exchange component estimated at US$92.0 million i.e. 58Z of the



-3-
project cost; this loan was onlent by the borrower--the Federal Government
of Nigeria(FGN)--to the KSG, which further onlent it to the KSWB. The local
component was to be financed by KSG (US$38.0 million equivalent) as well as
by KSWB (US$28.4 million equivalent) from internal cash generation. The
loan, originally scheduled to close on December 31, 1985, was actually
closed three years later.
4. Project Design and Organization
4.01      This project, the first assisted by the Bank in the urban water
supply sector in Nigeria, was initiated in 1974, and a first project
appraisal took place in April 1975. At this point, due to major political
changes and subsequent major institutional changes in KSWB, further
processing of th.e project stopped and significant changes in the project
design and scope were then proposed by KSWB, necessitating a fresh re-
start of the appraisal process. In the meantime, both RSG and FGN
repeatedly expressed interest in Bank participation in the project.
Eventually, after a long stop-and-go period, the project was appraised
again in May-June 1978, without substantial changes. It essentially
comprised the expansion of the water production, transmission and
distribution facilities for the city of Kaduna, to meet the water demand
for the next 10 years. Board presentation took place on May 31, 1979, loan
signature on July 16, 1979, and effectiveness was declared on July 22,
1980.
4.02      The project concept was clear from the very beginning and, in
spite of initial divergences about the scope of the project, was shared by
all relevant parties. As the first Bank-assisted urban water supply
project in Nigeria, the project apparently, did not try to be very
innovative; the only relative innovation could have been the inclusion of a
small sanitation component which, eventually, was wi*hdrawn from the
project, at the Borrower's request. The project, indeed, was conceived as
a purely urban water supply project focusing essentially on the expansion
of the existing system. As such, it was well prepared, reasonably
ambitious and comprehensive, with due consideration to urban development
and environmental issues.  The breakdown in institutional capacity, which
began soon after project startup with the exodus of qualified expatriates
and the subsequent loss of qualified professionals when Kaduna State was
split into Kaduna and Katsina States, could not have been foreseen at the
time of appraisal. At that time, KSWB had a full complement of expatriates
and new ones were still coming on stream.  The State Government's policy of
not employing out-of-state Nigerians was well known but the Government was
not prepared to change its policy. The extensive training program (as
designed) was aimed at alleviating this situation. It seems, however, that
little consideration was originally given to the rehabilitation of existing
facilities. Rehabilitation of the North treatment works was not included
in the SAR, but was peculiarly introduced in the Report of the President.
4.03      All technical, financial and institutional issues were addressed
in the project design. It is disappointing that a distribution system
study which was provided for under the project did not lead to the design
of a leakage control program. The consultant appointed was against the
strong objection of the Bank; a complete failure resulted in the study
undertaken. At the time of appraisal, 452 of water produced was



-4-
unaccounted for.  The SAR estimated that a 25Z reduction could be achieved
through billing and collection and through a survey of illegal connections.
The study was intended to address reduction of physical losses in existing
mains.
4.04      After abandonment of the sanitation component, the only State
agency involved was the KSWB, under tutelage of the KSG. Their respective
roles and responsibilities were clearly defined and understood in the SAR
and in the Kaduna State and Project Agreements, as well as in the Loan
Agreement signed with the Federal Government.
4.05      At the time of appraisal, KSWB's financial operations were found
satisfactory, and with some profitability, to the point that a substantial
contribution to the project cost (18X) was expected from KSWB. However,
some deficiencies were taen identified, such as a high level of
unaccounted-for water, lack of effective billing and collection practices,
a large number of unregistered connections and inadequate tariff levels and
structures. A comprehensive financial plan was prepared before loan
negotiation to address those issues. It was agreed in particular that the
water tariffs would increase annually by 15? and all financial projections
were based on this assumption, which subsequently proved both politically
unacceptable and financially insufficient, particularly with the sharp
deterioration of the Naira.
5. Project Implementation
5.01      Final completion of the project was scheduled for 1984 with the
loan closing date on December 31, 1985. But, due to repeated delays in
project implementation, the closing date was extended three times until
December 31, 1988, when the project was eventually declared closed.
Whereas no significant deviation was noticed in the project scope, the
project implementation was frequently disrupted, in spite of vigilant Bank
supervision. The main reasons for this hectic implementation are: (i)
major procurement problems; (ii) lack of counterpart funds; (iii) political
and institutional instability in the KSG and KSWB; and (iv) state
government's reluctancy to approie tariff increases.
5.02      The Bank's guidelines for procurement were frequently ignored
for contract awarding, and procurement disagreements between the Borrower
and the Bank led to long delays, and subsequently to unexpected cost
overruns. Tender evaluation procedures were tedious and lengthy. The
average time between bid evaluation and contract award was reported to be
more than a year essentially because of KSG's interference in the
procurement process. It is worth noting that a long misunderstanding arose
with a local consultant who prepared tender documents for ICB, which did
not comply with the Bank's guidelines; since Bank-assisted projects employ
more and more local consultants, who are generally not aware of the Bank's
guidelines, some basic information on the Bank's procurement procedures
should be geared specifically towards these needs.
5.03      Operation and maintenance deteriorated throughout the
implementation of the pruject due to poor management. The project
implementation period (1980-1988) was marked by frequent and unpredictable
changes in KSWB's top management, reflecting the many changes in the State



-5-
Government; not less than seven different General Managers succeeded one
another during this period, without prior consultation with the Bank, in
contravention of the Kaduna State Agreement. Equally important was the
gradual deterioration of KSWB's management capacity, with the loss of more
than twenty qualified asian expatriates who were not replaced by Nigerians;
their departure considerably weakened the Water Board who, for a long time.
declined the repeated suggestions of Bank missions to provide technical
assistance in the most critical areas of management. Moreover, in late
1987, when Kaduna State was split into Kaduna and Katsina States, a number
of competent professional staff left for Katsina, accelerating the
deterioration process.
5.04      Six.ce project inception, provision of counterpart funds from KSG
has been erratic, and notably insufficient to meet the project requirements
and, as a result, one of the major contractors demobilized temporarily. At
the insistence of Bank mission members, KSG resumed in 1984 regular
installments of counterpart funds up tc the end of the project. Because of
the rapid deterioration of its financial situation, KSWB has been unable to
significantly contribute to the project costs, as originally scheduled.
Indeed, this situation was exacerbated by the dramatic devaluation of the
Naira and its consequences on the prices of products (chemicals, spare
parts) imported by KSWB for its operations.
5.05      Financiai projections at the time of appraisal were based on
regular tariff increases of 152 per year. In fact, very limited increases
were approved by the State Government, in spite of very frequent reminders
from Bank supervision staff. Within the implementation period (1980-
1988), the basic rate (flat rate for domestic consumers) oaly doubled from
N7.50 to 115.00 per month, while the inflation was high and the Naira was
devalued in the ratio of 10 to 1. Federal and State Governments unpaid
water bills increased from N2 million in 1980 to 120 million in 1987 i.e.,
more than a year of KSWB billing. But at the time of appraisal, arrears
from Federal and State Governments to KSWB were not considered a serious
problem.  But the financial problems of KSWB reflected to a large extent,
not only the inadequacy of KSG support over tariffs and its own
indebtedness to KSWB, but the gradual weakening of KSWB's Finance
Department throughout project implementation. KSWB's financial performance
continuously and inexorably deteriorated and Bank proposals to improve the
situation through technical assistance were ignored.
5.06      The new water supply system is generally very conventional in
its design, and there was no real alternative in most of the technological
options; however, the sophisticated solution adopted for the treatment
plant might lead to operation and maintenance difficulties. The water
quality analyses in the two laboratories were reviewed by successive
missions. The systems and procedures were found to be deficient, but no
action was taken by KSWB. The situation might have improved during the
period after commissioning of the plant as it was being run by the
treatment plant supplier for one year.
5.07      At appraisal, the total cost was estimated at US$158.4 million
(H102.8 million), with a foreign exchange component of US$92.0 million
(N59.6 million), representing total foreign costs financed by the Bank.
The foreign component was estimated high, because the contractors to be



-6-
involved would rely extensively on imported equipment and expatriate
supervisory staff. Also, at the time of appraisal, a higher price
contingency than the Bank guidelines allowed was applied to compensate the
special conditions applicable to Nigeria--a tendancy of higher prices for
goods shipped due to special requirements (import inspections and payment
conditions). Over time, a reallocation of funds was approved by the Bank,
as the exact figures under the various disbursement categories became
clear. At the closing date, the project totalled US$122.0 million
equivalent, a decrease of 22.62 compared to appraisal estimates. However,
actual costs expressed in local currency are higher than appraisal
estimates 202 due to higher-than-anticipated devaluation, coupled with a
higher level of inflation. The financing of the Bank totalled 752 of the
total project cost and KSG and KSWB financed 25Z. The above project cost
does not include the outstanding costs of still incompleted works
(rehabilitation of the North treatment works and construction of
headquarter buildings).
5.08      Disbursements have been very slow; at the end of the originally
scheduled project implementation period (early 1985), only US$25 million,
i.e. 272 of the appraisal estimate, and 33? of the country disbursement
profile had been disbursed. This very poor performance in disbursing loan
funds mainly stems from lengthy procurement procedures and decisions, and
lack of timely availability of counterpart funds. The last disbursement
was processed on July 7, 1989.
6. Project Results
6.01      Most of the proposed physical facilities have been completed
with long delays; however, at loan closing date (December 31, 1988) the
headquarters building and the rehabilitation works at the old North
treatment plant were still uncompleted.
6.02      The level of service in Kaduna City has been manifestly improved
by the installation of some 10,000 service connections and 150 standpipes
in the low-income areas. Unfortunately, these improvements were not
complemented by a systematic metering program as such a program would first
hinge on the completion of a distribution system study. And the study
undertaken was a failure stemming from the choice of consultant appointed,
even against strong Bank objection.
6.03      Water quality also improved as a result of the construction of a
new treatment plant. However, water quality problems arising from the
small old treatment plant that was located downstream of the city still
persist. The appraisal report noted that pollution problems of the Kaduna
River were serious at the location of the Kaduna South treatment plant, and
recommended that it be closed or rehabilitated. Nevertheless, possibly
because of deterioration in operation of the other existing treatment
facility at Kaduna North, the Kaduna South plant was kept in operation. In
1984, a study by Amadu Bello University reported high levels of pollution
of the Kaduna River at the Kaduna South intake, particularly as regards
trace metals, some of which were at a level several times WHO standards.
Apparently, water has not been routinely tested for heavy metals by KSWB,
and the routine biological and chemical analyses that are carried out do
not reveal the extent of pollution from trace metals.



-7-
6.04      Although very low, the ratio of connections/staff in Kaduna City
increused significantly (from 40 to 67). Project results are difficult to
evaluate on the basis of the monitoring indicators proposed in the Staff
Appraisal Report; some indicators, like population (the last census was in
1963) or volume of water billed (most of the connections are not metered)
were unrealistic and finally useless.
6.05      The institutional component of the project is definitely very
disappointing, and can be classified as a failure. From profitable in
1978, the KSWB accumulated financial losses throughout the project. This
rapid deterioration of the institution stemmed from: (i) the numerous
changes and constant weakening of KSWB's top management level; (ii) the
loss of quialified expatriate staff not replaced by equivalent Nigerians
even though some out-of-state qualified candidates were available; (iii)
the departure in September 1987 of competent staff to Katsina subsequent to
the split of .aduna State; (iv) KSG's strong reluctance to consider tariff
increases; (v) the vertiginous increase of accounts receivables from
Federal and State Governments throughout the project period; and (vi)
changes in the exchange rate which dramatically increased costs without
increasing revenues. Operation and maintenance, which were very poor at
the time of appraisal, have not improved tangibly throughout the project.
6.06      KSWB's financial performance was very poor during project
implementation. Losses grew from 0.1 million in 1979 to 29.6 million in
1987. Annexes 9a-9c of Part III show how KSWB's financial situation
evolved over time; the improvement in the years 1983-1986 may result from
tariff increases and savings in administrative expenses, but is actually
artificial, since the dramatic revaluation of KSWB's assets was only taken
into account in 1987. Both operating and working ratios seriously
dcteriorated during project implementation. The submis3ion of audited
accounts were between one and almost three years behind schedule. The
Auditors' conclusions confirmed Bank's concerns about fixed assets,
improper accounting, inadequate store control, etc. Thus, the financial
plan worked out during project preparation has manifestly failed,
essentially because of the incompetence of KSWB's financial management,
compounded by KSG's lack of support in approving adequate and timely tariff
increases, and FGN and KSG's unwillingness to settle their water bills.
Due to the unreliability of data relating to water consumption, it has not
been possible to determine economic and financial rates of return for the
project.
6.07      The training component was ambitious and focused mostly on
supervisory staff but, after a good start with the production of 12
training modules, the training program languished, failing a permanent and
competent training manager and expanded training facilities; however,
training materials are now available to KSWB and training could be
reactivated easily. Technical assistance eventually started in 1986 with
focus on billing and collection (Customer Management Modernization) due to
the existing system having been abused and reduction of unaccounted-for
water. Too little and too late, this technical assistance has had a
limited impact on KSWB's performance; however, some concrete actions
developed by the technical assistance for KSWB's commercial operations
(customer enumeration, billing computerization, etc.) have been quite
useful and are still carried on by KSWB's staff. Technical assistance from



-8-
local experts, available in Nigeria, could have been considered; such
assistance, which is less costly and much more culturally adaptsd, might
have been more acceptable to the Borrower, although KSWB was disappointed
by the performance of local consultants.
7. Project Sustainability
7.01      From 1980, KSWB's financial situation has been deteriorating and
this tendency is continuing. Weaknesses in management have not been
addressed and no recent improvement has been noticed in this respect
particularly in operation and maintenance. For these reasons, no
sustainability of the project can reasonably be expected, unless
significant changes occur in KSWB's management and in KSG's support in the
very near future (paras. 5.03 & 5.04, 6.05 & 6.06).
8. Bank Performance
8.01      Taking into consideration that this project was the first Bank
projezt in the water sector, Bank performed quite well during the
identification and preparation stages. At that time, the Bank was not
familiar with sector constraints and could not have foreseen the magnitude
of institutional problems that developed during implementation (e.g. the
exodus of qualified expatriates, the split of Kaduna into two states and
the impact on project staffing), or the macro-economic dislocations facing
the economy. Though it seems more emphasis could have been placed on
rehabilitation.
8.02      Bank supervision has been very stable (same supervision team
throughout project implementation), and vigilant; and Bank staff
obstination has probably avoided a total failure of the project. It is
worth noting that the Bank did not benefit from any support from the
Federal Government, e.g., on the counterpart funds issue.
9. Borrower Performance
9.01      KSWB's performance did not improve throughout the project.
Senior management has been poor and unstable without commitment to
productivity and efficiency. It has been reluctant for too long to accept
technical assistance, while KSWB's situation was visibly deteriorating in
all areas of management. Dialogue between KSWB and KSG was frequently
difficult.
9.02      Changes in KSG as well as the split of Kaduna State into Kaduna
and Katsina States contributed to KSWB's instability and weakness. KSG's
interferences in the procurement process were chiefly responsible for the
long delays in procurement decisions. KSG's inaction on tariff increase is
partly responsible for the deterioration of KSWB's financial situation. An
ambitious document prepared by KSG in 1985, aiming at increasing the
autonomy of State parastatals, did not receive any application whatsoever.
9.03      The project management of KSWB was adequate and, with the help
of Bank missions, is to be credited for the completion of almost all
physical components.



9-
10. Project Relationship
10.01     Relationship between the Bank and the Borrower, i.e., KSG and
KSWB, experienced ups and downs; the very frequent changes of interlocutors
have not permitted a constructive dialogue. It is to be noted that, at the
worst moment of the project (November 1984), the Bank envisaged remedies to
simply close the loan.
11. Consultants and Contractors
11.01     Quality of performance from consultants and contractors was
variable but in general, and in spite of real difficulties (shortage of
local materials such as cement, lack of counterpart funds) etc.., they
performed reasonably well and cannot be held responsible for delays in
project implementation.
12. Proiect Documentation and Data
12.01     This PCR has been prepared after consulting the available
documentation (SAR, legal agreements, project correspondence file, project
management reports, supervision mission reports, audited accounts), a visit
to Kaduna and discussion with KSWB's staff and interviews with Bank staff
involved in implementation of the project.
12.02.    Legal agreements, i.e., Loan Agreement, Kaduna State Agreement
and Project Agreement, were generally comprehensive and dealt adequately
with the issues at the time of appraisal.
12.03     Supervision mission reports provide a good comprehensive picture
of the situation. However, there is a lack of continuity between them, and
it is sometimes difficult to get an idea of the evolution of the situation
between two supervision missions. This problem should no long occur with
the newly adopted Form 590.

KADUNA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT -_(LOAN 1711-UNI)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PART 1I: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
:.   'introduction
Up to the middle seventies, the level of service in Kaduna City
was generally good. However, from the late seventies until the
commissioning of the new water treatment plant in 1987. the level of
service was inadeauate. This was due to a combination of population growth
ana deteriorating piant and equipment.
2.   Proiect Objectives
2.01      It should be mentioned that although institutional support was
one of the goals of the proiect. it was poorly defined initially.
Furthermore, successive Bank missions did not pay as much attention to
institutional support as they did to the implementation of the physical
components of the project. Since human resource is perhaps the more
important resource, the Bank might have been more aggressive in supporting
and supervising the KSWB in this regard.
3.   Project Design and Organization
3.01      The managerial authority of both the Project Management and KSWB
Management was too low compared to the responsibility and decisions that
needed to be taken regularly on the project.
3.02      Many members of the Board of Directors of the KSWB during the
period 1980-1989 lacked the desired level of expertise to support their
role. Only a few members had the requisite professional qualifications,
experience and exposure in the areas of engineering, legal and personnel
matters, finance and operations/project management. As a result, the
contribution of the Board of Directors was often limited in appropriately
guiding the KSWB.
3.03      The project design should have provided for rehabilitation,
leakage control and early introduction and use of computers as a managerial
and design tool. The training needs and training methodology for the KSWB
was not sufficiently articulated and designed.
3.04      Design parameters such as per capita demand, proportions of
population to be served by house connections and public stand taps, growth
in demand, etc., were not sufficiently defined.



- 11 -
4.   Project Implementation
4.01      The project scope was increased by (i) extending the
distribution network beyond the original design, and (ii) the addition of
the rehabilitation of the old works to the project. The north western
parts of the town, notably parts of Tudun Wada, Kabala West and the whole
of Rigasa Wards were later additions.
4.02      The four reasons cited in paragraph 5.01 of the PCR on Project
Implementation are objective.
4.03      The effect of the loss of Asian personnel and later staff of
Katsina State on the performance of Kaduna State Water Board is grossly
exaggerated. Most Asians were recruited in the early 70s when many water
projects were under execution. These projects were completed before or by
1975. The down turn in the economy halted significantly the construction
of all schemes, rendering many of these Asians semi-idle. Their departure
was to a large extent desirable. Also, the professional quality of most,
was at best average.
4.04      The personnel that left for Katsina (upon the creation of
Katsina State) did not include a professionally qualified accountant. Only
five were graduate engineers of which three were relatively in-experienced
and were not performing critical functions. The staff that replaced the
two most senior engineers were more qualified and more experienced than
their predecessors. The relatively poor performance of the KSWB in respect
of operation and maintenance was as a result of its poor financial
performance. Since without funds, investments could not be adequately made
to operationalize innovative ideas.
4.05      The rehabilitation of the existing water works was a later
addition and thus not part of the original estimated project cost.
Similarly the distribution network was extended during project
implementation. If these additions are considered, the cost over-run would
be less than 18.7Z.
5.   Project Results
5.01      As rightly mentioned, a systematic metering program was not
implemented to quantitatively monitor system performance. The KSWB has
recently identified this weakness and is now installing more meters.
Unfortunately this new initiative is hindered by financial constraints, and
can only be implemented slowly.
5.02      To improve the institutional aspects of the KSWB there is need
for clear guidelines on the qualifications and experience of candidates to
be appointed to the Board of Directors, and the Office of the General
Manager. The necessity of the right leadership cannot be over-emphasized.
The political will of the Gover.anent to guarantee reasonable tenure of the
Board of Directors and General Manager would be helpful. In this regard
there is need for the Edict establishiag the Water Board to be amended
accordingly.



- 12 -
5.03      The relatively low remuneration for the Board hinders the
employment and retention of capable senior managers who could contribute
their knowledge and experience in improving the performance of the Board.
Thus, the bureaucratic managerial environment within which the Board has
been operating is a big obstacle to institutional improvement. There is
still a need for technical assistance to improve KSIWB as an institution.
5.04      Poor financial performance has been merely due to low tariffs
and poor marketing policies of the RSWB--customers generally think that
water should be free, partly from past Government attitudes. An
appropriate customer information, education and commtnications program on a
continuous basis has been lacking.
6.   Conclusion
6.01      Although the institutional component of the project has not been
much of a success, the project cannot be described as a failure. The water
supply in Kaduna City has been improved significantly resulting in improved
public health, industrial productivity and enhanced positive economic
development. The social and economic gains to the City and the State more
than compensates the financial losses to the Board.
6.02      The KSWB has been exposed as a result of the project, to modern
techniques of management, especially in the areas of computers and project
management and the need tJ understand and appreciate itself as an
enterprise, requiring the employment of concepts and methods that all other
successful and modern enterprises use.
6.03      Senior Management of KSWB now have a better appreciation of the
Board's institutional weaknesses as a result of the Bank's efforts. Thus a
basis for improved performance in the future has been laid.
