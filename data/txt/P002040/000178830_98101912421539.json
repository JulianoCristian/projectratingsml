It will provide for the construction of a raw\n            water intake and pumping station, water treatment plant,\n            about 37 km of transmission mains and 300 km of distribution\n            pipelines, and about 250 public standpipes. The project will\n            also provide KSWB with workshop, meter repair, and\n            communication and office facilities. It will also strengthen\n            KSWB's management and organization, expand and improve\n            formal and in-service training, and provide consulting services."}, "docdt": "1979-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
