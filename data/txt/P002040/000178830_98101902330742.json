The project will\n            also provide KSWB with workshop, meter repair, and\n            communication and office facilities. It will also strengthen\n            KSWB's management and organization, expand and improve\n            formal and in-service training, and provide consulting services."}, "docdt": "1979-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
