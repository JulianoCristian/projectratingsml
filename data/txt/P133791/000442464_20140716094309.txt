F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (PDOs):

The main Program Development Objectives (PDOs) of the Public Expenditure Policy Based Guarantee (PEPBG)
were to help FYR Macedonia respond to the economic slowdown triggered by the worsening Eurozone outlook by
strengthening public financial management practices and eliminating VAT refund and payment arrears; 1 improving
the efficiency of service provision in the health sector; and strengthening social protection and inclusion. In parallel,
the PEPBG assisted FYR Macedonia to implement a borrowing strategy to maintain sustainable fiscal accounts by
tapping funding from the international bank loan market, on improved terms. In line with the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) policy on PBGs, the PEPBG helped to expand the country’s investor base
as the commercial bank sold participation notes and shares to international investors.

In line with these objectives, the Government used the PEPBG to borrow EUR250 million in January 2013, covering
46 percent of the total financing requirement in 2013 at a reasonable cost (3.915 percent interest rate) 2 in two
tranches of 5 and 7 years maturity. The PEPBG also improved the leverage of the Bank’s capital by allowing FYR
Macedonia to contract a sizable commercial loan of EUR 250 million out of which only 62 percent, i.e. EUR155
million, equivalent of US$201.5 million, was guaranteed by IBRD.

  The PEPBG focused on the clearance of arrears on VAT refunds and payments of goods and services that are recorded in the
central government treasury. These arrears amounted to about 1-2 percent of GDP by September 2012. They did not include
arrears to the Health Insurance Fund and Health Care Institutions. These arrears were treated under the Policy Based Guarantee
(PBG) 2011 for FYR Macedonia and not covered under the PEPBG since all public health institutions are covered under a
separate Health Single Treasury Account.

  There was a EUR75 million unguaranteed loan contracted on 7/12/12, with a maturity of 5 years and which carried an interest
rate of 6.465 percent.

  As mentioned above, this indicator referred to payments recorded in the central government treasury.

1.      Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1       Context at Appraisal

The Economic Situation at Appraisal

1.       The Public Expenditure Policy Based Guarantee (PEPBG), was requested by the Government as
the gradual recovery during 2010 and the first half of 2011 appeared increasingly threatened by the
worsening Eurozone outlook. By June 2012, it became clear that growth in Germany, Italy and Greece,
which are among FYR Macedonia’s key trading partners, was slowing down, sharply reducing demand
for Macedonian exports. In FYR Macedonia, real output growth of 2.9 percent in 2010 and nearly 4.7
percent in the first half of 2011, was reduced to 1 percent in the second half of 2011 and turned negative
in the first half of 2012, driven by a slow-down in exports. . Real GDP growth contracted in 2012 and the
current account deficit in terms of GDP widened from 2.5 percent in 2011 to 3.0 percent in 2012 (Table
1).

2.       The Government was concerned that the output contraction in 2012, and the uncertain economic
environment would adversely affect living conditions, in particular for lower income Macedonians. In the
past, FYR Macedonia faced challenges promoting shared prosperity and inclusion. Overall inequality as
measured by the Gini coefficient, increased from 37 to 40 percent between 2003 and 2008. Similarly,
although overall consumption (based on household survey data) grew by 1.1 percent p.a. over the same
period, consumption for the bottom 40 percent declined by 1.5 percent p.a. The most recent Survey on
Income and Living Conditions (SILC) showed that in 2010 nearly 27.3 percent of the population lived in
poverty and in 2012, unemployment, the main threat to inclusive growth, though falling slowly, remained
high at about 31 percent of the labor force 4.

3.      The Government proactively responded to economic slowdown and its adverse social
consequences through significant fiscal stimulus, increasing social and capital spending. Between 2011
and 2012, capital spending of the central government increased from 3.9 to 4.1 percent of GDP and social
spending from 19.7 to 20.8 percent of GDP. In parallel, the Government continued its policy of a freeze
of public sector wages, which held the public sector wage bill to the same level in 2012 as in 2011. To
encourage growth, the Government implemented measures to improve credit availability for the private
sector by providing additional capital for the Macedonian Bank for Development Promotion and a
sovereign guarantee for an European Investment Bank (EIB) loan to the small and medium enterprise
(SME) sector. In addition, in line with the Government’s objective of improving FYR Macedonia’s
competiveness and supported by the Bank’s First Competitiveness DPL (November 30, 2012), the
Government implemented a number of measures to improve competitiveness. These included measures
to improve the environment for high value added manufacturing and agribusiness; improve trade logistics
and labor market flexibility. The fiscal deficit on a cash basis widened from 2.5 percent in 2011 to 3.9
percent in 2012 and the government built up arrears in the central Government treasury on VAT refunds
and payments on goods and services, which together amounted to about 1-2 percent of GDP by
September 2012. In addition, the health sector, which has its own treasury function, had payments
obligations amounting to nearly 0.5 percent of GDP by end 2012 5. Growth in 2012, still, turned negative
but was significantly above the regional average.




4
  Youth unemployment rates are exceptionally high. More than 56 percent of the active population aged 15-25 years
is unemployed.
5
   In DPL1 and in the first PBG operation the Bank had assisted with the creation of the separate treasury function
for all public health institutions which helped reduce public health sector arrears.

4.       Financing needs in 2013 were projected to be high in the Program Document due to a sustained
fiscal deficit and a maturing Eurobond. In September 2012, the Government publicly acknowledged the
presence of arrears, and included provisions in the 2013 budget to eliminate them by February 2013,
which widened the 2013 fiscal deficit. Wages and salaries were budgeted to remain flat in line with the
Government’s policy of the freeze on wages. Current expenditures were budgeted to increase by 4.6
percent in nominal terms compared to the 2012 budget mainly to accommodate the preannounced
increase in pensions. Capital expenditures were budgeted to increase by nearly 18.2 percent compared to
the 2012 outturn mainly to stimulate construction activity and were expected to be financed through
external loans. In addition, a large payment (EUR 175 million) on a maturing Eurobond was falling due
in early 2013 and increased the Government’s financing need. At appraisal, the Government’s 2013
budgetary financing needs amounted to about EUR 545 million. Even if the Government had rolled over
all the domestic debt, borrowed a small amount of EUR 59 million domestically and drawn down
Government deposits (EUR 175 million), it would still have been left with an external financing gap of
about EUR 320 million (59 percent of the total financing requirement), which, given the turmoil in the
Euromarkets seemed a very risky financing strategy.

Rationale for the PEPBG operation

5.       Against the background of large financing needs and an uncertain external environment, the
Government of FYR Macedonia approached the Bank in late 2012 for a PEPBG to tap funding from the
international loan market at a reasonable cost as a part of its overall borrowing strategy. In developing its
borrowing strategy, the choice of a policy based guarantee (PBG) as the appropriate instrument was
guided by three considerations:

First, increased domestic borrowing was not a viable option. While domestic banks were liquid, it would
have been very difficult to borrow the needed EUR 200 to 300 million with 5-7 year maturity from
domestic banks. The domestic market did not have enough large institutional investors and the cost of
borrowing would have been high.

 Second, despite having sound fundamentals, the option of borrowing from the commercial market
without a guarantee was very expensive and risky. Although FYR Macedonia had borrowed from the
private commercial market in the past without a high grade guarantee 6, plans to raise EUR 250 million in
market funding at a five year maturity earlier in 2012 partly failed and had to be scaled down to EUR 75
million. The financing was arranged with a high interest cost of 6.456 percent p.a. Finally, at appraisal,
market soundings suggested that, given the Eurozone turmoil, in the absence of a high-grade guarantee,
FYR Macedonia could access the international markets only at a spread of 650-700 bps over EURIBOR
(about 8 percent in aggregate). A number of financial institutions were skeptical that such a transaction
could even be closed at that time.

Third, the Government preferred a PBG to backstop a commercial loan, rather than a public bond 7
issuance for three reasons: (i) transaction risk of engaging lending banks directly was lower, and pricing
could be guaranteed ex ante through a loan, while the cost structure of a bond would be more difficult to
lock in earlier and would be more vulnerable to market volatility at closing; (ii) a, bond issue of the
targeted size would be considered relatively small and therefore illiquid for bond investors, which would
hamper the efficiency of the pricing and trading of the instrument,8 and (iii) the pricing efficiency for a
bond would be capped by the credit rating of the instrument, which would improve only marginally from
the underlying issuer rating, a consideration which does not generally exist with non-rated commercial
bank loans.

6.       The Bank moved quickly to assist the Government in responding to the deteriorating economic
situation by supporting its reform program as well as helping with the overall borrowing strategy. The
Bank modified the 2011-14 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) as set out in the CPS progress report on
November 1, 2012. The modifications included a development policy loan (DPL) topped with crisis
response financing, selected investment lending and addressing FYR Macedonia’s knowledge and
capacity building needs through AAA. The CPS progress report also included a second PBG to support
the Government’s borrowing strategy for 2013. In line with this strategy, in 2012, the Bank carried out
analytical work and a DPL operation to improve competitiveness in November 2012. The Bank had an
ongoing Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) operation, which contributed to formulating the reforms in
social protection. The PBG approved in November 2011 supported reforms in public finance
management, health sector, social protection, and competitiveness. The deteriorating economic situation

  FYR Macedonia had borrowed twice from the international bond market, with widely varying results. In 2005,
strong credit fundamentals and favorable market conditions allowed the Government to issue a 10-year global bond
at a spread of 120 bp (or 4.625 percent coupon). But in 2009, global financial turmoil led to a far less favorable 3.5-
year bond issue at 620 bp (or 9.875 percent coupon). A planned bond issue in 2010 was cancelled because the
available terms were not acceptable to the Government.

   This is an emerging market bond issued in the Eurozone.

   These conditions exacerbate the already illiquid nature of a partially guaranteed (and therefore hybrid) instrument,
for which a natural pool of investors does not exist.

called for extending all of these reforms. Finally, the Bank had an ongoing program of analytical work in
competitiveness, health sector efficiency, labor markets and public finance management (Table 3) all of
which informed the next phase of reforms pursued by the Government in addressing the crisis.

7.      In terms of its choice of instrument, there were three considerations behind the Bank’s decision to
support the Government’s request for a PEPBG. First, there was a clear, large financing need. The task
team convincingly argued that the PEPBG would help FYR Macedonia increase its borrowing volume
and in this way leverage Bank’s capital better than a DPL 9. Although, hypothetically, FYR Macedonia
could have obtained a competitively priced EUR$ 200 million loan from the World Bank, there was a real
risk that a separate unsecured market borrowing might not materialize under any acceptable terms.
Second, FYR Macedonia met the three criteria to be eligible for a PBG: (i) the country had a strong track
record of performance and its structural, social and macroeconomic policy package was satisfactory; (ii)
the country had a sustainable external financing plan; and (iii) the country had a coherent borrowing
strategy which would enable it to become a borrower in its own name without a guarantee in the medium
term. Third, as discussed in the PBG ICR, the Bank has had a very positive experience with the first
PBG, through which the cost of financing the 2011 fiscal deficit was significantly reduced. In addition,
the experiences of Montenegro and Serbia with PBGs were also encouraging. In both cases, PBG-
supported borrowing was able to extend maturities and result in savings of up to 400 basis points p.a. over
unsecured borrowing.

    The PEPBG is a useful instrument since it does not count 1:1 but 1:4 against World Bank’s exposure.

The PEPBG Operation

8.      The PEPBG was prepared quickly, in less than three months, and was approved by the Board on
January 8, 2013, on the basis of prior actions implemented during the course of 2012. (scope of the
operation is described in detail in section 1.2). In parallel, immediately following ROC approval on
November 2, 2012, the Government began the process of contracting the loan. The Government
approached fifteen international commercial banks with a Request For Proposal (RFP) and selected
Deutsche Bank AG to contract the loan. A parliamentary approval was obtained when all the agreements
were in place. The Loan agreement was signed on January 9, 2013, and the funds were withdrawn on
January 29, 2013.

9.      The PEPBG covered EUR155 million of the EUR250 million principal of the loan. The
unguaranteed portion of the loan had a 5-year maturity bullet repayment structure and the guaranteed
portion of the loan had a 7-year maturity bullet repayment structure. The loan carried a fixed interest rate
of 5-year euro swap rate plus 275 bps. The average interest rate on the loan was 3.915 percent. The
lenders also charged an arrangement fee of 150 bps.

Relationship with IMF and other Development Partners

10.     The Bank maintains a close working relationship with the IMF and the two institutions largely
agree on an assessment of the economic situation. The IMF provided an assessment letter to the Bank
endorsing the Government’s macroeconomic policies, which was attached to the Program Document (PD)
of the Operation. The IMF Board approved a Euro 475.6 million Precautionary Line of Credit (PCL) in
January 2011. The PCL was originally approved as an insurance mechanism in case of an “unexpected
balance of payment shock”. In March 2011, the Government withdrew Euro 220 million (286 percent of
the quota) from the Euro 475.6 million available under the PCL. The arrangement expired in January
2013. The Government has not sought successor arrangements. IMF management has initiated Post
Program Monitoring with two reviews completed in June 2013 and February 2014, respectively.
11.    The Bank has maintained a robust dialogue with the donor community on issues related to the
PEPBG. The Bank team benefitted from regular consultation with the IMF, the European Commission
(EC), and USAID – FYR Macedonia’s main development partners. The measures in public finance
management included in the PEPBG have benefited from the technical assistance provided by the IMF,
and much of the thinking on the health sector reforms was carried out through technical assistance
provided by the Dutch Government.

1.2           Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

12.      The main PDOs of the PEPBG were to improve the efficiency of public expenditures by
strengthening public financial management practices; improving the efficiency of service provision in the
health sector; and strengthening social protection and inclusion. The overarching goal was to ensure that
fiscal policy, and public expenditure policy in particular, supported an environment conducive to robust
growth, more effective social protection and improved service delivery. The eight prior actions
implemented to achieve these, as presented in the PD and in the legal documents, were grouped under
three “pillars” as indicated below and in more detail in Table 4:

Pillar 1

           Strengthening public finance management.

           (1) Establishing an inventory of the payment and VAT refund arrears, and establishing a timeline
           to clear them; and


                                                      5
           (2) Implementing amendments to the Manual of Treasury Operations to record multi-year
           liabilities, and putting in place provisions to ensure that expenditures are carried out within the
           budget without incurring arrears. 10
Pillar 2

           Improving the efficiency of spending and service provision in the health sector.

           (3) Adopting a new methodology, which resulted in setting lower reference prices for the most
           frequently used drugs.

           (4) Introducing centralized international procurement for optical medical devices and for
           orthopedic devices, and

           (5) Expanding health provider coverage in underserved areas.

Pillar 3

           Strengthening social protection and inclusion.

           (6) Implementing measures to encourage social safety net beneficiaries to actively seek
           employment opportunities.

           (7) Improving the administration of social safety net benefits by linking the CBMIS to the
           administrative registries of the Employment Service Agency (ESA) and Pension and Disability
           Insurance Fund (PDIF).

           (8) Using the savings from an improved targeting of the social safety net system to increase the
           level of means tested cash benefits.
The key performance indicators are presented in Table 4.

Not Applicable

1.4           Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program

13.        The policy areas supported by the PEPBG were grouped into three “pillars” as above.
Each of these policy areas contained measures, which constituted prior actions for the PEPBG as
per the legal documents as well as outcome indicators to measure progress of the reform program.
Since the PEPBG was a one-tranche operation, from a strictly legal point of view, all prior actions
were met before the loan was submitted to the Board. In addition, as indicated in Table 4, all the
outcome targets for the PEPBG have been met within the timeframe set in the PD. The impact of

10
  It is important to clarify here that the arrears addressed by the PEPBG, as defined in the PD and agreed upon with
the Government were Treasury arrears. Treasury payment arrears were defined as liabilities for payments that were
outstanding beyond the period specified in contracts and standard payment clearance practice at the Treasury. VAT
refund arrears were defined as approved refunds that have not been processed within the standard clearance period at
the Public Revenue Office (PRO) and the Treasury. Arrears covered by the PEPBG specifically excluded arrears in
the public health sector, which at end 2012 amounted to roughly 0.5 percent of GDP. In FYR Macedonia’s PFM
system, the health sector has its own treasury function and therefore the overdue obligations to the public health
sector (to hospitals and the Health Insurance Fund) are not monitored or resolved by the Treasury.

2.      Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1     Program Performance

14.     The full amount of the Deutsche Bank commercial loan amounting to EUR 250 million was
accessed within a few days of signing the indemnity agreement. This was made possible because the
Government worked closely with this commercial bank.
The program supported by the PEPBG contained important policies that helped the Government to
improve the credibility of the budget, strengthen controls on timely payment of financial obligations, and
enhance the effectiveness of health and social protection spending. All prior actions (see Table 4 above)
were completed prior to the Board presentation and all outcome targets were achieved well within the
timeframe outlined in the PD. This reflects Government’s commitment to the program as well as the

                                                          8
Bank’s ability to rapidly respond to the request of the client by providing sound policy advice as well as
leveraging support from other stakeholders.

2.2       Major Factors Affecting Implementation

15.      A number of factors contributed to the broadly successful implementation of the PEPBG. The key
factors are the following:

      •   Government commitment and ownership of the program. The PEPBG was closely aligned
          with the Government’s overall reform program and the Government was closely involved in the
          design of the operation.

      •   Good analytical basis: The PEPBG built effectively on a substantial amount of high quality and
          relevant analytical work. This is well documented in the PD (Table 6) summarizing the analytical
          work by area and links to the PEPBG.

      •   The PEPBG took into account lessons learnt from the earlier PBG operation. These included
          engaging the line ministries early and throughout the preparation. This helped build capacity in
          sector ministries and set realistic, achievable prior actions and outcome indicators. On this basis,
          the PEPBG set clear and achievable objectives focusing on only eight prior actions and eight
          outcome indicators.

      •   Broad support from senior management of the Bank. The PEPBG was a very high profile
          operation. With the approval of the PEPBG, the Bank has approved only six PBGs, of which two
          have been for FYR Macedonia. The Bank’s senior management was fully supportive of the task
          team from the very beginning. This enabled the task team to argue for and include in the PEPBG
          difficult but high impact measures, such as public acknowledgement and elimination of arrears;
          substantial reduction of prices of medicines, and extension of auctions to procurement of optical
          devices.

      •   Bank presence on the ground and link to the Bank’s program: The program supported by the
          PEPBG was well linked to key areas of Bank’s engagement in FYR Macedonia, such as the social
          protection program and health sector reforms – which have been supported in almost all previous
          programmatic lending operations. Past familiarity with the sectors and the presence of key sector
          staff in health, social protection and an economist in the field, helped lay the basis for the design,
          fast processing and implementation of the PEPBG.

      •   Early and close engagement with commercial banks was essential to sound out the market and
          to provide the best instrument to the client. The PBG allowed the Government of FYR
          Macedonia to develop a professional relationship with commercial banks involved in the
          transaction. Commercial banks indicated that the instrument allowed them to engage in a country
          that they would not have otherwise considered due to lack of familiarity and difficult external
          macroeconomic environment. They noted that it was of key importance to have had the Bank help
          facilitate the entry of FYR Macedonia into the international loan market. Having gone through the
          process (for example, having worked with a local legal counsel) increased their likelihood to
          consider follow-up transactions with FYR Macedonia. Banks also noted that there was a wider
          market impact, through increased interest from the limited pool of banks considering sovereign
          lending due to the positive reporting on the transaction in the international press.


2.3         Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:


                                                       9
16.     The M&E of the PEPBG relied on Government’s arrangements, consistent with the PEPBG
policy matrix. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) was responsible for monitoring and the overall
implementation of the PBG, including coordinating actions among other concerned ministries and
agencies. Other agencies involved included the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy (MOLSP) and the
Ministry of Health (MOH). Bank staff, especially those in the Country Office, worked closely with the
MOF and the other agencies to monitor actions and review implementation progress on a day to day basis.
This approach worked well and there was continuous tracking of reforms and outcome indicators.

2.4       Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation

17.      Projections of FYR Macedonia’s fiscal accounts and macroeconomic framework (Table 5)
indicate that FYR Macedonia has large financing requirements in 2015 and beyond, a part of which will
have to be financed by external borrowing. 11 At the same time, many of the policy reforms initiated
under the PEPBG operations need to be sustained to lay the basis for growth (see Para. 40). It is likely
that the Government will request financial support from the Bank to provide much needed budget support
as well as to accelerate the reform process. The exact form of this support is difficult to predict. Much
will depend upon the recovery in the Eurozone and the resulting improved market access at a reasonable
cost. In this respect, feedback from commercial banks that worked with the Government on the PBGs is
encouraging. Having gone through the process under the two PBGs, the Government is now familiar
with, and has valuable experience in accessing commercial debt markets. Nevertheless, the success of
FYR Macedonia’s ability to access the commercial loan market depends on factors such as the recovery
of the Euro Zone, strength of the economy especially the fiscal accounts and the balance of payments.

3.      Assessment of Outcomes

3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

18.      The PEPBG had clear and relevant objectives -- to respond to the economic slowdown triggered
by the worsening Eurozone outlook, by strengthening public financial management practices, eliminating
VAT refund and payment arrears 12 (crucial for improving the business environment), improving the
efficiency of service provision in the health sector and; strengthening social protection and inclusion. In
parallel, the PEPBG assisted FYR Macedonia in tapping funding from the international loan market, on
improved terms in the context of a highly uncertain external environment. The design of the operation
was simple; based on ongoing Government reforms, focusing on three reform pillars, eight prior actions
and eight measurable outcome indicators. The PEPBG operation was quickly processed in response to
the Government’s request and was considered as an important component of the overall crisis-related
assistance program defined in the Bank’s 2010-2014 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) and the 2012
CPS progress report.

3.2       Achievement of Program Development Objectives:

Sustainable Macroeconomic Framework and Borrowing strategy.

19.     Macroeconomic Framework. As presented in the PD, maintaining macroeconomic stability and
meeting the budgetary financing needs through a coherent borrowing strategy was a key objective of the
Government’s program. Macroeconomic developments in 2013 confirm that the Government largely
succeeded in achieving this objective. Fortunately FYR Macedonia’s macroeconomic performance in
2013 benefited from a nascent recovery in the Eurozone. By the first half of 2013, the “crisis”
atmosphere in the Eurozone had dissipated and there was modest growth after nearly six quarters of
contraction 13. Consequently, there was higher demand for Macedonian exports, restoration of capital
outflows and a reduction in borrowing costs. As indicated in Table 5 below, the economy grew by 3.1
percent in 2013 compared to a decline of 0.4 percent in 2012. This acceleration in growth is based on a
surge in construction activity (33 percent) enabled by higher private and public investment (Skopje 2014
and Corridor X highway projects). Mining and manufacturing also contributed significantly to growth,
driven by an increase in FDI from 1 percent of GDP in 2012 to 3.3 percent of GDP in 2013. Overall
exports grew by 4.5 percent in real terms and coupled with subdued imports, the current account deficit in
2013 narrowed to 1.9 percent of GDP and gross international reserves remained at 4.4 months of imports.

20.     A key objective of the PEPBG was to facilitate financing of the fiscal deficit in 2013. As the
pattern of deficit financing presented in Table 5 shows, the availability of external financing (made
possible by the PEPBG) made it possible for the Government to avoid a drawdown in Government
deposits. At appraisal, the total financing required 14 in 2013 (Table 5) was projected to be financed by
domestic borrowing (10 percent), a drawdown of Government deposits (30 percent), while external
borrowing financed the remaining 60 percent. The 2013 fiscal outturn shows that the Government met
nearly 43 percent of the total financing requirement through domestic borrowing 15 and about 58 percent
from external markets, and used these additional resources to add to Government deposits. This strategy
puts the Government in a strong position to meet fiscal financing requirements in 2014, when almost 55
percent of the total financing could be met by a drawdown of Government deposits.

21.      Over the medium term, growth prospects in FYR Macedonia are brightened by the continued
recovery in the Eurozone 16. Early signs of recovery in the second half of 2013 have gained momentum.
Real GDP growth in the Eurozone was 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013; the third straight quarter
of growth after an 18 month recession. In FYR Macedonia, growth is expected to accelerate to reach 3.7
percent by 2016 mainly from increased investments and sustained export growth (Table 5). The fiscal
deficit is projected to fall from 4.1 percent of GDP in 2013 to 2.6 percent of GDP by 2016 in line with the
Government’s medium term fiscal strategy. Securing such a reduction will require sizeable consolidation,
including sustained control of the wage bill and expenditures on goods and services and additional tax
effort. Even with this reduction in fiscal deficits, fiscal projections indicate a sharp increase in financing
requirements in 2015 and 2016. Even if a part of these can be met by domestic borrowing and by tapping
into Government deposits, there will still remain a gap, which indicates a need for external borrowing.

22.      How successful will the Government be in accessing international loan markets at a reasonable
cost in 2015 and 2016? This will depend on the strength of recovery in the Eurozone 17, growth prospects,
successful fiscal consolidation, and deepening of the domestic bond markets in FYR Macedonia 18.
Discussions with Government counterparts, in particular, the MOF indicated that the PEPBG provided
them with valuable insights into the workings of the financial markets while the commercial banks gained
a deeper understanding of the FYR Macedonian economy. These intangible benefits – which were the
medium term objectives of the PEPBG, would be invaluable should the Government of FYR Macedonia
approach the international loan or the bond market in future.

23.     Achieving PDOs. As discussed below, the Government has succeeded in achieving (and in some
cases overachieving) the PDOs of the PEPBG in line with the outcomes anticipated in the PD.

   In 2013, the government was able to issue a bond at an average interest rate of 4.65 percent p.a. compared to 5.2

     Our analysis (April Eurozone brief) indicates that sovereign borrowing costs have declined significantly since
their peak during the crisis.
18
     If the government is able to raise 5 year plus maturity bonds, lower amounts need to be raised in the external
loan/bond markets. In January 2013, the Government issued two 10-year bonds. Even though the amount was
symbolic (EUR 2.9 million), it marked a beginning of the Government’s efforts to lengthen the maturity of domestic
government securities.

Pillar 1.         Strengthening Public Finance Management 19.

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

24.     The Public Finance Management (PFM) system in FYR Macedonia is sound compared to that in
other countries in the region. The economic downturn, however, exposed weaknesses in the PFM system,
most importantly in the areas of multi-year budgeting and commitment controls, which resulted in the
emergence of payment arrears. The prior actions supported by the PEPBG therefore focused on two
areas. First, the Government committed to eliminate VAT refund and payment arrears, which had grown
to about 1-2 percent of GDP by September 2012, by December 2013. Second, the Government
implemented institutional reforms to ensure that arrears will not build up in future. These reforms
included making amendments to the Treasury Manual to provide for recording multi-year liabilities, and
reforms in commitment control, which explicitly prohibited the treasury from making payments unless
they were properly budgeted/registered. This was complemented by setting up a high-level working
group to implement and transmit these changes clearly to all departments to ensure compliance.

25.       Results: The Government confirmed to have eliminated about 50 percent of VAT refund and
payment arrears by end 2012, and the remainder by end-February 2013, well ahead of the target date of
December 2013 included in the PD20. The informal feedback received from the Government indicated
that although there was a broad consensus within the Government to eliminate the arrears, inclusion of
this outcome indicator in the PEPBG provided a crucial impetus to accelerate the process. The
Government also confirmed that there has been no further buildup of arrears since February 2013, which
indicates that the changes to the Treasury Manual and their implementation by the line Ministries were
effective. Discussions with the Budget Department also indicated that the budgeting for multi-year
liabilities helped by alerting the treasury in advance of large expenditures falling due in the near future.
This has helped medium-term expenditure management and has contributed to averting the buildup of
new arrears. Going beyond the prior actions in the PD, the Government sustained the PFM reforms by
presenting the Law on Financial Discipline to Parliament and by publishing for the first time a medium-
term fiscal framework in December 2013.
Pillar 2.         Improving the efficiency of spending and service provision in the health sector.

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

26.      Health sector reforms were a primary focus of the 2008 PER. Reforms supported under DPL1
and more recently under the PBG supported amendments to the health insurance law, introduced
competitive pricing of drugs and helped establish a separate treasury function in the health sector which
helped generate savings and control health sector arrears. The PEPBG supported reforms in the following
three areas to improve efficiency of health delivery services.

27.     Procurement of Drugs. In January 2012, the MoH revised the methodology for setting the
reference prices 21 of registered drugs by expanding the group of reference countries 22. On the basis of the
new methodology the MOH estimated and published in the Official Gazette, in March 2012, new

     There remain some central government arrears in the health sector, which are estimated to be around 0.5 percent
of GDP as of end 2013. The Government has taken several steps to reduce these arrears and prevent the
accumulation of future arrears by increasing transfers to the health sector, and by establishing lower reference prices
for medicines.

percent set in the PD. Going beyond meeting the outcome indicator targets in the PD, the Government
has been successful in achieving a sustained reduction in drug prices. As indicated in Table 6 below, the
Government has reduced the reference prices in each of the price announcements since March 201224,
thereby achieving an estimated cost savings to consumers of nearly 46 million Euros. It is also important
to note that even when the new methodology reduced the prices of nearly 1299 drugs, as in Table 6, no
supplier chose to exit the market, thereby maintaining competition in service provision.

29.    Centralization of the procurement of medical devices. As a prior action for the PEPBG, the
Government extended the centralized procurement process to optical lenses and disposables as well as
orthopedic devises.

30.     Results: As anticipated in the PD, the average price of optical lenses and disposables after the
auction declined by nearly 39 percent from its value before the auction in February 2012, thereby
surpassing the outcome indicator of 33 percent. Price reductions for specific devices are indicated in
Table 7 below.

31.      Extending provider coverage in underserved areas. Until recently, the HIF did not take into
consideration the demand for health services as a factor in the process of contracting with health service
providers (HSPs). This resulted in an oversupply of HSPs in urban areas while a number of (mainly
rural) areas remained underserved – with only zero or one provider. As a prior action of the PEPBG, in
June 2012 the Government adopted a by-law for the establishment of the medical network, which set a
maximum limit for contractors in over-served areas. In addition, the MOH announced the creation of 360
new concessions in underserved areas for which tenders were expected to be received by late 2012.

32.     Results. As a result of the new by-law, and the new tendering focused on underserved areas, the
Government has succeeded in significantly increasing the supply of health service providers in 16
underserved areas (Table 8) which had only zero or one health service providers prior to the new law.
The data indicate that there were no exits from existing providers. This exceeds the outcome indicator in
PD that only targeted doubling of such contracts in only five underserved regions by end December 2013.

Pillar 3.       Strengthening social protection and inclusion.

Rating.         Highly Satisfactory

33.     Targeting active labor market programs to the recipients of social assistance. An important
shortcoming of social protection and labor market systems in FYR Macedonia was that if the recipients of
social financial assistance accepted even a short-term job, they would lose their access to social
assistance. On June 26, 2012, the Government revised the regulations for ALMPs to specifically target
them to the beneficiaries of the social financial assistance. Under the revision, Social Financial
Assistance did not terminate automatically for certain kinds of jobs. In addition, the 2013 budget
increased the outlay for active labor market policies by 7.3 percent from MKD 300 million to MKD 322
million. The measures included a public works program, subsidies for firms that employed vulnerable
people and unemployed, loans for self-employment, and a firm-specific training program for unemployed.

34.    Results. As a result of these efforts, the number of social safety net beneficiaries who benefited
from the ALMPs increased from 5,700 in December 2011 to 11,308 by end-December 2013. This
exceeded the outcome targets set in the PD of 10,000 by end-December 2013.

35.     Improvements in efficiency of social safety net administration and service access. The
reforms supported by the PEPBG were aimed at reducing the transaction costs of accessing social
services. Typically the applicant was required to submit a number of documents from a number of
agencies while applying for social service benefits. To address this problem, in July 2012, the MOLSP
signed an MOU linking the Ministry’s CBMIS with the registries of the ESA and PDIF. The system links
were established in August 2012 and the system was since then tested and became operational in October
2012.

36.     Results. As a result of the linkage of the registries of the three agencies, the number of forms
beneficiaries are expected to complete for registration or renewal of Social Financial Assistance has now

                                                         15
been reduced from five to only one. Typically a claimant to Social Financial Assistance only needs to
show his/her identification and sign a document allowing the Centers for Social Work, which administers
the Social Financial Assistance, to access his/her personal data stored in databases of six other agencies.

37.     Increase in Social Financial Assistance and Permanent Assistance Benefit. In 2012, the
Government realized savings from the improvements in the targeting performance of the social safety net
system by eliminating inclusion errors. This was mainly due to an upgraded IT system and more
stringent controls. Despite a difficult fiscal environment, the Government took a decision to increase
Social Financial Assistance and Permanent Assistance benefits by five percent, starting in March 2013.

38.     Results. In line with the outcome indicators in the PD, starting in March 2013, Social Financial
Assistance and Permanent Financial Assistance were increased from MKD 3,800 and MKD 4,800
respectively by five percent. In total, about 45,000 households are benefiting from the planned increase
of both transfers. In continuation of this policy, a further increase of five percent went into effect on
March 1, 2014 (Official Gazette no 187/13).

3.3     Justification of Overall Outcome Rating (Combining Relevance, Achievement of PDOs):

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

39.      The PEPBG operation is rated highly satisfactory on the basis of setting clear and relevant
objectives, achieving macroeconomic stability and in most instances over-achieving the outcome targets
for the three pillars, as discussed above. The ratings are based on the implementation of the policies and
the achievements of the outcome targets set at appraisal and not on a broader assessment of the
development challenges facing the Government.

40.     While much has been achieved in the context of the PEPBG, further reforms are needed to lay the
basis for sustained growth and improvements in shared prosperity in FYR Macedonia. As pointed out in
the PD (Para. 66), additional PFM reforms are needed to improve medium-term fiscal planning, fiscal
reporting and transparency. The health arrears have continued to remain at 1-2 percent of GDP and need
to be eliminated. In parallel, the Government should consider a program of hospital restructuring and
measures to further improve the efficiency of health spending. Towards improving the social safety net,
the measures in the PEPBG need to be extended by consolidating the number of social assistance benefits,
implementing measures (such as revising the Social Assistance Rule Book) to further narrow errors of
inclusion and exclusion and strengthen oversight mechanisms.

3.4     Overreaching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts (if any, where not previously covered or to
amplify discussion above):

(a)     Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and social Development

41.     At a macro level, a sustained acceleration of growth from -0.4 percent in 2012 to 3.1 percent in
2013 can be expected to have a significant impact on poverty and employment. The main direct impact
on poverty in the context of the PEPBG is through the measures implemented under Pillar 3. These
measures, as described above in section 3.2, have made it easier for the poor to access Social Financial
Assistance; increased the Social Financial Assistance and the Permanent Assistance Benefit; and
improved the working of the Active Labor market Policies.




                                                    16
(b)     Institutional Change/Strengthening (particularly with reference to impacts on longer term
capacity and institutional development)

42.      Under each of the three Pillars, the program supported by the PEPBG included institutional
strengthening. As described above in section 3.2, under Pillar 1, the PFM reforms included strengthening
the working of the Budget Department for better expenditure and arrears control. In the health sector
PEPBG reforms contributed to the capacity building within the MOH for setting/revising minimum drug
prices; and the procurement of drugs and optical devices. In Pillar 3, the institutional innovations and
strengthening the CBMIS carried out in the context of the PEPBG contributed to the improved working of
the ALMPs and the Social Safety Net.

4.      Assessment of Risks to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

43.      Development outcomes are subject to three main risks as indicated below. In the aggregate, these
risks are moderate.

44.     External/regional economic risk: The first risk pertains to a possible worsening of the external
environment. The World Bank fiscal projections show that there are large financing gaps in 2015 and
beyond, which will require external funding. There is a risk that renewed turmoil in the Euro markets
could make it expensive for FYR Macedonia to borrow. To mitigate this risk, the Government needs to
maintain its previous track record on prudent macroeconomic management and make progress on fiscal
consolidation.

45.      Political risks: Political risks are mainly related to the stalling of progress in EU and NATO
integration, as the country’s name issue with Greece is yet to be resolved. The prospect for future EU
accession was a major impetus for reforms in the past. The political situation in the country continues to
evolve. The ruling coalition won both the parliamentary and the second round of the presidential
elections on April 27, 2014. While international observers have declared the elections fair, the opposition
has complained of fraud and negotiations to form a stable Government have been protracted. On balance,
however, the risks to the derailing of the reform program are not high since the reforms have been
supported across party lines.

46.      Program risks: The risk of a slowdown in the implementation or reversal of reforms is low in the
foreseeable future. The Government has a strong track record and support for the reform cuts across party
lines. Still, further improvements in public financial management are very important in order to maintain
central government debt and overall public debt at a sustainable level and improve the effectiveness and
efficiency of government spending. There is also a need for strengthening capacity with respect to data
collection, preparation and reporting in many different areas of the Government. Further, there remains a
residual risk related to implementation capacity. Avoiding government arrears will require a continued
commitment to fully adhere to and implement the processes outlined in the Manual of Treasury

                                                    17
Operations. Implementation capacity of some public sector institutions, such as the health sector and
institutions engaged in social transfers, while much improved over the past few years, remains stretched.
(See Para. 40 for a discussion of the next phase of reforms)

5.      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1     Bank Performance

(a)     Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (i.e., performance through lending phase

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

47.     Strong efforts were made by the Bank team to design a robust program, based on considerable
analytical work. The PEPBG program was: (i) aligned with Government’s reform program; (ii) consistent
with the higher-level objectives of the CPS and the CPS Progress Report; and (iii) focused on key reform
areas (See section 2, Para. 16 on factors affecting implementation).


(b)     Quality of Supervision

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

48.     Supervision of the PEPBG was continuous, as the TTL visited the country often and several
sector experts resided in the country. Since the operation was based on prior actions, which had been
implemented before the PEPBG was approved by the Bank’s Board of Directors, much of the subsequent
supervision consisted of tracking the progress of the reform program ensuring that there was no
backtracking and there was progress in achieving the outcome indicators. Detailed supervision missions
were conducted in March 2013 and September 2013, by which time most of the outcome targets were
already achieved.

(c)     Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

49.     For reasons noted above, the overall Bank performance is rated highly satisfactory.

5.2     Borrower Performance

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

(a)     Government performance

50.     The Government was quick to respond to the crisis and took difficult decisions. These included
publicly recognizing VAT refunds and payment arrears, introducing a supplementary budget in 2012,
which slashed expenditures by nearly 4.5 percent of GDP, freezing wages and employment. At the same
time, the Government improved efficiency of health expenditures, reduced drug prices and protected
expenditure outlays for the vulnerable. The performance of the MOF was especially commendable. The
MOF was responsible for overall program implementation and coordination with concerned ministries
and agencies. The MOF Debt Department was able to move with exceptional speed in organizing the
RFP, negotiating and selecting the bank and concluding the loan agreement in parallel with the Bank
approval of the PEPBG. The setting of lower reference prices for key pharmaceuticals, without major
suppliers exiting the market, is a testament to the performance of the staff in the MOH. Similarly the

                                                   18
MOLSP performed well in rationalizing the documentation for access to Social Financial Assistance.
This is a useful reform since it significantly simplifies the access to assistance for the poor.
(b)       Implementing Agency or Agency Performance

51.       Discussed above in Para. 50.

(b)        Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance:

49.       For the reasons noted above, the overall borrower performance is rated highly satisfactory.

6.        Lessons learned

(a)       Bank wide lessons

52.      A PBG can be a useful instrument for leveraging Bank resources to facilitate a much larger
resource transfer through commercial bank markets. Moreover, it is attractive from an operational
perspective since under the current incentive structure, guarantees count 1:4 against Bank exposure.
PBGs are also popular with the recipient countries, especially among smaller countries in the region since
they allow for a far larger access to resources than a typical DPL. Experience with the PEPBG, however,
raises a number of issues for the Bank if these operations are to be used more widely and scaled up.
These include the current incentive structure for exposure, the implications for the Bank’s balance sheet,
the extent to which countries should substitute typical DPLs with policy based guarantees and investing in
staffing and skill to work with commercial bank markets (see below).

(b)       Operation specific lessons

53.      The PEPBG confirmed general good practice lessons such as: work closely with the Government,
build on the Government’s program, have strong analytical foundation, work closely with sector
specialists and focus on a few achievable objectives which have the greatest impact (see para. 16 on the
factors behind successful implementation). There are, however, two ways in which PBGs differ from
standard DPL operations.

      •   First, PBGs require a highly rapid and time sensitive response. Operations such as the PEPBG
          are often requested when there is a large financing gap. Moreover, given the volatility in the
          commercial bank markets have to be processed quickly; and the commercial bank loan has to be
          contracted almost as soon as the guarantee operation is approved. Therefore a lot of preparation is
          needed to lay the groundwork for issuing the RFP for banks, making sure that there is broad
          participation, and preparing for parliamentary approval in parallel with the preparation of the
          Bank operation25.

      •   Second, PBGs require staff who have a good understanding of commercial loan markets and
          finance. Continuous involvement of staff from the Bank’s Financial Advisory and Banking
          services played an important role for the success of the PEPBG. The Bank’s financial staff
          worked closely with the Government team in MOF, helping approach the commercial banks,
          providing market soundings and an analysis of approaching the market with alternative financial
          instruments.




25
     In the case of the PEPBG, the preparations for approaching commercial banks began as soon as the operation was
       approved by the Regional Operations Committee (ROC).
