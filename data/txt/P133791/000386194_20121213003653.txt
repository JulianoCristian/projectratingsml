                         LOAN AND PROGRAM SUMMARY
              THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA
               PUBLIC EXPENDITURE POLICY BASED GUARANTEE
Borrower               Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
Implementing Agency    Ministry of Finance
Financing Data         The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)
                       Policy Based Guarantee will cover a portion up to EUR155 million of
                       the principal of a loan by Deutsche Bank to the Former Yugoslav
                       Republic of Macedonia (FYR Macedonia) made on commercial terms.
Operation Type         The proposed Public Expenditure Policy Based Guarantee (PEPBG) is a
                       stand-alone single tranche operation in the amount of EUR155 million
                       (equivalent of US$201.5 million). It will be used to enhance a
                       borrowing transaction in the amount of EUR250 million from the
                       international loan markets.
Main Policy Areas      The proposed PEPBG supports three pillars of the Government of the
                       FYR Macedonia’s (Government) reform program aimed at: (i)
                       strengthening public financial management; (ii) improving the
                       efficiency of spending and service provision in the health sector; and
                       (iii) strengthening social protection and inclusion.
Key Outcome            • Decrease in the stock of VAT and payment arrears.
Indicators             • Decrease in the average unit price of most frequently used drugs and
                            in the unit price for centrally procured optical medical devices.
                       • Increase in the number of health service provider contracts in
                            previously underserved areas.
                       • Increase in the number of Social Safety Net Beneficiaries of Active
                            Labor Market Policies.
                       • Improved service access by a reduction in the number of documents
                            needed by Social Financial Assistance claimants for registration and
                            renewal procedures
                       • Increase in the benefit level for Social Financial Assistance and
                            Permanent Assistance.
Program Development    The proposed PEPBG supports a broad Government program and will
Objective(s) and       assist FYR Macedonia in implementing its borrowing plan within a
Contribution to CAS    consistent macroeconomic framework. This will mitigate the impact of
                       the continuing uncertainty in the Euro zone, which is hindering access
                       to capital. The Program Development Objective is to improve the
                       efficiency of public expenditures by strengthening public financial
                       management practices; improving the efficiency of service provision in
                       the health sector; and strengthening social protection and inclusion. The
                       overarching goal is to ensure that fiscal policy, and public expenditure
                       policy in particular, supports an environment conducive to growth, more
                       effective social protection and improved service delivery.
                       The PEPBG will contribute to the Country Partnership Strategy goals to
                       promote faster and more inclusive growth by maintaining
                       macroeconomic stability and strengthening the efficiency of the social
                       protection system.
                       The envisaged reform program is also consistent with the Government’s

                                               v
                 aspiration for membership in the European Union (EU). The operation
                 will have a positive impact on the functioning of domestic markets and
                 public administration.
Risks and Risk   The proposed PEPBG has significant risks, mostly related to the
Mitigation       evolving external environment.
                 External risks: Shocks relating to the external environment, especially
                 the uncertain global and Euro zone economic outlook continue to affect
                 the economy. Deepened recession in the EU could undermine
                 confidence, reduce demand for exports, and weaken capital inflows.
                 This could put renewed pressure on reserves, fiscal balances and social
                 conditions. Currently, external economic risks are somewhat mitigated
                 by buffers in place, including the stable public debt level, a well-
                 performing banking system and solid reserve coverage. However, a
                 further intensification of the Euro zone crisis would amplify above risks
                 and need to be managed with an adequate policy response, including
                 efforts to preserve confidence in the banking sector and prudent fiscal
                 management. While the banking sector is exposed to external risks,
                 these are substantially mitigated by regulations of the Central Bank.
                 Political risks: Political risks are largely related to the stalled progress
                 in EU and North Atlantic Treaty Organization integration. This could
                 trigger reform fatigue and remove a big reform anchor. At the same
                 time, Government has a stable majority support and the European
                 Commission recommended in October 2012 the immediate start of
                 accession negotiations for EU-membership. This is expected to preserve
                 the political and popular support for reforms toward the Euro-Atlantic
                 integration. Another risk is an early call of parliamentary elections
                 before its regular schedule in 2014. This could lead to politically
                 motivated expenditure increases and add to existing fiscal pressures
                 with the risk of re-emerging arrears.
                 Implementation risks: Implementation capacity of some public sector
                 institutions, while much improved over the past few years, is still
                 stretched relatively thin. For example, reforms in public financial
                 management (PFM) would require a considerable change in existing
                 business practices of some budget users, including in contract
                 management and reporting. The proposed PEPBG supports
                 improvements in PFM processes with the goal to contribute to
                 strengthening capacity for public financial management. There are
                 considerable implementation risks associated with supported health
                 sector reforms, such as the medical network. Pressure from medical
                 provider associations might undermine its implementation. Similarly,
                 price changes on drugs to be procured might be undermined by political
                 considerations and lobbying by pharmaceutical companies.

                    IBRD PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A
         PROPOSED PUBLIC EXPENDITURE POLICY BASED GUARANTEE
           TO THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA


                                        I.     INTRODUCTION

1.      This Public Expenditure Policy Based Guarantee (PEPBG) proposes a guarantee
in the amount of EUR155 million (US$201.5 million equivalent) in support of a
commercial loan to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYR Macedonia). The
proposed single tranche operation supports reforms to improve the efficiency of public
expenditures and public financial management, to strengthen health systems, and to improve
the targeting of social assistance and social inclusion. The proposed PEPBG would help the
FYR Macedonia access international financial markets to address an expected financing gap
in 2013. In the current difficult financial environment, a partially-secured financing structure
would facilitate FYR Macedonia’s access to market funding at a longer tenor and under more
favorable terms than would otherwise be possible. Beyond the current turmoil, the PEPBG
would help FYR Macedonia preserve continued market access at reasonable terms, expand
over the medium-term its name in the international financial market and help the domestic
financial market to develop.

2.      The proposed operation is part of the World Bank’s additional crisis-related
assistance to FYR Macedonia aimed at mitigating the impact of the renewed Euro zone
turmoil. 1 In late 2011 the Bank increased available financing to FYR Macedonia to respond
to the crisis, including US$50 million to build on a successful municipal development project
to support small infrastructure projects and preserve jobs, a PEPBG of US$201.5 million, and
a doubling of the amount of the planned Second Competitiveness Development Policy Loan
to US$50 million. The additional assistance will come at a much needed juncture, particularly
given a partly failed EUR250 million borrowing earlier in 2012, which was reduced to
EUR75 million, and given a large Eurobond maturity (EUR175 million) due in January 2013.

3.      The renewed Euro zone turmoil since the second half of 2011 has adversely
affected the economy of FYR Macedonia. The economy weathered the 2008-2009 financial
crisis relatively well. Its recovery gained momentum in the first half of 2011 as real GDP
grew by about 5.6 percent year-on-year. However, the renewed turmoil in the Euro zone,
triggered by concerns regarding the health of sovereign balance sheets, created strong
headwinds for FYR Macedonia’s economy. As a result growth weakened to less than one
percent in the second half of 2011 and turned negative in the first half of 2012. Export
demand suffered, business sentiment fell and labor markets deteriorated. Negative effects
have also spilled over into the fiscal accounts, with poor tax performance and weakening
financial discipline in the public sector leading to arrears. In addition, renewed market
turbulence since May 2012 has dimmed short-term growth prospects and access to capital
markets. The risk appetite among global investors is volatile and cross-border lending is

  The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) of September 2010 (Report No. 54928-MK) was prepared in the wake
of the global economic crisis, at the onset of deepening Euro zone instability, and was developed with flexibility
in mind. A planned US$30 million Development Policy Loan was converted into a EUR100 million Policy
Based Guarantee in FY12. The Guarantee, leveraged a total of EUR130 million from lenders. This financing was
critical in helping cover financing needs during difficult times.

tightening, particularly in the Euro zone periphery, which is considered most vulnerable to
financial upheaval and contamination. Economic turmoil is likely to adversely affect
vulnerable groups.

4.      In this environment, the Government of the FYR Macedonia (Government) aims
to maintain macroeconomic stability and lay the groundwork for economic recovery.
Given the fixed exchange rate regime, fiscal policy will be critical in preserving stability and
ensuring an environment conducive to faster growth. The current mix of macroeconomic
policies is supportive of these goals. In light of the extended period of global uncertainty and
its impact on public finances, the PEPBG is proposed to support a continued reform agenda in
public expenditure and financial management. In the medium-term Government aims to
ensure that debt remains at around one third of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the quality
of public spending improves, including through measures supported by the proposed
operation. Monetary policy continues to be accommodative and was recently loosened in
response to the weakening growth outlook. At the same time, Government has introduced a
comprehensive reform agenda to boost competitiveness of the economy, including the
functioning of labor and land markets, and enterprise support (supported by a parallel
development policy loan series). The proposed PEPBG will also support reforms that will
help mitigate the impact of the ongoing turmoil on vulnerable groups, including women
(paragraphs 25 and 122). In this context, the 2012 Supplemental Budget, the Government’s
medium-term Pre-Accession Economic Program and the solid track record of the authorities
provide assurances that the overall environment is adequate.

5.      Government is requesting a second PBG in light of deteriorated financial market
access due to the Euro zone crisis. In a virtually closed market environment in November
2011, FYR Macedonia undertook a EUR130 million commercial loan, which extended
maturity by 50 percent and produced a savings of at least 300bp p.a., made through the first
PBG. The recent experience of Montenegro, and the earlier experience of Serbia, with using
IBRD guarantees over the last two years is also encouraging. 2 Today, secondary market yields
for medium term Macedonian bonds have recovered only slightly from spikes seen in late
2011 and previous highs in the summer of 2010, suggesting that market access remains
stressed. The yield on Macedonia 2015 bonds, for example, today figures at near 7 percent
p.a., and still over 150bp above the low reached briefly in March of this year. Since June 2012
yields for emerging Europe have been steadily declining, on the back of investor hopes that
the Euro zone crisis may be contained. Yet, yields for Macedonia assets have largely
increased over the same period. This investor behavior suggests that markets are clearly
differentiating across the credit spectrum and showing preference for the most liquid and
fundamentally solid investable instruments. Were Macedonia to attempt to issue a 5-year
Eurobond in today’s market, the un-enhanced transaction would be very costly, and a longer
dated bond would be extremely difficult to arrange, particularly denominated in Euro. The
PEPBG would improve Macedonia’s borrowing terms considerably.

6.      The PEPBG would help FYR Macedonia to increase its borrowing volume and in
this way leverage Bank’s capital better than a Development Policy Loan (DPL). A single
transaction involving both guaranteed and unguaranteed lending will allow Macedonia to
2
 In July 2012, Montenegro borrowed with the support of a PBG, EUR100 million during a period of heightened
volatility and greatly impaired market access at an otherwise unavailable maturity and with an estimated savings
of up to 400bp p.a.. Serbia raised EUR292 million and achieved a doubling of its tenor and an improvement in
borrowing costs of at least 400bp through a PBG-supported transaction that closed in February 2011.

raise a larger volume of needed funding in the amount of EUR250 million at a critical time,
particularly in light of the Eurobond maturing in January 2013. The alternative of two
transactions involving a World Bank loan and separate unsecured market borrowing poses a
high risk in current market conditions. Although FYR Macedonia can hypothetically obtain a
competitively priced loan from the World Bank in the amount of US$200 million, a separate
unsecured market borrowing might not materialize under any acceptable terms. Therefore, the
ability to leverage additional resources from the private sector through a PBG represents an
enormous benefit. The experience of these operations in the region thus far has demonstrated
that, through a competitive bidding, the pricing of the combined transaction results in an
overall cost that is equal to or marginally better than the costs associated with the two separate
transactions noted previously, were either a EUR200 million from IBRD or the additional
leverage from markets even available.

7.       The design of the instrument underlying the proposed IBRD guarantee will be
driven by FYR Macedonia’s debt management objectives and risk considerations in the
capital market. The structure should allow the borrower to secure the needed financing at
reasonable costs, while minimizing the transaction risk in a climate of volatility. FYR
Macedonia has indicated a preference to avail of a PBG to backstop a commercial loan, rather
than a public bond issuance for three reasons. First, the FYR Macedonia perceived the
transaction risk will be reduced by engaging lending banks directly, and pricing can be
guaranteed ex ante, through a loan, while the cost-structure of a bond will be more difficult to
lock in earlier and will be more vulnerable to market volatility at closing. Second, a bond
issue of the targeted size would be considered relatively small and therefore illiquid for bond
investors, which would hamper the efficiency of the pricing and trading of the instrument.
Emerging market bond investors show weak appetite for hybrid bonds, which fuse various
credit risks and become more difficult to place or exchange. Third, the pricing efficiency for a
bond would be capped by the credit rating of the instrument, which would improve only
marginally from the underlying issuer rating, a consideration which does not generally exist
with non-rated commercial bank loans.

POLITICAL CONTEXT

8.      FYR Macedonia’s political situation has been stable. The ruling coalition consists
of the two largest political parties from the ethnic Macedonian and Albanian political blocks
(VMRO-DPMNE and DUI) and 13 smaller parties. In the early parliamentary elections of
2011, this coalition maintained a majority with 72 out of 123 seats in Parliament. Most
mayors of the 85 municipalities belong to the ruling coalition. While the 2011 Census was
cancelled and there were several security incidents in 2012, which suggest lingering social
tensions, the authorities have been generally able to manage inter-ethnic relations well.

9.     The authorities initiated in March 2012 a high-level pre-accession dialogue with
the European Union (EU). In October 2012, the European Commission (EC) renewed its
recommendation for an immediate start of accession negotiations for EU-membership. This
expected to maintain the reform momentum and ensure continued progress towards adoption
of EU-supported reforms. However, the dispute with Greece about the country’s name
remains. Resolution of the dispute would open the way for immediate North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) membership (vetoed by Greece in 2008) and faster EU integration.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

10.        FYR Macedonia’s economy is increasingly diversifying away from its
traditional growth sectors. Traditional growth drivers -agriculture, mining, manufacturing
and trade- still make up over 50 percent of the country’s output (Figure 1). The backbone of
the productive economy remains mining and manufacturing, accounting for 21 percent of total
output and providing an important source of employment and export earnings. Since the mild
recession in 2009 however, growth in several other sectors has accelerated, helping the
country to diversify. Construction contributed 21 percent to growth in 2010 and 2011 (Figure
2) as a result of strong public and private investments. Communications, IT, financial services
and insurance became significant growth contributors during the period, together contributing
28 percent of growth. Exports were worth around 55 percent of GDP in 2011 and have grown
strongly from 39 percent of GDP in 2009 (Figure 3). At the same time, imports have also
increased, from 61 percent of GDP in 2009 to 74 percent in 2011, but partly due to imports of
manufacturing components and materials, which are then re-exported.

11.        FYR Macedonia’s steady growth during the pre-crisis period of 2004-2008 was
followed by a mild recession (Box 1). FYR Macedonia’s pre-crisis economy registered solid
growth, but followed a lower growth trajectory than other countries in the region. While
factors, such as prudent fiscal management, a relatively conservative financial sector and the
application of macro-prudential regulations led to more moderate growth, they also acted as a
buffer during the crisis that hit at the end of 2008. As a result, the economy shrank by nearly
one percent in 2009, less than in most countries in the region. A fiscal stimulus of about 3
percentage points of GDP, which was partly financed by increased borrowing, helped limit
the contraction. Central Bank’s tightened monetary policy and deepened macro-prudential
measures helped restore financial sector confidence.

          Box 1: Steady Growth and Mild Recession
In the pre-crisis period of 2004-2008 annual growth for              Figure 4: Average Growth, 2004-08 and
FYR Macedonia averaged 4.1 percent, compared with                    2009
4.7 and 6 percent in Albania, Kosovo and Montenegro                  10%
(Figure 4). Several factors contributed towards FYR
Macedonia’s comparatively moderate growth during this                 5%
period. First, prudent fiscal management limited
consumption growth. FYR Macedonia’s average fiscal                    0%
deficit during the period was 0.1 percent of GDP, and
more moderate than in other countries in the region                   -5%
(Figure 5). Second, although credit growth expanded at
around 30 percent annually during the period, this was              -10%
from a low base. A relatively conservative financial                                                                      2009 contraction

12.        The gradual recovery during 2010 and 2011 became increasingly threatened
by the worsening Euro zone outlook. Output expanded by 2.9 percent in 2010, led by a
trade turnaround, and then accelerated to around 5 percent growth in mid-2011, giving hopes
of a robust growth in the future. FDI performed particularly well in 2011 (through airport
concessions, agro-processing and real estate), reaching 4.4 percent of GDP in USD terms.
However, the renewed turmoil in the Euro zone took its toll on trade and capital flows, and
impacted demand in the second half of 2011. Year-on-year growth fell to 1.1 percent in the
second half of the year, resulting in an overall growth rate of 2.8 percent in 2011.

13.    Economic indicators point toward a difficult year in 2012, but growth is expected
to be positive at 0.5 percent. Output contracted by 1.3 percent (y-o-y) in the first quarter of
2012 reflecting the renewed uncertainty in the Euro zone, as well as the severe winter in early
2012. Industrial production and construction were hit particularly hard. In addition, the Euro
zone sentiments affected Macedonia’s exports and weighed heavily on the business
environment. The second quarter saw some improvement with quarterly growth of around 12
percent, but year-on-year growth remained negative at 0.9 percent. Second quarter growth
was helped by improved performance in construction and improved industrial performance. In
June and July construction permits were issued for work on large-scale transport projects co-
financed by the European Investment Bank (EIB). Reasonably robust private consumption,
and the fact that Germany, Macedonia’s largest trading partner, performed relatively well also
helped to boost growth. Net FDI inflows reached almost 1 percent of GDP in the first six
months of the year and this is expected to rise to around 2 percent by the end of the year, with
much of this coming from expansion of existing production facilities.

percentage point to 3.75 percent in May
2012. The exchange rate peg, acting as a
policy anchor, appears to have served FYR
Macedonia well in the past, providing stability assurance.

15.    The banking sector is highly concentrated and exposed to external risks that are
substantially mitigated (Box 2). The three largest banks in FYR Macedonia control over 70
percent of banking assets. One of these banks is FYR Macedonian, the others have parent
banks in Greece and Slovenia. While this presents a potential spillover risk for these two
banks in the event the parent bank’s condition worsens, causing deposit withdrawals as a

                                                 6
result of lack of confidence in these banks, it is mitigated by strict regulations from the
NBRM. According to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) Life
in Transition Survey of 2010, during the financial crisis trust in banks and financial
institutions in FYR Macedonia increased and is above average for the region. This confidence
in local financial institutions, coupled with the continued strengthening of the regulatory
framework, resulted in good performance of the financial sector during the crisis.

                           Box 2: Risk Mitigation in FYR Macedonia’s Financial Sector
Regulations in the banking sector increase confidence in the system and prevent sudden shocks.
The National Bank has strict regulations on lending between subsidiaries and parent banks. According to
the Law on Banks (Official Gazette No. 67/2010) the exposure of the subsidiaries towards the parent bank
(or related entities) cannot exceed 10 percent of the bank’s capital. Furthermore, the Law regulates the
maximum exposure toward the shareholders or persons with special rights within the bank as well as the
total exposure of the bank as per these regulated issues.
Stress-tests are being performed semi-annually by the NBRM. In the second quarter of 2012
                                                                                                         5
additional simulations were introduced to increase the level of degree of assumed shocks. Stress-tests
are based on the assumption of fourteen different hypothetical situations. These stress-tests simulate the
possible channels of contagion of the negative effects of the Greek and Euro zone crisis to the domestic
banking sector (transferred through the real sector). The majority of banks pass the stress-tests even
when extreme hypotheses are being assumed, leading to a conclusion that even though the banking
sector is exposed to risks, overall it is sound and liquid.
Strengthening of the deposit insurance framework encouraged an increase in deposits. According
to the recent changes to the Deposits Insurance Law, 100 percent of the deposits (MKD or f/x) amounting
up to EUR30,000 are guaranteed by the Fund. This brings additional security to depositors. Over the past
two years total deposits in the banking system have risen an average of 10.9 percent in 2011 and 8.2
percent in 2012 on a y-o-y basis. The three large banks hold about 70 percent of total deposits, though the
medium and small banks are increasing their market share in deposits.

16.     Credit to private sector has been steadily expanding, as banks obtain most of
their funding from domestic deposits. Reliance on domestic deposits for financing coupled
with minimal exposure to external risks has helped the banking sector insulate itself to date
from Euro zone contagion. After the credit growth contraction to 5.7 percent in 2010 (down
from 14.3 percent growth in 2009) credit to private sector during 2011 and 2012 has expanded
on average by 7.5 percent, with the three large banks holding most of the portfolio (between
65 and 70 percent). Furthermore due to the higher increase of the deposits base, the loan to
deposits ratio has been kept well below one since 2010.

17.    Overall, banks are considered sound. Lending is funded by deposits; the Capital
Adequacy Ratio was 17.4 percent at the end of the second quarter of 2012; liquidity is strong
and the sector managed to attract FDI even during the difficult period in 2011. Non-
performing loans, stable at 10 percent of gross loans as of end-June 2012, are fully
provisioned. Profitability remains low however, with overall Return on Average Assets
(ROAA) at 0.4 percent in the second quarter of 2012, while the ROAA of the three large
banks is 0.9 percent.

 This situations include: increase in the exposure towards higher credit risk categories; combination of credit
and f/x shock; increase in a certain percentage of the low risk credit exposure towards high risk credit exposure
categories; shocks on the side of credit risk, f/x risk and interest rate risk; requalification from low to high risk
category of the five/ten highest credit exposures of the bank etc. Furthermore, specific stress-test related to the
Greek and Euro zone crisis are being performed.

18.      External imbalances have remained sustainable during 2011 and 2012, and are
largely funded through FDI and remittances (Table 1). Sluggish domestic demand and
solid private transfers kept the CAD low at 2.7 percent of GDP in 2011 (calculated in US$).
FYR Macedonia was able to attract FDI worth about 4.4 percent of GDP in 2011, including
some high-profile investors such as Johnson Controls and Johnson Matthey. A lot of FDI are
now second generation investments to expand existing production facilities. Remittances have
remained stable at around 19 percent of GDP, helping to fund the trade deficit. As a result,
reserves increased to slightly below EUR2.1 billion in mid-2012, or above 4 months of
imports of goods and services. The short-term external debt-to-reserve ratio remained
comfortable at around 86 percent, as of July 2012. However, the external current account
deficit is expected to increase to 3.5 percent in 2012, due to the poor performance in the first
quarter stemming partly from FDI-related imports.

19.     Fiscal pressures have increased with the 2012 budget. In 2011, the fiscal deficit
was 2.5 percent of GDP (on a cash basis), in line with Government target. The 2012 budget
was formulated based on optimistic revenue forecasts. Lower-than-projected growth affected
revenue performance adversely in the first half of 2012. In response, Government adopted a
Supplemental Budget in April 2012 with measures designed to cut expenditure by 4.5 percent
in nominal terms, with the aim of maintaining prudent fiscal accounts. The Supplemental
Budget reinforced the authorities’ recent strong record in fiscal discipline. The main measures
included: (i) a reduction in capital expenditures; (ii) cuts in goods and services; and (iii) lower
allocations for non-social transfers. Nonetheless, by end-August 2012, nearly 80 percent of
the fiscal deficit was already exhausted.

20.     Even with the additional austerity measures in the revised 2012 budget, the fiscal
deficit in 2012 is projected to increase to 3.7 percent of GDP (Table 2). The deficit in the

                                                                    8
first eight months of the year amounted to MKD10.1 million (2.1 percent of GDP) compared
with MKD9.2 million (2 percent of GDP) in the same period of 2011. Personal income tax,
profit tax and Value Added Tax (VAT) revenues all declined as percent of GDP. This trend
was partly off-set by an increase in customs and excise revenue (resulting from higher tax
revenues due to increased oil prices). 6 Expenditure also declined in the first eight months of
the year but this adjustment was not sufficient to compensate for the lower revenues. Wages
and salaries declined as a proportion of GDP, reflecting a freeze in public sector wages.
Spending on goods and services and capital declined, but this is partly the result of a build-up
in arrears. Transfer spending increased reflecting an increase in agricultural subsidies.
Although growth is forecasted to be slightly positive in the second half of the year, its impact
on revenues is not expected to balance the poor revenue performance in the first eight months.

21.     Government announced this increase in the deficit will reflect the planned
payment of half of accumulated budgetary arrears by the end of 2012, with the remainder
to be paid in the first quarter of 2013. This will result in lower net VAT collections (VAT
accounts for over a third of tax revenues) and higher expenditure in the final quarter of the
year than previously forecast. Budgetary arrears 7 consist of VAT refunds (about 60 percent)
and payment arrears on goods and services and their stock is currently estimated at around 1-2
percent of GDP. The repayment of arrears will support economic activity and is in line with
long-term sustainability of public finances.

22.    The draft 2013 budget was approved by Cabinet on November 2, 2011 and
transmitted to Parliament on November 3, 2012. It was published promptly on the web-
page of the Parliament. The legislative approval and enactment period for the budget is in
December -usually in the first half of that month. Gazetting as well as web-posting happens
on the Ministry of Finance’s website before the start of the new fiscal year, on January 1.

23.      Living conditions have been affected by the uncertain economic environment and
an economic recovery which did not generate robust growth in jobs. Although the impact
of the global economic crisis in 2009 was less severe than in many countries in the region and
the recovery gained some momentum during 2010 and early 2011, consumption of the
vulnerable did not improve during this period, reflecting weaknesses in the labor markets.
According to the latest national poverty measurement, based on the Survey on Income and
Living Conditions (SILC), in 2010 less than a third of the population (27.3 percent) lived in
poverty. Unchanged labor market conditions and the increase in global food and fuel prices
contributed to this situation. Females in particular remain disadvantaged in the labor markets
with an activity rate of around 51 percent compared with 77 percent for males, and this gap is
growing. The official unemployment rate fell slightly from 32.0 percent in 2010 to about 31.4
percent in 2011 and further to 31.2 in the second quarter of 2012, most likely reflecting a lag
from the increased economic activity in the first half of 2011. But with the slowdown in 2012,
it is likely to turn up again. A meaningful reduction in the poverty rate would require stronger
economic growth as well as policy interventions to ensure that growth is inclusive.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

24.     Despite the current difficult economic climate, the growth outlook for FYR
Macedonia is relatively positive with growth projected to reach 2 percent in 2013. A
significant improvement in the business climate combined with efforts to attract investment is
beginning to reap rewards. The country is investing in Free Technological Industrial
Development Zones with good access to infrastructure and tax incentives. In addition,
Macedonian wage increases during the boom were more in line with productivity increases
than in many other Eastern European countries. Reasonable wages, improving infrastructure
and an improving business climate are encouraging businesses to invest in Macedonia. FDI is
the cornerstone of future export-oriented growth (Box 3). Infrastructure investment, largely
externally funded (especially by the EBRD), will also help to boost growth as well as improve
transport links. The challenge in the future will be to maintain this momentum. Despite the
benefits from FDI and infrastructure projects, the external climate remains challenging and
growth is likely to remain constrained by recession in many Euro zone countries.

25.     The medium-term outlook hinges on the economic performance in the Euro zone,
the realization of planned FDI, and sound structural reforms that improve
competitiveness. Assuming growth in the Euro zone recovers, GDP growth is expected to
pick up over the medium term. Supportive macroeconomic policies and continued structural
reforms to improve competitiveness will be crucial in further boosting investment and
increasing productivity. Reforms that aim to lower costs for business, including infrastructure
investments and regulatory reforms, as well as those that improve the functioning of the labor
market and raise the skill level of workers will be particularly important for future growth. As
the recent gender diagnostic shows, female entrepreneurship is currently limited and remains
an unexploited source of growth. Efforts to encourage females to start Small and Medium
Enterprises (SMEs) could stimulate economic activity and employment in the medium term.

                                                 10
                                            Box 3: Foreign Direct Investment
The Government considers FDI as one of the cornerstones for future growth and, through its agency
Invest in Macedonia, has been active in efforts to attract private investors in recent years. In addition to
international fairs, advertisements about the fast-improving investment climate have been published in a
number of global TV and newspaper networks. In addition, high-level officials (including the Prime Minister
and the Minister of Finance) are often present at the road-shows organized in targeted countries,
addressing private businesses directly. Over the past years significant reforms have been made to
improve the business climate and this has been reflected in the Doing Business Indicators. The country
                                                                                                  nd
has been repeatedly cited as one of the top five reformers in the world and was ranked as 23 on the
Ease of Doing Business 2013, up from 34 in 2011. Finally, Free Technological Industrial Development
Zones have been established to ensure that firms have access to high-quality physical infrastructure.
These efforts have helped to attract FDI, which reached 4.4 percent of GDP in 2011. Unlike other
countries in the region, almost all investments are export-oriented and many are part of a long-term
investment plan for FYR Macedonia. Large companies, such as Johnson Matthey and Johnson Controls,
are already expanding their production through a second wave of investments, a sign of confidence in the
country. Several companies also invested for the first time during 2012 –largely in light manufacturing–
and are expected to start production by the end of the year or in early 2013. Minimum investment amounts
for selected key investors for the remainder of 2012 and 2013 are presented in Table 3.

In addition, a large number of companies are in an advanced stage of negotiations with
Government on new FDIs (mostly in the car industry, food and construction). Total green-field FDI in
2013 (largely by export-oriented industries) is expected to reach around EUR250 million (1.9 percent of
GDP). Other sources of FDI (largely reinvested earnings) are expected to push this up to 3 percent of
GDP. This trend is likely to continue in 2014 as the Government continues pursuing its agenda of
improving the business climate combined with aggressive marketing as well as expanding the number of
Free Technological Industrial Development Zones from the current four zones up to ten.

26.     Medium-term fiscal planning weakened during the recent crisis period. Before
2009, the Ministry of Finance prepared a Medium-Term Fiscal Strategy with expenditure
ceilings for line ministries on a three year rolling basis. The strategy was based on
Government priorities developed by the General Secretariat. However, in the last two years no
ceilings for the outer years were provided. Furthermore, the annual budget preparation
process does not contain a strategic phase to determine budget ceilings. Planned Amendments
to the Law on Budgets are expected to strengthen strategic budget planning in line ministries.

27.     FYR Macedonia’s medium-term fiscal outlook appears to be challenging. The
fiscal accounts will need to be gradually adjusted over the medium-run, requiring strong
control of expenditures. If this is achieved, budget financing requirements are projected to

represents some improvement in the overly optimistic revenue forecasts of previous years.
However, there remains concern that despite the more positive 2013 growth outlook of 2
percent, this target will be difficult to meet in absence of new tax policy or tax administration

8
  Since the 2013 budget the Agency for State Roads will be treated as a public enterprise and not an agency. For
that reason it will not be part of the general budget.

measures. The 2013 revenue increase is expected to come largely from higher VAT receipts.
This is despite the fact that VAT receipts are projected to be especially low in 2012 due to
large arrears payments, although arrears clearances are likely to be front-loaded (in 2012
rather than 2013). Payment of VAT arrears is expected to stimulate the private sector and
encourage VAT payment in 2013, boosting revenue in that year.

30.     If a revenue short fall materialized, expenditures would need to be cut to
maintain the projected fiscal deficit of 3.5 percent. Another risk is that despite
Government’s sensible budgeting for arrears clearance in 2013, this arrears clearance effort
might increase fiscal pressures throughout 2013. Following the public announcement of
Government to clear arrears, new payment requests have continued to come in. This is
creating a fluctuation in the stock and some uncertainty about the exact level of stock of
arrears and adequacy of the budgeted funds to cover its clearance. The Bank team is in close
consultation with the authorities on the arrears issue in the context of this PEPBG, which
supports policies to reduce the stock of arrears and to eliminate the new flow of arrears.

31.    During 2013, Government financing needs will be met through the issuance of
domestic debt, external loans and drawdown on Government deposits. Financing needs in
2013 amount to EUR545 million. This includes EUR288 million of deficit financing and
EUR257 million amortization, including EUR175 million to repay a Eurobond due in January
2013 (Table 4). All domestic debt due in the period is expected to be rolled over. Identified
financing sources include EUR290 million of external donor financing (World Bank PEPBG
and Competitiveness DPL) and EUR59 million in new domestic debt (largely 3 and 5 year
bonds). If no additional domestic debt is issued beyond that identified, Government deposits
should be sufficient to close the financing gap. But this would result in a 70 percent decline in
deposits, and would be a significant reduction in the buffer designed to help cushion against
unexpected negative shocks in a volatile economic environment.

32.    Inflation is expected to remain contained, anchored by the commitment to the
exchange rate peg. The commitment to maintaining the value of the Denar remains strong
and standard measures do not indicate significant exchange rate misalignment. Recent
analysis by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) suggests that the exchange rate is broadly
appropriate, and that stabilization of inflation at around 2 percent and a continuation of
modest wage growth (in line with productivity) should keep the real exchange rate stable. The
current coverage of foreign exchange reserves (4 months of imports or EUR2.1 billion),
provides a reasonable buffer, which is expected to be maintained over the medium term.

                                                 13
33.     The banking sector is generally well placed to support the recovery, as banks
obtain most of their funding from domestic deposits and have limited reliance on
external financing (including parent banks). With the loan-deposit ratio at well below one
and low external exposure, banks should be able to support a pick-up in credit activity and
demand once the environment strengthens. Credit activity is expected to increase over the
medium term at an average annual rate of around 10 percent. A large proportion of this will
be financed by deposit growth that is forecast at 7-10 percent in the medium term.

34.     The external CAD is expected to widen somewhat over the medium term, but
remain at sustainable levels. Over the medium term it is projected to further widen as FDI-
related imports increase and domestic demand recovers. Export growth is projected to remain
robust, aided by the expansion of production capacities supported by FDI. Furthermore, the
continued inflow of FDI and the expected increase of exports could provide an additional
stimulus to growth. Private transfers are projected to remain stable at around 19 percent of
GDP 9, and continue to help finance the CAD. FDI and external borrowing will also be
important sources of financing. Despite moderate financing requirements, the pegged
exchange rate and volatile capital markets warrant caution.

35.     Government debt is expected to increase to about 34 percent of GDP by 2014, up
from 24 percent in 2009. Higher deficits intended to fund the payment of arrears and
increases in pensions are the main drivers of the increased debt. Despite the increase, debt
sustainability analysis (Annex 4) shows that the debt level is sustainable and remains
relatively moderate by international standards. A shock that permanently reduces growth
throughout the projection period compared with the baseline 10 would result in public debt
increasing to 40 percent of GDP by the end of 2017. This points to the country’s vulnerability
in the face of prolonged turmoil in the Euro zone and the need to ensure that structural
reforms that maintain economic growth are enacted. Debt sustainability would be tested if the
fiscal deficit is not controlled over the medium-term. An increase in the primary fiscal deficit
compared with the baseline scenario over the projection period would increase public debt to
39 percent of GDP by end-2017. Public debt is also vulnerable to exchange rate shocks with a
single 30 percent depreciation increasing debt by more than 10 percentage points of GDP.

36.     The proposed PEPBG will help to moderate some of the risks by ensuring timely
reforms and improved access to financing. It will support reforms to ensure the continued
competitiveness of FYR Macedonia’s economy, improved public financial management, and
protection for vulnerable groups. In addition, despite relatively sound fundamentals, financing
conditions for FYR Macedonia remain tight and have deteriorated recently. The PEPBG
would help the Government to raise financing for the 2013 budget. While borrowing costs
(including for FYR Macedonia) declined in early 2012 amid reduced risk aversion, these have
increased significantly in recent months.

  Main baseline assumptions are: (1) real growth slowly accelerates to 4 percent by 2016; (2) inflation slowly
comes down to 2 percent and remains there from 2015; (3) the fiscal deficit stabilizes at 2 percent of GDP from
2016 with revenues growing at the same rate as nominal GDP; (4) imports and exports continue to grow - both
driven by FDI - in the medium term reaching 82.6 and 63.2 percent respectively by 2017.

                                                             14
37.     Despite the identified risks, Government’s track record and macroeconomic
policies are considered adequate for the purposes of the proposed PEPBG. The set of
macroeconomic policies are adequate given the overall economic environment and should
support economic activity but also keep the external and fiscal balances manageable. Still,
policy-makers need to stand ready to take measures in case the situation deteriorates.

ELIGIBILITY FOR POLICY BASED GUARANTEE 11

Criterion A: The country should have a strong track record of performance, and its
structural, social and macroeconomic policy package should be satisfactory.

38.      FYR Macedonia has established and maintained a strong track record on
macroeconomic stability and the implementation of structural reforms. After it restored
macroeconomic stability in the mid-1990s, it has maintained it despite difficult circumstances,
including over the past few years. Capacity in key agencies to analyze, plan and implement
policies has been continuously evolving. Structural reforms have advanced in a number of
areas over the last decade, boosting incomes, and infrastructure improved. While growth was
slightly lower compared to other countries in the region in the first half of the last decade,
economic activity picked up prior to the global crisis in response to improvements in the
investment climate. In addition, some of these reforms helped mitigate the impact of the
crisis. FYR Macedonia is now one of the best-performing countries in terms of ease of doing
business. GDP per capita has doubled from US$5,943 in 2000 to US$11,665 in 2011. Labor
market reforms advanced and property and creditor rights strengthened over the last decade.
In the banking sector, the legal framework now provides sufficient power to the central bank
to regulate and supervise the banking sector, which has resulted in sound practices and kept
banks well capitalized and liquid.

39.     Government follows a broad reform agenda to build human resources and
improve the effectiveness of its social systems. Recent reforms to the social safety net
system includes administrative improvements to allow better monitoring and use of funds and
the introduction of means-tested programs (e.g. for secondary education). The country has
come a long way in reforming the pension system to meet the challenges of an aging
population. However, fiscal strains of the global crisis and a slow recovery would require a
prudent approach to pension policies, especially with respect to ad-hoc pension increases.
Particular attention has been directed to improving education outcomes. Having achieved
increased access to education services at all levels, recent reforms have a stronger focus on
improving the quality of education. Progress is also made toward ensuring the sustainability
of the health system. Reforms over the last decade aimed to streamline the operations,
decision-making and transparency in the health sector and facilitate a move towards more
efficient (output-based) payment systems for health care providers.

Criterion B: The country should have a sustainable external financing plan.

40.     The country’s external debt is moderate and external financing requirements
remain moderate. Gross external debt (public and private) at the end of Q1 2012 was around
62 percent of GDP (Box 5). Government external debt accounts for around 18 percent of GDP
and is largely on concessional terms. Non-government external debt accounts for around 45

     A more comprehensive discussion on all criteria can be found in

                                                           15
percent of GDP, out of which 12 percent is in the form of FDI-related transactions. Debt
amortization is not excessive. However, amortization will increase going forward, reflecting
the shift towards market-based financing, which typically has shorter maturities compared to
concessional financing. More specifically, the repayment of Eurobonds in January 2013 and
2015 will increase financing needs, but these are expected to be rolled over at maturity. A
moderate fiscal deficit will keep financing requirements manageable. Furthermore, securing
external financing for a significant part of the deficit will safeguard investor confidence,
attract foreign capital to support the exchange rate peg and avoid crowding-out of credit for
the private sector. Prudential regulations introduced by Central Bank should ensure that banks
do not build sizable liabilities based on short-term or volatile inflows.

                                     Box 5: Gross External Debt
  FYR Macedonia’s gross external debt stood at 62 percent of GDP at the end of the second
  quarter of 2012, up from 50 percent in 2006. The ratio was relatively stable until 2008, with
  increases in private sector debt partially offset by reductions in Government debt as a result of the
  early pre-payment of Government liabilities towards the London and Paris Clubs, the IMF and
  IBRD in 2006 and 2007. It picked up in 2009 and 2010 reflecting increased borrowing and FDI-
  related transactions in an environment of stagnant nominal GDP.

  Source: NBRM
  Government debt accounts for around one third of total gross external debt, with market-
  based borrowing (2 Eurobonds and one commercial loan) accounting for around 30 percent of it.
  Non-bank commercial sector accounts for an additional 32 percent of debt, while banks account
  for 12 percent of debt. In terms of maturity, around two-thirds of the external debt is long-term.
  The remaining short-term debt is largely in fully collateralized trade credits and FDI-related
  transactions with low roll-over risk (except the upcoming repayment of the EUR175 million
  Eurobond in early 2013). Debt servicing accounts for around 10 percent of exports of goods and
  services, significantly below the regional average. The collapse in exports due to the global crisis
  pushed the external debt to exports ratio up to above 150 percent of GDP in 2009; however, as
  exports recovered it retreated to 108 percent in 2011. Although external debt may seem high,
  intra-company lending accounts for around 60 percent of it. FYR Macedonian external debt is
  largely used for productive purposes and is sustainable.


Criterion C: The country should have a coherent borrowing strategy, which will enable it to
become a borrower in its own name without a guarantee in the medium term.

41.     The legal and institutional framework for debt management is sound. Financing
requirements are managed within the framework of a public debt strategy and the institutional
set-up of the public debt department in the Ministry of Finance follows good practice.

42.    Government has a strategy for market-based financing and has accessed
international markets independently on two occasions. FYR Macedonia issued a EUR150
                                                     16
million 10-year Eurobond in 2005 with a coupon rate of 4.625 which was used to retire old
London Club debt. A EUR175 million 3.5-year Eurobond was issued in 2009 with a coupon
rate of 9.875 for budget financing. Plans to issue a third Eurobond in 2010 were pulled due to
the unfavorable market terms prevailing. Neither of these bonds is traded frequently, and
yields for the more liquid issue maturing in 2015 are currently over 7 percent and volatile, to a
large extent due to FYR Macedonia’s proximity to the troubled Euro zone countries. Despite
this gradual shift towards commercial terms and with the exception of the two Eurobond
issues, a sizable part of Government debt remains concessional with very low interest rates.
Guarantees account for less than 4 percent of GDP and refer largely to guaranteed loans from
multilateral creditors to public enterprises.

43.     The authorities have also borrowed domestically. Domestic borrowing has come
under increased scrutiny for crowding-out financing for the private sector, though abundant
liquidity in the banking sector suggests that this may not be the case. So far in 2012, the
Government has raised around EUR295 million net in the domestic market. Currently, the
stock of domestic T-bills outstanding is around 6.3 percent of GDP equally split into 3-month
and 6-month bills with an interest rate slightly above 4 percent. Demand for government
paper has been stable, mostly coming from domestic banks and pension funds. Going
forward, the authorities plan to further develop the domestic debt market and increase the
average maturity. As a first step, a five-year domestic bond was successfully issued in late-
September 2011. This strategy may help to reduce market risks ahead and reliance on external
financing to cover the budget, but also support the development of the broader financial sector
in the country (including pension funds and financial intermediaries).

44.      Despite relatively sound fundamentals, financing conditions for FYR Macedonia
remain tight and have deteriorated once again since late 2011, notably amidst Euro zone
volatility and fears of an even sharper global slowdown. Global investors are broadly risk-
averse, reflecting widespread uncertainty about the direction of the financial market over the
months ahead. Also, some conditions inherent to FYR Macedonia (such as, small and
infrequent issuances, vulnerability to external factors, and proximity to troubled Euro zone
countries) render access to markets tight and sovereign debt issuance problematic. For FYR
Macedonia, recent market soundings suggest a maximum feasible tenor of five years (in the
absence of a high-grade guarantee). The spread likely achievable in the current market may
figure in the range of 650-700bp over the high-grade swap rate (about 8 percent in aggregate),
with a number of financial institutions sounding skepticism that an unenhanced transaction in
Euro could even be closed for FYR Macedonia in this climate.

45.    The proposed PEPBG supports the government’s borrowing strategy and in line
with the IBRD’s policy on PBGs, the proposed operation would: (a) provide improved
market access; (b) leverage the Bank’s capital substantially better than a DPL; and (c) reduce
FYR Macedonia’s borrowing costs considerably.

46.      The proposed PEPBG improves market access by enabling FYR Macedonia to
tap funding from the international bank loan market, at a time of ongoing financial
market turmoil. The proposed guarantee is expected to lead to more diversified sources of
financing for FYR Macedonia by initiating interest among large foreign banks and financial
institutions that may currently have little exposure to the country. The country’s integration
into markets will be strengthened and its relationship with lenders will be improved. The
proposed PEPBG would also leverage better Bank’s capital by helping FYR Macedonia to

                                                 17
increase the total amount raised. In order to maximize debt capacity, the PEPBG will
guarantee a partial amount of debt service, between 55-65 percent of principal and interest.
This will allow the country to issue a relatively sizable commercial loan of EUR250 million,
out of which EUR155 million would be guaranteed by IBRD. The loan would carry a higher
rate compared to a full principal guarantee or full guarantee of all debt service; however, the
rate achieved will be significantly lower than the cost estimated for a non-guaranteed
instrument. The PEPBG would allow FYR Macedonia to borrow at improved terms, including
longer tenor and lower rates. It would allow the country to comfortably borrow a large
volume with a 5-7 year maturity, or for about 50-100 percent longer than was achieved
through the last Eurobond issue in 2009. In addition, the cost of funding would be
significantly below the rates currently available to FYR Macedonia in today’s volatile market
in the absence of an IBRD guarantee. Including arrangement fees and the IBRD guarantee
fees, the loan should be extended at below 5 percent, a marked improvement from the likely 8
percent rate that FYR Macedonia would expect to pay in today’s market.

47.     Execution risks have increased in the current environment, but regional
experience with PBGs is encouraging. While market soundings do confirm the interest for
an IBRD-guaranteed borrowing by FYR Macedonia, the current environment is highly
unpredictable, which results in ongoing risk-aversion among emerging market investors,
which are increasingly carefully differentiating across credit quality. Following the PBG-
supported borrowing, Serbia was able to issue a 15 year domestic Euro T-bond at favorable
rates. In late September 2011, moreover, Serbia managed to issue a 10-year Global Bond and
raise US$1 billion, further reflecting improved market access. Most recently, in July 2012,
Montenegro borrowed EUR100 million for a 7-year maturity with an estimated savings of up
to 400 basis points p.a.. Following the PBG-supported transaction closed for FYR Macedonia
in November 2011, some level of market access was improved as well, as reflected by a
EUR75 million loan secured in tight markets earlier in 2012.

III.   THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

48.     The overarching goal of the country is EU integration, improved economic
performance and reduction of unemployment and poverty. While FYR Macedonia does
not have a single national development strategy statement, key documents include the
Stabilization and Association Agreement with the EU and Accession Partnership with the EU,
as well as the closely-linked National Plan on Adoption of the Acquis and the Pre-accession
Economic Program (serving as a macro-fiscal strategic document) and other sector strategies.
The Ohrid Framework Agreement, which concluded six months of hostilities in 2001,
regulates the relationship with minority communities in the country. Specific priorities of the
2011–2015 Government program include: (i) emphasis on economic growth and private
sector development; (ii) integration into the EU and NATO; (iii) fight against corruption and
economic crime; (iv) good interethnic relations on the basis of the Ohrid Framework
Agreement; and (v) investments in education, science and a knowledge based society.

49.     The Government’s program outlined here largely draws from the VMRO-
DPMNE’s Election manifesto for the 2011 Parliamentary elections as well as recent
analysis on the impact of the global turmoil. The VMRO-DPMNE program reflects inputs
from a comprehensive consultation process with the expert community in the country and the
non-government sector, including employee representatives, chambers of commerce, and
civil-society organizations. While the program continues to provide the overall direction for

                                                18
the activities of the Government, the global crisis has necessitated additional policies which
have, in most cases, been discussed and agreed with representatives of the non-government
sector and the private sector. Further, the overarching goals across the political spectrum are
broadly similar, which provides relatively broad consensus for the reform program.

50.     The program clearly identifies macroeconomic stability as a key pre-condition
for sustainable and strong growth of the economy and calls for greater efficiency in
public spending. On the basis of this program, the current Government was recently re-
elected for a third term in office in mid-2011. It calls for prudent fiscal policy and a
sustainable deficit level as well as a reduction of non-priority spending and an increase in
capital spending. The reforms in social protection and social inclusion are also a major theme
of the program, aimed at improving the protection of the most vulnerable. Also, the program
calls for more effective management of resources in the health sector (i.e. the introduction of
protocols and the medical network).

51.     The framework in place allows for a consultative process in decision making, but
certain aspects of consultations are still evolving. Consulting and communicating reforms
with relevant stakeholders are important given the ethnic and social diversity of FYR
Macedonia. While there is a shared view about the necessity for reforms, implementing these
can be difficult, especially if the external economic environment deteriorates further and
results in slow improvements in living conditions. Government has established a number of
bodies to channel and discuss planned policies. As a result, the 2011 Progress Report of the
EC noted further improvements in the regulatory framework as well as modest improvement
in implementation. Additional efforts are needed to build capacities among stakeholders and
to encourage wider participation of stakeholders.

52.    The program supported by the proposed PEPBG reflects input from various
stakeholders. Government maintains regular consultations with the business community
where the fiscal policy stance and some aspects of the public financial management agenda
have been discussed. Reforms related to social protection and inclusion benefited from
consultations and discussions during the preparation of the National Strategy on Reduction of
Poverty and Social Exclusion 2010-2020, which received broad support in the Parliament.
The authorities have also taken considerable efforts to communicate the ongoing health sector
reforms, including through regular and frequent presentations, and are working with the
World Bank in conducting poverty and social impact assessments of some of the proposed
measures in the health sector.

53.     The unpredictable external environment has necessitated adjustments in
Government policies. The fiscal framework has been adjusted in the 2012 Supplement
Budget to reflect the lower-than-planned revenues, with expenditure cuts being largely
focused on capital expenditures and goods and services. Transfers to the vulnerable have been
protected, while spending on wages and salaries remain tightly controlled. The increased
allocations for active labor market policies (such as public works, employment grants and
loans, training) as well as measures to improve credit availability for the private sector
(additional capital for the Macedonian Bank for Development Promotion and a sovereign
guarantee for an EIB loan to the SME sector) are also expected to mitigate the short-term
impact of the renewed turmoil.



                                                19
54.    The authorities also remain committed to reforms that create grounds for future
growth, including through a strong focus on improving the investment climate. A better
business environment will reduce costs and improve competitiveness of businesses. Efforts
have also been undertaken to promote competition in a number of sectors (for example,
banking, telecommunications) and to strengthen property, creditor and contract rights (for
example, reforms in the judiciary and cadastre). Also, major efforts have been made to attract
foreign direct investments, which appear to have resulted in a number of large international
companies establishing presence in the country.

55.     As discussed in further detail below, the Government’s reform program
supported by the proposed PEPBG focuses on three pillars: (i) strengthening public
financial management; (ii) improving the efficiency of spending and service provision in the
health sector; and (iii) strengthening social protection and inclusion.

Strengthening public financial management practices
56.     Recent economic challenges have put pressure on public financial management
(PFM) practices. While FYR Macedonia compares favorably to countries in the region in a
number of PFM aspects, notably in external audit and procurement administration, further
strengthening is desirable in some areas, especially commitment controls, which are important
for controlling and preventing the emergence of budgetary expenditure arrears.

57.      The budget planning process is generally in line with good international practice.
The Budget Law and the annual budget circular provide for an orderly budget process,
including the provision for medium-term fiscal and budgetary projections. The fiscal
framework is defined as part of a medium-term macroeconomic, fiscal and public debt
management strategy, but not all of its aspects were implemented in the recent crisis period
(paragraph 26). In addition, the framework envisages close linkages between the strategic
priorities of the Government and budget users and their medium term budget plans. An
explicit annual budget calendar with key dates is specified in the Budget Law which allows
for sufficient parliamentary and other consultation processes.

58.     Expenditure controls are also applied in budget execution processes, though these
need to be strengthened. There is a centralized Treasury Single Account and centralized
payment control through the Treasury. The Manual on Treasury Operations sets out a series of
procedures intended to control the budget execution process. Once the budget is approved,
budget users submit an annual cash plan, broken down by quarters. A quarterly plan must also
be submitted by budget users within 5 days of the beginning of the quarter including a
breakdown of planned expenditures by month within the quarter. Liabilities (such as contracts
signed, orders or official travel) greater than EUR590 per item must be reported to the
Treasury central commitment ledger within 10 working days from the date that the liability
occurred. Payment requests must be submitted by users to the Treasury for validation. Each
month budget users must submit details for all unsettled liabilities by the 10th of the
following month, clearly identifying liabilities that have been unsettled for up to 30 days, up
to 60 days and over 60 days by expenditure item. Monthly financial reports on budget
execution are published on the Ministry of Finance website. Explicit limits are in place on in-
year virements (transfers from an account with a surplus to cover the deficit within another)
within appropriations, including maximum adjustments for salaries, rents and allowances, and
there is Parliamentary control over virements between budget users. Annual financial


                                                20
statements, audited by the State Audit Office, are submitted to the Assembly within six
months of the end of the financial year.

59.     Despite this sound legal and regulatory framework for budget preparation and
execution, the current turmoil has exposed weaknesses in its implementation. Budget
preparation could further improve, including on improving revenue forecasts, managing
multi-year commitments and better aligning strategic priorities to budget allocations. For
example, the discrepancies between the budgeted amounts and actual revenues have been
large in recent years (around 16 percent in 2009, and around 8 percent in both 2010 and
2011). While part of this could be attributed to the unpredictable external environment, the
size of the underperformance and its persistence could be indicative of the need to improve
capacity in this area. Also, while the strategic documents (such as macro-fiscal strategy and
budget circular) contain some medium-term perspective, the adopted Budget remains a single-
year document (with the exception of development projects) which is not systematically
monitored or recorded in the Treasury Information System, and is making implementation of
multi-year projects more challenging.

60.     Some of these weaknesses are putting pressure on budget execution, which
together with deficiencies in the commitment control framework have resulted in the
emergence of public sector payment arrears. The significant underperformance of revenues
over the last few years needed to be matched by similar cuts in cash expenditures to meet the
targeted deficit levels. While the strong efforts to limit outlays to avoid exceeding the deficit
target are encouraging, they have had an undesirable effect on the composition of spending
and on meeting commitment obligations. Adjustment in budget appropriations after the
budget has been approved, can be difficult and may result in budget users taking on liabilities
in excess of what can be realistically financed by the budget. Also, budget users fail to
register commitments incurred within the period prescribed by the Manual on Treasury
Operations, thus preventing the Ministry of Finance from having adequate information about
the liabilities incurred by budget users and creating difficulties for cash management. This is a
particular concern for multi-year liabilities. The current system and procedures do not allow
budget users to record or report multi-year liabilities, which has resulted in some
commitments being overlooked when budgets are prepared. This has caused additional
expenditure pressures during budget execution because large unanticipated outlays cannot
easily be absorbed within the approved budgets and cash management plans. These practices
have contributed to the emergence of arrears. While the size of the arrears problem does not
appear to be threatening the stability of fiscal accounts, it is undermining the credibility of the
budget process and fiscal accounts and putting further pressure on the private sector in an
already challenging environment. Coping mechanisms by the private sector have included
non-invoicing of performed services (thus further affecting tax revenues for the budget) and
non-payment to sub-contractors, thus spreading the impact to the rest of the economy.

61.     The authorities are committed to improving financial management practices in
the public sector and are introducing safeguards to prevent future emergence of arrears.
First, the authorities launched an initiative to identify all existing multi-year liabilities
incurred by budget users. The information provided was used in the preparation of the 2013
budget with the aim of ensuring that all identified liabilities, including the stock of arrears, are
funded within a fiscally prudent timeframe. Second, the Ministry of Finance has implemented
amendments to the Manual on Treasury Operations which detail: (i) procedures for reporting
of multi-year commitments of budget users (on all spending items) to the Treasury; (ii)

                                                   21
stronger procedures for reporting liabilities on concluded contracts; (iii) procedures for
validation of commitment reports by internal auditors. The revised Manual also strengthens
the incentives for compliance, including refusing the payment of liabilities that are not
properly recorded, and requiring budget users to absorb within their authorized budgets the
cost of all multi-year commitments that they incur. The Government will give priority to the
elimination of arrears on a first in-first out basis while at the same time enforcing the payment
of all current liabilities, thereby preventing the accumulation of new arrears.

62.     The validation of reports to the Treasury on unsettled liabilities, including multi-
year liabilities, will be a major improvement because it will ensure that the information
held by Treasury will be complete and accurate. This will be beneficial for monitoring the
level and age of unsettled liabilities, and also assist with cash and debt management. The
Ministry of Finance can perform separate checks on contractual commitments by budget users
through the Public Procurement Bureau registry on awarded contracts. The Treasury
Department could compare the information received from budget users on their contractual
commitments with the register published by the Public Procurement Bureau.

63.     The changes in the regulations will be complemented with upgrades to the
Treasury Information System. The Treasury system was locally developed and has been in
place for around a decade. It is not well integrated with other central systems, such as the
budget, debt management, procurement management and budget user systems, and is reaching
the limits of its effective operations. It is doubtful that major modifications to the current
system would be cost-effective, although some important changes could be introduced
reasonably quickly without substantial outlays. Government has initiated development and
design of an upgrade to ensure that the multi-year commitments are fully integrated into the
Treasury Information System and the Budget preparation procedures. A technical working
group has been established within the Ministry of Finance to develop detailed procedures,
technical specifications and bidding documents for new software needed to record multi-year
commitments in the system. The upgraded system could realistically be expected to be fully
functioning by the end of 2013. Improvements to the Treasury Information System within the
next few years are expected to include a complete upgrade of the budget accounting and
reporting system, provision of online connections for every budget user, and improvements to
financial control mechanisms.

64.     The proposed improvement to financial management regulations will be an
important first phase in a longer term strategy to improve transparency of all liabilities
within the Government, prevent their accumulation and eliminate arrears. The changes
to the Manual on Treasury Operations will allow Treasury to monitor the level of
commitments and help to ensure that budget users make arrangements to meet their
obligations in a timely way and facilitate enforcement of obligations and imposition of
penalties where appropriate. It will also assist with cash management by ensuring that
Treasury is aware of the size and timing of commitments so that they can make arrangements
for sufficient funds to be available when needed. The proposed administrative changes will be
supplemented by action by the Ministry of Finance to ensure that budget instructions and
expenditure limits are fully enforced for all current liabilities.

65.    The accumulation of VAT arrears has arisen because processing times prescribed
in the law and regulations have not been followed systematically in recent years. The
applicable laws and regulations are sufficient to provide for timely payments, but a stronger

                                                 22
focus on consistent application of the arrangements is required. The Government has
recognized that greater attention to the timeframes for VAT refunds is a crucial element of its
strategy for clearing all overdue obligations. To that end, it has taken the necessary steps to
ensure that the backlog of refunds is processed on a first in, first out basis and is making sure
that new applications for refunds will be processed in accordance with the prescribed payment
deadlines.

66.     Further improvements in several areas of public finance management are
recommended, including: (i) improving budget revenue estimates and adopting conservative
approach in setting expenditure ceilings; (ii) strengthening regulation on commitment
accumulation and multi-year commitments; (iii) improving reporting on state-owned
enterprises; (iv) improvements in capital investment management and (v) strengthening
internal financial controls in the public sector. FYR Macedonia intends to implement a new,
integrated financial management system within the next few years and adopt International
Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). This would significantly improve the efficiency
and quality of financial administration and accountability. Ongoing monitoring and review of
public financial management performance, for example using the Public Expenditure and
Financial Accountability (PEFA) methodology, would be helpful to ensure that changes are
made in areas where weaknesses persist and affect overall performance.

Improving the efficiency of spending and service provision in the health sector

67.    Over the last decade, the authorities have introduced significant reforms to
improve the financial sustainability of the public health sector. The Health Insurance Law
was amended to streamline the operations, decision-making and transparency of the Board of
Directors of the Health Insurance Fund (HIF). The competitive procurement of
pharmaceuticals (an important achievement of a previous DPL series) resulted in considerable
savings. In 2009, the HIF Board instituted reference pricing 12 for drugs on the positive list and
stronger controls over spending were institutionalized, including through the introduction of
the Treasury function in the public health sector in 2011. Combined public and private health
spending in FYR Macedonia in 2010 was around 7.1 percent of GDP, down from close to 9
percent in 2004. Public spending was at 4.5 percent of GDP, mainly provided by the HIF
(mostly for purchase of health services) and the rest provided by the Ministry of Health
(MoH) for the purchase of equipment in public Health Care Institutions (HCIs), public health
programs and health insurance coverage for vulnerable groups.

68.     However, improvements in the financial position still need to be matched by
improvements in the quality of services. This reflects still existing disconnect between the
basic benefits package and available finances, unmatched demand and supply of services, an
unfinished agenda in management (autonomy and accountability) of HCIs and a gradual shift
towards output-based payment instruments. Access to and the quality of services needs to
further improve. Public opinion polls consistently rate health services as poor or very poor,
while household budget surveys show that out-of-pocket payments for health care are
significant and pose financial access barriers for poor households.




12
  Rather than procuring drugs, under reference pricing the HIF would reimburse a fixed amount covering the
cost of a generic drug. Doctors and patients could choose which drug to use.

                                                      23
69.      The provision of free health insurance to the unemployed was reformed to
decrease incentives to register as unemployed and to increase incentives for contributing
to the mandatory health insurance scheme and reduce free-riding. Until September 2011,
free health insurance was provided on the basis of registration as unemployed, without
extensive checks on the accuracy of information provided. As a result, an estimated 25
percent of all registered unemployed were registering only for the right to receive free health
insurance and were either informally employed or inactive. The 2011 reform decoupled the
provision of free health insurance from registration as unemployed and introduced an income-
test for the provision of free health insurance. While the reform was successful in reducing the
number of registered unemployed, it has not provided sufficient incentives for the
contribution to the health insurance system by those who could afford it. This is mainly due to
the fact that the income test to qualify for free health insurance is based on formal income,
and not on the actual means available to applicants. This less-than-perfect formal income test
is further hindered by delayed availability of data on income sources. In accordance with a
Memorandum of Understanding on exchange of data and information signed between the HIF
and the PRO, the data on recipients of free health insurance in 2011 was sent by the HIF to
the PRO in May 2012. The HIF will need to identify the cases of fraudulent claims of free
health insurance and initiate a procedure for reimbursement the expenditures incurred by HIF
for these persons. Closer cooperation between HIF and the PRO is essential to improve the
capability of HIF to identify fraudulent claims to free health insurance and to better enforce
the formal income test.

70.    The Treasury function introduced in the HIF in 2011 is generating savings and
improving financial management practices in the sector. As part of the previous program
supported by the first PBG the authorities introduced a Single Treasury Account in the public
health sector. Estimated savings in 2011 alone were EUR0.2 million, but more importantly
the new system is improving financial management practices by requiring health institutions
to prepare budgets and monthly plans and controlling their execution. The authorities have
continued to upgrade the system and are currently working on introducing e-Treasury.

71.     Reforms in the procurement system of the health sector are ongoing and are
resulting in important efficiency gains. First, with regard to procurement of drugs the MoH
revised the methodology for setting the prices of registered drugs by expanding the group of
reference countries. Second, centralization of the procurement of medical devices is
progressing and starting to lead to cost savings. For example, the authorities recently
completed the centralized procurement process for optical lenses and the results are
encouraging, with savings of around 50 percent per optical lenses set, or around EUR2
million over a three year period. Centralized procurement is being expanded to orthopedic
devices. In the future, MoH plans on expanding centralized procurement to around 150 drugs
(20 most frequently used and 20 most expensive drugs per HCI). Finally, the authorities
recently revised the legislative framework to require all health sector procurements to be
conducted through e-auctions and to allow HCIs to import drugs (transposing an EU Directive
on parallel imports).

72.     The system was also reshaped to ensure that provider coverage expands to
underserved areas. Until recently, the HIF did not take into consideration the demand for
health services as a factor in the process of contracting with medical providers. This led to an
excessive number of suppliers in certain—mostly urban—areas, sub-optimal concentration of
medical services and an additional financial burden to the HIF. The proposed PEPBG

                                                 24
supports the introduction of a Medical Network, which should address this issue. It defines for
the first time standards for health staff coverage of the population that will be used by HIF in
its contracting processes. That is, once the limit of contractors has been reached in a certain
area—so the standard has been met—HIF will not be able to contract with new providers
there. New contracts will only be issued for providers in underserved, mostly rural areas.
While there is some grandfathering built into the concept (existing providers with contracts
with the HIF will automatically be included in the Network) it is expected that over the long
term this measure will provide appropriate incentives for redistributing capacity in the system
to underserved areas.

73.     In the medium-term, there will be need for additional reforms in the health
sector. For example, incentives might be necessary to increase service provision in
underserved areas. Medical providers gravitate towards denser, urban populations, because it
enables them to capture a larger number of potential consumers at lower costs. Over time, if
unchecked, well-served urban areas might exist next to under-served rural areas. If, on the
other hand, new contracting is not allowed in urban areas, new providers will hopefully move
to less well-served areas, even if less profitable than serving urban areas. Nevertheless, in
certain remote rural areas service provisioning might not be profitable at all. In the medium
term, MoH and HIF will have to closely monitor the development of service provision in
under-served areas and consider providing additional incentives if service provision is not
expanded sufficiently to meet the new standards. The World Bank is assisting the authorities
in preparing a Poverty and Social Impact Assessment (PSIA) of potential changes to co-
payment policies, which is expected to inform any changes in co-payment policies in the
future. Through this and similar operations, the World Bank will continue to provide technical
assistance to improve the efficiency of health spending and the provision and quality of health
services in FYR Macedonia, from further strengthening the income-testing for free health
insurance, linking HIF with PRO to further improving procurement, the medical network, and
reforming the basic health benefit package.

Strengthening social protection and inclusion

74.     FYR Macedonia runs a complex social protection system that provides support to
a substantial part of the population. More than 20 percent of the population receives some
sort of social transfers. The largest transfer is the social financial assistance, an income-tested
last-resort income support providing assistance to around 40,000 households (8 percent of all
households, down from around 12 percent in 2006 reflecting efforts to improve targeting). A
few programs still remain categorical, with the parental benefit increasing in size recently.

75.     While the system helps mitigate adverse social impacts during an economic
downturn, improvements were needed, especially in terms of targeting and the
availability of financial resources. The system performs reasonably well by regional
standards, but it still suffers from both inclusion and exclusion errors. In addition, the level of
benefits might be not sufficient to help the vulnerable to escape poverty. A World Bank report
on the Social Safety Nets in Western Balkans (2011) indicates that the generosity 13 of social
assistance in FYR Macedonia is low compared with relatively high generosity in the Western
Balkan countries, i.e. the overall social assistance transfers account for only about 24 percent

13
  The generosity (also referred to as ‘adequacy’) of overall social assistance benefits is measured as the share of
benefits in total post-transfer consumption.

                                                           25
of total consumption. The last resort social assistance programs (means-tested) are assessed as
relatively modest and the share of the transfer in the post-transfer consumption of the poorest
quintile is around 25 percent.

76.     The authorities have been reforming the social safety net to enable it to better
respond to these challenges. A new Law on Social Protection was introduced in 2009 which
streamlined the procedures regulating the social protection system, and allowed for a rapid
response of the system to emerging priorities. This allowed the authorities to increase
decently targeted support in the form of energy poverty programs and conditional cash
transfers in education. An important next step was achieved with the preparation and adoption
of the bylaws which introduced a comprehensive definition of countable income for social
assistance purposes. A Cash Benefits Management Information System (CBMIS), a unique
registry of social cash beneficiaries, was developed and is an important tool in defining
policies to improve the functioning of the system. In addition, the infrastructure in the
Ministry of Labor and Social Policy (MoLSP) and the Social Welfare Centers (SWCs) was
upgraded to allow more efficient workflow in the sector.

77.      Improvement of the administration of the social safety net is underway. The roll-
out of the CBMIS has considerably improved the administration of the cash benefits and
reduced the leakage in the system. Administration of the cash benefits through CBMIS has
decreased the time spent for processing / payments of the cash benefits, decreased the burden
on the employees in the SWCs and created an appropriate database for analysis of the cash
benefits for the purpose of further policy change. The number of social assistance recipients
has also declined since the CBMIS was introduced in late-2011, as possibilities for abuse of
the system were considerably curtailed, thus contributing to the savings of about EUR290,000
on a monthly basis. Subsequently, current measures are directed towards reducing the
exclusion errors in the system and further improvements in the efficiency of social safety net
administration. Most recent improvements in the efficiency of the overall social safety net
administration, oversight and service delivery were directed toward improvements of the
institutional infrastructure by linking the CBMIS with the administrative registries in the
Employment Agency, Cadastre Agency and the Pension Fund. This exchange of information
between agencies and the MoLSP simplifies the registration procedures and reduces the
administrative costs for benefit claimants, and will furthermore reduce time and
administrative burdens for the administers at the SWCs.

78.     Policies were introduced to promote social inclusion through activation of
recipients of social financial assistance. An important shortcoming of traditional social
protection and labor market systems is that they inherently support non-activity of recipients
of social financial assistance. Recipients of social financial assistance have a financial
disincentive to seek even short-term employment, as this would effectively terminate their
access to social assistance, thus further deepening the exclusion of this group. However,
recent policies are changing this. The National Plan on Employment (2011) and the recently
amended 2012-2013 Operational Plan on Active Labor Market Policies (ALMPs) clearly
identifies recipients of social assistance and long-term unemployed as a vulnerable group and
targets ALMPs to this group to activate them and reduce the risk of social exclusion. This is
complemented by changes in the legal framework which stimulate the formal labor market
engagement of social assistance recipients (by allowing them to preserve access to social
assistance even when engaged in short-term labor activity of up to 10 days a month). This is
further being complemented with preparation to launch a new Conditional Cash Transfer

                                                26
(CCT) program with training/work activation component aimed at helping the beneficiaries of
social financial assistance to acquire skills needed at the labor market.

79.     In a difficult fiscal environment, the authorities have protected and increased
financing for well-performing transfers, such as the social financial assistance and the
accompanying energy poverty program. Despite an overall cut of expenditures of around
4.5 percent with the Supplement Budget, the allocation for social transfers was not cut. At the
same time, the authorities increased the amount of the energy poverty transfer (from MKD600
per month to MKD700 per month) to mitigate the impact of increased energy prices. The
authorities publicly committed to a 5 percent increase of Social Financial Assistance and
Permanent Assistance benefits starting in March 2013, using savings gained from
improvement of the targeting of the system.

80.      Going forward, a number of challenges to the social safety net, relating primarily
to benefit fragmentation and administration will shape the future reform agenda.
Despite high overall coverage and targeting accuracy, the relatively strict criteria for
eligibility for social financial assistance are disqualifying a considerable number of the
vulnerable from access to the system. The MoLSP is considering a revision of the Social
Assistance Rulebook with an aim to introduce more qualitative and informative criteria that
would allow for better targeting of the assistance. On the other hand, there remains an
excessive number of benefits that are inconsistent in their definitions and parameters, and
over-burden and weak capacity of the SWCs in benefits administration. Some of the
constraints within the present system are related to the existing legislation and to the design of
benefits. The MoLSP now has the appropriate database for the analysis of cash benefits.
Based on these analyses, certain policy options will be considered. The MoLSP should,
however, consider measures which would consolidate the number of social assistance
benefits, reduce the inconsistence in their definitions and parameters and strengthen oversight
and controls mechanisms to monitor implementation of social assistance benefits. The World
Bank will support future reforms through the CCT Project.

         IV.     BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM

LINK TO CAS

81.     The proposed PEPBG was included in the 2012 CPS Progress Report as a
response to the deteriorated external environment. The main objective of the Bank’s
partnership over the FY11-14 period is to support progress towards the EU membership with
the focus on: (i) promoting faster growth; (ii) ensuring more inclusive growth; and (iii)
promoting green growth. The 2012 CPS Progress Report noted that the objectives remain
relevant but also introduced some adjustments to the evolving partnership through the
remainder of the CPS period reflecting the increased risks from the deteriorated external
environment. This included greater allocation for budget support in response to a coherent and
credible package of policy reforms, also being supported by the proposed PEPBG.

82.      The proposed PEPBG contributes to the CPS goals of faster and more inclusive
growth by addressing the following objectives: (i) promote fiscal and macroeconomic
stability; (ii) increase employment among the vulnerable groups; and (iii) strengthen
efficiency of the social safety net through improved targeting of cash benefits.


                                                  27
83.      The Bank will continue to maintain an active policy dialogue in the areas
supported by the PEPBG even beyond the timeline of this operation. The lending
portfolio but also non-lending Technical Assistance (TA) and Economic Sector Work work
will allow the Bank to remain engaged in a number of areas. The ongoing CCT project will
facilitate the policy dialogue in the area of social protection as well as in pensions. The
parallel DPL series on competitiveness will allow the Bank to maintain the productive
dialogue on growth-supporting policies and employment opportunities of vulnerable groups.
The ongoing labor market technical assistance activity is assisting the authorities on measures
to enhance incentives for labor market participation and employment creation for vulnerable
groups. Poverty impacts of reforms will be monitored under the Western Balkans
Programmatic Poverty Program.

COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

84.    The Bank maintains close collaboration with the IMF team, seeking synergies
and harmonizing policy recommendations. Close coordination has resulted in largely
shared views of the economic situation in the country.

85.     The Bank maintains a robust dialogue with the IMF and other donors on issues
related to the proposed PEPBG. The area of public finance management has been at the
center of discussions between the IMF and authorities over the last nine months. Further, the
program supported on public finance management has benefited from the findings and
recommendations of the recent IMF TA mission. The Bank’s coordination and cooperation
with the European Union, the most important current and future development partner of FYR
Macedonia, is increasing and deepening. As part of the preparation of this operation, the Bank
has continuously briefed the donor community on the program and objectives of the proposed
operation.

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

86.    A number of other ongoing and past Bank operations will support the proposed
PEPBG operation. For example, the CCT project has also informed the policy dialogue on
social protection. In addition, there are strong linkages between the program and the
Programmatic Poverty Assessment being undertaken.

87.    The PEPBG is complemented by Bank development policy lending in private
sector development. The Competitiveness DPL is the first in a series of two programmatic
operations that will support reforms that incentivize productive investment and technology
upgrading in the manufacturing, agribusiness and trade logistics sectors; and put in place
enabling conditions that can progressively increase labor market flexibility and skills
development. The medium-long term objective is to create better job opportunities and
increase the economic growth potential.

88.    The PEPBG builds on the successful engagement under the first PBG. The first
PBG supported the Government program to strengthen fiscal and financial sector stability and
competitiveness of the economy, including by improving the functioning of the labor market.
This operation continues to support the robustness of health sector finances through support of
the implementation of measures included in the action plan to improve efficiency and service
provision in the public health sector. The technical assistance provided to the HIF on the

health sector program supported by the proposed PEPBG.

ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

89.     The Bank has an extensive portfolio of analytical work, including in areas
covered by the proposed PEPBG. The 2009 Poverty Assessment shed light on the reasons
for the relatively stagnant living conditions in the country, including the functioning of the
social safety net. Similarly, the 2010 Regional Social Safety Net report provided an in-depth
analysis of the functioning of the social assistance scheme. The 2008 Public Expenditure
Review analyzed spending patterns in a number of sectors, including education, health and
social protection. Some of the critical challenges still remain and are being addressed by the
proposed operation. The 2012 Competitiveness Assessment identified the constraints to
private sector development, including from existing public financial management
arrangements. In addition to the core analytical reports, the Bank has produced a number of
on-demand analyses on various issues raised by the Government, including a series of notes
on labor market performance and reforms. The table below presents an overview of the
analytical activities in recent years.

LESSONS LEARNED

90.     The World Bank has been actively using Development Policy Lending as the
principal tool to assist the FYR Macedonian authorities with the design and
implementation of important structural reforms since 2000. Over the past 15 years, the Bank
and the authorities have successfully implemented reforms supported by DPL-type of
operations in the financial and enterprise sectors, public administration as well as in the areas
of business environment and investment climate. The operations have introduced a number of
reforms which have had an important development impact on the country.

91.     An important lesson from previous DPL and PBG operations is that continued
engagement in policy dialogue and flexibility in the design are critical to the success of
reforms. Adoption of difficult reforms is not always feasible within the envisaged timeframe.
The experience in FYR Macedonia suggests that flexibility during project preparation
followed by continued policy dialogue after the approval and disbursement of a DPL or PBG
can be effective in supporting sensitive reforms in a difficult economic environment. In
addition, the previous PBG and the proposed PEPBG operation were successfully prepared in
a relatively short time period, due to strong commitment by the Government to its reform
program and close cooperation between the Bank and the main implementation agencies.

92.     A strong analytical basis, reinforced with investment project support and critical
technical assistance, is needed to design effective operations. Analytical work plays an
important role in defining the areas to be supported under development policy lending or a
PBG. This in turn ensured Government buy-in during the preparation stage and a strong
commitment during implementation. At the same time, investment projects and TA can help
build capacity to design and implement reforms.

V.     THE PROPOSED PUBLIC EXPENDITURE POLICY BASED GUARANTEE

OPERATION DESCRIPTION

93.     The objective of the proposed PEPBG is to improve the efficiency of public
expenditures by strengthening public financial management practices; to improve
efficiency of service provision in the health sector; and to strengthen social protection
and inclusion. The overarching goal is to ensure that fiscal policy, and public expenditure
policy in particular, supports an environment conducive to robust growth, more effective
social protection and improved service delivery.

94.      The operation will support critical reforms needed to strengthened robustness of
public financial management and help mitigate the impact of the Euro zone turmoil. The
proposed PEPBG will make a significant contribution towards ensuring that the 2013 budget
is fully financed. This is especially important given the unpredictable access to capital
markets likely to continue for some time. In addition, the measures supported by the PEPBG
are critical for the strengthened solvency of fiscal accounts, improved delivery of services and
resumption of growth over the medium term.

95.     A policy matrix containing all policy actions is attached as Annex 2. The expected
outcomes of the policies supported by the PEPBG are featured in the last column of the policy
matrix. Table 7 below lists the prior actions, while the remainder of this section outlines
policy areas supported by the proposed operation in greater detail.

                       Table 7: Proposed Prior Actions for the PEPBG
                PILLAR I: STRENGTHENING PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

(1) The Borrower has established an inventory of its (i) payment arrears and (ii) VAT refund
arrears, and has agreed to a timeline and plan to clear the stock starting in October 2012.

(2) The Borrower’s Ministry of Finance has taken the following measures to improve the
management of financial commitments:
•     Amendments to the Manual of Treasury Operations (Official Gazette No. 118/12,
September 24, 2012) to (i) set forth how multi-year liabilities will be recorded, reported and
validated, and (ii) prohibit the Treasury Department from approving payment requests if liabilities
are not properly registered; and
•     The Amendments to the Manual of Treasury Operations have been circulated to all budget
users with a confirmation that the statutory penalties provisioned in the Law of Budgets will be
applied for failure to meet the requirements of (i) reporting commitments and (ii) meeting
expenditures within the available budget without incurring arrears; and
•     Establishment of a Working Group within the Ministry of Finance (Decision number 04-
27553/1) to (i) prepare changes to the Treasury Information System to incorporate entry and
monitoring of multi-year liabilities; and (ii) adopt a plan on activities; and (iii) commence
implementation of such plan.

   PILLAR II: IMPROVING EFFICIENCY OF SPENDING AND SERVICE PROVISION IN THE
                                 HEALTH SECTOR

(3) The Borrower’s Ministry of Health has introduced and published revised reference prices for a
list of drugs for which prices were reduced as a result of improvements to the methodology for
setting prices for registered drugs (Official Gazette No. 156/11 from November 9, 2011) in order to
generate health expenditure savings.

(4) The Borrower’s Ministry of Health has concluded centralized international procurement for
optical lenses and disposables for 2012-2014 and has commenced centralized international
procurement for orthopedic devices in order to generate price savings and improved terms of
delivery

(5) The Borrower’s Ministry of Health has introduced criteria defining the standards for health
service provision, specifically for contracting providers, in order to expand provider coverage in
underserved areas, through adoption of the by-law establishing the Medical Network (Official
Gazette No. 81/12 from June 28, 2012).

             PILLAR III: STRENGTHEN SOCIAL PROTECTION AND INCLUSION

(6) The Borrower has adopted (on June 26, 2012) revisions to the 2012-2013 Operation Plan on
Active Labor Market Policies containing additional measures to encourage Social Safety Net
Beneficiaries to actively seek employment opportunities, to increase social inclusion.

(7) The Borrower’s Ministry of Labor and Social Policy has improved the efficiency of social safety
net administration and service access by (i) entering into a Memorandum of Understanding with
each of the Employment Service Agency (ESA) and the Pension and Disability Insurance Fund
(PDIF) in order to establish a system that links the Cash Benefits Management Information System
with the administrative registries of the ESA and the PDIF; and (ii) making such system
operational.

(8) The Borrower’s Council of Ministers has adopted (on October 16, 2012) the draft Law on
Amendments to the Law of Social Protection in order to use savings from improvement of the
targeting performance of the Social Safety Net System to increase the level of the means-tested
cash benefit.

POLICY AREAS

PILLAR I: IMPROVING PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

96.     The set of reforms proposed under this pillar focuses on policies that will
improve the credibility of the budget in delivering the objectives of fiscal policy and will
strengthen controls on timely payment of financial obligations. The set of policies
implemented by the authorities are expected to result in sustainable fiscal balances. The
projected deficit of 3.5 percent of GDP in 2013 is not expected to endanger fiscal
sustainability given the size and structure of public debt. At the same time, stronger public
financial management will strengthen the credibility of fiscal policy, improve accountability
in public service delivery and create an environment conducive for private sector growth.

97.     The PEPBG supports measures aimed at the reduction of arrears. This included
as the first step the establishment of an inventory of Government’s payment and VAT refund
arrears. Government also agreed to a timeline and plan to clear the arrears stock and started
clearing arrears systematically in October 2012. The Bank supports the Government’s
commitment to clear the current arrears stock by February 2013. Given the significant
external risks and fiscal pressures the country is expected to face in 2013, including some
uncertainty about the exact level of stock of arrears (paragraph 30), the proposed outcome
indicator for the related prior action is envisioning clearance of all arrears stock by end-
December 2013.

98.    PEPBG measures under this pillar support the goal of improving the
management of Government’s financial commitments to prevent new arrears. This
includes Amendments to the Manual of Treasury Operations on how multi-year liabilities will
be recorded, reported and validated, and the preparation of changes to the Treasury
Information System to incorporate entry and monitoring of multi-year liabilities. These
changes will ensure that all commitments are recorded shortly after they are incurred, and will
thus be visible to the Ministry of Finance, and facilitate better cash flow management.
Stronger incentives for recording commitments have been included in the manual. The revised
manual also requires that reports are independently verified by internal auditors to ensure that
they are complete, accurate and in full compliance with the regulations. Multi-year
commitments will be reported to the Treasury for the first time, which will improve budget
preparation and ensure that budget users adequately plan for expenditures beyond the budget
year. This reporting will be hard-wired into the central financial management system through
changes being designed and overseen by a specialist technical working committee established
by the Minister.

99.     Additionally, the Minister of Finance has reinforced Government’s seriousness in
addressing the correct recording and monitoring of commitments by issuing a new
circular to budget users reminding them of the statutory penalties applying to breaches of
requirements to report commitments. The combined effect of these changes will be to achieve
more comprehensive reporting and monitoring of commitments, providing for more effective
Treasury control, improved cash management and avoidance of the accumulation of new
arrears. This complements the first prior action such that new arrears will not be created to
offset elimination of the stock of arrears.



                                                 32
PILLAR II: IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY OF SPENDING AND SERVICE PROVISION
IN THE HEALTH SECTOR

100. The proposed PEPBG is supporting measures aimed at enhancing the efficiency
of spending in the health sector and improving service provision in under-served areas.
The objective is to generate savings that will be directed to other priorities in the health sector,
including improved service provision and quality of health services. The proposed prior
actions aimed at: (i) decreasing wholesale prices for drugs by improving the methodology for
reference pricing; (ii) decreasing prices for certain medical devices by introducing centralized
procurement; and (iii) improving service provision in under-served areas by introducing
standards of health staff coverage based on population density, which should limit new
service provision in well-served areas and shift them to under-served areas. Therefore, the
supported program supports increased efficiency of health spending on the one hand by
generating savings from the procurement of drugs and medical devices, and improved service
provision on the other hand by limiting new medical provider contracts to under-served areas.

101. The proposed PEPBG supports the revision of the methodology for setting the
prices of registered drugs by expanding the group of reference countries. The law
containing methodology changes to the reference price setting for registered drugs became
effective in January 2012 and the revised list was published in March 2012. This measure
reduced the wholesale and retail prices of 1,299 drugs with none of the suppliers exiting the
market in response. The measure is expected to generate significant savings for HIF.

102. The proposed PEPBG also supports the centralization of the procurement of
medical devices. MoH in 2012 has completed centralized international procurement for
optical lenses (and associated disposables). Savings totaling EUR2.0 million have been
realized as a result. Subsequently, MoH started the central procurement process for orthopedic
devices and plans to use the savings to increase the quantity purchased and to reduce waiting
times for operations. Both measures—the centralization of procurement for optical and
orthopedic devices—are expected to generate considerable savings for HIF.

103. The supported reform program establishes the Medical Network in the medium-
term which will increase the number of healthcare providers in poorly served districts.
MoH adopted a by-law (No.81 of June 28, 2012) establishing the Medical Network to
introduce standards for balancing the public health sector over time, by introducing ceilings
on number of contractors based on population metrics. The Medical Network places
maximum limits on the number of different medical practitioners and pharmacies in each
region that can be publicly funded. Practitioners in districts with surplus supply will not be
required to close but no new concessions will be permitted. The MoH has announced 360
concessions in under-provisioned districts for which tenders will be received in late 2012.
Over time, service provision will be more balanced and access to services will be more
equitable across the country. No new tenders for well-served areas will be issued in the future,
so that service provision expansion will be limited to under-served areas only.




                                                   33
PILLAR III: STRENGTHENING SOCIAL PROTECTION AND INCLUSION

104. Under this pillar the objective is to support Government’s efforts to better
protect vulnerable groups. The PEPBG-supported policies promote social inclusion and
improved targeting in the social protection system. They include administrative reforms to the
social net system, with the goal to increase efficiency of the system and to decrease leakages.

105. Increased social inclusion will be supported by the proposed PEPBG through the
adoption of additional activation measures for recipients of social assistance. Revisions to
the 2012-2013 Operational Plan on ALMPs were made in June 2012 to increase opportunities
for vulnerable recipients of social assistance and long-term unemployed. The measures
include a public works program (for around 2,000 beneficiaries), subsidies for firms that
employ vulnerable people and unemployed (for around 550 beneficiaries) 14, loans for self-
employment (for around 450 beneficiaries), and a firm-specific training program for
unemployed (for 1,000 beneficiaries) 15. These measures are designed to alleviate pressure in a
difficult economic climate and if they are successful, the program may be expanded.

106. The proposed PEPBG supports further improvement in the efficiency of social
safety net administration and service access by linking the CBMIS with the
administrative registries in the Employment Agency and the Pension Fund. The Ministry
of Labor and Social Policy signed in July 12, 2012 Memoranda of Understanding with the
Employment Service Agency (ESA) and Pension and Disability Insurance Fund (PDIF) to
connect the CBMIS with the registries of these two agencies. Improving the links between the
social safety net administration system and the registries in the ESA and the PDIF will help to
detect fraudulent claims and will significantly improve access to social services. Service
access will be improved by reducing transaction costs of social services applicants. Namely,
the number of forms beneficiaries are expected to complete for registration or renewal of
Social Financial Assistance will be reduced from five to one. All but one of the required
documents will now be provided via direct data exchange between these three agencies. The
system links were established in August 2012 and the system was since then tested and
became operational in October 2012.

107. The PEPBG reform program supports the planned increase of the Social
Financial Assistance and Permanent Assistant benefit. In October 2012, Government
adopted the decision to amend the Social Protection Law. According to the Amendments to
the Law, starting in March 2013, a five percent in means-tested cash benefits will occur. The
current average 16 benefit level of the Social Financial Assistance and Permanent assistance is

14
   Regarding the subsidies for firms employing vulnerable recipients of social assistance and long-term
unemployed, each company which employs up to 3 people will receive a loan in the amount of up to EUR9,000.
These three new employees will have to remain employed over a 3 year period during which the company will
repay the loan with 1 percent annual interest rate.
15
   Regarding the firm-specific training program for unemployed, out of the 1,000 placements, 250 are reserved
for young individuals up to 27 years of age, who have no previous work experience (i.e. for whom this is their
first employment). The purpose of this measure is to provide a specific set of skills to registered unemployed
persons for a pre-identified employer with certain job requirements. The training is then tailored specifically to
the needs of the unemployed and the employer. This training program (or preparation for employment) is
planned to cover a three months period, and the employer has the obligation to hire at least 50 percent of the
individuals in training and to not reduce the number of employees for a period of one year. The amount of
financial assistance for the unemployed person involved in the preparation is monthly MKD4,400.
16
    The benefit level depends on the number of household members.

                                                           34
about EUR52 and EUR80, respectively. The increase in the level of the means-tested cash
benefit is being financed by savings from improvements of the targeting performance of the
Social Safety Net System by reducing inclusion errors as part of the upgraded IT system and
more stringent controls. In total about 45,000 households will benefit from the planned
increase of both transfers.

GUARANTEE INSTRUMENT

108. The details of the terms and conditions of the IBRD Guarantee to FYR Macedonia are
still being defined in close consultation with the Government and the lender. The proposed
terms are substantially as set forth in Annex 6 and can be summarized as follows:

109. Borrower and Guarantee Amount: The Borrower is FYR Macedonia and the
operation is a Policy based Guarantee from the IBRD in the amount of EUR155 million, the
equivalent of US$201.5 million.

110. Structure of the instrument: The PEPBG will partially guarantee a commercial loan
made by Deutsche Bank. The guarantee will cover EUR155 million of the EUR250 million
principal of the loan. The unguaranteed portion of the loan will have a 5 year maturity bullet
repayment structure and the guaranteed portion of the loan will have a 7 year maturity bullet
repayment structure.

111. Interest rate: The interest rate structure will be a fixed rate, equivalent to the five
year euro swap rate plus 275bp. The lenders will also charge an arrangement fee of 150bp.

112. The procurement process will follow national legislation. The procedure for
selecting the loan is relatively simple and requires issuance of a Request for Proposals from
the Ministry of Finance to a number of market participants. According to national legislation,
once bids are received and there is a government decision on the winning bid, a parliamentary
approval is required for effectiveness of the guaranteed Loan Agreement. The Indemnity
Agreement between the Bank and FYR Macedonia will also require parliamentary approval.
The Bank will work closely with the authorities to minimize risks during the process.
Furthermore, the guaranteed Loan Agreement to be signed will have provisions that cover
Sanctionable Practices at all stages of the proposed operation. Under these provisions, IBRD
is allowed to withhold payment if evidence arises at any time between the date of the
guaranteed loan agreement and the final maturity date of the guaranteed loan that the lender
has engaged in a Sanctionable Practice in connection with the guaranteed loan agreement.

113. Disbursement: Upon approval of the guarantee and notification by the Bank of the
effectiveness of the Guaranteed Loan Agreement (to be entered into among the private
lenders, the Bank and FYR Macedonia) and the Indemnity Agreement (to be entered into
between the Bank and FYR Macedonia), the Borrower may request withdrawal of the loan
proceeds from the private lenders within a defined drawdown period. The front-end fees and
the annualized guarantee fee will be paid from the Loan proceeds.

114. Guarantee Fees: Consistent with the current Bank policy, there is a front-end fee of
25 basis points on the face value of the guarantee exposure (EUR155 million) and a guarantee
fee of 50 basis points per annum (equivalent to the contractual spread for loans) on the present
value of Bank’s exposure from the transaction. The guarantee fee will also be collected
upfront, on a present value basis, to strengthen the transaction terms for all parties.
                                                 35
115. Callability of the Guarantee: As the borrower, the FYR Macedonia has the
obligation to ensure timely repayment to the lenders. Details of the callability of the
Guarantee will be defined at a later stage once the instrument is more precisely defined.
Following payment by the Bank under its guarantee, the Bank would have sole discretion to
decide whether to demand immediate repayment from FYR Macedonia or to extend terms for
repayment over time, and in the latter case, would have sole discretion as to the terms to be
extended.

116. The administration and accounting of the loan from the private lender will be the
responsibility of the Ministry of Finance (MoF). The MoF will provide the Bank within 30
days of receipt of funds from the private lender with a confirmation letter stating that the
funds have been received and deposited into the deposit account designated by the borrower.
Considering the Bank’s knowledge of the public finance management systems, the ongoing
improvements of these systems and the assessment of the NBRM made by the IMF, no audit
of the deposit account will be necessary.

                      VI.     OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT

117. FYR Macedonia is facing a relatively high national poverty rate. Poverty levels
have increased during the recent years as growth has been adversely impacted by the external
crisis and labor markets have remained stagnant. But poverty levels also declined only very
little during the period of higher growth prior to 2009 (and this despite a more substantial
reduction in the unemployment rate). Since then more frequent global price shocks have
further eroded the purchasing power of households. Also, inequality (based upon the
Household Budget Survey) is relatively high and has been increasing in recent years, which
has contributed to the lack of progress in poverty reduction.

118. Overall, the actions proposed to be supported by the PEPBG are likely to have
positive poverty and social impacts. The PEPBG supported-program should help strengthen
confidence in the economy, improve service delivery and better protect the vulnerable.

119. PFM measures are expected to have a somewhat positive poverty and social
impact. The overall fiscal framework supported by the PEPBG should partially mitigate the
impact of the Euro zone turmoil by maintaining stability while protecting allocations for
social protection as well as increasing capital spending. Vulnerability of certain groups
excluded from the system could increase; however, efforts to counteract this are supported
under Pillar III. In addition, strengthened credibility of fiscal policy, though improved public
finance management is expected to stabilize business confidence and limit the impact of the
turmoil over economic activity and jobs. Recent reports have noted that the deteriorated
liquidity in the real sector, including due to delays in payments by the public sector, is a
significant constraint to private sector activity. More robust PFM practices will result in better
predictability for the private sector and more cost-efficient procurement processes for the
public sector.

120. The PEPBG-supported measures aimed at increasing the efficiency of health
spending should improve access to services for the vulnerable groups. The
implementation of the Medical Network should ensure more equitable and easier access to

                                                  36
health services for the population throughout all regions of FYR Macedonia. At the same
time, the grandfathering clause (existing providers are automatically included) should ensure
that there are no sharp adjustments in the coverage with services over the short term. The
reforms in centralizing procurement will improve the quality and access to services, but it
would be critical that these are effectively enforced and used in the reimbursement for
services provided by the HIF. The Bank will remain engaged in the policy dialogue in the
health sector, including through the PSIA Trust Fund, which will help the authorities better
design future reforms in the sector, including potentially on the co-payment schedule.

121. The Government’s reform program in the area of social protection will help
better target resources towards the vulnerable. Preserving the allocations for social
transfers in the current difficult economic environment should ensure that the vulnerable are
not disproportionately affected by the turmoil given that the current slowdown could increase
the demand for social assistance transfers. At the same time, in addition to helping the
vulnerable cope with the payment of their energy bills, the increase in the energy poverty
transfer should help the energy sector in its adjustment to market prices. Though FYR
Macedonia has a decently performing social assistance program, the system suffers from both
imperfect targeting (55 percent of benefits go to persons who were not in the poorest quintile)
as well as inadequate coverage (only about 32 percent of those in the poorest quintile live in
households which receive social benefit (based on 2006 data)). While the recent introduction
of the CBMIS –a unique database of recipients of social assistance benefits- is estimated to
have improved targeting considerably, the PEPBG-supported linkages with other agencies
will ensure that criteria for social assistance recipients are better adhered to and service access
for legitimate applicant is easier. In order to track improvements in the targeting effectiveness
of the social protection programs, the Household Budget Survey needs to be strengthened to
better capture changes in absolute poverty in both rural and urban areas and key
characteristics such as employment status. In addition, the recently introduced SILC is
expected to improve the availability of information on the performance of the system.

122. Stronger incentives for activation of social assistance recipients should have a
positive impact over social inclusion. The National Strategy on Poverty Reduction and
Social Inclusion 2010-2020 identifies unemployment as a main contributor to social exclusion
and proposes measures to promote employment of vulnerable groups, including social
assistance recipients. Welfare-to-work initiatives have recently gained momentum in number
of countries reflecting increasing evidence of their significant impact on employment
prospects of social assistance recipients. FYR Macedonia has limited experience with such
schemes which puts constraints on the ability to assess the impact of the proposed measures
supported under the PEPBG. Still, given the large number of recipients of social assistance
(around 8 percent of the population), the impact could be significant. At the same time, the
limited capacity of institutions may delay the achievement of expected outcomes.

123. The program is not expected to have a significant gender dimension but may
have some minor benefits for female employment. FYR Macedonia has narrowed the
gender gaps over time in many areas. Notably, gender inequalities in education and health are
relatively small compared to regional averages. Despite this, sharp gender disparities arise in
access to economic opportunities, with women having poorer labor market outcomes than
men. This program may have some minor benefits for females in the labor market in several
ways. First, the program supports reforms that will help to strengthen public financial
management at a time of economic turmoil. The reforms will contribute towards measures

                                                  37
that will support economic growth and employment, such as paying arrears. This is
particularly important for females, who remain disadvantaged in the labor market, with
significantly lower labor force participation rates and wages (even after controlling for other
factors) than males. The activity rate is around 51 percent for females compared with 78
percent for males. Second, focusing ALMPs on recipients of social assistance will reduce the
risk of exclusion errors and benefit women who are more likely to struggle in the labor
market, as noted above. Finally, improvements in health coverage in areas that are currently
underserved are expected to benefit both males and females. The Bank has recently
undertaken a Gender Diagnostic in Macedonia, which provides more detailed information on
gender issues, and will serve as a basis for future gender-related interventions.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

124. The specific policies supported by the PEPBG are not likely to have effects on the
country’s environment and natural resources. The measures contemplated under the loan
are primarily geared towards supporting Government reforms in public financial management,
health and social protection. None of the reform measures included are expected to have any
direct significant links to the environment.

125. FYR Macedonia is continuing to align its legal framework for environmental
management along the lines of the EU acquis. The legal framework (including the laws on
Environment, Nature, Air Quality and Waste Management) is generally in compliance with
EU requirements. Further regulation, including the drafting of secondary legislation is
continuing, in a number of cases, guided and supervised with EU technical assistance. The
2011 EC Progress Report noted further improvements in the transposition of legislation;
including on nature protection, air and water quality. The report also noted constraints arising
from insufficient capacity to implement the policies as well as inadequate implementation of
the provisions for public consultation; however, these are being tackled gradually. FYR
Macedonia has also signed the South Eastern European Energy Community Treaty which
subjects it to key pieces of the acquis, notably the Large Combustion Plants Directive. This
directive places restrictions on local pollution emissions (sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and
particulate matter). The country also ratified the Kyoto Protocol.

IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

126. The Ministry of Finance will be responsible for overall implementation of the
proposed program and coordination with other concerned ministries and agencies. The
Bank will remain engaged in policy-dialogue in the areas covered by the proposed PEPBG.

127. Monitoring and evaluation of the program will be undertaken jointly by the
Ministry of Finance and the Bank team. During supervision assignments the respective
teams will jointly review progress in the implementation of the proposed reform program and
its outcomes. Progress will be measured using the baseline and expected program outcomes
outlined in the Policy Matrix (Annex 2). The Implementation Completion and Results Report
(ICR) will be due no later than 18 months after the effectiveness of and disbursement of the
loan under, the commercial loan agreement. The Government will remit to the Bank the
Borrower’s ICR before that date.

FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

128. Two aspects of FYR Macedonia’s fiduciary arrangements are relevant to the
operation: the implications for the Bank assets of the guarantee and the consequences of
activating the guarantee; and the PFM arrangements underpinning the government’s capacity
to manage resources to meet its obligations to the Bank under the facility.

129. The guarantee would involve no immediate transfer of funds from the Bank, but
sufficient funds would need to be provisioned from the Bank assets to meet a call on the
guarantee if required. When called under conditions provided for under the Agreement, the
payment from the Bank will be made as a single payment to the lender or agent of the lender.
The indemnity agreement between FYR Macedonia and the World Bank provides that the
former will repay the latter on demand or as the Bank otherwise directs, if the guarantee is
called.

130. The overall fiduciary risk for the PFM system in FYR Macedonia as regards the
proposed operation is assessed as moderate. There has been significant improvement in the
procurement arrangements, an area in which the risk rating was assessed as significant in
earlier assessments (2007 Country Fiduciary Assessment and the 2004 Country Financial
Accountability Assessment). The financial management assessment for the aspects considered
in these assessments was considered moderate. The financial management risks continue to be
moderate. The 2009 review of the National Public Procurement System noted improvements
in the procurement system which has advanced further since, while further progress has been
reported in the area of external audit and internal audit and control. However, the emergence
of public sector arrears recently suggests still evolving mechanisms for control and recording
of commitments. The reforms supported by the proposed PEPBG to improve the accuracy and
completeness of information on commitments, the management of commitments and
reduction of arrears, should address the risk posed by overdue financial obligations.

131. FYR Macedonia continues to have strong public financial management
arrangements compared with other countries in the region; however, the international
financial crisis, and internal economic challenges, have exposed risks and stresses in the PFM
system and have made the need for remedial action more pressing, including through
measures supported by the proposed PEPBG. The Budget Law provides for an orderly budget
process, including provision for medium term fiscal and budgetary projections. However,
budget revenue estimates for the last three years have been overly optimistic and medium
term expenditure planning has not been fully implemented resulting in incomplete and unclear
baselines for budgets in subsequent years. On the Budget execution side, effective
implementation of the Manual on Treasury operation should ensure that adequate information
is available to the MoF on expenditure plans and commitments. The measures supported by
the proposed PEPBG will strengthen internal transparency and control of commitments.

132. There has been substantial progress in strengthening the Supreme Audit Office
(SAO). The SAO is independent from the executive branch and its mandate covers all public
sector activities. The Government increased resources for the SAO and amended legislation
to: require an annual audit opinion on the government’s annual financial statements; require
the auditor to summarize the audit findings for the year into common themes on high-risk
areas for the government to address; adopt a risk-based audit approach to the annual audit
planning process; report on the Government’s progress in implementing current and all

                                                39
outstanding audit recommendations; perform performance-based audits; and implement
international auditing standards covering all aspects of its work.

133. The fight against corruption is an important feature of the Government’s work
program. The country has put in place an extensive framework to fight corruption, including
a State Commission on Prevention of Corruption, a specialized unit within the Ministry of
Interior as well as a specialized Public Prosecutor for fight against corruption and organized
crime. The legal framework generally transposes good international practices in this area. The
ongoing improvements in the areas of public procurement, internal audit, and strengthening of
the role of the SAO contribute to the fight against corruption. Still, the track record on the
implementation of policies needs to be improved while agencies responsible for preventing
corruption remain understaffed and underfinanced. The 2008 Business Environment and
Enterprise Survey showed a marked improvement compared to the 2005 round of the survey
in the percentage of firms indicating corruption as a problem of doing business.

134. The latest IMF update of the safeguards assessment was completed in May 2011.
The assessment found that a good governance framework is in place and the NBRM had taken
steps to strengthen its safeguards framework and implemented recommendations from the
2005 assessment. Reinforcement of governance practices and implementing an internal risk
management framework was recommended by the IMF and the NBRM has already started
implementing the main recommendations. The actions taken by the NBRM to safeguard funds
are deemed adequate.

RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

135. The proposed PEPBG has significant risks, mostly related to the evolving
external environment. The country has been able to weather the crisis well so far without
major imbalances that would threaten macroeconomic stability. However, the prolonged Euro
zone uncertainty is undermining growth prospects. In particular, this program faces the
following risks: (i) external risks, (ii) political risks, and (iii) implementation risks:

(i) The uncertainty about the global, especially Euro zone economic outlook, continues to
pose significant external risks. Shocks relating to the external environment continue to affect
the FYR Macedonian economy. Deepened recession in the Euro zone could undermine
confidence, reduce demand for exports, and weaken capital inflows. This could put renewed
pressure on reserves, output, and social conditions. A further intensification of the Greek
crisis but without large scale contagion in the Euro zone would further amplify these trends
This risk should be manageable in FYR Macedonia with an adequate policy response,
including to preserve confidence in the banking sector and to avoid disruptions in economic
activity. Under a scenario of a wider contagion affecting also Germany, economic growth is
likely to turn significantly negative with a sizeable impact on unemployment. While a
stronger focus on stabilization in the design of macroeconomic policies may preserve
stability, the adverse impact over living conditions would likely be significant. This risk is
partly mitigated by the relatively sound macroeconomic stance and existing buffers (low
fiscal and external imbalances, moderate public debt and sound reserves). The banking sector
is also exposed to external risks, but these are substantially mitigated by strict regulations
from Central Bank, which include regulations on lending between subsidiaries and parent
banks and a strengthened deposit insurance framework. Central Bank is also performing
stress-tests semi-annually.

                                                40
(ii) Political risks are mainly related to the stalling of progress in the EU and NATO
integration as a result of the failure to resolve the country’s name issue with Greece. This
could trigger reform fatigue and remove a big reform anchor. At the same time, Government
has a stable majority support and the EU recommended in October 2012 the immediate start
of accession negotiations for EU-membership. This is expected to preserve the political and
popular support for reforms toward the Euro-Atlantic integration. Another risk is an early call
of parliamentary elections before its regular schedule in 2014. This could lead to politically
motivated expenditure increases and add to existing fiscal pressures with the risk of re-
emerging arrears.

(iii) Implementation risks including capacity and political economy risks. The implementation
capacity of some public sector institutions, while much improved over the past few years,
remains stretched. For example, the reforms in the public financial management area would
require a considerable change in the existing business practices of some budget users,
including on contract management, reporting etc. In addition, the program supports
introduction of new practices in the health system. Still, institutional change comes slowly
and could delay the accomplishment of expected outcomes. The improvements in the PFM
processes supported under this PEPBG are designed specifically to contribute to strengthening
capacity for efficient financial management. There are also considerable implementation risks
associated with supported health sector reforms. One example is the implementation of the
medical network. The reform envisions a cap on contracting of new providers in relatively
well-served urban centers. Political economy considerations and pressure from medical
provider associations might undermine a strict implementation of such caps. Similarly, price
changes on procurement of drugs might be undermined by political considerations and
lobbying efforts of pharmaceutical companies; and centralized procurement of medical
devices might be resisted to some extend by HCIs.

   Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia—Assessment Letter for the World Bank
                                     November 14, 2012
This note provides the IMF staff assessment of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia’s
     macroeconomic outlook and policies. It is based on information gathered during the
 December 2011 IMF Article IV surveillance mission and subsequent September 2012 staff
                                            visit.

Overview
1. The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is a middle income country with a good
record of macroeconomic stability. The peg to the euro has anchored monetary policy and
helped achieve a long record of low inflation, while low fiscal deficits have kept public debt
ratios moderate. The absence of significant imbalances in the Macedonian economy and a
banking system with limited reliance on external financing has helped contain the impact on
Macedonia of continued financial stress in the euro area, although confidence spillovers from
the euro area pose potential risks. While growth convergence has proceeded at a modest pace
so far, Macedonia faces good medium-term growth prospects. Efforts to improve the business
environment, infrastructure, and education continue, and have recently succeeded in attracting
substantial FDI, mostly in the tradable sector. Unemployment, however, remains high.

Macroeconomic and Financial Outlook
2. Growth has slowed markedly, as weaker-than-expected domestic demand combines with
slowing demand from abroad. Recent high frequency indicators suggest downside risks to
staff’s baseline forecast of 0.5 percent growth for 2012. Inflation rose to 5.3 percent yoy in
September and October, on the back of energy and food price increases, but core inflation is
substantially lower, at 2 percent yoy. As the effects of commodity price hikes fade, inflation is
projected to decline, to 2.3 percent on average in 2013.

3. Overoptimistic revenue projections in the 2012 budget led the authorities to draft a
supplementary budget in April, maintaining the fiscal deficit target at 2.5 percent of GDP.
However, fiscal revenue is turning out to be weaker than expected, and despite an
underexecution in spending, the central government cash deficit had already reached 2.5
percent of annual 2012 GDP at end-September; the authorities have since raised their 2012
deficit target to 3.5 percent of GDP. Public debt is projected to increase to 31 percent of GDP
at end-2012 (71 percent of which comprises external borrowing).

4. In 2013, economic growth is projected to recover to about 2 percent. Substantial inflows of
greenfield FDI are already generating new production capacity, and several large public
investment projects are planned to start in 2013. Nonetheless, a difficult euro area
environment weighs on the near-term outlook as it constrains external demand. 5. The current
account deficit is forecast to remain modest at just under 3 percent of GDP in 2012, widening
in the near term as FDI-related imports rise, and leveling off at around 4 percent in the
medium term. Export growth is expected to be robust, underpinned by FDI in the tradable
sector and improvements in the business climate. Foreign exchange reserves stand at €2.1
billion (end-October), adequate on standard metrics. Total external debt is projected to rise to
67 percent of GDP at end-2012, before moderating to around 65 percent of GDP in 2014-15.
6. The banking sector has remained stable during the crisis. Capital adequacy ratios are over
17 percent (with Tier 1 capital at almost 15 percent) and, while the sector is largely foreign-
                                                 51
owned, reliance on short-term external funding is minimal. As economic activity contracted,
non-performing loans (NPLs) rose, and remain at elevated levels around 10 percent. Still,
total provisions exceed NPLs, and banks remain liquid and well-capitalized, albeit with low
profitability. Credit to the private sector has been growing at about 7½ percent yoy over the
past 12 months. Deposit growth has also been stable throughout the year.

Fiscal Policy
7. Optimistic revenue assumptions and weaknesses in the commitment recording and control
framework—particularly as it pertains to multi-year projects—have led to ad-hoc cuts in
expenditure and to the emergence of public sector payment and VAT refund arrears. The
government has publicly committed to clear these arrears starting in the last quarter of 2012.
Additional transparency about the amount and details of the clearance strategy, as well as
measures to prevent re-occurrence, will be important to bolster the credibility of the
authorities’ fiscal framework.

8. The authorities announced an upward revision of their cash deficit targets for 2012 and
2013 to 3½ percent of GDP, to create space for arrears clearance and to maintain support to
domestic demand in the context of a weakening growth environment. A temporary widening
of the deficit along these lines would be manageable as it adds only about 2 percentage points
of GDP to staff’s previously projected path of public debt, with central government debt
remaining moderate at about 32½ percent of GDP by end-2013. However, to stabilize public
debt, fiscal deficits would need to be brought to below 1.5 percent of GDP over the medium
term. Deficits at these levels would also provide appropriate buffers, minimizing the need for
spending cuts during future downturns.

9. Strengthening of fiscal institutions is needed to improve medium-term expenditure
prioritization and budget execution practices. In particular, the authorities should focus on
improving public financial management, particularly revenue forecasting, commitment
control, and medium-term budgeting, as well as the observance and enforcement of proper
budget laws and procedures. This should help reduce the risk of arrears and allow a more
considered evaluation of medium-term spending priorities within the available budget
envelope. Improving public debt management and deepening domestic debt markets to reduce
reliance on external financing should remain key policy objectives.

Monetary Policy and Financial Stability
10. The National Bank left interest rates unchanged from December 2010 until April 2012,
while modestly relaxing prudential requirements that had been tightened as a crisis response
in 2008–09. In April 2012, it introduced a set of measures aimed at easing credit conditions
and furthering money market development, including a gradual reduction in the amount of
outstanding 28-day central bank bills, the introduction of a 7-day and overnight deposit
facility and a weekly repo auction. In early May 2012, it lowered the maximum rate on central
bank bills by 25 bps to 3.75 percent. These gradual easing measures were taken against a
background of favorable balance of payments conditions, slowing growth, subdued core
inflation, and modest credit growth. In accordance with staff advice, the overriding policy
objective remains the stability of the de-facto exchange rate peg.

11. To preserve financing stability, continued vigilance as well as further progress on
addressing regulatory gaps and strengthening crisis response capacity is needed. The recently
established Financial Stability Committee and the procedures put in place by the NBRM to
                                                 52
monitor deposits on a daily basis, in line with improved stress testing procedures, are
welcome developments in that respect.

Risks
12. An intensification of the euro area crisis remains the main risk and could lead to pressures
on the current account and external finances. The domestically-financed banking system,
moderate public debt, contained current account deficit and adequate foreign reserves are
important buffers against risks. Nonetheless, linkages with the euro area – both direct trade
links and indirect confidence effects– create the potential for negative spillovers. An adverse
scenario in Greece could damage confidence in Greek bank subsidiaries in Macedonia and
may prompt deposit outflow. In case of extreme financial turbulence, the exchange rate peg
could come under pressure. The authorities are mindful of such risks, and have stepped up
their monitoring and contingency planning efforts.

Relations with the IMF
13. A two-year arrangement under the Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL) was approved
on January 19, 2011. The authorities purchased an amount of SDR 197 million (about €221
million; 286 percent of quota) in March 2011. The second review under the arrangement was
not completed and the arrangement will expire in January 2013. The authorities have not
indicated that they will seek a successor arrangement, and management is expected to
recommend initiation of Post-Program Monitoring with the Former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia upon expiration of the PLL.

Despite a slightly widening CAD in the short term, external debt remains sustainable under the
baseline scenario, falling to 57 percent of GDP over the projection period. However, external debt
sustainability would be tested under a growth or current account shock. 17 A shock to growth
would increase external debt to around 66 percent of GDP by the end of the projection period
while a widening current account shock would increase external debt to 67 percent by 2017.
External debt sustainability would also be under threat from an exchange rate shock with a single
30 percent depreciation increasing external debt by over 15 percent of GDP over the medium
term.

Despite the sustainable baseline scenario, policy makers need to be cautious given the
unpredictable and still high-risk external environment. The external environment remains
particularly vulnerable to confidence shocks in a scenario of expanding Euro zone crisis, while
financing conditions may deteriorate rapidly in the current environment. A crisis cannot be ruled
out in case of a wider contagion from the Euro zone. Heightened concerns over fiscal imbalances
in the Euro zone could affect the health of banks in other economies, trigger a credit crunch and a
rapid contraction in domestic demand leading to a prolonged and severe recession.

  Growth shock is a reduction in growth of half of one standard deviation of the previous 10 years’ growth
compared with the baseline scenario over the projection period. The CAD shock is a one half standard deviation
increase in the CAD over the projection period.


                                                                            54
                          Annex 5: Eligibility for Policy Based Guarantee

Criterion A: The country should have a strong track record of performance, and its
structural, social and macroeconomic policy package should be satisfactory.

FYR Macedonia has established and maintained a strong track record on macroeconomic
stability. After it had restored macroeconomic stability in the mid-1990s, it has maintained it
since despite difficult circumstances, including over the past few years. Consecutive
governments have remained committed to fiscal prudence, supporting the exchange rate peg.
An independent central bank implements monetary policy with a clear price stability objective
and from recently a financial sector stability objective. Capacity in key agencies to analyze,
plan and implement policies has been continuously evolving.

Structural reforms in factor markets (labor, land and capital)
Structural reforms have advanced in a number of areas over the last decade, boosting
incomes, and infrastructure improved. While growth underperformed compared to other
countries in the region in the first half of the last decade, economic activity did pick up prior
to the global crisis in response to improvements in the investment climate. In addition, some
of these reforms helped mitigate the impact of the crisis and have contributed to the recent
acceleration of economic activity. FYR Macedonia is now one of the best-performing
developing countries in terms of ease of doing business: the country has been repeatedly cited
as one of the top five reformers in the world and was ranked as 23nd on the Ease of Doing
Business 2013, up from 34 in 2011 and a dramatic improvement up from 92nd position in
2006. GDP per capita (PPP, current international US$) has risen from about US$5,943in 2000
to around US$11,665 in 2011. Infrastructure improved: roads have been rehabilitated and the
average border crossing time has decreased.

The labor market reforms advanced and property and creditor rights strengthened over the last
decade. A Labor Code (introduced in 2005 and amended in 2008) introduced greater
flexibility in employment relations. Reforms in recent years streamlined procedures and
reduced the tax wedge. According to the 2009 Enterprise Survey (the latest available) labor
regulations were a constraint for doing business for 8.9 percent of firms 18. The reforms had
positive effects; participation increased by 5.4 percentage points between 2004 and 2011
unemployment declined although it remains high. Recently de-linking health benefits from
unemployment registration has helped to reduce registered unemployment. Reforms in the
real estate cadastre have increased the coverage to 99 percent of the territory; nearly tripled
the number of mortgages; doubled the number of registered transactions; and shortened the
period for transaction registration. In addition, the court system is better organized and new
laws reduced the backlog of cases.

The financial sector legal framework now provides sufficient power to the central bank to
regulate and supervise the banking sector which has resulted in sound practices and kept
banks well capitalized and liquid. Risk-based supervision has been introduced, and efforts
have increased in recent years to deal with weaknesses in the insurance sector by establishing
an independent supervisor in 2010. Most recently, stronger oversight and fit and proper
criteria are being introduced in the leasing sector and for non-bank credit institutions.

18
  Also, according to the 2012 World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report, the country scores 4.13
on the labor flexibility indicator, slightly lower the 4.35 average for the new EU member states.

                                                     55
Building human resources
FYR Macedonia is building a well-targeted social safety net. The existing system performs
reasonably well by regional standards, but exclusion and leakage exist. The government
launched a broad reform agenda to improve the effectiveness of the system. Administrative
improvements are being introduced and the integrated cash benefits information systems is
being developed to allow better monitoring and use of funds. At the same time, means-tested
programs, such as the CCT program for secondary education and the energy poverty program
are being introduced.

The country has come a long way in reforming the pension system to meet the challenges of
an aging population, but risks remain. Parametric reforms to the defined benefit system were
introduced over the last decade, including an increase in the retirement age and contribution
rates and a reduced replacement rate. A mandatory defined contribution component was
added in 2006 and a voluntary one in 2009. These are important measures, but the fiscal
strains of the global crisis and the slow recovery are placing these achievements at risk and
would require a prudent approach to pension policies, especially with respect to ad-hoc
pension increases. The replacement rate (around 50 percent in 2011) has been declining since
2007 and a recent revamping of the information systems will reduce fraudulent claims, both
helping to ensure a sustainable pension system.

Particular attention has been directed to improving education outcomes. Poor performance on
international assessments in 2000 and 2001 triggered wide reforms in the education system.
Recent reforms have aimed to modernize the curricula and improve access to education
services at all levels. Public funding of education was also increased in recent years. Between
2004 and 2008, secondary enrollment increased from 85 to 95 percent, and dropout rates for
primary school decreased to below 2 percent. A stronger focus is currently being given to
improving quality of education.

Progress is also underway toward ensuring the sustainability of the health system. Reforms
over the last decade aimed to streamline the operations, decision-making and transparency in
the health sector and facilitate a move towards more efficient (output-based) payment systems
for health care providers. As a result, combined public and private health spending fell from
around 9 percent of GDP in 2004 to 6.5 percent in 2011.

Public sector reforms
Tax policy and tax administration reforms have reduced costs of compliance and expanded
the tax base. The tax system has been reformed resulting in relatively few taxes and low tax
rates. Consumption is taxed by a functioning VAT system (introduced in 2000) with few
rates. Income is taxed at low and flat rates of 10 percent, while social insurance contributions
are below regional levels. Tax administration reforms accelerated since 2006, including
establishment of large taxpayer office responsible for collecting taxes and providing advisory
services to the largest taxpayers in the country, introduction of e-filing of tax records and
integrated collection of personal income tax and social insurance contributions.

Risks from contingent liabilities appear limited. The country has largely liquidated the
legacies of the past, including compensating the depositors for foreign exchange deposits lost
during the break-up of SFR Yugoslavia and largely settling the restitution process for land
nationalized after World War II. Reforms to the pension system have largely addressed the
aging problem and state involvement remains limited to few sectors. While commercial
                                                 56
orientation of public enterprises is limited; emergence of contingent liabilities that could
threaten stability is unlikely.

Despite considerable public sector reforms over the last decade, a number of challenges
remain. FYR Macedonia developed an integrated strategic planning and budgeting process
governed by a common calendar. This includes among other things multiyear fiscal plan
(though the budget is still a single year document) as well as the adoption of government
priorities and expenditure ceilings per function. Extra-budgetary funds and agency accounts
have been integrated (most recently also the public health institutions) under the Treasury
Single Account and reporting has improved. But financial controls have deteriorated in the
past few years and thus further reforms are needed. The capacity of the independent external
auditor has come a long way since it was established over a decade ago. In 2008, a new Law
on Public Procurement, fully harmonized with the EU acquis was adopted and activities are
underway to ensure its effective implementation. However, considerable efforts are still
needed: a number of agencies need to be reformed, and there are frequent allegations of
politicization of institutions. Legislation and institutions covering the governance framework
is extensive and in line with good international practice, but enforcement needs to improve.

Criterion B: The country should have a sustainable external financing plan.

The country’s external debt is moderate. Gross external debt (public and private) at the end of
Q1 2012 was around 63 percent of GDP. Government external debt accounts for around 18.6
percent of GDP and, with the exception of two Eurobond issues (around 4.5 percent of GDP),
is largely on concessional terms. Non-government external debt accounts for around 44.5
percent of GDP, out of which 11.8 percent is in the form of FDI-related transactions, 7.3
percent in bank sector debt and the remainder in non-bank corporate sector debt.

External financing requirements also remain moderate. The external current account deficit is
projected to widen somewhat, but also to be financed by a recovery in FDI and other private
capital inflows. Debt amortization is not excessive, reflecting relatively small external
borrowing by commercial banks and little direct cross-border lending to the non-bank sector.
However, amortization will increase going forward reflecting the shift towards market based
financing which typically has shorter maturities compared to concessional financing. More
specifically, the repayment of Eurobonds in January 2013 and 2015 will increase financing
needs, but these are expected to be rolled over at maturity. As noted earlier, under a downside
scenario the financing needs are expected to be lower as the current account deficit adjust to
the slower demand; however, securing financing will be more challenging.

The moderate fiscal deficits would keep financing requirements manageable. Furthermore,
securing external financing for a significant part of the deficit will safeguard investor
confidence, attract foreign capital to support the exchange rate peg and avoid crowding-out of
credit for the private sector. A sizeable portfolio of projects with bilateral and multilateral
creditors (IBRD, EBRD, EIB, Council of Europe Development Bank, KfW) will also bring
foreign financing as will increasing absorption of EU pre-accession funds.

Government does not have a program with the IMF, following the expiration of the
Precautionary Credit Line (PCL), but a program could be envisaged under a much worse
external scenario. In January 2011, the IMF Board approved a two-year PCL arrangement for
FYR Macedonia, the first country to receive this facility. The authorities drew part of the
                                                57
available funds in March 2011, as early elections and the Euro zone turmoil undermined their
ability to borrow.

Prudential regulations introduced by Central Bank should ensure that banks do not build
sizable liabilities based on short-term or volatile inflows. Central Bank introduced regulations
on managing liquidity risk which requires banks to match liabilities with assets by both
currency and maturity. According to the NBRM, banks are largely in compliance with these
regulations.

Criterion C: The country should have a coherent borrowing strategy, which will enable
it to become a borrower in its own name without a guarantee in the medium term.

The legal and institutional framework for debt management is sound. Financing requirements
are managed within the framework of a three-year public debt strategy (as of 2011 the public
debt strategy has been fully integrated with the fiscal strategy and closely linked to macro
policies). 19 The guiding principles of the strategy are to support macroeconomic policies,
ensure regular servicing of liabilities and limiting/eliminating risks to the sustainability of
public finances. The law on public debt prescribes a relatively detailed and transparent
process for incurring debt for the entire public sector (including guarantee issuance). The
public debt department in the Ministry of Finance has most features of a good practice debt
management framework, with operations segmented along the lines of front, middle and back
office. Summary reports on general government debt are published on monthly basis.

Despite gradual shift towards commercial terms in recent years, a sizable part of the country’s
government debt remains concessional. The average maturity of general government debt is
above five years and more than half of it is denominated in Euro. External debt accounts for
more than 70 percent of government debt. Around 60 percent of the debt is with variable
interest rates. With the exception of the two Eurobond issues (2005 and 2009), it is mostly on
concessional terms or with very low interest rates (i.e. structural bonds issued as part of the
restitution process or the clean-up of the financial sector in the late 1990s). Guarantees
account for less than 4 percent of GDP and refer largely to guaranteed loans from multilateral
creditors to public enterprises.

The country has started the process of transition to market financing. The country has already
graduated from IDA financing and concessional financing sources are likely to become even
more limited given the level of income. While the domestic government bond market is
currently very shallow, plans have been announced to develop it over the next few years.
Against this background, the public debt management strategy envisages borrowing from the
private international markets to meet most financing needs over the next several years.
Moreover, the government can turn to the IMF in case of need during particularly difficult
external circumstances.

The country has accessed the international capital markets independently on two occasions in
the past and the e authorities have also borrowed domestically. But despite relatively sound
fundamentals, financing conditions for FYR Macedonia remain tight and have deteriorated
once again since late 2011, notably amidst Euro zone volatility and fears of an even sharper

global slowdown. Global investors are broadly risk-averse, reflecting widespread uncertainty
about the direction of the financial market over the months ahead. Also, some conditions
inherent to FYR Macedonia (such as, small and infrequent issuances, vulnerability to external
factors, proximity to troubled Euro zone countries) render access to markets tight and
sovereign debt issuance problematic. For FYR Macedonia, current market sounding suggests
a maximum feasible tenor of five years (in the absence of a high-grade guarantee). The spread
likely achievable in the current market may figure in the range of 650-700bp over the high-
grade swap rate (about 8-9 percent in aggregate), with a number of financial institutions
sounding skepticism that an unenhanced transaction in Euros could even be closed for FYR
Macedonia in this climate.

The proposed PEPBG improves market access by enabling FYR Macedonia to tap funding
from the international bank loan market, at a time of ongoing financial market turmoil. The
PEPBG may expand the investor base by catalyzing new interest among large foreign banks
and financial institutions that may currently have little exposure to the country, and it help to
introduce the FYR Macedonia credit to a new pool of investors, which can lead to more
diversified sources of financing. By further establishing FYR Macedonia as a global
borrower, the authorities may further reduce portfolio risks, as terms for future market
borrowing should be supported by greater familiarity with the credit story. FYR Macedonia’s
integration into markets will be strengthened and its relationship with lenders will be
improved. Given the considerable links between corporate and sovereign credit risk, it is
expected that gains in creditworthiness at the sovereign level will be transferred to corporate
borrowers as well over time.

The proposed PEPBG would also leverage better Bank’s capital by helping FYR Macedonia
to increase the total volume raised. In order to maximize debt capacity, the PEPBG will
guarantee a partial amount of debt service, between 55-65 percent of principal and interest
This will allow FYR Macedonia to issue a relatively sizable commercial loan of EUR250
million, out of which approximately EUR155 million would be guaranteed by IBRD. The
loan would carry a higher rate compared to a full principal guarantee or full guarantee of all
debt service; however, the rate achieved will be significantly lower than the cost estimated for
a non-guaranteed instrument.

The PEPBG will allow FYR Macedonia to borrow at improved terms, including longer tenor
and lower rates. It will help FYR Macedonia to reenter the international money market under
reasonable terms, following the difficulties it has faced in recent years. It allows FYR
Macedonia to comfortably borrow a large volume with a 5-7year maturity, or for about 50-
100 percent longer than was achieved through the last Eurobond issue in 2009. In addition,
the cost of funding will be significantly below the rates currently available to FYR Macedonia
in today’s volatile market, in the absence of an IBRD guarantee. Including arrangement fees
and the IBRD guarantee fees, the loan should be extended at below 5 percent, a marked
improvement from the 8 percent rate that FYR Macedonia would likely expect to pay in
today’s market.

The design of the instrument underlying the proposed IBRD PEPBG and the coverage of the
latter was driven by the country’s debt management needs, i.e. securing financing at
reasonable costs and minimizing risks. The amount borrowed would cover a significant part
of the 2013 budget financing needs thus reducing market risks. Reducing financing costs is


                                                 59
another important objective of the authorities, but was considered in parallel with the amount
and tenor of the loan.

Preliminary market soundings indicated that the guarantee would add more value when
combined with a commercial loan than with a global bond. According to market soundings
conducted earlier, a guaranteed global bond transaction would cost at least 150bp more than a
loan or privately placed security. This can in part be explained by the fact that the low
yielding bond issuance would not be attractive for the majority of standard emerging bond
market investors who search for yield and have strong preference for liquid assets. The size of
the transaction, in bond format, would be much smaller than that required by the JPMorgan
Emerging Market Bond Index, which is another important consideration for emerging markets
funds. High value assigned to IBRD guarantees in the commercial loan markets derives from
the effect of the IBRD guarantee on the capital treatment of the instrument. Triple A credit
enhancement can substantially reduce the capital that a bank needs to allocate against a loan
which can allow many banks to more efficiently price the overall risk, rendering a high
quality balance sheet investment with extra yield (and not a widely distributed security that
would compete with similarly rated and higher yielding emerging market bonds). Going
forward, and even more so once FYR Macedonia borrows independently, its financial
credibility will be strengthened which may further reduce the country risk premium. Regional
experience with PBGs is encouraging. Following the PBG-supported borrowing, Serbia was
able to issue a 15 year domestic Euro T-bond at favorable rates. In late September 2011,
moreover, Serbia managed to issue a 10-year Global Bond and raise US$1 billion, further
reflecting improved market access. Most recently, in July 2012, Montenegro borrowed EUR
100 million for a 7-year maturity with an estimated savings of up to 400 basis points p.a..
Macedonia obtained some improvement in its own access, temporarily, following a PBG-
supported transaction that closed in November 2011, as revealed by a loan secured earlier in
2012 for EUR75MM through a private global lender.

However, execution risks have increased in the current environment. While market soundings
do confirm the interest for an IBRD-guaranteed borrowing by FYR Macedonia, the current
environment is highly unpredictable, which results in ongoing risk-aversion among emerging
market investors, which are increasingly differentiating carefully across credit quality.

OUTLINE OF INDICATIVE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF POTENTIAL WORLD
    BANK GUARANTEE OF LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA
This term sheet contains a summary of indicative terms and conditions of a potential IBRD
Policy Based Guarantee (the IBRD Guarantee) for a private sector loan to the Republic of
Macedonia.
This term sheet does not constitute an offer from IBRD to provide an IBRD Guarantee. The
provision of the Guarantee is subject, inter alia, to satisfactory appraisal by IBRD of the
related Program, review and acceptance of the underlying financing structure and
transaction documentation, and the approval of Management and the Board of Directors of
IBRD in their sole discretion.
IBRD Guarantee and Guaranteed Loan:

Guarantor:                           International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
                                     (IBRD).

Borrower:                            Republic of Macedonia (Macedonia).

Purpose:                             The proposed Policy Based Guarantee (PBG) supports
                                     Macedonia’s program aimed at strengthening public financial
                                     management, improving the effectiveness of public
                                     expenditures on health, and improving targeting of the social
                                     safety net. The PBG is a stand-alone operation building on a
                                     Policy Based Guarantee provided during the fiscal year 2011.

Guarantee Term:                      [5] [7] 20 years.

                                     IBRD Guaranteed Loan at stated maturity.

Guarantee Support:                   The IBRD Guarantee would cover any outstanding scheduled
                                     payment of principal (up to EUR155,000,000), which the
                                     Lender would have otherwise received from the Borrower under
                                     the IBRD Guaranteed Loan Agreement at scheduled maturity,
                                     but for the occurrence of a Guaranteed Event.

                                   amount of principal for which IBRD shall have liability shall not
                                   in any circumstances exceed the amount of the IBRD Guarantee

                       guarantee of payment and not of collection. Any demand notice
                       must be received by IBRD within thirty (30) business days of the

                       Agreement.

Reduction of Demand:   If after the Lender has made a demand on IBRD for payment
                       under the IBRD Guarantee but before IBRD has made payment of
                       the amount so demanded, the Borrower pays the Lender (or the
                       Lender recovers otherwise than from IBRD) any sum which is
                       applied to the satisfaction of the whole or any part of the such
                       principal amount, the Lender shall promptly notify IBRD of such
                       fact and IBRD’s liability under the IBRD Guarantee in respect of
                       such demand shall be reduced by an amount equal to the portion
                       of principal so paid by the Borrower (or so recovered by the
                       Lender) and so applied.

                       the rights, powers and remedies conferred upon the Lender with
                       respect to IBRD by the IBRD Guarantee or by applicable law or
                       regulation shall be discharged, impaired or otherwise affected by:

                       relating to the Borrower; (ii) any of the obligations of the
                       Borrower under the IBRD Guaranteed Loan Agreement being or
                       becoming illegal, invalid, unenforceable, void, voidable or
                       ineffective in any respect; (iii) any time or other indulgence being
                       granted to the Borrower in respect of its obligations under the
                       IBRD Guaranteed Loan Agreement or (iv) any other act, event or
                       omission (other than the failure of the Lender to make a demand
                       under the IBRD Guarantee) which might otherwise operate to
                       discharge, impair or otherwise affect any of the obligations of
                       IBRD under the IBRD Guarantee or any of the rights, powers or
                       remedies conferred on the Lender by the IBRD Guaranteed Loan

No Amendment without   The IBRD Guarantee shall terminate and any written demand
IBRD Consent:          from the Lender pursuant to the IBRD Guarantee shall be void if
                       any amendment is made to the IBRD Guaranteed Loan
                       Agreement, or any waiver or consent is given in writing with
                       respect thereto, without IBRD’s prior written consent.

IBRD Obligations       IBRD’s obligations under the IBRD Guarantee shall be binding
Binding:               upon IBRD and inure to the benefit of the Lender and shall be
                       enforceable only by the Lender, provided that the obligations of
                       IBRD under the IBRD Guarantee shall not be treated as a
                       separate obligation of IBRD independent from the principal

                                         63
                          amount guaranteed, and the benefit of such obligations may only
                          be transferred by a Lender in accordance with the provisions
                          below, as more fully described in the IBRD Guaranteed Loan
                          Agreement.
                          Except as IBRD may otherwise agree, any assignment of the
Assignment:
                          IBRD Guaranteed Loan may be made only to an assignee
                          established as a bank or financial institution duly licensed to carry
                          out banking or financial business in its country of domicile. Such

                          institution, but cannot be an export credit agency, multilateral
                          institution or state entity. Such assignee must not have been
                          declared ineligible to be awarded an IBRD- or IDA-financed
                          contract in accordance with World Bank Sanctions Procedures
                          and must not be an entity included on the consolidated list of
                          individuals and entities maintained by the United Nations
                          Security Council Committee established pursuant to United
                          Nations Security Council Resolution 1267.


                          The assigning Lender shall provide advance notice of potential
                          assignments to IBRD as provided in the IBRD Guaranteed Loan
                          Agreement.

Subrogation:              Upon payment by IBRD of amounts under the IBRD Guarantee,
                          IBRD shall, to the extent it has not been reimbursed by the
                          Borrower under the Indemnity Agreement (as discussed below),
                          be immediately entitled to recover from the Borrower the amount
                          so paid by IBRD in respect of principal and for this purpose
                          IBRD shall be immediately subrogated to the rights of the Lender
                          to the extent of the amount in respect of principal so received by
                          such Lender, regardless of whether such Lender has been fully
                          prepaid or repaid by the Borrower, and the Lender shall forthwith
                          assign or transfer to IBRD, without representation, warranty or
                          recourse, all of such Lender’s claims, interests, rights and security
                          which it then has against Macedonia under the IBRD Guaranteed
                          Loan Agreement in respect of principal so received.

Withholding of Payment:   If at any time between the effective date of the IBRD Guaranteed
                          Loan Agreement and the maturity date of the IBRD Guaranteed
                          Loan (i) there is substantial evidence that the Lender has, in
                          connection with the IBRD Guaranteed Loan, engaged in
                          fraudulent, corrupt, coercive or collusive practices or (ii) the
                          Lender has been declared ineligible to be awarded a contract
                          financed by the International Bank for Reconstruction and
                          Development or the International Development Association in
                          accordance with the World Bank Sanctions Procedures, then
                          IBRD shall be entitled to withhold payment of all amounts
                          otherwise payable under the IBRD Guarantee by IBRD on

                                             64
                          account of such Lender.

                          under the IBRD Guaranteed Loan Agreement solely in its
                          capacity as guarantor of the principal of the IBRD Guaranteed
                          Loan as provided therein and in no other capacity. IBRD shall
                          incur no liability under the IBRD Guaranteed Loan Agreement
                          nor have any other duties or responsibilities, except to the extent
                          expressly specified in the IBRD Guaranteed Loan Agreement or
                          in any document delivered by IBRD under or pursuant to that
                          agreement.

Cross-Default             IBRD may require a cross-default-related provision in the IBRD

                          of the Lender to accelerate the IBRD Guaranteed Loan upon a
                          default by the Borrower under any World Bank loans such that
                          the IBRD Guaranteed Loan may only be accelerated in the event
                          of a material default on World Bank loans.

                          front in advance by the Borrower. If Guarantee Fee not paid
                          upfront in advance, IBRD may terminate the IBRD Guarantee if

                       IBRD will represent and warrant to the Lender that (in addition
                       to standard representations about due authorization, capacity
                       and enforceability) its obligations pursuant to the IBRD
                       Guaranteed Loan Agreement rank pari passu with all other
                       unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of IBRD.

                       The Lender will represent and warrant that it has not engaged
                       in and are not engaging in fraudulent, corrupt, coercive or
                       collusive practices, and will covenant, inter alia, to apply all
                       amounts received by them under the IBRD Guaranteed Loan
                       Agreement towards payment of the principal amounts covered
                       by the IBRD Guarantee which were the subject of the demand
                       notice.
Indemnity Agreement:   The Borrower would enter into a separate Indemnity
                       Agreement with IBRD. Under the Indemnity Agreement, the
                       Borrower would undertake to indemnify IBRD on demand, or
                       as IBRD may otherwise determine, for any payment made by
                       IBRD under the terms of the Guarantee. The Indemnity
                       Agreement will follow the legal regime, and include dispute
                       settlement provisions, which are customary in agreements
                       between member countries and IBRD.

                       Any obligation by the Borrower to reimburse IBRD for
                       payments made under the IBRD Guarantee will rank pari
                       passu with all other external indebtedness of the Borrower,
                       including external indebtedness of the Borrower to IBRD.

                       The Indemnity Agreement will also contain provisions on the

                       Guaranteed Loan in an account acceptable to IBRD, with
                       appropriate tracking of amounts deposited therein in the
                       Borrower’s budget management system. The Borrower will
                       make withdrawals from such account for use in support of its
                       development policy program, and will agree not to use such

include, inter alia, goods included in groups or subgroups of
the United Nations Standard International Trade Classification,
Revision 3, military goods, environmentally hazardous goods,
certain payments prohibited by a decision of the United
Nations Security Council taken under Chapter VII of the
Charter of the United Nations, or expenditures with respect to
which IBRD determines that corrupt, fraudulent, collusive or
coercive practices were engaged in by representatives of the
Borrower. If any such withdrawals are used for excluded
expenditures, the Borrower shall deposit an equivalent amount
in the account or prepay the Lender an equivalent amount.

In the event that the Borrower fails to make any payment to or
to indemnify IBRD under the Indemnity Agreement or
otherwise defaults on its obligations under the Indemnity
Agreement, IBRD shall be entitled, in addition to any other
rights and remedies it may have, to suspend or cancel in whole
or in part the Borrower’s right to make withdrawals under any
loan or guarantee between IBRD and the Borrower or under
any development credit agreement or financing agreement
between IBRD and the Borrower, or to declare the outstanding
principal and interest of any such credit or loan due and
payable immediately.
