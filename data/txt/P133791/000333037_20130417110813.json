Directors endorsed the objective of the reform\n            program supported by the guarantee which will ensure that\n            fiscal policy, and public expenditure policy in particular,\n            supported an environment conducive to growth, more effective\n            social protection and improved service delivery. They\n            commended the FYR Macedonia for maintaining macroeconomic\n            stability and laying the groundwork for economic recovery\n            while the country is adversely affected by the Euro zone\n            economic challenges.
