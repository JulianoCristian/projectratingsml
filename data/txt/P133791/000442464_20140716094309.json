  satisfactory, risk to development outcome was moderate, Bank\n            performance was highly satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was highly satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: a PBG can be a useful instrument for leveraging\n            Bank resources to facilitate a much larger resource transfer\n            through commercial bank markets. There are two ways in which\n            PBGs differ from standard development policy loan (DPL)\n            operations. First, PBGs require a highly rapid and time\n            sensitive response. Operations such as the PEPBG are often\n            requested when there is a large financing gap. Second, PBGs\n            require staff that has a good understanding of commercial\n            loan markets and finance. Continuous involvement of staff\n            from the Bank's financial advisory and banking services\n            played an important role for the success of the PEPBG."}, "docdt": "2014-05-27T00:00:00Z"}
