The substantial\n            financing it provides should not be used by clients to\n            postpone but to facilitate reforms and necessary\n            adjustments. Hence, a strong reform program is essential.\n            Also, while the bullet repayment feature temporarily\n            relieves repayment and fiscal pressure, it could add to\n            borrower risk of repayment in the future unless it is\n            accompanied by ex-ante provisions equal to the amount\n            required under a standard annual repayment schedule.\n            Repayment options and their pros and cons should, therefore,\n            be discussed at length with the client. Standard repayment\n            schedules should normally be preferred and bullet repayments\n            should be accompanied by a World Bank recommendation (or\n            requirement) to the Borrower to make annual provisions; (4)\n            This operation shows that the World Bank is particularly\n            effective when it promotes the regional and global public\n            good of country-to-country learning during preparation of\n            similar projects in different countries. This is especially\n            the case when testing relatively new instruments as was the\n            case with PBGs. The FYR Macedonia PBG benefitted from\n            consultations the FYR Macedonia government held with the\n            government of Serbia on the costs and benefits and technical\n            details of the operation. The World Bank took an active part\n            in these consultations and encouraged this productive\n            learning. The World Bank team itself has shown that the\n            lessons from the first PBG in the region on Serbia were\n            absorbed and integrated into the design of the FYR Macedonia\n            operation; and (5) Financial sector supervision and\n            regulation can help preserve macroeconomic and financial\n            stability in the face of substantial external shocks and\n            adverse local conditions. At a time when many a country in\n            Europe faced bankruptcy or major interventions of systemic\n            banks, FYR Macedonia\u2019s fiscal and monetary authorities\n            managed to maintain stability by a combination of active\n            monitoring, a focus on stability, and anticipation of the\n            impact of regional shocks."}, "docdt": "2016-06-30T14:00:05Z"}
