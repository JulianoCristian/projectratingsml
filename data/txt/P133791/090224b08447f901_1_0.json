Some of the\n            lessons learned include:  PBGs can potentially be a useful\n            instrument for supporting countries facing large external\n            financing needs. PBGs implemented in a context of\n            challenging macro-fiscal situation and large financing needs\n            need to incorporate a consistent macro-economic framework\n            with necessary macro and fiscal actions for risk mitigation.\n            Positive impact of important public expenditure measures\n            (wage control, reforms in health procurement, and better\n            targeting of social protection) can be eroded if the program\n            lacks an overarching fiscal and debt framework. As FYR\n            Macedonia\u2019s case illustrates, fiscal savings achieved\n            through these important measures can be dissipated by\n            introducing non-priority spending such as ad-hoc pension\n            increases or controversial capital expenditures. Comparing\n            the aggregate interest rate of PBG-supported debt\n            instruments with counter factual market rates may not be\n            enough for assessing the extent of reduction in the\n            borrowing costs associated with the transaction. Estimating\n            the change in sovereign risk perceptions, although a\n            challenging task, may give more accurate assessment of the\n            impact of the program."}, "docdt": "2016-06-28T07:34:03Z"}
