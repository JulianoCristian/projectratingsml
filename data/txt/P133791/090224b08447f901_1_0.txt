      IEG Mission: Improving World Bank Group development results through excellence in evaluation.


About this Report
     The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two
purposes: first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is
producing the expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through
the dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20-25 percent of the
Bank’s lending operations through fieldwork. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that
are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which
Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
      To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examines project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower
for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers' comments are
attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has
been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both ri gor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive
at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
information is available on the IEG website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be
achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, and Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to
which the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s
objectives were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency
is the extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of
capital and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to
adjustment operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory,
Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or expected
outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High,
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) on the Former Yugoslav
Republic (FYR) of Macedonia Public Expenditures Policy-Based Guarantee implemented
in 2012–2013. The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) prepared the report. It is based
on interviews, documents, and data collected in the course of a visit to FYR Macedonia
in October 2015, during which government officials, external development partners,
business groups, academics, nongovernmental organizations, civil society groups, and
other stakeholders were consulted. The evaluation also draws on in-depth interviews with
World Bank and International Monetary Fund staff, including current and former
members of the FYR Macedonia country teams in Washington, D.C., and Skopje; and on
published and internal documents from the two institutions. The cooperation and
assistance of all stakeholders and government officials are gratefully acknowledged, as is
the support of the World Bank office in Skopje.

Following standard IEG procedures, a copy of the draft PPAR was sent to the relevant
government officials and agencies for their review and feedback, and comments received
from the Government of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia have been
included in Appendix D.

Summary
This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) evaluates the public expenditure
policy-based guarantee (PEPEG) provided to the Former Yugoslav Republic (FYR) of
Macedonia in the amount of €155 million implemented in 2012–2013. The PEPEG supported
a commercial loan in the amount of €250 million. This was the country’s second policy-
based guarantee (PBG) in the aftermath of the global crisis. The objective of this PPAR is
two-fold. First, it assesses various dimensions of performance based on both Independent
Evaluation Group (IEG) and Operations Policy and Country Services (OPCS) Vice
Presidency guidelines. It also builds on evidence emanating from the assessment of FYR
Macedonia’s first PBG and draws broader lessons on the use of this instrument in the World
Bank.

The PEPEG had three specific objectives:

       (i) improving the efficiency of public expenditures by strengthening public financial
            management practices;
       (ii) improving the efficiency of service provision in the health sector; and
       (iii) Strengthening social protection and inclusion.
These objectives were substantially relevant to World Bank and government strategies and to
country conditions at both the entry and the closing of this operation. The program design,
however, has shortcomings, and its relevance is rated modest. In spite of the relevance and
institutional depth of most of prior actions, the design suffered from a lack of operational
focus on the program’s macroeconomic and fiscal risks as well as a relatively narrow scope
of the public financial management (PFM) reform agenda at a time of heightened risks.
The achievement of these multiple objectives was mixed. Efficacy of the first objective—
improving the efficiency of public expenditures by strengthening public financial
management practices—is rated modest. The program helped to achieve clearance of the
arears identified in the program and introduce changes in treasury practices to prevent
accumulation of future arrears. However, because of remaining gaps the information about
arrears at the level of central government is not fully reliable, while arrears at the
municipality level and in the health sector remain quite large. Additionally, the efficiency of
capital expenditures has deteriorated and has become an area of concern. The replacement of
the indexation mechanism for pensions by ad-hoc increases has reduced the predictability of
PFM.
There was substantial achievement of the second objective—improving the efficiency of
service provision in the health sector. The program helped reduce the unit price of
pharmaceutical and some medical equipment to a considerable extent. The implication of
these changes for budgetary savings in 2013–2015, however, was less evident as an increase
in the number and cost of prescriptions offset the positive impact of unit price reduction. An
improvement in service provision to underserved areas came through the introduction of a
new framework that helped to direct more resources to those areas.
Achievement of the third objective—strengthening social protection and inclusion—was also
substantial. The government’s active labor market programs were strengthened by improving
                                                             x


the access of vulnerable groups to social services and generating fiscal savings. In the area of
social protection, the program helped improve targeting to a considerable extent. Fiscal
resources freed up because of improved targeting enhanced the levels of financial assistance
to beneficiaries.

The overall outcome is rated moderately satisfactory.1 The objectives were substantially
relevant, but the design was only modestly so. The risk to development outcomes is rated
significant mainly due to the overall macroeconomic risks arising from pro-cyclical fiscal
policy and weaknesses in the public financial management. Bank performance is rated
moderately satisfactory that reflects strengths such as prioritization of clearance of arrears
and Treasury reforms to alleviate a key constraint affecting the quality of PFM, and
shortcomings in addressing macro and fiscal risks. Borrower performance is rated moderately
satisfactory reflecting strengths such as clearance of arrears ahead of the schedule and
important reforms to improve health and social expenditures, and weaknesses in transparency
and predictability of PFM and the overall use of public resources including ad-hoc pension
increases, large capital investments in non-productive areas, and large off-budget
infrastructure investments.

Among the key lessons are:

         PBGs can potentially be a useful instrument for supporting countries facing large
          external financing needs.
         PBGs implemented in a context of challenging macro-fiscal situation and large
          financing needs need to incorporate a consistent macro-economic framework with
          necessary macro and fiscal actions for risk mitigation.
         Positive impact of important public expenditure measures (wage control, reforms in
          health procurement, and better targeting of social protection) can be eroded if the
          program lacks an overarching fiscal and debt framework. As FYR Macedonia’s case
          illustrates, fiscal savings achieved through these important measures can be dissipated
          by introducing non-priority spending such as ad-hoc pension increases or
          controversial capital expenditures.
         Comparing the aggregate interest rate of PBG-supported debt instruments with
          counterfactual market rates may not be enough for assessing the extent of reduction in
          the borrowing costs associated with the transaction. Estimating the change in
          sovereign risk perceptions, although a challenging task, may give more accurate
          assessment of the impact of the program.

1. Background and Context
1.1     In 2012, when the public expenditure policy-based guarantee (PEPEG) operation
was prepared, external and regional context for the Former Yugoslav Republic (FYR) of
Macedonia was challenging. The slow recovery from the global crisis in the Western
Balkans region stalled at the end 2011 as the result of market turbulence associated with
the sovereign debt crisis in Europe. The ensuing regional recession was particularly
challenging for many emerging countries of Europe, including FYR Macedonia, because
of hard external financing conditions. Against this background in 2011, FYR Macedonia
and the World Bank converted the envisaged second operation in the series of
development policy operations (DPOs) into a policy-based guarantee (PBG) to address
larger than expected financing needs. With the help of the PBG, FYR Macedonia
mobilized €130 million in the international loan market.2

1.2     In 2012, many countries of the region saw a full-blown recession, including FYR
Macedonia. Substantially narrowed fiscal space affected policy response. In the first half
of 2012, FYR Macedonia introduced spending measures as the result of revenue
underperformance. Financing requirements, however, remained sizeable because of
greater economic contraction, relatively modest spending cuts, and problems in
commitment controls that affected the overall fiscal stance. These translated into
accumulation of arrears in budgetary payments and value added tax (VAT) refunds.
Borrowing costs were high. While the government’s initial plan was to borrow €250
million through commercial loans, tough market conditions allowed borrowing €75
million only with a fixed interest rate of 6.5 percent and five-year maturity in July 2012.

1.3     To respond to higher financing needs, the World Bank and the government
decided to convert a DPO under preparation for €50 million into another PBG, repeating
the experience of the first PBG in 2011. The planned DPO was designed based on
government’s reform program in public expenditures on health, social protection, and
pensions. The DPO focused on improving the targeting of means-tested financial
assistance, improving procurement of medicine and medical devices to reduce unit costs,
and strengthening the pension system to ensure long-term sustainability. It was converted
into a €155 million PEPBG that supported a €250 million commercial loan from
Deutsche Bank in January 2013. The policy matrix of the PEPBG also included measures
to address the growing problem of fiscal arrears.

1.4     In the years following the approval of the PEPBG, FYR Macedonia experienced a
resumption of economic growth aided by overall improvement in regional and global
economies. Its fiscal stance in 2013–2015 was relaxed as a result of revenue
underperformance, pension increases, and large capital expenditures. The country
returned to the international bond market in 2014 with a successful issuance of €500
million. Domestic bonds have become an important source for deficit financing. Public
and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt approached 47 percent of gross domestic product
(GDP) by the end of 2015. Implementation of large off-budget infrastructure projects will
lift PPG debt as a percent of GDP further in the medium term. Against the background of

political uncertainties, FYR Macedonia saw an increase in the spreads on its international
bonds by the end of 2015.

2. Objectives
2.1    The operation supported a broad government program and assisted FYR
Macedonia in implementing its borrowing plan within a consistent macroeconomic
framework (Loan and Program Summary, page v). For evaluation the purposes, the
Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) focused on the following program objectives:

      improving the efficiency of public expenditures by strengthening public financial
       management practices;
      improving the efficiency of service provision in the health sector; and
      strengthening social protection and inclusion.

3. Relevance of Objectives—Substantial
Relevance to the Context
3.1      The program’s objectives were strongly relevant to the context. At program
preparation, a high premium was put on prudent macro-management and a sound
borrowing plan because of uncertainties in the external environment amid Europe’s debt
crisis. FYR Macedonia had a good record of accomplishment in macroeconomic
management that helped bring down the debt at a time of strong economic performance
in the 2000s. This created appropriate fiscal room to counteract the impact of the global
crisis in 2009–2011. Sustaining these achievements required maintaining a prudent fiscal
policy and borrowing strategy within a consistent macro framework, an objective
supported by the program. This macro objective was also relevant to choosing the
instrument—policy-based guarantees have an intrinsic macroeconomic motivation in
meeting large financing needs when access to capital markets is difficult. The size of the
borrowing operation that the program supported (more than 3 percent of the borrower’s
GDP) also highlights the importance of the macro objective.

3.2     With respect to the PFM objective, although the policy-based guarantee approved
in 2011 had an objective of strengthening public finance, FYR Macedonia experienced
weakening in PFM practices in important areas throughout 2012. Revenue
underperformance and lack of adequate response by the authorities led to a deterioration
in fiscal discipline and the accumulation of payments and VAT refund arrears in 2012.
According to the Bank’s estimates, arrears reached 2 percent of GDP by September 2012.
Inclusion of the PFM objective was important for helping the authorities to recognize the
magnitude of the problem and undertake measures to address it. In addition, the focus on
PFM was relevant to a deterioration in some aspects of budget management in 2010–
2012. The government resorted to greater use of off-budget vehicles for implementing
PFM functions typical for the central government, such as road infrastructure. Lack of
medium-term planning also heightened the risks to the overall quality of PFM. Against
this background, the PFM objective was highly relevant.

Relevance to Bank and Government Strategies
3.3     The health sector's reform agenda during program preparation was substantial. Its
main aim was to improve procurement and expand access to health services in
underserved areas. The government’s reform initiatives focused on improved
procurement of medicine and medical devices to enhance the efficiency of public
expenditures. The concentration of health service providers in the capital and other urban
centers had constrained access to services in remote areas, and the government’s reform
program included actions to address this situation. In the area of social protection at the
time of program preparation, the government was implementing a set of actions aimed at
better targeting in social protection and more incentives for inclusion and participation
through active labor market programs. These followed the government’s earlier actions,
such as adoption of the Law on Social Protection in 2009 and introduction of the Cash
Benefits Management Information System (CBMIS) in 2011.

3.4     With respect to the relevance of the objectives to the World Bank’s strategy in
FYR Macedonia, the country strategy partnership for 2011–2014 directly supported two
out of four program objectives. Cluster 3 on human development had specific goals in
strengthening social protection administration and health expenditure management.

4. Relevance of Design—Modest
4.1     The relevance of design is assessed as modest based on policy content in relation
to objectives and choice of instrument. Strengths included the relevance and institutional
depth of most prior actions. The design mostly suffered from lack of operational focus on
macro risks as well as the relatively narrow scope of the PFM reform agenda during
heightened risks to overall PFM quality.

Choice of the Instrument
4.2    Use of the guarantee instrument by the World Bank has been limited.3 FYR
Macedonia is the only country that has benefited from two PBGs under which €255
million of the Bank's guarantees leveraged €380 million in commercial loans, which
comprised about 9 percent of FYR Macedonia's outstanding public debt as of 2015. The
reason behind the repeated use of PBGs in FYR Macedonia was a belief that the country
complied with specific eligibility criteria on macro, debt, and financing while at the same
time experienced limited access to markets for debt refinancing.

4.3     The country's financing needs were sizeable due to revenue underperformance,
lack of fiscal adjustment, and debt refinancing needs. The choice of the instrument
allowed the Bank to provide financing well beyond a typical DPO and without exceeding
the country exposure limits of the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD). 4Borrowing €250 million from the market in December 2012–

3Long considered as a “hybrid” operation, the guarantees were fully incorporated under Bank’s OP 8.60 on DPOs in
2014, formally becoming a subset of the Bank’s development policy financing.
4The World Bank has a 1:4 rule for BPG wherebyUSD$4 of commitment in guarantees count as USD$1 of country
exposure
                                                         4


January 2013 without the Bank's interest rate "subsidy" through the guarantee would have
been costly for FYR Macedonia. In this respect, the use of the instrument could have
helped to reduce borrowing costs.

4.4     The financing gap in early 2013 reflected the fact that the government intended to
clear the arrears accumulated mostly as a result of weakened commitment control in the
second half of 2011 and first half of 2012 (estimated at €200 million) without fiscal
adjustment. Moreover, toward the end of 2012, the government’s spending plans for 2013
became more ambitious as it embraced, among other initiatives, the controversial idea of
an ad-hoc increase in pensions that added an estimated €40 million, or 0.4 percent of
GDP, to the deficit in 2013.

4.5     In mid-2012, the government wanted to borrow €250 million from Deutsche Bank
for deficit financing and repayment of Eurobonds in January 2013 but was able to
mobilize only €75 million at terms it deemed acceptable. When the government
approached the World Bank and Deutsche Bank for a repeat guaranteed loan at the end of
2012, its financing objective remained at €250 million notwithstanding the fact that it had
already borrowed €75 million a few months prior. This is an indication that the
government's spending plan expanded toward the end of 2012 against the backdrop of
available financing.

4.6     The €250 million commercial loan from Deutsche Bank with an interest rate of
3.9 percent guaranteed by this operation consisted of an IBRD guaranteed component of
Euro 155 million with seven years maturity, and a non-guaranteed component of Euro 95
million with five years maturity. The aggregate interest rate of 3.9 percent on the loan
was lower than the non-guaranteed loan of July 2012, which had 6.3 percent interest rate.
The terms were better than what Macedonia could have received in the market without
the guarantee. Although estimating the counterfactual is difficult, it is believed that the
interest rate of a loan with similar parameters could have been as high as 7 percent.

4.7      However, comparing the aggregate interest rate of PBG-supported financial
instrument with market rates available to the borrower may not be enough for assessing
the extent of reduction in the borrowing costs associated with the guarantee transaction as
the interest rate of the guaranteed instrument by definition should be lower than the rates
of “clean” instruments without guarantees. A more comprehensive approach would be to
assess the change in market’s perceptions of sovereign risk because of the underlying
macroeconomic and structural policy program supported by Bank’s policy lending. This
could be done by estimating the implicit interest rate on non-guaranteed component of
the loan by isolating non-sovereign risk factors associated with the transaction (IBRD
risk, liquidity premium, etc). Although IEG does not look at these aspects for
performance evaluation purposes, this evaluation highlights the importance of developing
an approach to comprehensively assess the impact of PBGs on client’s borrowing terms. 5




5The World Bank has not yet developed an approach for such an assessment in spite of scaling-up of PBGs since 2011.
IEG will look it this and other important aspects of PBGs as part of a learning product, which will draw on this and
other PPARs.

Policy Content and Results Framework Analysis
4.8     Analysis of policy content and the results framework focuses on the links between
objectives, outcomes, and policy actions and the relevance and quality of policy actions
to measure the extent to which outcomes are likely to be achieved.

4.9     The strengths of the program's results framework included strong links between
prior actions, outcomes, and objectives and satisfactory institutional depth of most prior
actions. The program included important actions for achieving the outcomes such as the
inventory and clearance of arrears, changes in treasury manuals to strengthen PFM,
changes in procurement practices in health sector, and improved targeting in social
protection. In terms of the relevance and additionality of prior actions, the prior action in
the health sector on reference prices and centralized procurement was implemented more
than 12 months before the program's approval (not directly motivated by the program),
which somewhat affected its additionality in this policy area.

4.10 The design shortcoming was that the policy content of the program did not
include actions needed to address heightened macro and fiscal risks6. Because of lack of
information about the extent of payments arears accumulated because of deterioration of
commitment control, there was no certainty about the implications of arrears clearance on
the 2013 budget. In addition, during program preparation it became known that the
Government is planning to sign a large loan agreement with China for highway
construction, which further added to macro and fiscal risks7. These factors contributed to
higher risks to the consistency of fiscal framework that required risks mitigation.

4.11 Additionally, the impact of possible savings on fiscal sustainability from
improved procurement of medicine, for example, would be much less if the saved
resources are used to increase non-priority expenditures such as pensions and non-
productive capital investments. Possible actions that could support the objective included
a credible and debt-stabilizing medium-term fiscal framework and, possibly, a fiscal rule.

4.12 It is important for the World Bank's operations to facilitate rather than postpone
necessary adjustments. The Bank's support for clearance of arrears without fiscal
measures affected the rationale for the intervention and created conditions for higher
deficit in 2013. Additionally, the fact that FYR Macedonia allowed the IMF's
precautionary line of credit to expire in January 2013 put a higher premium on the Bank's
operational focus on macro and fiscal framework. The operation was the only vehicle for
macro and fiscal policy dialogue with the Bank and, in this respect, it was expected to
inform implementation of the single-sector competitiveness DPO being prepared in
parallel with no macro and fiscal objectives. Against this background, the lack of macro
and fiscal policy actions to underpin fiscal sustainability affected quality of design.


6According to the Bank’s Operational Policy OP 8.60, substantial macroeconomic risks should be addressed through
DPOs as a pre-condition of Bank’s budget support.

5. Implementation
5.1     The PEPBG was the second PBG operation in FYR Macedonia. Both the Bank
team and government counterparts had previous experience with various aspects of
PBGs, such as identifying the commercial lender, negotiating loan terms, and finalizing
the deal after approval of the operation. It was approved by the Bank on January 8, 2013
and became effective on January 11, 2013. The €250 million commercial loan with
Deutsche Bank was finalized within a week after the program became effective.

5.2     Preparation of the operation also required strong cooperation among various units
of the Bank, including the core PBG team, the Bank’s lead network (Poverty Reduction
and Economic Management), the Bank’s Human Development network, FPD, Treasury,
FINCR, and the country team. The Ministry of Finance, as the implementing agency,
played a coordinating role. The National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia, the
Ministry of Labor and Social Policy, and the Ministry of Health were also closely
involved.

5.3     The operation triggered no safeguards. The Poverty and Social Impact Analysis of
the original DPO that was converted into the PBG under review provided an adequate
assessment of possible adverse social and distributional effects of the policies supported
by the operation.

5.4     The implementation was supervised by the Bank staff in the region and through
missions in March and September of 2013. Implementation was mostly focused on
verifying the clearance of arrears, which was completed in the first half of 2013. Policy
dialogue during implementation resulted in publication of the medium term fiscal
strategy in 2013. Implementation also benefited from parallel activities, such as
preparation of the public expenditure review.

6. Achievement of Objectives
Macroeconomic Developments in 2013-2015 (not rated)
6.1      Growth was relatively strong in 2013-2015. FYR Macedonia's domestic and
international borrowing terms improved in recent years against the background of overall
moderation of risks in the region. However, the overall fiscal policy stance was not fully
consistent with debt-stabilization and fiscal sustainability. This evaluation finds that in
the current political and institutional context characterized by a lack of credible fiscal
responsibility institutions and political uncertainties it will be difficult to achieve
consistent macroeconomic framework.

6.2     The generally prudent and countercyclical fiscal stance that characterized FYR
Macedonia throughout the 2000s has disappeared since 2013. The central government's
budget deficit increased to 3.9 percent in 2013 and further to 4.2 percent in 2014 while
remaining elevated in 2015 notwithstanding relatively strong economic growth. These
figures, however, do not show the actual extent of fiscal expansion because since 2013
road infrastructure expenditures have not been included in the central government budget.
                                             7


As major infrastructure projects implemented by off-budget State Owned Enterprises
through external borrowing have been gradually expanding in recent years, the actual
fiscal stance might be more expansionary than the headline budget deficits would
suggest.

6.3     The data on public debt (public and publicly guaranteed debt) may provide a
better indication about the overall fiscal stance in the recent years. It includes SOE
borrowing with government guarantees for the implementation of transport infrastructure
projects. FYR Macedonia’s PPG debt was at around 47 percent of GDP by the end of
2015, which is 8 percentage points higher than in 2012. It is substantially higher than
expected at the time of program preparation. The government’s letter of development
policy for this operation from December 2012 stated that the medium-term plan is to keep
the public debt below 35 percent. According to the government’s fiscal strategy, public
debt will reach 53 percent of GDP in 2018, which is substantially higher than estimated
under the most pessimistic debt sustainability scenario prepared at the time of approval of
the guarantee.

6.4     Larger than expected debt accumulation since 2013 has taken place due to a
combination of revenue underperformance and new expenditure initiatives. Revenues
underperformed in 2013 and 2014 because of tax policy choices, such as tax expenditures
for investments promotion, and tax administration issues. The government did not adjust
fiscal spending to respond to the revenue shortfall. In contrast to previous years, the
revenues overperformed in the first half of 2015 because of phasing out of corporate tax
privileges introduced in 2009. Instead of strengthening the fiscal buffers, the government
introduced new spending initiatives in July 2015 in an amount exceeding revenue
overperformance. This highlights the government’s pro-spending preferences and
existing risks to fiscal consolidation.

6.5     The institutional framework governing fiscal policy remains weak, and it
contributes to debt accumulation at a time of relatively strong economic growth. The
government has proposed a fiscal rule for parliament’s approval that introduces caps for
the budget deficit at 3 percent of GDP and for public and publicly guaranteed debt at 60
percent of GDP. However, the authorities’ decision to approve these rules as a
constitutional norm that requires broader political support (two-thirds vote in parliament)
made its approval in 2015 impossible, while prospects for 2016 also seem uncertain. At
the same time, the potential effectiveness of the proposed fiscal rule is questionable with
respect to the budget deficit as major infrastructure expenditures will be off budget for
the years to come.

6.6     FYR Macedonia went back to the international bond market in mid-2014 with an
issuance of €500 million Eurobonds having a 7-year maturity and an interest rate of 3.95
percent (an estimated spread of around 3 percent against German 10-year bonds). In early
2015, FYR Macedonia repaid the IMF credit well in advance of the schedule using
receipts from Eurobonds. The spreads on the country’s international bonds fluctuated
between 3 and 6 percent in 2013–2015, staying at around 6 percent as of November 2015,
higher than most regional comparators. Several large bullet repayments are scheduled in
2016 and 2017, suggesting it is important to create fiscal buffers including cash deposits
                                                           8


in the Central Bank to address the risks of market volatility at the time of debt
refinancing.

6.7    Since 2012, FYR Macedonia has substantially expanded the use of domestic
bonds, which is a welcome development. There has been a shift toward longer-term
government bonds with maturities reaching 15 years at an interest rate of around 4
percent (as of October 2015). Interest rates on short-term bonds (3 to 6 months) were
around 1.5 percent.

6.8     With respect to the country’s sovereign credit risk, Standard & Poor’s
downgraded its credit rating in May 2013 following a similar rating cut for Croatia in
February 2013. Although the overall regional trends played a role, the rating cut was also
driven by country-specific factors such as deteriorated fiscal transparency, the fiscal
stance, and large nonproductive investment projects.8 In August 2015, Fitch Ratings
changed the outlook of FYR Macedonia from stable to negative because of heightened
political risks and debt dynamic.9

To Improve the Efficiency of Public Expenditures by Strengthening
Public Financial Management Practices—Modest
6.9     Results were mixed under this objective. The program’s focus was mostly on
clearance of arrears that became a major problem in 2012 because of revenue
underperformance and slippages in fiscal discipline. The program helped to achieve
clearance of those specific arrears as planned by early 2013 and to introduce changes in
treasury practices to address the problem more systematically. However, FYR
Macedonia’s PFM has not been strengthened substantially, and there is no evidence of
overall improvement in the efficiency of public expenditures. Among achievements are
the reintroduction of the Medium Term Expenditure Framework in 2013, public sector
wage control, and improved reporting on public debt. Problems in PFM, including arrears
at the municipality level and in the health sector, and efficiency of capital expenditures
were still present by the end of 2015. New problems emerged, such as the transfer of
public road expenditures to off budget and replacement of the indexation mechanism for
pensions by ad-hoc increases, that have heightened the risks to fiscal sustainability.

Clearance of Arrears
6.10 As the result of revenue shortfall and slippages in the fiscal discipline in 2011 and
2012, the government accumulated VAT refunds and payments arrears of at least 2
percent of GDP. Clearance of these arrears became the cornerstone of the program
because of its negative implications for the quality of PFM and for the overall business
environment. The program helped the government identify arrears and make a
commitment for their clearance. In addition, the government implemented amendments to
the Manual on Treasury Operations to specify procedures for reporting multiyear
commitments of budget users to the treasury, improve procedures for reporting liabilities

                                                            9


on concluded contracts, and improve procedures for validation of commitment reports by
internal auditors. These changes were supported by an upgrade to the treasury
information system that further strengthened commitment control. The Law on Financial
Discipline, according to which the invoices should be settled within 60 days of receipt,
strengthened the framework to avoid the re-occurrence of arrears.

6.11 In spite of these reforms, the system in use does not record the dates the invoices
are received by the budget users thus creating room for accumulating arrears against the
invoices that are not yet submitted to the treasury.10 This shortcoming precludes a
comprehensive centralized record of financial liabilities and reliable information about
the extent of arrears. Furthermore, there is evidence of accumulation of payment arrears
in local governments. Various estimates put the arrears accumulated by municipalities at
1 to 2 percent of GDP, which is quite high compared to the combined budget of local
governments of around 5 percent of GDP. Arrears in the health sector have not improved.
The first policy-based guarantee of the World Bank implemented in 2011 aimed at
reducing the arrears in the health sector to below 0.4 percent of GDP by the end of 2012,
which was achieved. However, the results were not sustained. As of the end of 2015,
health sector arrears stood at 0.7 percent of GDP.11

Fiscal Transparency
6.12 There is mixed evidence on fiscal transparency. The decline in the open budget
index in 2010–2012 was not reversed in 2013–2015.12 FYR Macedonia’s index remains
low by regional standards because of limited engagement with the public in the budget
process and limited budget oversight by the legislature. There were, however,
improvements in the publication of public debt data. In 2014, the government restarted
the practice of quarterly publication of public debt that had been discontinued in 2010.
The reports cover the external and domestic debt of the central government, the SOEs,
and the municipalities.

6.13 As a major change in fiscal institutions in 2012, the government established
the Public Enterprise of State Roads (PESR) through the amendments to the Law on
Public Roads that assumed the responsibilities of the Agency for State Roads. The PESR
is responsible for the planning, construction, and maintenance of public roads and
management of state roads. It receives transfers from the state budget (as a share of
excise tax revenues on fuel) and collects revenues from public toll roads and vehicles
registrations. The PESR is the main vehicle of scaling up of road infrastructure spending.
It has extensively borrowed externally with government guarantees. Implementation of
PESR projects will add at least 5 percent of GDP on the country’s debt stock over the
medium term. This change—moving road infrastructure spending to off-budget—has
undermined FYR Macedonia’s pubic financial management system in many aspects,

including the increased risks to credible fiscal planning, efficiency of capital
expenditures, and fiscal sustainability.

MEDIUM TERM FISCAL PLANNING

6.14 The government discontinued the practice of publishing the Fiscal Strategy, a
three-year expenditure framework, in 2010 amid uncertainties in the medium-term
outlook and fiscal parameters. It was reintroduced in 2013 because of policy dialogue
under PEPBG.13 This was an important achievement with the potential of strengthening
the fiscal framework and signaling the needed fiscal consolidation plan. The benefits of
this change, however, were dissipated by persistent expansion of fiscal deficits since
2013 (figure 6.1). This has resulted in uncertainties about key parameters of the medium
term fiscal program. The removal of key infrastructure expenditures from the central
budget in 2013 also undermined its overall usefulness in establishing a credible medium
term fiscal framework.

EFFICIENCY OF PUBLIC EXPENDITURES

6.15 This evaluation finds a lack of evidence about tangible achievements in
improving the efficiency of public spending in 2012–2015. Moreover, developments in
the areas of pensions and capital expenditures have affected the quality of public
expenditures and intensified the risks to fiscal sustainability.

6.16 In the area of pensions, pension-related spending has steadily increased from 8.8
percent of GDP in 2007 to 9.6 percent in 2014. This was largely driven by ad-hoc
pension increases that were implemented in addition to the formula-based annual
indexation. The annual formula-based indexation was dropped in 2015, and the system

now depends on discretionary policy decisions. As a result, more risks to the stability in
the pension system emerged. The World Bank’s first PBG specifically addressed this area
by establishing a target value of 9 percent for pension spending in GDP. It was not
sustained because of ad-hoc increases. This evaluation finds that the increase of the
pensions share in total expenditures has not only elevated the risks to fiscal sustainability
but also negatively affected the effectiveness of public expenditures and the equity of
public resource use. Pensioners as a group are relatively well off compared to the rest of
the country, with only 14 percent of pensioners living below the poverty line, compared
to 27 percent for the total population.

6.17 Efficiency of capital expenditures has remained hampered by major shortcomings,
while the introduction of several large investment projects has created new challenges.
Most stakeholders interviewed for this evaluation shared a view that the quality of capital
expenditures has declined in recent years. Planning of investment projects is not fully
integrated with the annual budget process, while the practice of comprehensive costs-
benefit analysis is still lacking. The result has been the implementation of several
controversial large investment projects such as the Skopje’s urban beautification project
(known as Skopje-2014 project). The government created more risks to the efficiency in
public expenditures by taking out some large public investment projects from the budget
and creating disconnect between these investments and the overall fiscal framework.

Improving the Efficiency of Service Provision in the Health Sector—
Substantial
6.18 The program aimed to achieve this objective through improving procurement of
drugs and equipment and creating incentives for expanded service delivery in
underserved areas. This evaluation finds that on balance the program has substantially
achieved the objective. The unit prices of pharmaceutical and some medical equipment
have declined to a considerable extent. This, however, did not translate into actual budget
savings in 2013–2015 because of an increase in prescriptions that offset the positive
impact of unit price reduction. The new framework to rationalize service provision is
expected to direct more resources to underserved areas.

PROCUREMENT OF PHARMACEUTICAL AND MEDICAL EQUIPMENT

6.19 In the area of procurement of prescription drugs, the revision of methodology for
reference prices and publication of prices on annual basis since 2011 (the prior action)
has resulted in substantial savings of €30 million to €45 million in 2012–2014 through a
30 percent average reduction in prices. Additional savings were generated by introduction
of pooled procurement and international tendering for some pharmaceutical and medical
devices purchased by hospitals, which was a prior action for the operation. The program
aimed at a 30 percent reduction in optical medical devices, which was achieved in 2013.
More reductions occurred in 2014 and 2015. As of the date of this evaluation, the
average unit price of optical devices was 50 percent lower on average than in 2011.14 The
impact of lower unit costs on the budget savings, however, was offset by an increase in

generated. Procurement of medicine and medical devices used by hospitals remains
decentralized with possible implications for the efficiency of health expenditures.

SERVICE PROVISION IN UNDERSERVED AREAS

6.20 Throughout the 2000s, health service providers concentrated in the capital and
large urban centers. This trend was fueled by a capitation-based financing formula of
independent service providers that encouraged concentration of service providers in large
settlements. The government established the so-called Medical Network that balances the
number of service providers over the medium term across the regions (the prior action).
This action established ceilings on the number of concessions in overserved areas while
increasing the number of quotas in underserved areas. At the same time, it established
caps on the maximum number of patient per primary healthcare providers.

6.21 Positive results came from the implementation of the plan. Underserved areas
have seen an increase in service provision through new concessions issued to primary
health providers, pharmacies, and dental service providers. The government is optimistic
about the service providers’ interest in concessions in underserved areas, and the numbers
of obtained concessions are expected to increase. At the same time, the Ministry of
Health has not increased the number of concessions in overserved areas. In addition, the
government has introduced specific targeted programs such as the Rural Doctor and
Health for All programs for underserved areas. In 2014, these programs delivered health
services in 64 rural communities and served more than 5,000 patients.

Strengthening Social Protection and Inclusion—Substantial
6.22 The overall achievement of this objective is substantial. The program supported
improving effectiveness of the government’s active labor market programs and
strengthening social protection by improving the access of vulnerable groups to social
services and generating fiscal resources through better targeting to enhance financial
assistance to beneficiaries. The specific results sought by the program were achieved by
2013 as projected and were sustained throughout 2013–2015.

ACTIVE LABOR MARKET POLICIES

6.23 The program addressed the need to strengthen incentives for social safety
beneficiaries to seek employment opportunities. As a result of the revisions made in the
2012 social safety net, beneficiaries were given an opportunity to participate in active
labor market programs including public work programs, employment subsidies for firms,
training, and loans for self-employment (a prior action). These modifications were
supported by an increase in fiscal allocations to active labor policies as an important
measure at the time of economic downturn.

6.24 The number of beneficiaries of labor market programs has increased since 2012
(table 6.1). The government introduced new programs in recent years, including in
training, subsides for job creation, and conditional cash transfers for employment. The
Macedonia Employs program, one of the main vehicles of active labor market
interventions that covered 8,700 beneficiaries as of the end of 2015, was introduced in
2015 and has five different categories of interventions based on age and professional
background of recipients.

6.25 An attempt has been made to assess the effectiveness of active labor market
programs. An impact evaluation supported by the International Labour Organization
(ILO) employing a quasi-experimental method15 has found clear evidence of the
effectiveness of several interventions, such as internships, training with participant
employers, information technology (IT) training, and self-employment support
mechanism. The study has found no evidence of positive impact from wage subsidy
interventions.

SOCIAL PROTECTION

6.26 In the area of social protection, the Bank supported changes for improving access
to the services by reducing the transactions costs for applicants. As a prior action, the
government modified the system linking administrative registries of Employment Service
Agency, Pension, and Disability Insurance Fund and Social Protection to the CBMIS and
reducing the number of documents required for registration or renewal of financial
assistance through CBMIS. This step has reduced the transaction costs for applicants.
This achievement was sustained through 2013–2015.

6.27 Substantial progress is seen in the targeting of social protection. The program
supported a set of measures for improving targeting and using the saved resources for
augmenting means-tested social assistance to the most vulnerable groups (a prior action).
This policy area also has benefited from the parallel investment lending project of the
Bank in strengthening the IT system of social administration, which created mechanisms
for data exchange with other agencies, such as tax administration, Central Bank 9 (for
remittances), and the Ministry of Agriculture (agricultural subsidies). This has resulted in
a substantial improvement in targeting as thousands of noneligible households were
dropped from the system. Improved information exchange also resulted in a positive self-
selection by applicants as many noneligible applicants stopped applying for financial
assistance. Means testing was strengthened in 2014. As a result of these measures, the
overall number of beneficiary households receiving social financial assistance has
declined to 28,500 in 2015 from more than 70,000 in 2007.

6.28 Improved targeting has helped to sustain regular increases in average benefits.
The program aimed at increasing the average social financial assistance benefit by at least
5 percent in 2014, which was implemented. The government raised the average benefits
further in 2014 and 2015 by 5 and 10 percent, respectively. The freeing of resources from
improved targeting, however, has not been used to relax eligibility criteria for financial
assistance to cover more vulnerable groups marginally above the threshold. This could
have been a step forward for the social protection agenda given that one-fourth of the
country’s population, or around 150,000 households, is below the poverty line. The
government also introduced new benefits for disabled people which, while addressing
certain aspects of vulnerability, were not means-tested mechanisms of social protection.

7. Outcome Rating
7.1      The objectives of the program were substantially relevant to the country’s
priorities and the Bank’s strategies at the time the operation closed. The design of the
operation showed strengths in some areas, including health-sector reforms and the
streamlining of social protection. It did not, however, incorporate adequate measures to
ensure consistent macroeconomic framework. On balance, the relevance of design is
rated modest.

7.2    Of the three objectives envisaged, one was partly achieved, and two were
substantially achieved. The objective of improving public financial management practices
was only partly achieved as the initial clearance of existing payments arrears was
followed by a deterioration in overall PFM in the areas of capital expenditures and fiscal
                                             15


transparency. On the positive side, reforms in the health sector led to lower costs of
essential drugs and an increase of service provision in underserved areas. Similarly,
improved targeting of social protection enabled the government to increase the benefit
levels for vulnerable groups.

7.3    On balance the outcome is rated moderately satisfactory.

8. Risks to Development Outcomes
8.1    The risks to development outcomes are rated significant.

8.2    Main risks are due to the lack of a credible fiscal consolidation plan, the
government’s ambitious plans in infrastructure projects that are not supported by sound
cost-benefit considerations, pensions, and persisting shortcomings in PFM.

8.3      According to the current projections based on the fiscal consildation plan outlined
in the fiscal strategy for 2015–2017, the debt will reach 53 percent of GDP in 2019.
However, serious risks are seen in the implementation of the announced fiscal
consolidation. As past experience shows, the three-year fiscal strategy is not a credible
predictor of fiscal developments. Recent ad-hoc pension increases are yet to be reflected
in the fiscal trajectory for the medium term. The absence of a sound fiscal responsibility
framework magnifies the risks to the implementation of the government’s fiscal
conslidation plan.

8.4     The reduction of the budget deficit, even if it materializes as expected, will not be
enough to ensure fiscal sustainability as the government’s program envisages ambitious
infrastructure projects to be implemented by SOEs outside the budget. These projects will
add to the country’s indebtedness to an extent that the public debt will pass the 60 percent
debt ceiling sought by the government. The scenario that combines full implementation
of these off-budget projects and lack of fiscal consolidation may lead to unsustainable
public debt over the medium term.

8.5     In spite of reforms implemented in the treasury system, serious risks to an
efficient PFM exist due to perisistent arrears in the health sector and local governments,
large-size off-budget activities by SOEs operating with government guarantees, and the
decline in the quality of capital investments implemented through the budget.

8.6     With respect to broader economic performance, although FYR Macedonia’s
growth performance in 2013–2015 was commendable, there are risks to sustaining the
trajectory in the medium to long term. Growth has been driven largely by a combination
of FDI-led export sector that was strongly supported by generous tax expenditures given
to the “greenfield” industries and sizable construction activities funded by public debt.
There are uncertainties about long-term performance of the FDI sector as evidence
emerges that some foreign companies may leave FYR Macedonia after expriration of the
tax previligies granted by the government. As for the debt-driven domestic demand this
evaluation highlights the limits of this growth vehicle as debt-accumulation with the pace
observed in recent years would be unsustainable.

9. Bank’s Performance
Quality at Entry – Moderately Satisfactory
9.1      The operation was prepared against the background of a tense fiscal situation in
2012. Authorities were facing a large financing gap as a result of revenue
underperformance further aggrevated by weak commitnment control. This has resulted in
accumulation of arrears to an extent that the overall bisiness environemnt was
undermined. Bank’s response to support the authorities through an instrument that
provides substantially larger financing than a regular DPO was adequate. The regular
DPO of USD 50 million under preparation was converted into the second policy based
guarantee in the last quarter of 2012. The Bank worked with the government to develop a
program with relevant objetives. Most policy actions choosen by the Bank as buiding
blocks of the operation were relevant to the objective and supported important
institutional reforms. The focus on the clearance of arrears was justified from both fiscal
discipline and business environment perspectives. The tight time frame of program
preparation might have been adequate in the context of authorities’ request to finalize the
program and, subesquently, the transaction with the commercial loan before the large
bond repayment in January 2013. This urgency, however, might have imposed constraints
on the team potentially affecting the coverage of the operation.

9.2     Having said that, this evaluation finds that the conversion of the planned DPO to a
much larger guarantee operation took place without addressing substantially elevated
macro and fiscal risks. The Bank dropped the policy action in pensions initially
incorporated in proposed program due to increased risks of non-implementation as a
result of authorities’ intentions to increase pension at ad-hoc basis, an action that run
against the spirit of agreed reforms and fiscal sustainability. Additionally, Bank’s
response to some other major risks to program’s objectives that emerged during program
preparation was sometimes weak. The fact that the authorities allowed the IMF program
to expire created major risks for the conduct of macro policies, and, in this context, the
lack of operational focus in the program was a lost opportunity undermining the
effectiveness of reforms in public expenditures.

9.3     By end of 2012 evidence emerged about the scale of controversial capital
expenditures in non-productive areas and the extent of the problem of arrears
accumulation as a result of weak commitmnment controls. In addition, in November
2012, after a long preparation period, the Government signed an agreement with China
on a large loan for highway construction followed by a decision to transfer most
infrastructure spending to off-budgtet16. The risks associated with these factors were not
reflected in the program design. The team, however, proved successful in addressing
some important issues without formally incorporating reform actions in the policy matrix
inlcuding re-introduction of the medium-term fiscal planning in 2013.

Quality of Supervision—Satisfactory
9.4      Supervision was conducted through Bank staff based in the region and the
missions in March and September 2013. The supervision was mostly focused on
verifying the process of arrears clearance, which was completed in the first half of 2013.
Policy dialogue continued during the supervision, resulting in preparation and publication
of the 2014–2016 fiscal strategy at the end of 2013. Supervision benefited from parallel
activities such as preparation of the public expenditure review.

9.5    The overall Bank performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

10. Borrower’s Performance
10.1   Government performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

10.2 The government demonstrated strong ownership in specific reform actions
supported by the operation. It delivered strong results in the clearance of arrears, reforms
in health expenditures, and improved targeting in social protection. The arrears identified
under these operations (payments arrears of the central government and arrears in VAT
refunds) were cleared ahead of the timeline mostly in the first quarter of 2013. The
government’s approach to public wage restraint was also commendable. The government
continued implementation of the reforms to improve efficiency of health expenditures
beyond completion of the program, which is an indication of strong ownership. Similarly,
reforms in improving the targeting in social protection continued further in 2014–2015,
resulting in savings. As a welcome development, the medium term fiscal strategy was
reintroduced in 2013, strengthening the planning framework.

10.3 Despite these strengths in performance, weaknesses were found in the
government’s performance that did not allow the translation of important structural
reforms in improved efficiency of public expenditures. The government initiated
spending programs that jeopardized the fiscal sustainability framework and undermined
the efficiency of public resource use. Ad-hoc pension increases, large capital investments
in nonproductive areas, and large off-budget investments in roads without strong
economic rationale have substantially elevated FYR Macedonia’s indebtedness—
neutralizing the impact of the reforms implemented with operation support operation.
Fiscal consolidation has been continuously delayed in recent years, while no critical
fiscal responsibility institutions have been created. A strong pro-spending bias elevates
the risks to development outcomes.

10.4   Implementing Agency Performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

11. Monitoring and Evaluation—Substantial
11.1 Design. The indicators selected for progress monitoring were strongly linked to
the policy actions and were generally measurable and quantitative. Some of the results
indicators were output oriented but largely adequate for capturing the first round of the
effects of policy actions, and they could provide important information about the progress
in reform program. The target values established for the results indicators were adequate
                                            18


from the viewpoint of the program’s stated ambition. Required data were available from
the government’s public sources or from the relevant ministries and agencies.

11.2 Implementation. The Ministry of Finance coordinated data collection and
reporting. All indicators were reported in the ICR of the project in 2014. The choice of
the indicators allowed an update of most of the indicators with more recent data to assess
the sustainability of achieved results. The evaluation was not able to update the indicator
on payments and VAT arrears because of shortcomings in arrears reporting in the
treasury system, which did not allow verification of no payment arrears at the time of the
evaluation.

11.3 Utilization. No utilization was reported in the ICR. The evaluation notes that
respective ministries continued the monitoring of some indicators after program
completion.

12. Lessons
      PBGs can potentially be a useful instrument for supporting clients facing large
       external financing needs.
      PBGs implemented in a context of challenging macro-fiscal situation and large
       financing needs need to incorporate a consistent macro-economic framework with
       necessary macro and fiscal actions for risk mitigation.
      Positive impact of important public expenditure measures (wage control, reforms
       in health procurement, and better targeting of social protection) can be eroded if
       the program lacks an overarching fiscal and debt framework. As FYR
       Macedonia’s case illustrates, fiscal savings achieved through these important
       measures can be dissipated by introducing non-priority spending such as ad-hoc
       pension increases or controversial capital expenditures.
      Comparing the aggregate interest rate of PBG-supported debt instruments with
       counterfactual market rates may not be enough for assessing the extent of
       reduction in the borrowing costs associated with the transaction. Estimating the
       change in sovereign risk perception, although a challenging task, may give more
       accurate assessment of the impact of the program
