substantial\n            institutional development impacts, including satisfactory\n            performances by the Bank, and Borrower. Lessons address the\n            following. The delayed appreciation, and ownership of\n            reforms, somehow slowed the process. Instead, government,\n            and partners should invest in reform advocacy on a\n            continuous basis with the different stakeholders, including\n            at community levels. It is also reinforced that donor\n            coordination, a necessary input to health reform especially\n            when it involves a sector-wide approach, demands commitment\n            from partners, and management skills from the government.\n            Inconsistencies between the financial years of local, and\n            central government, requires high leadership to anticipate\n            and prepare, and as well, to negotiate an acceptable\n            compromise, while not derailing the project. Nonetheless,\n            the high coordination transactions costs translated into a\n            sharp increase in basket funding, and its efficient\n            utilization. Furthermore, reforms require new and\n            diversified skills, hence training, and continuous education\n            should become the core pillar of the reform program,\n            integrated in the resource allocation of reform. This\n            sector-wide-approach experience shows that while focusing on\n            system capacity strengthening, can be initially detrimental\n            to service delivery due to overall capacity weakness, it is\n            nonetheless a necessary step in achieving long term\n            acceptable performance of health service delivery. Lessons\n            highlight that human resources issues can only be resolved\n            by addressing the civil service as a whole (throughout all\n            ministries), because staff are employed by the public\n            sector, and there are limitations on what the sector alone\n            can accomplish."}, "docdt": "2004-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
