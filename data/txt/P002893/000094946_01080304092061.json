The lessons\n            learned from this project include: 1) A well-designed\n            conservation trust fund can provide a stable and permanent\n            source of funds for park management, applied research, and\n            community development projects. 2) The decentralized\n            decision-making process of the Mgahinga Bwindi Impenetrable\n            Forest Conservation Trust (MBIFCT) allowed for genuine\n            stakeholder participation and integrity in governance. 3)\n            The co-financing of the project's administrative\n            allowed the project to build-up its capital by reinvesting\n            its income and not depending upon the initial investment\n            income to finance the start-up of the project. 4) Dividing\n            the community development activities into distinct granting\n            phases allowed for different thematic approaches, adequate\n            preparation, and implementation time, and was consistent\n            with the absorptive capacity of recipient groups. 5) The\n            cooperation of government and nongovernmental organizations,\n            including the private sector, in an innovative partnership\n            arrangement was essential to the political neutrality and\n            longevity of the MBIFCT. 6) The clear direction set up\n            during preparation contributed to the ultimate success of\n            the project."}, "docdt": "2001-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
