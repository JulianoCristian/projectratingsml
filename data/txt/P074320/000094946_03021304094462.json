Specifically,\n            the project will: a) assist participating schools to achieve\n            basic operational level (BOL); and b) build up the capacity\n            of the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MEST)\n            to plan and manage education services. The project was\n            prepared by IDA, the African Development Bank (AfDB) and UK\n            Department for International Development (DFID). The\n            components are: 1) support to education service providers to\n            bring primary schools and Junior Secondary Schools (JSS) to\n            BOL standards by a) introduce peace education into the\n            curriculum, b) support non-formal and emergency education\n            programs, c) HIV / AIDS education prevention, d) support the\n            expansion of the Grants Program; and 2) enhance the\n            institutional capacity of the MEST by a) establishing a\n            Project Coordination Union (PCU); b) strengthening the\n            MEST's planning and management capacity; and c) support\n            the training of 80 teacher trainers who will provide\n            in-service training for unqualified teachers. The\n            Bank's role in supporting a participatory approach in\n            disarmament, reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts in\n            Sierra Leone positions this project to continue to build up\n            the education sector."}, "docdt": "2003-01-28T00:00:00Z"}
