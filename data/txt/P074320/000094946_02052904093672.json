The\n            environmental analysis concluded that there are no\n            significant environmental issues related to this project,\n            since project sites will not affect national parks, natural\n            reserves, nor cultural heritage sites, for these were\n            completely destroyed during the civil war. While the\n            findings of the EA show that the project was well conceived,\n            taking implicit consideration of environmental concerns.\n            Mitigation measures are as follows. Construction of\n            buildings will be in accordance with existing building\n            codes, i.e., adequate toilet facilities will be provided\n            with proper waste disposal systems. During construction,\n            open pits will be installed; waste disposal sites will be\n            selected; while landscaping, and vegetative propagation will\n            be undertaken following construction."}, "docdt": "2002-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
