Definitions

Basic Operational Level (BOL) is achieved in schools which have a physical structure safe for
children and teachers, which are supplied with basic furniture, a set of core textbooks for each
pupil, teaching and learning materials, where at least 50% of teachers are trained! and where there
is an adequate teacher to student ratio (e.g. one teacher per 40 students), a school management
committee (SMC) for primary schools and a Board of Governors (BOG) for junior secondary
schools (JSS).

Full Grants cover all of the Basic Operational Level (BOL) requirements defined above.
Partial Grants exclude infrastructure (construction, rehabilitation and furniture costs).
Primary completion rati (proxy: gross intake rate to last grade of primary) is defined as the total
number of pupils in the last primary grade, minus the number of repeaters, divided by the total
number of children of official entrance age to the last primary grade in the population.

    Project Development Objectives

    The objective of the project was to assist the Government of Sierra Leone (GOSL), to re-establish
    education services, and prepare the grounds for building up the sector. Specifically the project
    would: (i) assist participating schools to achieve basic operational levels (BOL), and (Ii) build up
    the capacity of Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (MEYS) to plan and manage the delivery
    of education services.

    Revised Project Development Objectives

    The project development objective was not revised.

    1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

    1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country and Sector Background: The Republic of Sierra Leone lies on the west coast of Africa,
north of the Equator. Bordered on the north and east by Guinea, on the southeast by Liberia, and
to the south by the Atlantic Ocean, Sierra Leone covers a land area of about 74,000 square
kilometers and exhibits considerable ethnic variety. Traditional African Religion and customs,
Islam, and Christianity are the three main religious practices. In 2003, following the civil war
which lasted from 1991 to January 2002, Sierra Leone had a population of 4.983 million and a per
capita income of US$149. The country ranked lowest on the United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) Human Development Index out of 179 countries in 2008. Population growth
rate was 1.8 percent in 2004, and the population between 0-14 years represented 42 percent of the
population.

Post-Independence Sierra Leone had a troubled history characterized after the war by institutional
instability and poor govemance infrastructure and practice. After witnessing economic growth
rates of nearly 4 percent per annum during the first decade after Independence in 1961, Sierra
Leone saw its economic and social condition deteriorate in the 1970s and in the first half of the
1980s; and by 1990,82 percent of the population lived below the poverty line.

The result of the civil war was a serious dislocation of the society, as large sections of the
population were traumatized and migrated both intemally and across their borders to seek refuge.
The central and local govemment systems also collapsed, leading to a disruption in the provision
of services and public safety. The existing limited services were provided by UN Agencies and
largely unregulated national and intemational Non-govemmental Organizations (NGOs) as well
as some private enterprises.

The war also brought additional burdens to an already weak education sector therefore the
education system was characterized by a number of post-conflict challenges namely:

       •   Frequent disruption of schooling due to devastated school infrastructure, displacement of
           teachers and unsafe conditions in some communities.

       •   Destruction of records on teacher numbers and deployment in the Ministry of Finance
           and Development (MOFD) and the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology
           (MEST4), as well as weak sector capacity made it difficult to reconstitute and maintain
           records as a basis for paying teacher salaries and for managing the teacher corps.
       •   Serious lack of school fumiture and teaching and leaming materials.
       •   Decreased enrollments in areas seriously affected by the war and overcrowding in many
           schools located in relatively safe areas.

     Youth and Sports (MEYS) in August 2007.
    •   Weakened administrative, pedagogical and planning capacity in the MEYS which made it
        difficult to manage the education system and to obtain required data for decision making
        and planning purposes.
    •   Poor coordination of the various initiatives among numerous development actors in the
        education sector                              .

Rationale for Bank assistance: A Bank Transitional Support Strategy (TSS) for 2002-2003 was
prepared to assist with the implementation of the Interim-Poverty Reduction Strategy (I-PRSP)
presented by the government in September 2001. The main objective of the TSS was to support
Sierra Leone's transition from post-conflict reconstruction to sustainable poverty reduction. The
first year of the TSS proposed activities to support the establishment of core services in war-
affected areas, and the second year proposed activities to support the I-PRSP development phase.
The provision of education services in rural and underserved areas was proposed as a priority in
the TSS, and seen regarded as a means of helping to mitigate against the risk of renewed conflict
and to lay the foundation for sustained poverty reduction. The Rehabilitation of the Basic
Education Project (REBEP) was one of the lending activities proposed in the TSS in FY03 to
support Sierra Leone's transition from post conflict reconstruction to sustainable development. .

The project was parallel-financed with the African Development Bank (AfDB) for a total amount
of US$ 40 million. Out of the total 14 districts in Sierra Leone, the AfDB and IDA fmanced
interventions in seven districts each. There was one .Project Coordination Unit (PCU) with staff
whose work covered all districts, and implementation arrangements were similar for the two
funding banks. Reporting by the PCU to the two financing banks however differed, as did
procurement and financial management guidelines. The U.K's Department for International
Development (DflD) took part in the preparation of the program but their assistance was not
fmalized.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The objective of the Project was to assist the Government of Sierra Leone to. re-establish
education services, and prepare the grounds for building up the education sector following the
war. Specifically, the Project was designed to: (i) assist participating schools to achieve a basic
operational level (BOL); and (ii) build up the capacity of the MEYS to plan and manage the
delivery of education services.




                                                2
    Key PD~ Indicators5 were:

       Assist participating schools to achieve basic operational levels

       •    50% of primary schools in the targeted districts meet Basic Operational Level (BOL)
       •    50% of junior secondary schools in targeted districts meet BOL
       •    70% completion rate in primary schools in targeted districts by December 31,2007
       •    20% increase in girls enrollment in primary schools in the Target Districts located in the
            Northern and the Eastern Regions by December 31, 2007 as compared to December 31,
            2001.
       •    20% increase in enrollment in junior secondary schools (JSS) in the targeted districts of
            Northern and Eastern Regions by December 31, 2007 as compared to December 31, 2001
       •    20% increase in the pass rate of students who take the Basic Education Certificate
            Examination in the Target Districts in the year 2007 as compared to the year 2001.

(i) Build up the capacity of the MEYS to plan and manage the delivery of education services
       •    A PCU within the MEYS capable of undertaking procurement and fmancial management
            of the project, technical review of grant proposals and monitoring and supervision of
            project activities
       •   An enhanc~d capacity of the MEYS to conduct: planning, monitoring and evaluation of
           education services provision, and stakeholder coordination
       •   An operational Education Management Information System (EMIS) fully integrated
           within the planning and decision-making process
       •   400 School Management Committees (SMCs) established and empowered.

The indicators that were monitored during the project are the basis for the ICR. A comparison of
PDO indicators in the Grant Agreement and PDO indicators in the Project Appraisal Document is
presented in Table 1.

Out of the six PDO indicators, two targets have been met. i.e. BOL achievement in primary and
junior secondary schools. An additional two indicators, girls' enrollment in primary and junior
secondary in targeted regions/districts have been reported as exceeding the targets of 58 percent
and 38 percent respectively. This is based on increases in the proxy of overall primary Gross
Enrollment Rate which was 89 percent in 2002 compared to the current 154.5 percent 6 in
2006/07. The overall junior secondary Gross Enrollment Rate was 23 percent in 2002 compared
to 54.5 percent in 2006/07. Targets for the remaining two indicators i.e. primary completion rate
and increases in the pass rate of students taking the BECE, were not met.

The BOL values were constructed based on the expected effect of full grant and partial grants on
the total number of schools in 20067 • According to the PAD, the number of full grants and partial
grants for each district is based on the damage index determined after the war.



6 Gross Enrollment Rates above 100 percent indicate that there are over aged pupils in schools. This was
the situation in Sierra Leone as many children whose schooling had been truncated by the war went back to
school when the war ended.

                                                   4
        The higher the damage index of the district, the more schools were constructed. Assuming that
        (i) the total number of schools in 2006/07 included all full grant and partial grant schools, and (ii)
        full grant schools benefit from all the activities defined under full grants and partial grant schools
        benefit from the activities needed for them to achieve BOL, Table 2 attempts to demonstrate the
        cumulative effect of project activities on primary schools to achieve BOL. It shows that in IDA
        districts, 41 percent of existing schools benefited from full grants and partial grants. Starting
        from a baseline for 12 percent of primary schools at BOL, it is justifiable that 55 percent of
        schools have achieved BOL. This does not take into account other interventions by the GoSL,
        development partners and NGOs to rehabilitate and construct schools, and provide other basic
        education services.

    In junior secondary schools, the available data supports the estimated end of project BOL of 60
    percent from a baseline BOL of 50 percent. The projected impacted at least 49 percent of junior
    secondary school and the starting base is 50 percent of schools. Even with attrition, it becomes
    justifiable that 60 percent of schools have reached BOL.

    The indicators monitored during the project's implementation form the basis for the discussion on
    outcome achievement. These indicators also include IDA 15 indicators for number of textbooks
    procured and distributed. The indicators related to increases in girls' enrollment in primary and
    junior secondary schools in the targeted Northern and Eastern Regions were modified with
    proxies from "increases in enrollment rates of girls to gross enrollment rates" which were
    considered by the team to be more robust indicators. The team was confident that the relevant
    data would be available to monitor the proxy indicators given the availability of improved school
    level data discovered during the preparation of the Country Status Report (CSR) and because of
    the possibility of obtaining relevant demographic data from the planned new population census.
    Although the indicator for girls enrollment rate instead of percentage of girls enrolled was not
    formalized, the proxy indicators were used to monitor implementation.

    1.3 Revised PD~ (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
    reasons/justification

    The project development objective was not revised at any time during the lifetime of the project.

    1.4 Main Beneficiaries,

    The main beneficiaries of the project included:
    Children: The principal beneficiaries of the project were the 700,000 children enrolled in basic
    education (grades 1-9) in Sierra Leone at the inception of the project who would benefit from the
    provision of the improved school environment including teaching and learning materials. Those
    who complete primary level would have better opportunity to continue to junior secondary
    schools and would increase their chances of employment. It would reduce the risks of fa1ling into
    the difficulties of child labor or being affected by other problems of the youth.



   9 Table 2 and 3 are based on SP reporting on partial grant schools which is incomplete as it does not
   capture all 1,625 partial grant primary schools. Full grant primary schools were however fully reported on.


                                                         6
Teachers: Those who benefitted from in-service teacher training programs including skills
development on peace-building and others who benefitted from relocation packages, to enable
them to resettle in their communities.

Education Sector Staff: Several central and district level education staff received capacity
building in the form of training as resource persons for the in-service teacher training programs.
They also benefitted from the provision of office equipment and vehicles such as generators,
motorbikes, computers etc. to improve their efficiency. .

Families and communities: SMCs were established and mobilized so that families and
communities could proactively participate in the management of their schools at the local level.

Civil society: The project encouraged participation of all segments of civil society during
platlliing and implementation. SMCs gave parents the opportunity to participate in school
management and decision-making. Support for the decentralization ·of MEYS encouraged the
participation of a greater number of stakeholder groups. The project empowered civil society and
stakeholders in the education sector, and contributed to strengthening their role in the govemance
of other sectors.

1.5 Original Components

The IDA project consisted of two components as follows:
Component 1:      Support to Service Providers to rehabilitate the provision of education services
                  (US$ 18 million)

This component would provide the following:
(a) Support to education service providers to bring primary and JSS to BOL standards. The
component would provide funds in the form of grants to finance approved proposals from
education service providers (SPs) to bring primary and lower secondary schools within a given
district up to the basic standards for delivering education. By the end of the project at least 50
percent of schools in project districts were expected to have met these basic standards. The
project would encourage service providers to expand coverage in underserved areas, based on
notional district allocations.

(b) Introduce peace education into the curriculum and the school environment. In addition to
bringing schools to basic levels of operation, the project would support the development of a
peace education program. The objectives of this program were to train teachers, parents and
students to engage in peace-related processes such as constructive conflict resolution, promotion
of tolerance, understanding of differences and trauma healing, in order to build a broad culture of
peace within and beyond schools. The program would develop tool-kits/manuals for teachers,
parents and students and would address curriculum materials and specific teaching and classroom
activities, as well as a broader set of issues dealing with creating a peaceful environment in
schools and the community.

(c) Support to non-formal and emergency education programs. It was estimated that as many as
500,000 children in the 10-14 year age range had missed some years of schooling because of the
war. Those children were mostly Intemally Displaced Persons (IDPs) or retumed refugees and
were over age for their academic class levels. The Complementary Rapid Education for Primary
Schools (CREPS) was initiated in 2000 to cater for the needs of these children,

                                                7
especially those who were out of school and wished to make up for lost time. The project would
support non-formal initiatives on an "as-needed basis".

Component 2: Enhanced Institutional Capacity of the MEYS;          (US$ 2.0 million)

(i) Establishment of a PCu. A small PCU would be established within the MEYS. This PCU
would have the overall responsibility of planning, coordinating and managing activities to be
funded by the project as well as provide overall technical support as required for the functioning
and institutional strengthening of the MEYS. The PCU would include a Project Director and three
key specialists: (i) National Technical Coordinator; (Ii) Partnership Coordinator; and (iii)
Capacity Building Coordinator.

(ii) Strengthening of the MEYS's capacity in planning and management. The priority units for
strengthening overall management and planning capacity at the MEYS were as follows:

    (a) Procurement unit. A procurement unit would be established under the Director-General's
    (DG) (administration) office. Technical Assistance would be provided for the duration of the
    project through the appointment of a Procurement Specialist who would be supported by a
    specialized fIrm. This unit would be responsible for all procurement matters under the current
    project.

    (b) Civil Works units. A civil works architect/engineer would be appointed to the civil works
    unit of the Planning Directorate for the duration of the project. He/She would work with other
    staff in the unit to supervise the implementation of the civil works component of the school
    grants program.

    (b) Financial Management. A fmancial management specialist backed by a specialized firm
    would be appointed to set up the required financial and accounting procedures to be used for
    this project.

    (c) Education Management Information System. The project would finance activities aimed
    at setting up an EMIS which would include data on schools, staffing and fInances.

    (d) Human Resource Management. Technical assistance, including a personnel management
    specialist, was provided for the Personnel Directorate to undertake the following tasks:

        •   clean existing registry(ies) on MEYS's personnel records and prepare a database that
            would include both civil servants and personnel under contracts (e.g.: teachers in
            government-assisted schools)
        •   overhaul rules and procedures used for the appointment/recruitment and deployment
            of existing and new personnel, particularly teachers, to expedite and ease the overall
            management process, and to ensure greater compliance with existing rules.

    (j) Training to build capacity in planning and management. Training would be provided for
         units in the relevant departments based on needs identified by individual administrative
         units, and consolidated by the capacity building coordinator.

(iii) Supporting and monitoring education service delivery. This sub-component would aim at
building capacity at the local level. First, it would support the training of an estimated 80 teacher


                                                 8
trainers who would serve as resource persons for the provision of in-service training for pupil
teachers targeted through the school grants program.

1.6 Revised Components

The project components were not revised.

1.7 Other significant changes

There were no changes in the project's design, and geographic scope and scale. However, there
were changes in the project's schedule, and funding allocation as well as a simplification of the
supervision arrangements for school construction to facilitate implementation progress as follows:

Project schedule. The closing date of the project was extended twice. The first extension was for
one year from June 30, 2008 to June 30, 2009, and the second extension was for six months to
December 31, 2009. Both extensions were done to ensure that: (1) all civil works were
completed and schools were handed over to communities; and (ii) MEYS would fully implement
the capacity building component aimed at supporting district inspectors to effectively monitor and
supervise basic services.

Funding allocations. During implementation, the Grant Agreement was revised twice to
reallocate funds among expenditure categories.

The reallocations are shown in the table below.

The reasons for the first reallocation of funds in July 2006 were specifically for goods and
consultant services categories which had been overdrawn. With respect to goods, the capacity
building at district level within the context of the ongoing decentralization efforts necessitated
additional funding. Regarding consultancies, the reallocations were made to allow IDA to finance
requirements for the EMIS and establishment of the PCU for which DfID and AfDB respectively
were committed.

According to the project document, component 2 was to be funded by DfID (45 percent), IDA (18
percent), and GoSL (one percent). A funding gap was created because the fmancing agreement
with DfID was not fmalized. The reason why DfID did not jointly fund the project is not clear but
the situation led to a funding gap ofUS$2 million if all the activities were to be implemented. IDA
also funded most ofthe cost of setting up the PCU originally to be jointly funded with AfDB mainly
because IDA activities started at least 12 months ahead of AfDB activities and the establishment of
the PCU could not be delayed.

The second reallocation of funds was made in May 2008 mainly to provide the required
strengthening and support to district education offices.

Implementation arrangements. The original implementation arrangement was that:

(i) The MEST would be responsible for overall project implementation under the guidance and
support of the Project Steering Committee (PSC) chaired by the Minister of Education. It was
expected that 60 percent of the PSC's members would be from the Government, 40 percent from
civil society and the vice-chairpersonship would rotate every year. Based on annual plans and
proposals submitted by local SPs, the PSC would approve the quantity and scope of activities that
would receive support under the Project. Eligible SPs would submit annual plans/proposals to bring
their schools up to the BOL standards to the PSC. The PSC would review proposals to ensure that
they met the agreed criteria.

(ii) The PSC would also be responsible for promoting the coordination of education sector
initiatives supported by various agencies, overseeing operational and implementation procedures,
and monitoring and evaluating project outcomes. The PSC would not be an implementing agency,
but would be supported by a PCU, which would be responsible for the coordination and
management of project implementation.

(iii) The PCU would be staffed by a core team consisting of a Project Director, technical and
partnership program coordinators (with necessary support staff) to provide program leadership in
project planning, implementation coordination, M&E and partnership program implementation. The
PCU would also include an educational plannerlEMIS specialist and a civil engineer/architect who
would be associated with their counterparts in the relevant divisions of the MEST.

(iv) A Procurement Unit, backed up by an independent audit frrm, would be established and a
fmancial management specialist provided by a professional frrm would be appointed to backstop the
finance division of the Ministry. M&E functions would largely depend on a national EMIS in the
MEST.

(iv) Three Works Management Agents (WMAs) acting as Supervising Agents (SA) in each of three
selected regions were responsible for preparing valuation certificates for work completed by
contractors, but this was not always done in a timely and organi~ed manner and therefore caused
delays in implementation. In addition, having a Supervising Agent to oversee a contractor, whose,
contractual obligations were to an SP, proved difficult to coordinate and lacked effectiveness.

Changes made during implementation

(i) At the Mid-Term Review (MTR) conducted in November 2005, it was noted that delays in civil
works implementation were in part attributable to the complex nature of implementation
arrangements involving SPs, contractors, and supervising agents/works management agents WMAs.
In a few cases, especially in Koinadugu district where the challenges were especially difficult,
WMAs with strong technical structures i.e. clerks of work, architects, engineers, etc. were
contracted directly to implement the civil works component of the project without going through
SPs. This allowed the element of flexibility necessary for completing the civil works in these
difficult areas.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Project Preparation. The project focused on the rehabilitation of the school system (grades 1-9)
and capacity building to restore management of the system to pre-war levels. The BOL standards
were used to monitor the quality of education delivered by the service providers. In the prevailing
emergency context, focusing on providing the essential requirements for bringing schools to the
basic operational level would ensure that affordable solutions for schooling were provided to a
substantial proportion of children. By choosing this approach, the project provided a solid basis
for the education system to evolve in the future. Furthermore, this strategy enabled the country to
make rapid progress towards the achievement of some of the more quantitative EFA goals
(universal completion of primary education by 2015 and elimination of a gender gap in primary
and·secondary education by 2005).

The project preparation was participatory and involved and supported existing school service
providers (NGOS, community based groups) to: (a) upgrade their current levels of provision of
services to meet the aforementioned standards, and (b) to expand the provision of services to
underserved areas. Based on annual plans prepared with the participation of NGOs, district
councils, chiefdom authorities, and CBOs, .and approved by the MEYS and Project Steering
Committee, the project supported the provision of education inputs necessary to meet the basic
operational level criteria.

Project Design. The project objectives were clear and suitable to the country context at the time.
There was little option after the war but to bring schools up to the basic operating levels (BOL).
The effort needed to achieve this goal was however substantial and challenged the capacity of the
central and local governments as well as some NGOs whose capacity had been seriously eroded
during the war. To address this challenge the government mobilized international and local NGOs
perceived to have capacity to implement the project activities. Many of these NGOs had been
providing services in the country during the war.

These SPs acted as service providers and supervised the contractors engaged to carry-out· the
rehabilitation and construction work. The approach was to invite these SPslO to submit proposals
voluntarily for a variety of tasks. These proposals were examined by a Steering Committee and
once approved they would be executed in a clear and robust technical and fiduciary management
framework that would ensure quality as well as protection for the government and beneficiaries
in the event of default. Consequently there were some mis-starts with non-performing SPs or
NGOs and the supervision of the grants implementation did not work as well as expected leading
to some modifications of implementation arrangements after the MTR. The government was able
to minimize loss by executing performance bonds and the supervision mechanism was modified
to improve its effectiveness. In sum this was a high-'risk high-payoff operation which worked
reasonably well.

Decision Meeting of the SL REBEP, May 9, 2002)

The project components were also appropriate for meeting the project objectives. The
combination of a safe environment and furnished school structure, minimum proportion of trained
teachers, adequate supply of textbooks and school management committees are essential for
obtaining good quality education. Despite the capacity challenges, the design was based on
focusing on the key areas necessary for managing the system, such as teacher trainers to support
untrained teachers in the field, in-service training which incorporated peace education as an
integral part of the curriculum, capacity strengthening for district inspectors and quality assurance
officers· who would support and monitor SMCs, sector planners and associated EMlS specialists,
as well as fiduciary management professionals. Substantial training was also provided for all key
players involved with the project including SPs, contractors and education staff at district and
central levels. The project design incorporated mechanisms successfully tested in several other
countries such as Vietnam, Cambodia, and East Timor, and incorporated lessons learned from
previous Bank-assisted projects in the education sector of these countries and in Sierra Leone.

Soundness of Background Analysis. The Government was fully committed to the program and
carried out detailed analysis of the sector and country situations with the help of the Bank and·
other partners as a basis for project preparation. This included an education sector review
published in 2001 and a National School Survey Report, 2001. The latter included a damage
index for districts which was used to determine the priorities for project interventions.

Quality at Entry!.

The project's overall quality at entry received a "Satisfactory" rating from the Quality Assurance
Group (QAG). This rating was based on Highly Satisfactory ratings for Strategic Relevance and
Approach and Satisfactory ratings for all other rating categories.

QAG remarked that:
      "This is a well designed, ful1y satisfactory project with a number of outstanding features
      that are best practice. The Task Team did a good and patient job of refming and simplifying
      the project design until it seemed to "fit" with the circumstances and capacities of this post-
      conflict society. The decision to work with the missionary and NGO providers that deliver
      85 percent of the primary education service in Sierra Leone was a strategically pragmatic
      one, and built upon the earlier pilot work in Moyamba District. Relevant Bank experience
      in other post-conflict settings also was well drawn upon by the task team designing the
      project.
      The clarity and realism of the Development Objectives were particularly well formed and
      articulated. The Task Team is also to be congratulated for the introduction of a "Peace
      Education" component, the outcome of which will obviously only be able to be assessed
      much later. The Task Team also deserves credit for good use of resources in terms of
      generating important background and baseline information.
      The project was carefully and patiently designed to meet the most essential needs in a
      sector with very weak capacity, and in the context of a post-conflict society which has
      demonstrated extremely poor fiscal management capacity. The high quality of the strategic
      relevance of the project's design, and the technical quality of the project are the particularly
      strong points of the operation."
The quality at entry was positively influenced by the use of the Bank's experience in scaling up
provision of education services to meet the needs of underserved children in a short period of
time drawing from lessons learned in India and Bangladesh. In addition, the Bank expanded its

                                                 12
support for a participatory approach to the disarmament, reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts
in Sierra Leone to the education sector through the design of the REBEP. The Bank also used its
key role in donor coordination to further strengthen multi-donor collaboration in the education
sector and through this leveraged resources from the AfDB, United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) and United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), to support the
education sector in Sierra Leone.

In retrospect, the fully satisfactory assessment by QAG seems rather generous given the
experience during implementation. For example, while in principle the decision to use NGOs or
Service Providers for implementation was a good one, there was an under assessment of the risks
associated with working with NGOs that could not have been screened and in relying entirely on
a weak commercial banking system following a war to help compensate for failure. The
challenges associated with school construction in difficult areas were also not sufficiently taken
into account. Both of these factors significantly delayed implementation and could have been
foreseen.

Lessons of Earlier Operations taken into Account.

• To increase project ownership, create sustainability and facilitate implementation, and
improve monitoring and evaluation, project management needs to be undertaken by the direct
beneficiary. Accordingly, the project had the MEYSas the implementation agency, and a PCU
was established in the ministry to provide technical support for the MEYS efforts.

• To overcome procurement and financial management problems encountered in the past, the
project design had given priority to the creation of an oversight body, the Project Steering
Committee, with a 40/60 percent representation from private and public sector institutions in
order to improve transparency and governance, as well as creating a direct link between project
actions and education policies.

• Support to existing agencies involved in the provision of services, and direct support to
schools had proven to be successful in Cambodia. The School Grants Program was designed
taking into consideration lessons learned from the School Grants Program in the Cambodia
Education Quality Improvement Project.

• Creating a sense of community and reestablishing ownership and trust have been important
elements of success of education projects in post-conflict environments. In El Salvador, the
EDUCO program where the schools were directly managed by the community was successful.
Building on this experience, the project emphasized the establishment and support to the SMCs.

Risk Assessment. The overall risk rating of the project in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD)
was substantial. This does not seem to be consistent with the ratings for the individual risks
unless some weighting was applied to the assessment that is not evident in the PAD. Of the nine
risks listed, only three were rated substantial risks, while five were rated modest and one,
negligible. The overall risk rating in the PAD related to the PDOs could be inferred as modest
since two of the four risks were rated modest while one was rated substantial and the other
negligible. Three of the five risks related to outputs were rated modest and the other two
substantial suggesting an overall risk rating of modest for this category of risks. These risk
ratings appear to be unrealistic and optimistic given the objectives of the project in such a
difficult context.


                                               13
           The overall risk rating of "Substantial" is closer to the ICR rating of High for the project. The
           high risk rating is justified on the basis of the comments shown in the table below. The ICR rated
           four of the nine identified risks as high (none was rated high in the PAD). In addition, two risks
           that materialized that should have been considered high are also rated high by the ICR. These are.
           related to difficulties in getting counterpart funds and under assessment of the difficulties in
           constructing schools in certain areas and related higher costs and delays in putting in place
           appropriate procurement measures to deal with limited interest in competing for contracts in these
           areas. Both of these significantly affected implementation progress and threatened achievement of
           the PDOs. These risks could also have been foreseen given the precarious fiscal situation in the
           country following the war and the poor infrastructure in some areas worsenend by war damage.

           Adequacy of participatory processes. Both the preparation and implementation of the project
           were highly participatory. The participation of NGOs, and community-based groups in the
           delivery of education services in Sierra Leone was remarkable. Project preparation activities were
           done in a highly participatory way. Funded through the PHRD the partnership program for
           education was developed, with participation of the religious missions, NGOs, Teachers Union,
           Teacher Colleges and donors, UN agencies (including UNAMSIL, UNICEF, OCHA), NRC, Plan
           International, NaCSA (formerly NCRRR). Equally, the school survey and the social assessment
           were conducted with participation of the above organizations, under the lead of the Central
           Statistics Office. Based on the partnership established to mobilize the participation of all
           stakeholders, the planning of the project was done in consultation and with active participation of
           all involved in the delivery of education services

           Adequacy of government commitment. At the time of project preparation, the government had
           demonstrated a high level of commitment to the objectives of the project. For example, during
           preparation, the GOSL had defined education as a priority sector to achieve its development
           goals, and had clearly demanded the Bank's assistance in doing so. The government had
           identified education as a key sector to re-establish normalcy in the country, and in the peace
           building process. The Ministry of Education was fully supportive of the approach taken in this
           project, and had initiated the process for establishing a PCu. A project preparation team formed
           with key MEYS staff, and in collaboration with representation of all sector stakeholders worked
           on preparing the different components of the project. The project director was appointed before
           the Board, date, and fmancial management and procurement staff were already recruited. They
           played an active part in the launch seminar, providing important guidance to service providers
           regarding procurement procedures and financial management and reporting of expenditures.

                                                            16
Despite the challenges, the Government was also anxious to ensure nationwide coverage of the
project to help maintain the peace and to promote increased regional integration in the post-war
period. Another indicator of government commitment was that the education sector enjoyed 31
percent 12 of government revenues; higher than recommended within the FTI framework. The
Government also agreed to provide about 5 percent of project funds despite the precarious fiscal
situation following the war.

2.2 Implementation

The project faced several challenges during the implementation period, as shown below:

Factors outside government control or implementation agency

(i) The months leading to the Presidential and Parliamentary elections in August, 2007 and
the change in administration eroded much of the implementation time as sector heads
changed, and there were delays in decision making.
(ii) There was significant and unexpected price escalation related to construction which
eventually led to a re-evaluation of construction costs and consequently a reduction in the number
of schools from the targeted 500 Schools to the 240 actually completed and handed over to
communities.
(iii) The lack of capacity of local contractors was the single most difficult issue in civil works
implementation. Many contractors lacked the capacity and management skills required in spite of
undergoing several training programs organized by the peu. For example, many contractors were
bidding low for civil works without knowing the actual quantities and cost of materials. The high
turnover of contractors employed was a reflection of their inadequate financial and technical
capacities. This situation led to re-launching new bids, which further delayed implementation,
and increased the cost of civil works.

(iv)Difficult access to remote school communities. Due to the destruction of bridges and roads
during the civil war that ended in 2002 difficult access to remote school communities was a
major hurdle for civil works in those communities. Difficult access was further compounded by
the six-month rainy season making roads impassable. At least 90 percent of contractors were
based in Freetown and access to the sites, most of which were outside Freetown proved to be
difficult. and A number of contractors failed to execute their contracts in a timely manner and had
to be terminated. These terminated contracts were re-awarded although there were some
difficulties in retrieving mobilization funds and funds on bid securities. It was observed during
project implementation that contractors who resided in districts lacked the key requirements for
participating in project contracts. For example, some contractors lacked proper financial
statements and audited accounts, record of technical competence, and access to credit lines which
were some of the key requirements for bidding in the Bank projects.

 (v) Lack of capacity of SPs and high rate of staff turnover. In the initial stages of the project,
 many SPs did not have adequate capacity in terms of civil works, procurement, disbursement, and
 contract management. As a result, for almost two years a great deal of training was provided to
 build their capacity on various aspects of the project, and this process delayed implementation. In
 addition, the high rate of turnover of the staff of the SPs after receiving training, and the need to
 train the new SP staff over and over again also affected the pace of implementation.

 (vi)Lack of demandfrom districts to submit proposals as Service Providers. The empowetment
 of local councils in 2005, made it even more appropriate for districts to submit proposals as
 service providers. By the MTR in 2005 however, it was observed that most contracts in IDA
 districts had been awarded and there remained little implementation opportunity for districts.

 Factors subject to government control or implementation agency

 (i) Delays in counterpart funding. As the issue of counterpart funding was a systemic problem in
 Sierra Leone, the project also continued to face severe problems in accessing counterpart funds.
 For example, in 2008 the project did not receive any counterpart funding until September.

 (ii) Delays in replenishment offunds. There were regular delays in the replenishment of project
 funds on the part of the MOFD. These delays in replenishment requests resulted in the pev
 resorting to costly overdraft facilities on its counterpart account in order to ensure smooth
 implementation of project activities.

 (iii) Challenges of contract management: Initially, the three WMAs acting as Supervising Agents
 in each of three selected regions were responsible for preparing valuation certificates for work
 completed by contractors. This was not always done in a timely and organised manner and as
 such caused delays in implementation. Furthermore, none of SAs performed their responsibility.
 of day-to-day supervision satisfactorily. The required technical staff (e.g. clerks of works), were
 not put in place to ensure quality and standards until much later during implementation. In
 addition, the process of having a Supervising Agent overseeing a contractor who had contractual
 obligations with an SP proved difficult to coordinate and lacked effectiveness in some cases.

 (v) Difficulties were experienced by the PCU in getting commercial banks to honor their
 obligations for advance guarantees and performance bonds issued to SPs and contractors.
 In .addition, some bid securities, performance bonds and even advance payment guarantees of
 defaulting contractors 13 could not be cashed, either because they had expired before the SPs tried
 to cash them or because the banks refused to make good the guarantees. Some banks claimed that
 the signatures on the guarantees were not authorized by their management.

. (vi) Inaction on the part of certain service providers to terminate contracts promptly when
  contractors did not perform as expected, caused much delay in school construction and
  rehabilitation. In addition, it took a while for the peu to hire the requisite number of civil
  engineers, quantity surveyors and architects for a functioning civil works unit which would take a
  more active supervisory role in the construction and rehabilitation works.



 13 Defaults comprised less than 1% of funding for school grants. MEYS and MOFD follow up with
 defaulting SPs and commercial banks have yielded significant results with some SPs and commercial banks
 paying up.

Midterm Review. Based on the MTR fmdings, project indicators and performance targets were
reviewed and proposals for revisions were made. The reasons for the suggested revisions of the
PD~ indicators were explained in section 1.2. With regard to the output targets the main reason
for the proposed revisions of the targets was to make the targets more realistic given higher than
expected inflation and to separate the IDA targets from the program targets which combined
AfDB and DflD targets. These targets were however not formally revised as the government did
not request the revisions as had been agreed during the MTR.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Monitoring and evaluation design. A baseline survey was conducted in 2002 during project
preparation, fmanced by a Policy and Human Resource Development (PHRD) grant, which was
useful for project preparation, especially in terms of providing details on the enrollment rates,
number of schools to be rehabilitated and constructed, and identification of catchment areas. This
survey also provided the basis for allocating partnership grants as well as detailed indicators to
monitor the performance of the operation. However, at the time of project preparation, the MEYS
had lacked the capacity for effective data collection. As mentioned in Section 2.2, at the time of
the MTR proposals for revising the original performance indicators were made to make them
more realistic and achievable.

The indicators for monitoring the PDOs for the IDA portion of the project were stated in the GA
and in the PAD. Given the implementation environment, the indicators were too focused on
outcome or higher level indicators which were difficult to monitor because of lack of consistent
data. The first indicator for monitoring progress in meeting the PDOs was directly related to
achievement of the BOL in 50 percent of primary schools in project districts. This seems to be
both ambitious and ambiguous given that in each district only a small proportion of schools were
supported and it was unlikely that the interventions in these schools affected the operational
levels of non-project schools in the same district.

Secondly, the BOL concept whle a good idea, is a loaded concept, sometimes beyond the scope
of the project e.g.an adequate teacher to student ratio is beyond the control of the project. The
target for the second indicator was an increase of 20 percentage points from 50 percent to 70
percent in the completion rate for all primary schools in project districts. Similar to the first
indicator, it is uncertain how all schools in the district would benefit from project intervention if
only a proportion were included in the project.

 The third and fourth indicators relate to increases in enrollment for girls in the primary cycle and
for all in junior secondary education the targeted districts. The concerns raised above regarding
the possible impact of interventions in a few schools on non-project schools also apply in this
case. The target for the fifth indicator was a 20 percentage point increase in pass rates in the
BECE. This seems rather ambitious given the time needed to put in place the project
interventions that would allow a positive impact on pupil performance in examinations.
Secondly, pass rate for BECE are not standardized and generally restricted by the number of
junior secondary school places. A 20 percentage point increase in examinations performance also
seems unrealistic 14 •

M&E implementation and utilization.

The project allocated resources to set up an EMIS within the MEST. The proposed EMIS was to
have up-to-date school-based, staff and financial data. The project was to finance four Annual
School Surveys which would provide an essential part of the information to be integrated in the
EMIS system. By project completion the EMIS had been established but was not fully functional.
As at the time of the ICR, although there were plans to recruit a director for the EMIS, no one had
been recruited yet, due to lack of qualified candidates. The contract of the international
consultant recruited for the EMIS expired before he fmished his mandate. Although DIS renewed
his contract and was ready to provide the funding, the Ministry did not wish for the consultant to
continue to work on the assignment. Thus the EMIS effort was stalled. The most recent data
available on enrollment by class are in 2003/04 and the most recent data on teachers are in
2000/01. Detailed enrollment data have been collected for the 2007/08 academic year but MEST
did not have capacity to input the data electronically. The lack of education statistics makes
monitoring project outcomes and critical education sector indicators impossible, such as primary
school completion rate, pupil teacher ratio and percent of qualified teachers. At the time of ICR
Mission, however, a Director of Planning and a Statistician was in the process of being recruited
with funding from the Education Sector Support Fund.

It must however be mentioned, that the inability to measure project impact as planned should not
be read as the project not having made any contribution to the development of the sector and the
peace effort. This weakness could be attributed to the very difficult post-war environment in
which the project was designed and implemented.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

There were no significant deviations or waivers from the Bank safeguards and fiduciary policies
and procedures during the implementation of the project.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Following the project's implementation, procurement and financial management activities have
been mainstreamed in the MEYS.The relevant units have taken over the procurement and
financial management under the follow-up EFA FTI project which is mainstreamed.
Rehabilitation and construction of schools, procurement of teaching· and learning materials and
other key activities will coptinue to be supported under the EFA FTI project and it would take a
while for the education budget to fully take over these activities because of budget constraints.

(a) Transition arrangements. Experience gained during implementation of the REBEP
facilitated the Republic of Sierra Leone's acceptance to Education For All- Fast Track Initiative
(EFA-FTI) Catalytic Funds when it received a grant ofUS$13.9 million to fund priority activities.
An education sector group was created to coordinate activities related to meeting the objectives of
the education sector strategy and ensuring effective use of grant funds to meet agreed targets.

In addition, discussion is also ongoing regarding analytical work that would form the basis for a
post-basic education project in the medium term.

      •   Technical/Institutional. The MEYS recruited a procurement specialist who is being
          trained by the Bank's procurement specialist and the PCU's procurement specialist.
          The Ministry has also recruited a chief accountant working on budget and financial
          management issues. Further, local councils have developed adequate capacity for civil
          works management.

      •   Financial. The MEYS is planning for and providing adequate reSources for procuring
          text books and maintenance of school structures. The MEYS is also applying for
          $559,000 from the Education Program Development Fund (EPDF) to support capacity
          building for the education sector.

      •   Staffing. The 19 local councils will be using their budgets to maintain the primary and
          junior secondary schools pI:ovided for their districts.

Monitoring and evaluation. With the recruitment of the Director for Planning and a Statistician,
the M&E system has been initiated. Under the current EFA FTI project, the Education Sector
Group will be responsible for monitoring the indicators. Despite the capacity issues, continued
implementation of the EMIS started under the project will be financed under the Education Sector
Support Fund (ESSF). It will be important to conduct an impact evaluation after two years of
project closing in order to assess the impact of the project on reading skills and learning
achievements of children in primary and junior secondary schools.

Recommendation for any follow-up project. This project has laid a very strong foundation for
further development of the education system in Sierra Leone. The Government is already
building on the positive outcomes through further investment in the sector fmanced through the
ongoing EFA-FTI project and ESSF; to further expand provision of quality basic education. In
this context further efforts are being made to strengthen the capacity of the MEYS and of local
government authorities who are responsible for implementation of the FTI program.

Now that the main foundations for the development of basic education have been laid, the
 Government is also keen to embark on further development of post-basic education, including
 skills development, to support the diversification of the economy and to promote economic
 growth. To ensure that the gains made in the basic education sector are not eroded, support under
the EFA FTI has been secured in a follow-up education project. The IFC and AfDB have
expressed interest in also supporting the post-basic/technical vocational sub-sector. Preliminary
discussions along these lines have begun between the Government and the Bank and active
preparation of a post-basic operation is expected to start soon.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The objective of the project was· and is still important to the country's social and economic
development. It was also timely and appropriate to the post-conflict priorities of Sierra Leone.
The number of schools constructed and rehabilitated, and the inputs in terms of textbooks and
teacher training have gone a long way in lifting the educational system from the level it was in
Sierra Leone soon after the war, to its current levels. In addition, the project was consistent with
the World Bank's country assistance strategy (CAS) in that it focused on the lack of adequate
inputs at the school level and insufficient planning, management and implementation capacity at
all levels. Bank support was further built on the REBEP by undertaking an Education Country
Status Report (CSR) in FY06. The outcome of this analysis was used to guide the sector-wide
strategy and to provide a framework for development partners' support.                    However,
implementation was constrained by limited in-country capacity and an overly complex
implementation structure.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Moderately Satisfactory. The project was moderately successful in achieving its development
objectives. It assisted in improving school operations in terms of: (i) construction and
rehabilitation of schools; (ii) providing textbooks and learning materials to pupils; (iii) offering
training and teaching materials to teachers; and (iv) creating and resourcing SMCs. However,
verification of data with respect to the BOL is limited due to capacity constraints within the
MEYS to collect and maintain comprehensive school data.

The highlights ofthe project's achievements are given in the following Table:

The project development objective was relevant to the country conditions and government
priorities at appraisal. Assisting the country to re-establish education services, and preparing the
grounds for building up the education sector was exactly what was needed after the war. This
was not only to improve access to education, but also to bring normalcy into the provision of
basic education. Peace building was a key theme in teacher training materials and the main
objective ofthe Bank's Transitional Support Strategy (TSS) for 2002-2003 in the first year was to
support the establishment of core services in war-affected areas.
The project also addressed existing sector constraints such as serious lack of furniture and
teaching and learning materials, devastated school infrastructure, and decreased eurollment. The
partial grants aspect of the project benefited more schools than was targeted. The project also
supported the Interrim Poverty Reduction Strategy (I-PRSP) objective to reduce poverty by
providing more schools in districts with higher damage index. The Unit cost of providing a
student with classroom space, water well, and VIP latrines were estimated at a reasonable cost of
less thatnUS$15 per annum (Ref. Annex 3: Economic and Financial Analysis).
The details of the project's major outcomes and achievements are as follows:

Objective: Achieving Basic Operating Level of Primary and Junior Secondary Schools

Achievement of this PDO is moderately satisfactory.

Based on infonnation available at the time·of project closing, the target of 50 percent of primary
schools meeting BOL in targeted districts had been reached. Likewise, 60 percent of junior
secondary schools had met BOL in targeted districts, meeting the End of Project (EOP) target.
Completion rate for primary enrolment in target districts increased to 65 percent but fell short of
the target of 70 percent. Progress in reaching the enrollment targets for girls' in primary schools
and for JSS in the Northern and Eastern regions could not be assessed as the data for these
districts could not be disaggregated. Pass rate in the BECE increased by 8 percentage points from
64 percent to 72 percent less than half of the planned 20 point increase.

By project completion, 100 percent of planned primary and junior secondary schools were
constructed and rehabilitated. This represents 984 primary classrooms (164 primary schools)
constructed and 168 primary classrooms (28 primary schools) rehabilitated. For junior secondary
schools, this represents 129 junior secondary classrooms (43 JSS) constructed and 15 junior
secondary classrooms (5 JSS) rehabilitated. The first schools were completed in Kambia district
in 2006.

Other achievements of the project include:

(a)   Infrastructure andfurniture:

At project closure, 240 schools in the seven Bank-supported districts were handed over to
communities. These schools have all-season functioning classrooms; a chair and a desk for every
pupil, and for every teacher.

                                                   23
(b) Pupils and learning materials:
A total of 1.92 miHion textbooks were received and distributed by SPs to the beneficiary schools
in the seven IDA districts l5 • This represents 100 percent of targeted procurement and distribution
of textbooks.
All the full grant and partial grant schools achieved the 1: 1 primary pupil/text book ratio in the
four core textbooks of Core textbooks include Mathematics, English, Science and Social Studies.
Additional partial grant of 421 schools were also supplied with the books.
About 40 percent of partial grant schools attained the 1: 1 ratio, while the rest achieved a 3: 1
pupil: textbook ratio16 or less. On the whole, 1,119 primary schools in the seven IDA districts
were supplied with books.

(c) SMCs
The creation of SMCs and their effective functioning in the management of schools was a major
contribution of the project. In the seven IDA districts, 192 SMCs were established and resourced.
The number of SMCs trained and resourced fell short of the Development Grant Agreement
(DGA) target of250 SMCs due mainly to funding constraints.

Further, the participants of the Stakeholder workshop conducted in May 2010 acknowledged that
the participating schools had made conscious efforts to achieve the Basic Operational level as
defined by the project document. At least 80 percent of beneficiaries surveyed were satisfied
with BOL achievement.

At least 92 percent of beneficiaries surveyed were satisfied with the quantity of core primary and
JSS textbooks delivered to participating schools, 95 percent of beneficiaries surveyed were
satisfied with teacher training provided and 92 percent of beneficiaries surveyed were satisfied
with SMC training,

Objective: Strengthening Institutional Capacity at Central and Local Levels

Achievement ofthis objective is moderately satisfactory.

The project helped to re-orient the MEYS to its core business of ensuring the provision· of
education services. The project helped to focus the attention of the MEYS on providing schools,
training staff, procurement and distributing textbooks and to a limited extent, collecting education
data to enhance planning and management of education delivery. The project was also
instrumental in providing a focal point for development partner coordination and engagement.
Implementing the project empowered the MEYS to also engage with the Local Councils in the
delivery of education services. Prior to the project's implementation, it was a challenge for
MEYS staff to even visit the districts. Project implementation facilitated site visits to almost
every school location and facilitated normalcy of operations.

The project was designed for Service Providers or NGOs to provide basic education services in
areas where they were already engaged. It thereby built on systems that had been put in place
during the war and also provided the MEYS the much needed space to focus on strategy and
build its capacity to provide leadership in the sector.

Enhancing the Institutional Capacity ofMEYS by:

•   Establishing a well functioning PCU, the MEYS recruited a Project Director~ National
    Technical Coordinator, Partnership Coordinator, and Capacity Building Coordinator.

•   Supporting and monitoring education service delivery through the training of all seven
    district inspectors and SMCs. In order to train other teachers under the teacher in-service
    training program, 80 teacher trainers received training. The teacher training sub-component
    was outsourced to UNICEF to take advantage of their experience in teacher in-service
    training in Sierra Leone.

•   Training staff of MEYS in areas such as financial management, procurement and project
    management increased their skills and capacities. However, there was a high tum-over of
    counterparts trained as they moved on to better paying jobs. The flight of professionals during
    the war led to serious competition for the few qualified people who stayed in the country to
    fill key positions.

•   The PSC was set up to approve all proposals and allocate funding. The Rehabilitation of
    Basic Education Project referred to locally as SABABU also issued regular newsletters and
    disseminated information on fundallocateion to each district and provided implementation
    updates.

•   HR management was to have been funded with additional funding from DfiD which was not
    fmalized before the project was implemented~ However, in a pooled funding arrangement
    under the ESSF, DfiD funded a teacher verification exercise to the tune of £750,000.

PCU:

The PCU was able to:

•   conduct procurement and fmancial management activities of the project in a satisfactory
    manner

•   undertake quality technical review of grant proposals for the approval of the PSC

•   attract the relevant staff to monitor project activities, including architects, engineers, and
    quantity surveyors, as well as a capacity building coordinator, and partnership coordinator.
    The number of untrained teachers trained and schools rehabilitated/constructed was
    monitored regularly by these technical staff.




                                               25
Teacher In-service Training:

•   3,337 teachers received in-service training, comprising 2,737 primary school teachers and
    600 Junior Secondary teachers. This is less than the planned 10,000 but exceeded the
    proposed revised targets that were never finalized. However, anecdotal evidence indicates
    that the project has been effective in improvirig the quality and quantity of teachers in the
    classrooms, reducing overall pupil-teacher ratio 17, increasing confidence of untrained and
    unqualified (UU) teachers in their professional practice, and bringing younger people into the
    teaching profession.

SPs and contractors:

•   The capacity of many SPs and contractors has been strengthened as a result of their active
    involvement with the projeCt's implementation. For example, by working with multilateral
    organizations such as the World Bank and the AIDB and through the training programs
    organized, SPs improved their capacity and skills in areas· including procurement, fmancial
    management, and contract management.

Training ofSMCs:

•   SPs in 14 districts organized training for their SMCs, and most SMCs trained received their
    maintenance grant of Le280,000.00 provided in kind, to enable them to generate income to
    procure tools and necessary equipment for cottage industry activities e.g. soap making,
    gardening, cash crop cultivation, etc.

Grants:

•   192 primary schools have implemented full grants in IDA districts, compared to the target of
    250, and 2,670 primary schools have implemented partial grants in IDA districts exceeding
    the target of 1,625, by the end of the project. Likewise, 48 junior secondary schools have
    implemented full grants in the IDA districts; compared to the target of 50, and 486 JSSs have
    implemented partial grants in IDA districts by.the end of the project, exceeding the target of
    225. The project made every effort to spread the benefits of partial grants as widely as
    possible exceeding the target and achieving some quick wins. The ratio of unit costs per
    textbooks to construction per pupil was on average 1:7.5 i.e. for each dollar spent on
    textbooks per pupil, an additional US$6.5 is required to provide classroom space and
    furniture per pupil (Ref. Annex3: Economic and Financial Analysis).

NGOs:

•   The SMC training manuals developed under the project are being used by the NGOs to train
    SMCs in school management.                    .

District Level Capacity:

•   The supervision capacity at the district level has also been strengthened by the provision of
    vehicles, motorbikes and equipment including generators under the project.


17 Some the newly rehabilitated Iconstructed schools however attracted more pupils leading to higher
enrollm.ents and increased pupil-teacher ratio.

                                                   26
EMIS -Annual School Census:

•   Although the project was unable to establish a functioning and sustainable EMIS, the first
    EMIS school census conducted in 2006/2007 provided some school level data/information.
    This data was not enough for the overall planning of the MEYS and the tracking of key
    indicators for the project but the results of EMIS did inform the design of the EF A FTI
    Catalytic Grant implementation. Further, based on the census, it was estimated that there
    were about l.3 million children enrolled in 5,016 primary schools, 249,000 pupils enrolled
    424 junior secondary schools, and 60,329 pupils enrolled in 112 senior secondary schools.
    Gross enrolment rates stood at 154.5 percent for primary, 54.5 percent at junior secondary,
    and 21.2 percent at senior secondary levels.

•   A second EMIS census was been conducted but data entry had not yet been analyzed due to
    the capacity constraints described earlier.

•   In addition, participants of the Stakeholder workshop conducted in May 2010 have
    highlighted that the initiative to build capacity in the MEYS and other institutions and to plan
    and manage the delivery of education services had unquestionably raised the capacity of these
    institutions to become more responsive and effective in their functions. They also confirmed
    that the quality of the SMCs by measure of their operational capacity is much improved.

3.3 Efficiency

The project was implemented with modest efficiency. Under the IDA grants, a total of 240
schools (1,025 classrooms), water wells, and VIP latrine structures were built, costing less than
US$15 per year to provide a student with a classroom space within a permanent building. This
was assessed by the economic analysis to be very reasonable cost. Also presented in Table 6 of
the economic analysis (Annex 3), the prices of textbooks procured by the project were lower for
most of textbooks than the prices used by MEYS. This is a good indication that the project
procured textbooks with relatively higher efficiency. Based on the post project survey, above 95
percent of stakeholderslbeneficiaries indicated that they were satisfied with school construction.
In addition, there may be significant social returns given the project's contribution to restoring
normalcy and peace building which are difficult to measure.

In summary, the project partially met the original targets. This seems largely due to the fact that
the unit cost of most of project components had increased between appraisal and implementation.
While UNICEF promptly revised the project target before taking on teacher training activities,
most of other targets were not revised down based on increased costs. Thus the proportion of
targets met by the project must be put into a proper context. Given the limited resources allocated,
the great damage sustained by the prolonged war and the weak implementation capacity in the
country, on hindsight, the project design may have been more ambitious and more complicated
than the country's capacity could handle. With these caveats, the project has accomplished a great
deal under the circumstances.




                                                27
A more detailed survey on infrastructure from a district where the infrastructure was completed
four years ago, provides a window of opportunity to evaluate the sustainability of the project.
Based on the survey results, about one third of infrastructures were not current with their
maintenance needs while two thirds are still in good condition. This illustrates the critical
importance of continued support of the government and/or donors to maintain infrastructure at
functional levels after the project completion. Textbook distribution was a success. The quantity
of textbooks procured was about 10 percent over the project target, at a cost of no higher than
textbooks procured by MEST, and more than 90 percent of books were distributed.

The actual need of the country was far greater than what has been accomplished by the project.
Capacity building in MEST needs serious attention to ensure continued and successful reforms in
the education sector in the post war Sierra Leone. For the next project, more rigorous criteria
should be set up to monitor the quality and the maintenance of the rehabilitation projects. It was
evident that great capacity had been built by this project in procurement and project
implementation. Such capacity should be utilized and strengthened continuously in the next
project.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Overall the project achieved the following:
   • Set up a functioning PCU that oversaw the day-to-day project implementation activities
        and ensured that the World Bank's fiduciary requirements were maintained
   • Constructed schools in some of the most remote areas ofthe country
   • Builtthe capacity of local contractors to undertake major civil works
   • Achieved comparable efficiency in the procurement of textbooks at lower unit costs
        compared to textbooks procured outside the project
   • Trained teachers, including peace building to support the stability achieved after the war
   • Trained SMCs and supported them to participate in school management and record
        keeping

Alternatively,
    • Could not train the targeted number of teachers due to increased unit costs
    • Could not sustain the Education Management Information System due to capacity
        constraints

Based on this summary and the discussion given above, the overall outcome is rated as
Moderately Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)   Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
In the short term, during the construction and rehabilitation of schools, the project was
instrumental in generating employment opportunities for residents of various communities,
thereby contributing to poverty alleviation. In the long term, the benefits of education would have
a strong influence in terms of improved skills and capacity, and higher incomes for community
members that would contribute to reducing poverty and promoting social development. The
project has also contributed to improving the enrollment rate of girls in schools, especially in
districts where girls did not have access to schools.

                                               28
(b)       Institutional Change/Strengthening

The project resulted in substantial development impact on the following as confirmed at the
stakeholders' workshop:

      •    MEYS
      •    Capacity of SPs and contractors
      •    SMCs
      •    District level capacity

For details, see Section 3.2

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

Positive
      •    The project succeeded in setting comprehensive standards for school construction, such as
           storage space for textbooks, head teachers' office, separate toilets for boys and girls, and
           water wells in every school. These standards including architectural plans are now being used
           by the MEYS and other SPs.
      •    Location of schools in remote areas has created an impact, as children do not have to
           travel long distances to take public examinations, as exam c,enters located in JSSs are
           now closer to their villages. Under the project, almost every chiefdom benefited from
           school construction and rehabilitation.
      •    Having more schools provided in a relatively equitable fashion has resulted in uniting
           communities.
      •    The Project created public awareness on the importance and value of education
      •    The establishment of SMCs' proved to be of great value as schools management
           instiutions at the community level. The Manual prepared on the roles and responsibilities
           of SMCs has helped SMCs to discharge their duties more effectively.
      •    During the course of implementation, local councils began to playa major role in the
           education sector in many communities.
      •    There is a likelihood of making the PSC, after some changes in membership, a statutory
           committee to monitor all education projects. As its capacity has been strengthened, it is in
           a better position to evaluate the capacity of SPs and contractors.

Negative
There was no unexpected negative impact of the project.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

A Stakeholders' Workshop was held from May 6-7, 2010. The opening ceremony was chaired by
the Deputy Minister of Education II and opened by the Deputy Minister of Education I. . The
Minister of Education also gave a speech on the second day of the workshop. Participants
included senior staff of MEYS, staff of DEOs, paramount chiefs, Members of Parliament, PSC
members, service providers, principalslhead teachers, contractors, councilors, PCU coordinators,
World Bank and AtDB personnel. A beneficiary survey was administered after the workshop.


                                                   29
The Workshop focused on the objectives of the project vis-a.-vis its achievements, lessons learnt,
and recommendations for future projects. The presentations focused on the objectives, design
and implementation arrangements against the achievements of the project. Thereafter,
stakeholders were required to asses project outcomes based on their own experiences. In order to
capture differences in experiences and outcomes between regions, there was group work for
participants according to regions (north, east, west and south) Discussion and feedback from the
group work was presented in plenary sessions.

The Participants were unanimous in emphasizing that the project was timely and that its
achievements had gone a long way in satisfying the objectives. On the partnership school grant
program, participants confirmed that: school structures had been constructed/rehabilitated at the
agreed locations, but a few of the schools had not received the required quantity of furniture;
textbooks had been distributed to project supported schools to reach the pupiVtextbook ratio of .
1: 1; other schools not initially identified for project support had also benefited from the supply of
textbooks; SMCs and teachers had been trained as indicated by the project. Regarding the
capacity building component, the satisfaction level was slightly lower because the beneficiaries
were of the view that more could have been done and in a more timely manner.

The Participants agreed that the project's implementation had faced challenges, given that it came
immediately after the civil conflict when supporting structures were not in place. Participants
thought that more sensitization could have been done to help resolve some of the misconceptions
among stakeholders. It was noted that issues such as continuity of teacher training, SMC training,
and maintenance of structures needed to be discussed and addressed. They stressed the need for a
follow-up project of a similar nature and scope.

During the Stakeholder Workshop, Eighty (80) participants responded to a beneficiary survey on
their level of satisfaction with the project. Respondents were made up of beneficiaries such as
DEOs, headteachers and principals of schools, Local Councilors and other officials, Paramount
Chiefs, Parliamentarians, SMC members, members of the media etc. The Beneficiaries
acknowledged that: (i) collectively, the participating schools had made conscious efforts to
achieve the Basic Operational Level as defined by the project document. At least 80 percent of
beneficiaries surveyed were satisfied with BOL achievement. At least 92 percent of beneficiaries
surveyed were satisfied with the quantity of core primary and JSS textbooks delivered to
participating schools, 95 percent of beneficiaries surveyed were satisfied with teacher training
provided and 92 percent of beneficiaries surveyed were satisfied with SMC training,

The Deputy Directors of Education, in charge of the DEOs responded to specific qu~stions on the
capacity building activities of the project relating to their offices. The level of satisfaction of the
DEOs was lower, compared to the satisfaction of beneficiaries of the construction, rehabilitation,
teacher training, textbooks etc. Only 9 percent were satisfied with office space which was not
surprising since the project did not provide any office space. Sixty four (64) percent of the
directors were satisfied with the provision of equipment, computers and printers; 64 percent were
satisfied with stationery; and 60 percent were satisfied with the operational budget provided.
Only 47 percent were satisfied with generators; 27 percent with motor vehicles; and 17 percent
with motorbikes provided. The reason for lower satisfaction of DEOs may be attributed to higher
expectations than what was planned by the project, and also the delay in implementing the
capacity building activities as the Capacity Coordinator was recruited late in the project
implementation.




                                                 30
Lessons from Stakeholder Workshop
The group work during the Stakeholder Workshop outlined what participants believed were the
lessons leamed. Below are some of the lessons from the Stakeholder Workshop:

Revelance/DesignIMonitoring
    •   The project came at the right time after the war and deprived districts were given the
        opportunity to have schools. (Moyamba)
    •   Inflation was a factor that negatively affected number of schools provided, teachers
        trained etc. There was the need to factor inflation in subsequent projects (Pujehun).
    •   When stakeholders were involved in project design there was a better understanding of
        the project and implementation was facilitated. In addition, activity reports should be
        shared with all stakeholders (Kono district).

Teaching and Learning
   •    Providing sets of teaching and leaming materials facilitated teaching and leaming
        because children whose parents could not provide textbooks benefited (KonolPujehun).

Training/Capacity Strengthening
   •    A credible system of selecting teacher trainees should be put in place for subsequent
        teacher training (General)
   •    When DEOs and UU teachers are capactitated/trained, they perform better (Kono district)
   •    Trainers perdiem etc. should be the same across districts and not different for different
        training providers. This will help improve motivation to participate in the training (Kono
        district).
   •    SMCs participation in school activities is necessary for effective and quality education
        provision

Disbursement/Procurement
   •    Timely disbursement of funds for project activities would speed up project
        implementation (Westem Rural)
   •    Some contractors lacked requisite capacity therefore, in subsequent projects contractors
        should be more carefully selected (Moyamba district)
   •    The Procurement process was new to stakeholders and caused delays in submission of
        reports. Subsequent projects must take the time it takes for stakeholders to be trained into
        account (Kono district).

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

The risk to development outcome of the REBEP was substantial. The rating on risk to
development outcome was justified by a number of risk factors that each had the likelihood to
occurrand erode some of the impact on outcomes.

The first risk factor was related to sustainability of the facilities, materials, and training provided.
Schools have been constructed /rehabilitated and handed over to Local Councils which are
mandated to provide basic education. If these schools for e.g. are not maintained, they would not
last very long. Textbook maintenance and continued training wass also important to safeguard
the gains made under the project. Some textbooks which were not for sale have been retrieved
from the open market in spot checks by the MEYS. These efforts must be sustained to ensure
that textbooks are not diverted from schools. If the interest and commitment levels of teachers
are not sustained, and their skills are not improved with refresher courses, they are likely to lose
whatever skills they have received over a period of time. In addition, failure on the part of the
MEYSlLocal Councils to recruit teachers of the right caliber, and put'more teachers on the pay
roll, would endanger the quality of education in the schools. Towards the end of the project some
of the water pumps on the wells provided had been removed! stolen and had to be replaced before
the schools were handed over to the communities. It is important that communities continue to
receive education that these facilities are their's and they must take care of them. If Local
Councils do not provide adequate budget for the purpose of maintenance, training, the facilities
provided will be at risk and teacher training gains will be lost.

The second risk factor is related to the selection of schools for rehabilitation and construction
which under the project was a modest risk. Selection of sites was based on 'need', as determined
by the damage index. In the follow-up EFA FTI project, selection of sites for rehabilitation and
construction was done by Local Council authorities who selected schools which had been
selected under the REBEP but did not benefit because of increased unit cost. The number of
schools to be constructed/rehabilitated under the EFA FTI project is significantly smaller but it is
important to continue to base selection of schools sites for rehabilitation/construction on the basis
of priority criteria to reduce the potential of eroding the credibility of the process of selection for
intervention instituted under the REBEP.

Finally, is the issue of data collection activities to support policy decision making such as
selecting schools to be supported. The Education Management Information System (EMlS) was
not functional at the end of project implementation. There is the need to address the capacity
issues associated with the EMlS in a more sustainable manner and to ensure that EMlS is
continuously resourced under the education budget. At project closing in December, 2009, the
GoSL had committed some funds to the EMlS but this was not considered adequate by the EMlS
unit.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a)   Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

As mentioned in Section 2.1, QAG gave a satisfactory rating to the project's quality at entry.
According to the ICR team, the Bank's performance in the identification, preparation, and
appraisal of the project was overall satisfactory although there were some issues especially with
regard to reviewing the indicators. During preparation and appraisal, the Bank took into account
the adequacy of project design and major relevant aspects, such as technical, financial, economic,
and institutional, including procurement and fmancial management. Major risk factors and
lessons learned from earlier projects in the social sector were considered and incorporated into the
project design.

The task team used a PHRD grant of $468,000 to fill the most critical holes left by a decade of
war: for example, it conducted a comprehensive census of schools, enrollment, teachers, and
other material inputs, such as textbooks. It applied the Bank's experiences in: (a) the post-conflict
situations of Vietnam, Cambodia, and East Timor; (b) India and Bangladesh in scaling up
services quickly to serve underserved populations; and (c) El Salvador with the EDUCO program
that depended on schools directly managed by the community.

Project preparation was carried out with an adequate number of specialists on social science,
capacity building, M&E, and EMIS, who provided the technical skill mix necessary to address
sector concerns and a good project design. In the complex environment in which the project was
prepared and negotiated, the Country Director, Country Program Manager and Country Program
Coordinator played key roles in supporting the Task Team.

The Bank provided adequate resources in terms of staff weeks and dollar amounts to ensure
quality preparation and appraisal work. The project was consistent with the TSS and government
priorities in the sector at the time. The Bank enjoyed a consistently good working relationship
with the Borrower during preparation and appraisal.

(b)   Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank's performance during the implementation of the project was satisfactory. This was a
project' designed and implemented in a challenging and dynamic socio-economic environment.
The post war ,situation, a change in government. administration, a commission of enquiry for all
donor funded projects, escalating prices of goods and services which affected the quantum of
activities, and the handing over of basic schools to Local Councils during the project's
implementation all took careful consideration and management to ensure that these factors did not
become overly detrimental to the project's implementation. These factors did not affect the task
team's focus on the project's development impact, and the team was flexible in adapting to the
situations· as they emerged. The Bank allocated sufficient budget and staff resources, and the
project was adequately supervised and closely monitored.



                                                33
The task team regularly prepared Aide-Memoires, alerted the government and PCU about issues
identified during project execution and facilitated prompt action to resolve these issues. The
Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) realistically rated the performance of the project both in
terms of achievement of development objectives and project implementation. The task team
carried out a Mid-Term Review in November 2005. Based on the recommendations of the MTR,
measures were taken to ensure improvement in implementation performance.

The Bank however, could have worked harder in getting the GoSL to formally request a review
of the project targets. The Bank should have ensured that proposed revisions to the indicators to
make them more realistic were finalized, and that the project was restructured for these
adjustments especially since this issue had been identified at MTR.

The task team monitored safeguards and fiduciary compliances. Bank's procurement and
financial management staff worked with the PCU staff to explain the guidelines and procedures to
be applied during project implementation. This is with regard to procurement of goods and works,
and selection of consultants, accounts and audits, based on the Grant Agreement. In the final 18
months of project implementation, the Bank hired procurement and fmancial management
specialists located in Sierra Leone. Hiring relevant staff led to more focused capacity
strengthening and assistance for procurement and financial management staff both in the MEYS
and PCU. In March 2009, a detailed review of the financial management arrangements for the
project was conducted to ascertain assurances on the continuing adequacy or otherwise of the
financial management arrangements and whether they met the Bank's minimum requirements.
The review covered the key fmancial sub systems such as (i) budgeting, (ii) accounting, (iii)
internal controls, (iv) funds flow processes, (v) fmaricial reporting, (vi) information systems, (vii)
external auditing, and (viii) a review of a sample of transactions.

Harmonization of IDA and AIDB operations was achieved at various levels. For example, the
Bank's task team conducted joint supervision missions with the AIDB at least once a year.

(b)   Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Based on the Bank performance during lending phase and sup~rvision as discussed above, overall
Bank Performance is rated as Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a)   Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The government consistently maintained its commitment throughout implementation. The
government officials worked closely with the Bank's project team on a continual basis, and
cooperated fully with the task team. Appropriate levels of review and approval were usually in
place; fmancial accountability and follow-up was observed, and expenditures were duly
authorized before they were incurred; and documentation was maintained properly for periodic
review.



                                                34
On the other hand, as discussed earlier, the government did not formally request the revisions
to indicators/targets agreed during the MTR. Further, the project also suffered from
counterpart funding problems, although this was a systemic problem in Sierra Leone not limited
to this project. However, the government had managed to pay a significant amount of counterpart
funding and to clear the arrears though belatedly.

(b)   Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The PCU was effective in carrying out all aspects of project management, such as financial
management, procurement arrangements, reporting activities, and disbursements:

Financial Management Review. The fmancial management system including accounting,
controls,auditing and reporting was adequate and satisfied the Bank's financial management
requirements. All FMRs reviewed were submitted mostly in a timely fashion and found to be
satisfactory. The financial audit reports were also received on time and the opinions in the
Management Letters were "unqualified" in regard to the project's fmancial statements.

Procurement Arrangements. Procurement of all works, goods and technical services under the
project followed the Procurement Guidelines "Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits".
Procurement audit conducted in 2004 and 2009 showed that there were no compliance issues.

Reporting Arrangements. The PCU submitted all required quarterly and annual reports more or
less in a timely manner. These reports were informative, and provided valuable information on
the progress of project activities. The status of performance indicators were incorporated in all
progress reports and served as valuable input to Bank supervision mission reports.

(c)   Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

In the light of the Government and PCU performance as discussed above, the overall performance
of the Borrower was satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

       •   A thorough analysis of the capacity of contractors to undertake the civil works prior to
           the commencement of implementation should be done as part of the procurement process.
           This would prevent the situation where contracts are terminated before the contract is
           completed.
       •   Every effort should be made to use appropriate criteria for engaging local contractors to
           increase their participation in project implementation, especially in the implementation of
           civils works.
       •   Considering the situation in the country after the civil war, the concept of using the SPs
           for implementing the project was an appropriate and relevant approach. As the SPs were
           in a position to access the war-affected areas, they were in a unique position to execute
           the project activities. However, the capacity of these SPs also needed to be continually
           assessed even during implementation as there was significant staff turnover.

                                                35
      •    SPs and contractors need to be continually trained in construction and project
           management before the commencement of civil works and also during implementation.
           This means that SPs and contractor training should be adequately budgeted for. It is also
           important to put in place an effective mechanism for monitoring the performance of
           contractors by the SPs, and likewise, a similar mechanism for monitoring the
           performance ofthe SPs by the PCU.
      •    The approach to teacher training stlOuld be more systemmatic and comprehensive and
           aimed at improving the entire teacher training system including recruitment,
           deployment, incentives and supervision. Frequent teacher training training programs
           should be conducted for untrained and unqualified teachers in order to refill gaps in
           teaching staff due to attrition and exits. In order to attract qualified teachers to work in
           rural and remote areas, the provision of accommodation for teachers in rural areas should
           be considered.
      •    Trainers should undertake regular follow-up on trainees after training and give
           feedback to the MEYS. They should also participate in the mentoring of the
           untrained and unqualified teachers.
      •    When a project such as the REBEP is funded by two multilateral organizations like the
           World Bank and the AfDB, it is important to have a harmonized set of guidelines and
          procedures on fiduciary aspects e.g. procurement and financial management for both
           funding organizations. This way, duplication of efforts can be avoided and the
           implementation can be better harmonized and effective.
      •    While putting together the team of consultants for the project, it would be useful where
           possible, for these consultants to become part of the project preparation itself, so that their
          valuable experience can contribute to the project design and preparation. In such a case,
          they would also be able to better appreciate various aspects of the project's design.
      •   A strategy to maintain project staff after project closing especially in the Sierra Leone
          environment where the capacity needed to be strengthened and sustained is necessary
           during project preparatory stages. Especially given that capacity strengthening can
          usually be expected to go beyond the short term project implementation period.
      •   It is importance to include indicators that can be met and are also measurable. Since
          a CSR was prepared at the initial stage of project implementation, it was possible to
          include baseline values for most of the indicators. However, CSRs are time
          consuming and labor intensive activities .and it is difficult to replicate the data
          produced in those reports.
      •   Ambitious targets are always hard to measure and more so indicators in a post -
          conflict and capacity constrained environment. The Project delivered many key
          inputs into the education system. Unfortunately the focus of the indicators seemed to
          be on outcomes which are difficult to meet during the relatively short implementation
          period. It is important that projects implemented in a challenging environment such
          as this also rely on input and output indicators.
      •   Setting up a functioning Education Management Information System (EMIS) takes
          much longer than project term (usually 5 years) and in an environment where
          technical EMIS staff are difficult to attract it is important to have a funding support
          for the EMIS which overlaps project funding. This will ensure that EMIS can be
          resourced for as long as it is necessary and beyond the project life-span

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

 The project was prepared immediately after the civil war, therefore statistical information was
 sparse. Given the available information, the PAD articulated the rationale and the great needs in
 rehabilitating basic education and skill trainings, as well as the vision for the basic education
 sector after the civil war, but did not calculate the NPV of the project. However, it would have
 been difficult to articulate NPV and economic rate of return for an education project even in the
 best circumstances since return to education sector investment is very long-term and the its
 impact on employment and economy is difficult to capture in its totality. Therefore, this section
 focuses mostly on the implementation of the project based on its measurable outputs and
 outcomes. Table 1 gives a summary of the project components and resources allocated to each
.component and the following sections examine each component in details.

Component A: Emergency response to rehabilitate the provision of school services
(IDA $18 million, AtDB $18 million)

Infrastructure and furniture

After 10 years of civil war Sierra Leone education sector infrastructure was severely debilitated.
The IDA Basic Education Rehabilitation Project focused on reconstruction and rehabilitation of
school infrastructure in seven out of 14 districts while the AfDB project supported the
infrastructure in the remaining 7 districts. Based on the National School Survey Report, at the
time of the commencement of the REBEP, only 13 percent of classrooms were in usable
conditions.
The project allocated 90 percent of its resources to infrastructure rehabilitation and rebuilding,
setting a goal of helping at least 50 percent of schools in every district to meet the BOL standards,

                                                40
giving full grants to 500 and partial grants to 650 primary schools. 19 This goal proved to be
difficult to achieve given the total amount of US$36 million allocated by IDA/AIDB, the dire
needs of school infrastructure and the country's capacity to build.

This section evaluates the outputs of IDA districts in detail, including infrastructure, school
furniture, textbooks, and support to School Management Committees. As presented in Table 2,
while the project did not meet targets for most of components, the target for textbook distribution
was met.

Of the total $18 million spent, the IDA REBEP rehabilitated and rebuilt 192 primary schools,
benefiting 32,680 primary and 8,320 JSS students, assuming that on average each classroom
provide space for 40 students (Tables 3 and 4). Although it is impossible to assign precisely the
rate of return to the US$18 million invested in the school infrastructure, both private and social
return to education is high for developing countries. According to Bloom, Canning, and Chan
(2005), Sub-Saharan Africa's production level is 23 percent below its production possibility
frontier because of a shortfall in human capital. Psacharopoulos and Patrinos (2004) estimated
that the worldwide average social rate of return to primary education was 18.9 percent while the
private return was 26.6 percent. This is also consistent with the results based on Ghana 1992
Living Standards Survey, which demonstrated 8.5 percent social return and 27.7 percent of
private return to primary education.

Assuming a six percent of capital depreciation and a lifespan of 20 years for a newly
rehabilitated/rebuilt classroom, the average cost of housing a student in a safe studying
environment is less than US$15 per year. In short, the private and social return to the US$18
million is significant. In addition to classrooms, the project also provided VIP sanitation and
drinking water sources to all IDA project schools. It should be noted that the IDA project was

least 50%) of minimally trained teachers, with the recommended maximum student-teacher ratio of 40 to 1;
(iii) a core set of textbooks for every child; and (iv) a functioning school support structure, in the fonn of an
SMC.

at the inception of the project.

It should be pointed out that while the US$18 million investment yielded significant benefits, the
education sector infrastructure has much greater needs. The IDA project contributed to the
improvement of eight percent of primary and 22 percent of JSS schools. The actual need of the
country is far greater than what has been accomplished by the project. It is estimated that as of
2004, 60 percent of primary schools and 40 percent of secondary schools needed major
rehabilitation or reconstruction (World Bank 2007). The IDA and AtDB Basic Education

                                                  42
Rehabilitation project are the only large scale projects that improve school infrastructure, thus
leaving approximately 50 percent of primary schools and 20 percent of JSS schools still in need
of rehabilitation and/or reconstruction.

Textbooks and SMC grants
While the number of textbooks distributed at primary education level exceeded the project target
by about 10 percent, the grant distributed to number of SMC is far less than the projected targeted
600 (Table 5). This, however, is due to the fact that only 291 schools were reconstructed or
rehabilitated. Based on the project design, it aimed at establishing an SMC in every
reconstructed/rehabilitated school. Therefore, the SMC grant distribution is consistent with the
project design. The number of textbooks distributed at the JSS level also exceeded the project
target by 16 percent.

To determine the efficiency of textbooks procurement, the unit cost of the textbooks procured by
the project can be compared with the unit costs of textbooks procured by the MEST. However, a
word of caution is warranted for sUGh a comparison. The price of textbooks vary based on the
quantity procured, thus the unit cost between the project and the MEST is not directly comparable
since they procured different quantities. Additionally, some prices from METS were in Leone
tenns while the project used $US as its currency of calculation, thus the exchange rate added
another uncertainty to the price comparability. Consequently, the comparison of the unit costs
between that of the project and that of the MEST is only indicative. As presented in Table 6, the
prices of textbooks procured by the project are lower for most of textbooks than the prices used
by METS. This is a good indication that the project procured textbooks with relatively high
efficiency.

The project allocated resources to set up an EMIS within the MEST. The proposed EMIS was
supposed to have up-to-date school-based and staff-based data and financial data. The project was
to finance four Annual School Surveys which would provide an essential part of the information
to be integrated in the EMIS system. At the close of the project, the EMIS was not functioning
effectively. The Bank ICR mission was informed that no qualified director had been recruited for
the EMIS due to lack of qualified candidates and the contract of the international consultant
recruited for the EMIS expired before he finished his mandate. Although UIS renewed his
contract and was ready to provide the funding, the Ministry did not wish for the consultant to
continue to work on the assignment. Thus the EMIS effort was stalled and all that was left of the
EMIS was a room of computer equipment.

At the time ofICR mission, however, the new Director of Planning at METS was looking into the
issue and intended to restart the project. The statistical capacity in the METS appears to be low.
The most recent data available on enrollment by class are for 2003/04 and the most recent data on
teachers are for 2000101. Detailed enrollment data had been collected for the 2007108 academic
year but MEST did not have capacity to input the data into the computer. Such lack of education
statistics makes monitoring project outcomes and critical education sector indicators impossible,
for instance, primary school completion rate, pupil Iteacher ratio and percent of qualified teachers.

The teacher training component was undertaken by UNICEF. Before taking on the assignment
UNICEF indicated that the available funds allocated by the PAD would not train the 10,000
required. The numbers were discussed, agreed and reduced to 2,000 primary and 600 JSS
teachers, and supplementary training for 1547 primary school teachers who had already received
initial three week training (MOU with UNICEF). The total number of teachers trained was above
the revised target.

Stakeholderlbeneficiary Satisfaction Survey
A survey questionnaire at the project closing workshop was circulated among stakeholders and
beneficiaries to rate their degrees of satisfaction (Highly satisfied, Satisfied, Moderately satisfied,
Moderately unsatisfied, Unsatisfied, and Highly unsatisfied) to various project subcomponents.
Summarizing the fITst three responses as "Satisfied" and the last three responses as "Unsatisfied",
Figure 1 demonstrate that satisfaction rate is extremely high for school constructions, above 95
percent. By comparison, satisfactions on schools furniture are relatively low at 80 percent, which
is still a very high satisfaction rate. Satisfaction rates for textbook distributions, teacher· training
and SMC training are also very high, above 90 percent.

A more detailed survey was also conducted at the project closing workshop for all stakeholders to
verify the infrastructure provided by the project. So far, only Kambia district returned the survey
questionnaire. Kambia was the first district where the project was implemented and all
infrastructure was completed about four years ago. Therefore its results give a great opportunity
to assess the sustain ability of the infrastructure built by the project. All 31 schools (26 primary
and 5 JSS) contracted by the project are built in the said locations to the contract specifications in
terms of the number of infrastructure. However, while two thirds of school buildings (20 schools)
are still in good condition after four years, one third of schools (11 schools) need repairs,

                                                             46
including cracked walls, potholed/coarse floors, leaking ceilings, and coarse blackboards that
consume too much chalk. Of a total of 31 water wells built by the IDA grant, six are incomplete
or not functioning. The experience of Kambia reveals that it is imperative to continue
maintenance efforts particularly after project is ended.

A survey was also conducted among District Education Office staff on the satisfaction rate of
capacity building. As illustrated in Figure 2, the satisfaction rates are low for most of components,
except for stationary, equipment and operational budget.

Conclusions
In summary, the project partially met most of its original targets. This seems largely due to the
fact that the unit cost of most of project components had increased between appraisal and
implementation. While UNICEF promptly revised the project target before taking on teacher
training activities, most of other targets were not revised down based on increased cost. Thus the
proportion of targets met by the project must be put into a proper context. Given the limited
resources allocated, the great damage sustained by the prolonged war and the weak
implementation capacity in the country, on hindsight, the project design might have been rather
ambitious and more complicated than the country's capacity could handle. With these caveats, the
project has accomplished a great deal under the circumstances. With respect to the IDA grants, a
total of240 schools (1,025 classrooms), water wells, and VIP latrine structures were built, costing
less than $15 per year to provide a student with a classroom space within a permanent building.
This should be a very reasonable cost. Based on the post project survey, above 95 percent
stakeholderslbenefidaries indicated that they were satisfied with school construction.

A more detailed survey on infrastructures from a district where the infrastructure was completed
four years ago provides a window of opportunity to evaluate the sustainability of the project.
Based on the survey results, about one third of infrastructure were in need of maintenance while
two thirds are still in good condition. Thispoints to the critical importance of continued support
from the government and/or donors to maintaining functional infrastructure after the project.

                                                       47
Textbook distribution was a success. The quantity of textbooks procured was about 10 percent
over the project target, at a cost of no higher than textbooks procured by MEST, and more than 90
percent of books were distributed.

The actual need of the country is far greater than what has been accomplished by the project.
Capacity building in METS needs serious attention to ensure continued and successful
reforms/rehabilitations in education sector in the post war Sierra Leone. For the next project,
more rigorous criteria should be set up to monitor the quality and the maintenance of the
rehabilitation projects. It is evident that great capacity has been built by this project on
procurement and project implementation. Such capacity should be utilized and strengthened
continuously in the next project.

1.0   BACKGROUND

1.1   The Consequences ofthe Rebel War
      In the early 1990s the onset of the ten-year rebel war in Sierra Leone adversely
      devastated physical structures and significantly eroded the very foundation of the
      human resource base in the country. Accounts on the negative effects of war the
      show a wide-range of consequences on virtually every layer of the Sierra Leone
      society (Banja Tejan-Sie II, 1998, Manyeh, 1998, M'Carthy et. aI., 1999,
      Harleston, 2000, Waritay, 2001). For example, the research study by M'Carthy et.
      al. (1999) revealed destructive consequences on education in the country which
      included the following:
       a) lack of furniture, inadequate materials and equipment, shortage of qualified
            teachers, overcrowding in schools, many traumatized children, lack of
            parental support, and late payment of teachers salaries;
       b) teachers and pupils displaced and abducted; some raped and maimed; and
          others inflicted with gun-shot wounds;
       c) teacher and pupils depopulated in some areas and overcrowded in new areas
          of settlement;
       d) teacher performance level before the war was comparatively good in the
          urban schools but plunged downwards after the 25 th May, 1997 invasion;
       e) primary school teachers could not complete the prescribed work in the
          teaching syllabus for a variety of reason;
       f) pupils experienced loss of materials of which 60.9% could not be replaced;
       g) teacher attendance rate during the war dropped from 63% to 38%; and
       h) pupils manifested attitudes of worry about the future (34.5%), loss of interest
          in school work (27.5%) and a feeling of fear and anxiety (22.8%).
1.2   Justifications for the Sababu Education Project (SEP)
      In complementing the research findings of M'Carthy et. ai. (1999), Harleston
      (2000) asserted that the rebel war led to vandalization of property and significant
      destruction of "private and public buildings including schools and colleges, health
      facilities and community centres, roads, bridges, water and electricity supply"
      (p.1l).
      Moreover, Manyeh and Gibril (2010) underscored the significant role of findings
      from the Needs Assessment Survey conducted in the year 2005 and which
      confirmed among other things the justifications for the Sababu Education Project.
      Among the problems identified were untrained, under trained and inadequate
      school staff; inadequate office furniture and equipment; lack of secretarial
      services in most District Education offices, (DEOs); insufficient supply of
      stationery; no storage space, power supply and imprest to run offices; and
      running cost or maintenance vote for vehicles, motor bikes, generators and
      general office equipment.

2.0      THE SABABU EDUCATION PROJECT (SEP)

1.1      Establishment and Commencement of the Project

         Manyeh and Gibril (2010) mentioned that the SEP was a "post-conflict
         emergency response project" necessitated by the downward and sluggish trend
         that the system of education particularl6' at the basic education sub-sector was
         experiencing. Officially launched on 24t April, 2003 in Freetown it started in the
         Kambia District in November, 2003. The project had the unfortunate experience
         of an unreconcilable nomenclature whereby for the African Development Bank
         (ADB), it is the "Rehabilitation of Basic and Non-formal Education and
         Vocational Skills Training Project" and "Rehabilitation of Basic Education
         Project" for the World Bank (IDA). Once known as the REBEP Project in Sierra
         Leone, it became known later as the SABABU Education Project (SEP) for
         ideological and customary significance in the country.

2.2      Goals and Objectives

          The primary objective of the SEP was to resuscitate the basic education sector
          (primary and junior secondary school level) and to assist the Government of
          Sierra Leone (GoSL) to re-establish basic education services so severely
        . destroyed during the rebel war, and to prepare the ground for building the
          education sector.

         The specific objectives are to:

         a) achieve Basic Operational Level (BOL) for schools participating              III   the
            project,
         b) rehabilitate/reconstruct and equip vocational skills training centres, and
         c) enhance the Ministry of Education's capacity for quality and efficient
            education service delivery.

2.3      Specific Components and Activities

2.3.1    Bank Participation

         The SEP contains specific components and activities with corresponding key
         performance indicators against which its success' or failure could be evaluated
         (Table1.) The table shows the components of the SEP as identified by the ADB
         and the WB. For example, the ADB identified rehabilitation and training
         activities, strengthening of       institutions capacity building and project
         management. On the other hand, the World Bank identified enhancing the
         institutional capacity of the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports and
         improving school service delivery.

2.3.2   Project Activities

        Project activities ranged from strengthening District Education Offices to
        rehabilitating and constructing Primary, Junior Secondary Schools and Technical
        Vocational Centres, teacher training for untrained and unqualified (UU) teachers
        in the Primary Schools and the Junior Secondary Schools; supply of school and
        office furniture; and training of Ministry of Education staff to improve their
        knowledge and skills accordingly. In addition, the activities included establishing
        an Education Management Information System (EMIS) database and to equip
        Technical and Vocational Skills Training Centres (VSTC).

2.5. Revision of Project Expectations

        Funds available under the Project were estimated to meet only between 20% and
        30% of the needs at the Basic Education Level. In the course of implementation,
        it was realized that the quantitative targets needed to be revised to reflect


                                              56
                    increases in prices that had occurred since project conception and inception. The
                    previous quantitative targets have since been revised as follows:

                    •         Provide full grant to 265 Primary Schools and 97 Junior Secondary Schools.
                    •         Provide partial grant to 944 Primary and Junior Secondary Schools.

3.0      END-OF -PROJECT STAKEHOLDERS WORKSHOP

3.1      The Programme of Activities

         Theoretically, the life span of the SEP has come to an end and the need to
         determine its success or failure was necessary. The two day (6 th and i h May,
         2010) end-of-project stakeholders workshop was organized "". to identify and
         catalogue the achievements of the project and evaluate them against the desired
         objectives given the environment within which the project was implemented."
         The workshop programme is in Appendix 1 and all details on its activities are
         contained in Appendices 2 and 3.

3.1.1    Opening Ceremony

      a) Remarks by Chairpersons and Statements by Repesentatives

         Following Christian and Muslim prayers said by eminent religious leaders on both
         occasions, chairpersons were introduced to direct and manage the programme of
         activities. Highlights of their remarks and statements by representatives included
         the following:

         •   Some SEP schools were not easily accessible
         •   Mechanism be put in place to secure and maintain the SEP facilities
         •   The SEP should be extended to other chiefdoms not covered by SEP
         •   The location and continuity of the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) should be
             addressed
         •   Staff quarters should be built in the compound of participating schools
         • . Additional JSS and technical vocational centres should be built and equipped.
         •   The SEP was a success given the prevailing circumstances in the country
         •   Consideration should be given to the nature of the terrain in financing future
             projects

3.2.1     Presentations

      The following presentations were made :

         •   Project design and objectives by Mr. Salieu M. Kamara
         •   Summary of achievements by Mrs. Yvonne Gibril

   Design and Objectives of SEP

        On the design and objectives of the SEP, the highlights included the following:
        • The original quantitative targets of schools, training centres, and housing units
           were adjusted downward owing to unanticipated factors such as increase in
           cost of materials, transportation, etc.
        •   Textbooks, toolkits, etc were to be supplied as targeted. '
        •   School Management Committee (SMC) members should receive training in
            order to build on their capacity.
        •   Full grants and partial grants should be paid to participating schools according
            to criteria.
        •   Basic Education Operational Level (BOL) standards were established in
                   infrastructure and furniture
                   students and learning materials
                   school staff and teaching materials
                   participation (see Table 4).
        •   The governance structure of the project was established.

   Summary of Project achievements

        In the presentation on the summary of project achievements, Mrs. Y.N. Gribil
        drew attention to the financial support provided by the two banks (ADB and WB)
        according to their assigned districts and project components. She added that the
        Basic Operational Level (BOL) standards have been used to monitor the delivery
        services by the service providers.

3.1.3   Mixed Group Discussion. Plenary Sessions and Reports on Outcomes

        There were four mixed groups distinguished by geographic location (East, West,
        North and South) set up to discuss two topics, namely;

            a) Getting the schools to Basic Operational Level (BOL)
            b) Enhance Institutional Capacity in MEYS (see Appendices 2 and 3).

        Each group examined each topic using the guidelines in Appendices 4 and 5. A
        summary of the group reports is contained below.

3.2    Evaluation
       The end-of-project stakeholders' workshop evaluation was done to obtain
       participants' and representatives' assessment of the objects of the project: as well
       as the conduct of the workshop. The evaluation was focused on three aspects: the
       organization of the Opening Ceremony, the thematic/interactive session and other
       miscellaneous subjects.

       Opening Ceremony
       In assessing the Opening Ceremony, the majority of the participants and
       representatives (94.4%) indicated that it went well throughout, was properly
       planned and the presentation on the purpose of the workshop was satisfactory
       (97.2%). In addition, statements by representatives of local and international
       agencies were informative and insightful (93.0%). The need to improve on the
       overall planning and organization of the Opening Ceremony was assessed at the
       level of2.8%.

Table 11. The suggestions on the major concerns about the Opening Ceremony as
measured by the number of times they were mentioned were; the need to manage time
more wisely (ranked highest); the confirmation of letters of invitation; attendance by
government functionaries; self - introduction of participants; provision of accreditation
cards or tags and so forth.


                                           62
Thematic Interactive Session
The evaluation of the thematic/interactive session received very high positive ratings
ranging from 62.5% to 95.80%. For example, the accounts on the appropriateness of the
composition of the mixed groups (95.8%), the design and objectives of the project
(94.4%), project achievements (93.0%) and the clarity and relevance of the information
on the instructions for the group discussion (93.0%) were highly rated. The least rating,
62.5% was on the quality of the group reports and participants' expectations about them.

Within the context of the Thematic/Interactive Session were several suggestions intended
to improve on the quality of the subject (see Table 12).

Suggestions                                                                                    F
A. Organization of Discussion Groups
     •    Grouping should have been done according to mixed districts rather than              2
          "East" "West" "North" and "South"
     •    Grouping should be organized according to areas of responsibility                    1
     •    Representation of district stakeholders should be increased                          2
B. Composition of Mixed Groups
     •    Groups should be from the same location as members are aware of their                3
          problems, that is, district by district grouping will provide more detailed
          information
     •    Grouping should have been further divided to include local councils                  2
          administrators, mayors and district chairpersons
C. Group Reports
     •     Accurate statistics to support statements was necessary in some cases               2
     •     Quantitative rather than qualitative information was preferable                     1
            in some case
     •     Graphical presentation could have improved the quality of some reports              2
    •      The report by the Western Area group should have been properly done on              1
            the activities

    •      Group reports on achievements of the project should be specific                     3
           and include quantitative information
D. Organization of Group Activities to Enhance Institutional Capacity Building
    •      The Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports should have been excluded               1
           as a component
    •     Reporters in group activities should be carefully selected                           1
    •      Statistical data were necessary to support statements made in group reports         1

Across the thematiclinteractive subjects were suggestions dealing with grouping based on some
regional locality, the need to have clear and well focused group instructions and the specificity of
group reports on project achievements. These subjects were mentioned more often than others.
Least in the order of mention were suggestions relating to, for example, grouping based on area of
responsibility, preference for improved group report from the "Western Area" and the need to
have carefully selected group reporters.


                                           63
Miscellaneous Subjects
The section on "Miscellaneous" dealt with, for example, the selection of chairpersons, the schedule
and duration of the workshop activities and the workshop venue. The ratings ranged from 54.1 %
to 91.6%. The result on the appropriateness of the choice of chairpersons ranked highest (91.6%)
and the least (54.1 %) on the timeliness in the food service.

Measures to improve the subjects in question ranged from the promptness of the food service to
the specific length of the tea break.

      nomenclature should be harmonized.
   9. Education service delivery must be monitored regularly and timely and reports
      produced and sent to MEYS.
   10. More vocational skills training centres should be constructed especially in the
       northern districts.

END-OF-PROJECT STAKEHOLDERS WORKSHOP REPORT FOR DAY 1

Date:              6th May, 2010

Time:              9:52 am.

Venue:             Presidential Lounge, National Stadium

             A.        OPENING CEREMONY

   1. Prayers: The opening prayers were said by Rev. Moses Kanu and Sheikh Abu
      Bakarr Conteh for both Christians and Muslims respectively.


   2. Introduction of Chairman:            The chairman for the opening ceremony,
      Honourable Dr. Lansana Nyallay was introduced by Mr. Salieu Kamara, the
      Partnership Programme Coordinator of the SABABU Education Project (SEP).
      In his introduction, Mr. Salieu Kamara noted that Dr. Nyallay displayed a keen
      interest in the operations of the SEP.
   3. Chairman's Opening Remarks

    In his opening remarks the chairman expressed his gratitude for the recognition and
   opportunity to serve in this capacity. He advised participants and stakeholders to
   focus on three key questions:

             • the justification for the establishment of SEP;
             1. the activities of the project and its achievements; and
             2. the concern expressed about the notion of bringing the SEP to an end.

Among the issues he raised were:

         •        difficult access to some of the SEP schools

         •     the security and maintenance of SEP facilities
         •     the continuity of the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) after the closure of
               the project
         •     the need to build staff quarters in the schools' compounds to ensure security
               of SEP facilities
         •     the need to build more Junior Secondary Schools (JSS) and Technical
               Vocational Skills Centres (TVC) in the country in order to absorb more
               students.




                                               66
4. Welcome and Purpose of Workshop:

 In her opening statement, Mrs. Yvonne N. Gibril, the SEP Director, warmly
welcomed participants. She reported that, not withstanding the different labels and
features of the project since launching in Freetown on the 24th April, 2003, and the
ultimate nomenclature as the SEP, the names and some features remained
unharmonised. She added that the Government of Sierra Leone secured forty million
u.s dollars ($40m) assistance from the African Development Bank (ADB) and the
World Bank (WB) to undertake the SEP. She further reported that the purpose of the
workshop "is to identify and catalog the achievements of the project and evaluate
them against the desired objectives given the environment within which the project
was implemented." She cautioned participants that in their evaluation, they should
take cognizance of specific components and their corresponding performance
indicators. She highlighted that there were unforeseen changes and development that
could have impacted on the project outcomes-the strengths and weakness could help
in determining the lessons learned for the project. In raising the issue of
sustainability of the facilities, she appealed to the donor to consider continuing their
support.

5. Statements

   a) IDA (WB) Representative
      In her statements, Ms. Eunice Dapaah, Senior Education Specialist of the WB.
      intimated that it wass a requirement of the WB for the sector to organize an
      End of Project Meeting with stakeholders for the following reasons:

           To ensure the integrity of the evaluation process;
           To verify that the work the bank was supporting produced expected
           results;
           To help develop improved strategies, policies and instruments from the
          lessons learned.
   She underscored the need for an Implementation Completion Report from both
   the Government and the WB to serve as a reliable sources of information. In
   addition she mentioned that other sources of information could be:

           project filesfield visits to project sites etc.

   In highlighting the expectations of the workshop from the perspective of the IDA,
   she noted that the workshop could have achieved its purpose it we could answer
   the following questions:

           What were the objectives of the project?What lessons can we learn from the
           operations of the SEP?
           Was the project beneficial to the target groups?

   b) Representative of the Hon. Minister of Education, Youth and Sports
      (MEYS)

                                           67
        In his statement on behalf of the Hon. Minister of MEYS Dr. Minkailu Bah,
        the Deputy Minister of MEYS I, Dr. Algasimu Jah welcomed all participants
        to, the workshop. He acknowledged their contributions to the success of the
        project

          a) He also underscored the important role of the SEP in improving the
              education landscape of the country.              While commending the
              performance of some contractors, he also noted that that some
              contractors failed to provide us with good quality work, especially in the
              area of civil work. He recommended that to remedy the defects in the
              affected structures, the retention fees of these contactors should be
              applied.
              The Minister assured participants that the schools built by the SEP
              wouldbe absorbed by the Ministry into the national education frame
             work to ensure their effective management and operations. He appealed
             to stakeholders such as Paramount Chiefs (PC), Councillors and School
             Authorities to ensure that these facilities are properly used, managed and
             protected to serve all generations.
              In conclusion, he expressed thanks to the funding banks (IDA and ADB)
             for their remarkable support and funding to the project, which he hoped
             will continued. At this juncture, he then formally declared the workshop
             opened.

6. Presentation

    THEMATICIINTERACTIVE SESSION

    The Thematic/Interactive Session was chaired by Mr. A.R. Bayoh, Permanent
    Secretary, MEYS. Two presentations were made:

          Design and objectives of SEP by Mr. S.M. Kamara and
          Summary of Project achievements by Mrs. Y.N. Gibril and Mr. F. M. Elliot,
          Project Architect

(a) Design and objectives of SEP
    In his presentation, Mr. Salieu Kamara addressed critical aspects of the design and
    objectives of the SEP which included its purpose, specific objectives, expected
    outcomes, the Basic Operation Level Standards and the institutional and
    implementation arrangement. For example, the purpose and main objectives were
    "to resuscitate the Basic Education Sector after the (llyears) war," to assist
    government to re-establish education services and to prepare the foundation for
    building the education sector."
    The three specific objectives he mentioned were to assist participating schools to
    achieve BOL; rehabilitating or reconstructing and equipping vocational skills
    training centres and capacity building in MEYS staff to plan and manage
    education service delivery.



                                        68
       With regard to the expected outcomes of the SEP, he presented quantitative
       information on the number of Primary Schools and JSS (500 and 100 respectively),
       vocational training centres (40), textbooks (1,100,000 sets), toolkits and housing
       units (138) to be provided. Moreover, untrained and unqualified teachers should
       receive professional training. Similarly, members of School Management
       Committees (SMCs) should likewise be trained. Finally, the capacity and output
       of the MEYS staff should be strengthened.

The presenter drew attention to the need for the PCU to revise the quantitative targets
owing to factors which included increases in the price of items and services.
Consequently, the revised targets were as follows:

     .:. 265 Primary Schools and 97 Junior Secondary Schools to receive full grants

     .:. 944 Primary and JSS to receive partial grants
     .:. 8 Vocational Training Centres to be rehabilitated/constructed
     .:. 6,007 untrained and unqualified teachers to receive professional training
     ·:·1,000,000 sets of core Primary and 100,000 sets core JSS textbooks to be
          distributed respectively in equal numbers
     .:. 12 housing units for teachers in remote areas to be constructed

The project established Basic Education Operational Level (BOL) standards in four areas,
namely,

     i) Infrastructure and furniture
     ii) Students and learning materials
     iii) School staff and teaching materials
     iv) Participation
Each area has a set of indicators by which its achievements should be measured. For
example, in the area of students and learning materials, at least, 45% of enrolled students
should be girls and students should have notebooks and writing tools.

The presenter outlined the structure of the project to include size, membership and
functions of the PCS Committee, the PCU, project partners and so forth. All the
information explained the institutional and implementation arrangement. In conclusion,
the presenter drew participants' attention to three main factors which influenced the
design and objectives of the project. These were the provisions of the Millennium
Declaration of 2000 of which Sierra Leone is a signatory, the findings and
recommendations of the IDA/World Bank education survey and the results and
recommendations of the MEYSIUNICEF survey on students' characteristics. For
example, dismal statistics on damage index of educational infrastructure, status of local
district/city council, primary school enrolment, access to tertiary education and so forth
were compelling reasons for the design and objectives of the project.

       b) Summary of Project Achievements

       Presented by Mrs. Yvonne N. Gibril, Project Director.
       Two Banks supported the project - the African Development Bank (ADB) and the
       World Bank (IDA).
       The ADB divided the project into:                                    .
          3. Rehabilitation of basic education, vocational skills training and literacy -
              partnership programme.
          4. Institutional Strengthening, capacity building and Outreach
          5. Project management

The World Bank divided the project into:
         • Emergency response to rehabilitate the provision of school services
         • Enhancing the intuitional capacity of MEYS

Each bank supported seven of the fourteen districts in the country.
The Basic Operational Level (BOL) criteria were used to monitor the quality of education
delivered by Service Providers (SPs). There were four groups, namely,
           • Infrastructure and Furniture
           • Students and Learning Materials
           • School Staff and Teaching Materials
           • Participation
                a) In the case of students and learning materials, the criteria required
                   a pupil teacher ratio of between 30-45 pupils per classroom; 45%
                   enrollment of girls; 1: 1 correspondence between pupils and textbook
                   in the core areas and provision of writing materials. There were
                   between 30 and 45 students per classroom per teacher.

               b) In terms of infrastructure and furniture, the furniture supplied per
                  classroom, especially in primary schools, was normally 15 to 17 sets
                  of three-seater chairs and tables.

               c) Girls enrolment: Although the project was unable to directly
                  influence the proportion of girls enrolled in schools, the 45%
                  enrollment may have been achieved through other GoSL programmes.

               d) Students and learning materials: It was proposed that 3,948,327
                  (1,133,417 sets) of primary and 962,572 (240,663 sets) in four (4)
                  JSS core subjects textbooks be distributed. So far, 1,006,000 sets of
                  primary and 112,600 sets of JSS were distributed to full and partial
                  grant schools and other primary school that qualify as partial grant
                  schools.

               e) School staff and teaching materials: Train at least 50% of Primary
                  School teachers and provide each with a teacher's guide. Schools
                  with more than 150 students should have a principal. Every
                  classroom be equipped with a basic set of teaching aids. Of the initial
                  10,000 Primary Schools and JSS teachers targeted for training nation


                                          70
                   wide, due to inadequacy of funds, the implementing agency could
                   only train 4,000 primary and 1,200 JSS teachers.

                    In reality 6,244 Primary and 1,143 JSS teachers making a total 7,387
                   were trained. The provision of Principals for schools with 150 or
                   more students fall under the management of another arm of the
                   Ministry of Education. The Macmillan Publishers provided teachers'
                   guides free of charge to the project. IDA indicated before the
                   programme commenced that teaching learning aids were not eligible
                   for funding. These materials were provided by the ADB and were
                   distributed to their areas of operations.

               f) Participation:     School Management Committees were trained.
                   These 291 SMCs received Le 281,379 as maintenance grant support
                   by the project. Some service providers, e.g. PLAN-SL, LWF and
                   others, trained SMCs bringing the total to 377 trained SMCs.

The training was done by the District Education Offices, Chairpersons of Headteachers
Council and headteachers ofMEYS.
The following steps were taken to strengthen the capacity of the MEYS:
   • Recruit an Architect to re-enforce the Civil Works Unit.
   • Establish a project financial system and overhaul the Finance Directorate of
       MEYS.
   • Recruit a Financial Controller and a Financial Specialist. They were recruited.
   • Establish an EMIS. Contract for the EMIS was signed between MEYS and
       UNESCO Institute of Statistics (UIS).
   • Provision of Office equipment, furniture and transportation for functioning of the
       units. This was done.

Supporting and Monitoring Education Service delivery
   • 80 Trainers were trained by UNICEF.
   • All district inspectors received training on the SMC Manual.
   • Office equipment, furniture, transportation and other logistics provided for 14
      District Education Offices.
   • Every DEO without a desktop computer and accessories was provided with one
      along with a SKVA generator, motor bike and vehicle. Funds were provided for
      six months for repairs, maintenance of equipment, fuel etc.

c)    Group Discussion and Reports
      After lunch, activities of the workshop continued with group work discussion on
      the topic: "Getting the Schools to Basic Operational Level (BOL)." The chairman
      for the session was Mr. M.A. Renner, former Director of the Planning Unit,
      MEYS. Participants (see Appendix 4) were divided into four regional mixed
      groups:- Group I-Eastern Region; Group 2-Western Region; Group 3-Northern
      Region; and Group 4-Southern Region. Each group comprised participants from
      the region, service providers, contractors, MEYSIDEO staff, PCU consultants,
      member of Parliamentary Over-sight Committee on Education, representatives
      from the Anti-Corruption Commission, the press and so forth.

Each group was asked to honestly and sincerely discuss and evaluate the activities of the
SEP in each district for each ofthe five (5) components of the project with respect to the
BOL criteria as follows:
     • What was the objective of the component?
     •. What was planned to be achieved?
     • What was achieved based on the plan?
     • What were the challenges - strengths and weaknesses?
     • Lessons learnt from the project.
     • Suggestions for future projects/programmes (see Appendices 5 and 6).
The group discussions lasted for sixty minutes and the reports were presented by the
group secretaries in turn, beginning with the Eastern Region, followed by the Western,
Northern and Southern Regions.
 Each group highlighted the objectives and plans for each component of the project,
stating what was achieved and what was ongoing in statistical terms. The groups also
highlighted some of the positive impact of the SEP on the beneficiaries and their
communities with regards education in Sierra Leone. However, in an attempt not to be
remiss in their duty, they pointed out some of the problems encountered with service
providers, contractors and community members. The lessons learned from the activities
of the SEP enabled the. groups to make sound suggestions for future projects in their
districts and chiefdoms and emphatically expressed the need for same.
Meanwhile the statistics and other elements of the group discussions were not made
available to the recording team, as each group was advised to go and fine-tune its reports
and present it to the team the next day. When that is done, the team of rapporteurs would
report the details accordingly.

The plenary session prompted salient contributions from the floor after each group report.
Collectively, the participating schools have made conscious efforts to achieve the Basic
Operational level as set forth by the project document and the extent of the
rehabilitation/reconstruction and equipping of Vocational Skills Training Centres were

                                            72
quite satisfactory. The initiative to build capacity in the MEYS and other institutions and
to plan and manage the delivery of education services unquestionably had raised the
capacity of these institutions to become more responsive and effective in the functions.
The quantum of sets of core primary and JSS textbooks delivered to participating schools,
the partial grants to the primary and JSS schools, and the construction of housing units
for teacher in remote areas are remarkable and motivating to the country's education
stakeholders and the schools communities. The quality of the SMCs according to their
operational capacity is much improved.

The lively discussions and suggestions from which emerging issues were noted are
contained in the recommendations. The day's session was then adjourned to the next day
by the chairman.

END-OF-PROJECT STAKEHOLDERS WORKSHOP REPORT FOR DAY 2

Date:            7th May, 2010
Time:           9:52 am.
Venue:          Presidential Lounge, National Stadium

1. Prayers: The day's proceedings began with Muslim and Christian prayers by Sheik
     CSA Jah of Ansarul Islamic Mission and Rev. Lewellyn Rogers Wright of the .
     Anglican church.

2.    Introduction of Chairman: Mr. Salieu Kamara, coordinator of the Sababu
     Education Proj ect introduced the chairman, Mr. Horatio N elson-Williams of the Basic
     Education Secretariat. In his opening remarks, the Chairman expressed his pleasure
     to serve in this capacity because he had played a very active role in the preparation of
     the project. He further reported that the project has been a success as measured by
     the quantum of core textbooks supplied, the SEP's contribution to the success in the
     NPSE. He recommended that the project be extended.

3. Chairman's Opening Remarks: The Chairman expressed his appreciation to the
   planners of the workshop for the recognition accorded to him. He recalled his earlier
   role in planning the REBEP (Sababu) Project and was pleased to known that it
   materialized successfully. He expressed the hope of an extension of the project
   because of its success in raising the quality of basic education in Sierra Leone.
4. Recap of Previous Day's Proceedings The summary of the previous day's
   proceedings was presented by Dr. Beresford M. Davies a member of the team of
   rapporteurs.

5. a) Statement by Country Director of ADD - Sierra Leone
     In his statement, Samuel Dforie, Country Director of ADB commented on the
     previously deplorable state of the Sierra Leone educational system. He reflected on
     how Sierra Leone used to be the Athens of West Africa in terms of education
     whereby other countries in Africa tried to eliminate the high standards set in
     education. This trend should have continued, but almost the exact opposite is what
     happened. This downward trend, he said, might probably have been due to the
     negatively attitudes of most Sierra Leoneans towards Sierra Leone and anything
     Sierra Leonean. He, however, encouraged all Sierra Leoneans to have a positive
     attitude towards Sierra Leone, and hence help improve the educational system.




                                             74
   b) Statement by the Honourable Minister of Education, Youth and Sports
   The Honorable Minister of Education, Youth and Sports: Hon. Dr. Minkailu Bah,
   recalled the negative effects of the civil war on the educational sector and noted that
   he understood the role played by SEP in salvaging the depressed educational system.
   In this regard he expressed his thanks and appreciation to the donors and operators of
   the SEP and the need for them to continue their good work. He informed participants
   that he wass already exploring the possibility of an extension of the project.
   While praising the successes achieved by the SEP Director and her team, he however,
   noted the poor performance of a few service providers especially in the area of civil
   works and the construction of school furniture. For example, some contractors used
   poor materials to construct school buildings and furniture.
   He suggested that the retention fee should be used to remedy any defects evident in
   the service delivery process. In additi9n, he mentioned a situation in which 68,000
   SEP books were retrieved from street book vendors, and for which a Task Force had
   been set up to investigate and take necessary action.
   He recommended that the beneficiaries such as Paramount Chiefs, Local Councils,
   SMCsand other community groups, should be vigilant and more committed to ensure
   proper use and management of the SEP facilities for the future generation. He
   reminded them that there are other competing communities that need these facilities.
   He thanked all and wished for a successful workshop.

6. Presentations

   a) Capacity Building and other Training Support
    The first presentation for the day was on Capacity Building and Other Training
   Support by Dr. Morie Manyeh, the Sababu Project Consultant .He mentioned that the
   project was an emergency response to the need for rehabilitating the Basic Education
   Sector in Sierra Leone and bringing it up to Basic Operational Level (BOL). He
   identified several activities which included: Needs Assessment Survey, In-service
   Teacher Training for untrained and unqualified teachers (UU), creating an Education
   Management Information System (EMIS) and establishing technical vocational skills
   centres.
   The needs assessment survey identified problems such as misconceptions about the
  project, poor mobility of staff, low staff morale, unfriendly working envirol1llient,
  inadequate staff as well as lack of storage space. Therefore, the SEP wass an
  intervention to address the needs borne out of the research survey.
  The interventions took the form of providing project vehicles and motor bikes for
  DEOs with critical need for transportation. Also, computers and diesel generators
  were provided to five DEOs. Money for operational cost, top-up-cards and stationery
  was also provided.
  Furthermore, the interventions included institutional and technical capacity building
  with particular reference to teacher training. The survey findings established strong
  justifications for teacher training and education.

  At this point, Dr. Manyeh drew participants' attention to the modification of the
  original project targets. For example, the number of UU teachers to be trained was
  reduced from 10,000 to 6,724; the teaching time for training the primary school

                                          75
teachers was reduced from 9 weeks to 4 weeks and for the junior secondary school
teachers from six weeks to three weeks.
The scope of the training content included: subject content, paedagogical skills,
record keeping, use of teaching .learning materials, promoting positive attitudes to
teaching and so forth.
The ultimate number of trained UU teachers was 7,387, distributed between primary
and JSS school as defined in the IDA and ADB districts.
Dr. Manyeh noted that the challenges singled out some policy differences between
the IDA and ADB. For example, disparities in payment of remuneration to trainers
and trainees were evident

In terms of lessons learned, he reported the following:
 • A credible system for selecting trainees must be put in place.
 • Timely disbursement of funds for project activities can lead to prompt project
     implementation.

b) The Role of Education Management Information System (EMIS) in
   Achieving Quality Education
Mr. M.A. Renner presented a paper on the Role of Education Management
Information System (EMIS) in achieving quality education,and underscored the
importance of Statistics in the area of educational planning and development
particularly with the rapid expansion of education in Sierra Leone.

The presentation addressed seven critical phases in the evolution, institutionalization,
and current status of the EMIS Unit. For example, in the Pre-EMIS phase the
responsibility of data management was under the Planning Directorate. It was
transferred to the Inspectorate Division, and this caused the narrowing down of the
scope of the database to just Statistics on enrolment of pupils and number of teachers
in schools. It also created a time lag in the production of education statistics and
affected negatively the quality of the database.

The place of EMIS (a product of SEP) therefore was to enhance the database for good
quality education statistics and to build the capacity of staff of the Ministry for
effective planning and management of the education sector. In all of these EMIS
collaborated with Statistics Sierra Leone (SSL).
Mr. Renner ordered that EMIS database would produce statistical information on
policy and decision making, the teacher and teacher motivation, student
characteristics, quality assurance and the internal and external efficiency of the
system.

The achievements of the EMIS Unit were the collection, processing and analysis of
the 2006/07 school survey and the preparation of the report. At present, the EMIS
Unit is without an EMIS Coordinator, and an IT specialist. He recommended the
appointment of an EMIS coordinator and an IT specialist. Also,there was a need to
train more statistical clerks and to continue collaborating with SSL to put a better data
collection mechanism in place, then solicit funding to sustain the EMIS programme.



                                         76
7. Procurement and Financial Management
   Mr. Cecil O. Coker in the presentation on procurement and financial management of
   the project, explained the objectives of his presentation and focused on strategies and
   processes involved in financial and procurement management of the SEP. He further
   went on to explain how funds were obtained and disbursed. In particular the SEP
   received a total of U.S dollar 42.4m from three major sources: ADB, IDA (World
   Bank) and Government of Sierra Leone.

   The category of expenditures included goods, works, services operating costs and
   unallocated expenditure. In the area of civil works a total of 412 buildings were
   constructed of which 240 were supported by IDA and 172 by ADB. Also a total of
   4,886,131 core text books were supplied to primary and JSS participating schools by
   the IDA and ADB donors through service providers. In this regard, U.S $ 580,600
   was expended. A total of 291 SMCs in primary schools received training. A
   maintenance grant of Le 281,379 was paid to each SMC. A total of 7,387 UU
   teachers distributed between ADB and IDA districts were trained. The disbursement
   and management of the funds was done through two main national banks: The Sierra
   Leone Commercial Bank and the Rokel Commercial Bank.

   The IDA grant and the Government counterpart funds were lodged at the Sierra
   Leone Commercial Bank, and the ADB loan and the Technical Assistance Fund
   (TAF) grant were lodged at the Rokel Commercial Bank. A total ofLe 1,479 million.
   constituted outstanding project liabilities from service providers. For example, the
   Sierra Leone Muslim Brotherhood (SLMB) in Tonkolili District had a total liability
   of Le 707 million. CAUSE Canada in Koinadugu District had a total liability of Le
   169.9 million.

   Retention payments are imposed to ensure coverage for residual defaults to building
   deviancy. For the construction liability period of six months, a "5% deduction from
   payments due to civil works contractors is made by a service provider in respect of
   retention payment on civil works contract."

   There are pending and outstanding procurem~nt issues relating to goods as the project
   comes to an end. For example, the procurement of furniture for 8 vocational skills
   training centres for some districts is still pending. Also tools and equipment for these
   centres to cover some subject disciplines are pending. Procurement of furniture for
   42 schools in the Western Urban, Bo and Bombali districts is also pending.

   In conclusion 99.54%, 95.19%, and 100% of the IDA grants, the ADB loan and the
   TAF grant respectively have been successfully implemented.

1. PROJECT CONTEXT, DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES, AND DESIGN

1.1 Context at Appraisal

The eleven year old civil war in Sierra Leone ended in 2001 leaving behind massive
destruction in virtually all regions of the country. There was immense infrastructural
damage across all sectors of the economy, mainly due to indiscriminate burning of public
structures and private homes. This led to substantial displacement of the population. In
the immediate aftermath of the war, large areas of the country were still not freely
accessible except to mainly NGOs who engaged in humanitarian work towards restoring
and resettling communities. The education sector was deemed to have had more than a
fair share of its infrastructure damaged as schools and colleges were also burnt down
completely. Those not burnt down were used to house the displaced population, thereby
subjecting the furniture and other school facilities to misuse. A good many of the teachers
left the jurisdiction in search of paid employment and security for their own families.
The need to mitigate the risk of renewed conflict was high on the country's agenda and
the revitalization of services in the education sector was identified as most vital in
addressing this need.
 The provision of education services in rural and underserved areas was considered a
priority in the Transitional Support Strategy (TSS) for 2002-2003 prepared by the World
Bank. This Project was one of the lending activities proposed in the TSS for 2003.
Surveys, including a National School Survey were conducted in 2001 to determine the
status of education at the time. The following outcomes informed on the need for
immediate remedial action:
     • Education infrastructure was affected by varying degrees in every district.
     • 70% of educational infrastructure such as classrooms, administrative buildings,
         workshops, laboratories and furniture were destroyed.
     • Most teachers were either refugees or displaced
     • Local district/city councils were not established
     • 42% of teachers in Primary Schools were untrained and unqualified.
   •   30% of all teachers in Junior Secondary schools (JSS) were also untrained and
       unqualified
   •   The enrolment and dropout rates was also assessed as follows:
       - Primary school enrolment was approximately 1,000,000 pupils.
       - 30% of Primary pupils do not enter JSS due to many reasons including poverty,
       distance to schools, cultural reasons etc
       - 30% of JSS pupils do not reach Senior Secondary School (SSS)
       - Approximately 10% of SSS pupils access tertiary education institutions

   •   Capacity of the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (MEYS) was assessed
       and found to be weak for effective delivery of education services.
   •   Key Divisions ofMEYS and the District Education Offices (DEOs) lacked basic
       equipment and other logistics for delivery of services

                                            82
1.2 Project Objectives and Design

The Project's main objective is to assist the Government of Sierra Leone in re-
establishing education services in the post-conflict situation, and prepare the grounds for
building up the sector. Specifically, the Projectwill:
      (i)    Assist participating schools to achieve basic operational standards, defined
             in terms of a safe furnished school building, the presence of at least 50%
             trained teachers with a maximum student/teacher ratio of 40:1, a set of core
             textbooks for each child and, a functioning school support structure in the
             form of a School Management Committee(SMC).
      (ii)    Build up the capacity of MEYS to plan and manage the delivery of
             education services.
The design of the project took cognizance of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG),
the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), as well as the need to provide support for good
governance and transparency. The project has a strong partnership background by
building on existing partnerships between the Ministry and other education stakeholders
mainly Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and Community-Based Organizations
(CBOs) for delivery of services, instead of using a centrally managed approach.

The project was jointly funded with the African Development Bank (AIDB), each Bank
supporting seven ofthe fourteen districts in the country. The Partnership Programme took
the form of full grant and partial grant support to primary and junior secondary schools.
Full grant support was for construction /rehabilitation of school with provision of
furniture, a set of core subject textbooks (mathematics, english, science and social
studies) for each primary school pupil, in-service training of teachers and, training of
members of SMCs. Partial grants exclude construction/rehabilitation and furniture.

1.3 Beneficiaries

The main beneficiaries of the project are
   • The children of Sierra Leone enrolled in basic education grades (Grades 1-9) in
      project - supported schools
   • Unqualified and untrained teachers who will benefit from in-service teacher
      training.
   • Families and communities where project -supported schools are located will have
      SMCs trained and other benefits such as improved learning environment for their
      children, access to water wells etc.                           .
   • Inspectors of Schools and other District Education Office (DEO) who were
      resource persons in training activities and also received specific capacity building
      support from the project.

1.4 The Key Performance Indicators are:

1. 50% of primary and junior secondary schools in the target districts reach the BOL.
2. A 70% completion rate in primary schools in target districts.


                                           83
3. A 20%. increase in girls' enrolment rate in primary schools in the target districts of
northern and eastern regions
4. A 20% increase in enrolment in junior secondary schooling (JSS) in the target districts
5. A 20% increase in passing rate of students taking the Basic Education Certificate
Examination BECE).
6. 50 primary schools have received full grants every year during project implementation
7. 325 primary schools have received partial grants every year during project
implementation.
8. 10 junior secondary schools have received full school grants every year during
implementation
9. 45 junior secondary schools have received partial school grants every year during
project implementation.
10. Existence of a Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) capable of conducting the financial
and procurement management of the project, technical review of subprojects, and
monitoring and supervision of project activities.
11. An enhanced capacity of MEYS to conduct, plan monitor and evaluate the provision
of school services, and stakeholder coordination.
12. Existence of an operational Education Management Information System (EMIS) fully
integrated within the planning and decision making process
13. Establishment and empowerment of 400 School Management Committees.
Based on discussions between the Bank and Government at MTR, a request was made by
the executing Ministry, MEYS to revise the quantitative targets to reflect the inflationary
trends in the economy which had not been adequately reflected in the estimated unit costs
generated during project appraisal. It was also realized that, given the demand - driven
nature of the project, targets could not exceed the demand. This was particularly evident
from the fact that the overall targets for construction of 500 primary schools and 100
junior secondary schools indicated in the PAD 20 was higher than the total support
demanded by SPs, which is four hundred and seventy (472) primary schools and eighty
eight (88) junior secondary schools.

The targets for IDA support were revised as follows:

Targets   School Grants Civil Works        Teacher Training    SMC Training
          Full   Partial   Primary JSS
Original 300     1850      250       50    5,000               400
Revised   240    467       192       48    2,600               192




20 The targets indicated in the ADB documents for the same project nationwide are
different.


                                            84
1.5 Project Components

The Project has two components as follows:
Component 1: Emergency response to rehabilitate the provision of school services.
The project was based on the demand-driven approach, eligible SPs, on provision of a
comprehensive package of services to schools would receive project funding for delivery
of the services. BOL standards were to be used to monitor the quality of services
provided. At the end of the project, 50% of primary and junior secondary schools in the
target districts should have met BOL standards. Based on the unit cost for construction
and lor rehabilitation, core textbooks, teacher training, teacher's guides, peace education
toolkits and support to SMCs, the project would provide full grants to approximately 500
primary schools and 100 JSSs nationwide.

Component 2: Enhancing the Institutional capacity of MEYS
 (i) Establishing a small PCU with overall responsibility to plan, manage, and coordinate
project activities as well as providing overall technical support to the Ministry of
Education.
(ii) Strengthening the capacity of MEYS in planning and management by establishing
procurement and finance units for all project funds.
(iii) Recruitment of an architect to re-enforce the civil works unit.
(iv) Establishing an EMIS by the Planning Directorate.
(v) Supporting and monitoring education service delivery in order to build capacity at the
local/district level.
(vi) Provision of Technical Assistance to the Personnel Directorate ofMEYS.

1.6 Other Changes

There were no significant changes in the project's design and scope. After the MTR,
there were changes in project implementation arrangements and schedule and also
financing.
Implementation Arrangements: For the purpose of managing the civil works aspect of the
partnership programme implemented by SPs, the country was divided into three zones
(West and South, North and East). The management of works contracts in each zone was
contracted to an architectural/civil engineering firm referred to as a Supervising Agent. If
however a SP was assessed to lack the requisite capacity to implement the civil works
aspect, then one of these firms would actually implement the civil works aspect in the
capacity of a Works Management Agent (WMA), but in a different region from that in
which the firm is acting as Supervising Agent (SA).

In both of these roles, the firm had the specific responsibility of ensuring quality control
and certifying payments to contractors. At MTR, the role of Supervising Agents was
viewed as superfluous and not in conformity with standard practice in the construction
industry. The role of SA was therefore removed while that of WMA was retained. The
rate of implementation of the civil works aspect by SPs increased as there was no need to
wait for a SA to certify work for payment when the SP had in-house capacity to do so.



                                            85
Project Schedule: The project closing date was extended twice. The first extension was
for one year from June 30, 2008 to June 30, 2009; the second extension was for six
months to December 31, 2009. Both extensions were necessitated by delays in civil
works implementation, attributed to the following factors:
 (i)    The late start up of actual implementation due to intensive training requirements
        for SPs on the Bank's procurement and disbursement procedures. This continued
        to slow down the process even after commencement.
 (ii)   The initial use of SAs.
 (iii)  The capacity of SPs and contractors to manage civil works contracts.
 (iv)   Bad terrain and impassable road system to remote areas. Koinadugu district, in
        particular is known for very bad terrain, and it was difficult to get contractors to
        bring construction to completion. The extension of the project for the last six
        months was purely to complete civil works in that district.

Project Financing
During implementation funds were reallocated twice among the expenditure categories as
shown in the table below.

The first reallocation in July 2006 was:
   (a) To fund the financing gap created by the pull out of DIFD prior to project
        implementation. According to project documents (PAD and budget), component 2
        was to be funded by DIFD (45%), ADB (36%), IDA (18%) and GoSL (1%). A
        financing gap of US$2.0 million was created by DIFD opting out of the project,
        which meant that funding was not available for corresponding activities such as
        the establishment of the EMIS including recruitment of staff, procurement of
        equipment and training for EMIS, recruitment of a financial controller, and
        provision of technical assistance to the personnel directorate of MEYS. The latter
        aspect was not implemented while the other two aspects were funded by the Bank
        through reallocation to the affected categories of "goods, equipment and vehicles"
        and "consultancy services and training."

   (b) To shore up the operating cost budget that had been depleted in procuring
       essential office equipment to set up the PCU? The latter was to have been funded
       by AIDB but there was delay in meeting the conditions precedent to loan

                                            86
       effectiveness and subsequent disbursement of funds from AfDB. The Bank came
       in on the understanding that the funds would be refunded by ADB. This was
       subsequently done when ADB funded procurement the balance of office
       equipment including some for EMIS.

   The second reallocation in May 2008 was mainly to provide the required
   strengthening and support to the DEOs since the consultancy and services and
   training category had once again been depleted after funding EMIS and providing
   overseas and training for MEYS staff.

2. KEY FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES

1.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

   •    During project design, lessons learned from previous Bank-supported projects in
        other countries, specifically in Africa and particularly Sierra Leone was taken
        into consideration. Key officials of MEYS participated in a study tour to India
        and Bangladesh. The success of the partnership between NGOs and Government
        in these Asian countries formed the basis for introducing a similar partnership for
        this project.
   •    The project therefore engaged partners, mainly NGOs to provide services to
        schools being supported by the project. The partners were viewed to have the
        experience to deliver the required services under the project. Their experience
        was however based on their own systems and structures, and within their own
        limited scope of operations. A study conducted by an international firm after
        project appraisal noted that very few NGOs would be in a position to effectively
        handle the extent of civil works services to be delivered.
   •    The implementation by NGOs had an impact on ownership as time progressed
        and accessibility to all areas improved. The DEOs were no longer as supportive of
        this aspect of the design, especially when the implementation was slow. A similar
        problem surfaced when district councils were finally set up.
   •    The design provided SPs with a 10% management fee which invariably was
        viewed by most SPs as payment for services rendered rather than for facilitating
       provision of services. This issue was contentious throughout implementation.
   •   The organization of the project especially the civil works was initially seen as
       over supervised with too many layers. Roles and responsibilities on the ground
       were blurred thereby compromising effective supervision.
   •   The Government was fully committed to the project but budgetary constraints
       prevented the provision of timely and adequate counterpart funding.
 .•    The eligibility criteria set in the PAD for participation of SPs in the partnership
       programme were simple This qualified a good many SPs though a few did not
       have adequate capacity to implement civil works which was their main interest,
       given that this activity's management fee was attractive.
   •   The commitment and full involvement of partners to deliver services under BOL
       standards posed a high risk which persisted throughout project implementation
       though this risk was supposed to be mitigated by the supervision of the peu and

                                           87
         the pse. The pse however found it difficult to enforce sanctions for poor or non-
         performance of SPs apart from terminating their contract with the Ministry. This
         process would cause delay and meant identifying another SP to work in the
         district without any guarantee of better performance.
     •   Project preparation in readiness for implementation was not adequate as key
         coordinators were not recruited on time nor was office space and equipment
         available. The latter were procured some two to three months later.
     •   The integration of the peD within the Ministry was difficult as the project
         staffwere deemed as better paid and had the capacity for which Ministry
         personnel were identified as not possessing. Participation in project activities by
         officials in the Ministry without remuneration from the project was a constant
         issue of debate.

 2.2 Implementation
 A joint MTR was conducted in November 2005 with the AfDB. At the time,
 implementation had just started and was very slow indeed. The factors below were
 identified as affecting the rate of implementation and were extensively discussed.
 However, the project was not restructured as it was not at risk. Some SPs were not
 retained for continued implementation when their contracts expired. The role of SA was
 viewed as counterproductive and dispensed with.
 It was realized that the targets would not be met as the unit costs of all the services had
 increased. The Government was urged to request for a revision of targets.

 The following factors affected implementation:

 (i) The Procurement Procedures
 The implementation procedures especially the procurement procedures did not in any
 way provide the intended emergency response to the needs of the sector. The
 Government requested, without success, a review of the procurement procedures to fast
 track implementation and also to address construction in difficult terrain and hard to
 reach areas. Service Providers found compliance with the procedures daunting.

  (ii) Capacity of contractors
  This was the single most difficult issue in the civil works implementation. Most
  contractors lacked the management skills and capacity required even though they
  satisfied all the bidding requirements. Their financial and technical base was not adequate
  to meet the standards set by the Project. These problems are evidenced by a number of
  terminated contracts necessitating re-Iaunching of new bids and the recovery of project
. funds thereafter.


 (iii)    Lack of capacity ofSPs and high rate ofstaff turnover
 At the start of implementation, the implementing partners, SPs and WMAs were not
 conversant with the banks' procurement and financial procedures. This necessitated a
 number of workshops for capacity building and one- on- one meetings with peD staff,
 resulting in delayed start of implementation. The capacity of SPs to manage large scale

                                             88
civil works was very weak and staff turnover in some of the NGOs was very high
requiring constant training and dialogue with new staff.

(iv)     Supervising Agents
Initially, three WMAs appointed as SAs in each of three regions were responsible for
preparing valuation certificates for work done by contractors. This was not always done
in a timely and organised manner and as such caused delays in implementation.
Furthermore, none of SAs performed their responsibility of dayto day supervision
satisfactorily. The required technical staffwere not put in place to ensure quality and
standards. Moreover, their interactions with SPs were not always affable and particularly
so with contractors with whom they had no direct legal and contractual -obligations.
 Following the Mid-term review it was agreed that SAs should be dispensed with as there
 were too many levels of supervision and the SAs were not adding value to project
 implementation. The rate of implementation improved slightly thereafter.

(v)      Difficult access to remote school communities
Due to the destruction of roads and bridges during the civil war, access to many remote
areas was difficult. This was compounded by the six -month rainy season which made
many of these roads impassable. Given that about 90% of contractors were based in
Freetown, movement to construction sites outside the capital was not only difficult but
costly. The contractors who reside in the districts lacked the main requirements such as
financial statements and audited accounts, records of technical competence, access to
credit lines etc for participation in the procurement process. This was a constant problem
during implementation.

(vi)     Contract Management
  The project faced challenges in recovering advance payment guarantees and
  performance bonds from SPs who had been issued these securities by financial
  institutions in favor of contractors who were being terminated. Some of these securities
  were not valid at the time of termination because they had expired in the custody of the
  SPs. Financial institutions also showed unwillingness to honour their obligations on the
  valid securities.

  (vii) Delays in counterpart funding
  The Government had severe constraints in providing counterpart funds For example
  for the year 2005, only two tranches ofLe 70 million each (i.e., a total ofLeI40
  million) was received by the project instead ofthe total expected amount of LeI, OOS
  million. At end June 2007, the Government's contribution was short by Le 3.S billion.
  The Government sought through dialogue a waiver of the arrears but without positive
  results. However in January 200S, SO% of the arrears were paid.

  (viii) Replenishment of Funds
  Initially the lengthy delays in the Ministry of Finance in forwarding the project's
  request for replenishment of funds to the banks adversely affected implementation as
  contractors were quick to abandon construction sites if not paid in a timely manner for
  work done. The project had to resort to overdraft facilities on its counterpart account to


                                            89
  keep contractors mobilized. The overdraft facilities attracted substantial bank
  substantial charges which were unanticipated expenditures. The situation improved
  considerably after 2007.

  (viv) Administrative Delays
  The months leading to, and immediately after the Presidential and Parliamentary
  Elections in August/September 2007 stalled implementation until the change in
  administration had settled.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

A good many of the sector and outcome indicators identified to monitor progress towards
the project's development objectors were ambiguous and ambitious. While the project
supported only a specific number of schools in any district, the requisite indicators were
tied to performance for the whole district. It is awkward to expect that in a district where
for example only 10% of the schools receive project support, 50% of schools in that
district should reach basic operational level. A baseline National School Survey was
conducted during project preparation and proved useful in determining the extent of
project interventions. The M&E function was dependent on annual EMIS reports and
sector performance reports by MEYS. SMCs were expected to collect data on their
school, a function which many SMCs were not up to even after training. It should be
noted that literacy was not criterion for membership in a SMC.

Regarding implementation, data was collected by the PCD in collaboration with SPs and
closely monitored on the output indicators: civil works, in-service teacher training,
textbook distribution, SMC training and capacity building activities. It was indeed a
difficult task to get data and information from many of the SPs on project implementation.
The DEOs were also not always very forthcoming with information especially as they
had many challenges unrelated to project activities to surmount.
Two Annual school surveys were undertaken by EMIS but none of the results were fully
analyzed or published prior to expiration of the contract of the specialist.

2.4 Post-Completion Operation

The Bank has already drawn on the experience gained in implementing the project in the
current Education Sector Support Fund (ESSF) being implemented by the Ministry. The
need for procurement and financial capacity within the Ministry as well as other staffing
requirements are being addressed. The EMIS is also actively receiving the attention of
MEYS.
A follow up project on a larger scale than the ESSF should be considered to address those
schools, (about 177 nationwide) which were proposed by SPs for project support but did
not get it. This recommendation was buttressed at the Stakeholders Workshop by
participants who advocated for continuation of the project.

The Government is keen on conducting an impact evaluation of the project as soon as
feasible to assess whether the services have positively affected learning outcomes.

3. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES

3.1 Project Outcomes

The Project's development objective is to assist primary and JSSs to achieve BOL
standards defined in terms of infrastructure and furniture, trained teachers, basic
textbooks, and a functioning school management.

Component l-Support to Service Providers to rehabilitate the provision of education
services (School Grant Programme)

(aj Infrastructure andfurniture
A total of 277 schools were proposed by SPs in collaboration with DEOs and
communities, for full grant support in the seven districts under IDA funding. Of these,
237 were primary schools and 40 were junior secondary schools.
A total of 240 were identified for full grant support of which 192 were primary schools
and 48 were junior secondary schools. All of the 240 schools received full grant support,
and are practically completed.
All of these schools are in use by their communities though furniture fabrication is still
on-going for about 10%, while minor defects are also being addressed in about 5% of
them. Teachers/ head teachers /principals were also provided with tables and chairs.
Furniture fabrication is delayed in some schools due in some instances to poor quality of
furniture initially produced and which were subsequently rejected by the project.

(bj Students and learning materials
These 240 structures account for 1028 classrooms. Desks and chairs have been provided
for an average of 40 -45 pupils per class in the form of pupils' and teachers' desks and
chairs for 90% of these classrooms and the rest is being fabricated.

On the distribution oftextbooks, 3,948,327 copies of primary textbooks (1,133,417 sets)
and 962,572 copies of JSS textbooks (240,663 sets) in the 4 core subjects of mathematics,
english, science and social studies were supplied to all fourteen districts in three phases
during project implementation.
 The last supply of 820,000 copies of (216,000 sets of both primary and JSS texts) was
received in November, 2009 and delivered to all fourteen (14) districts.
Prior to this last consignment, 1,006,000 sets of primary and 112,600 sets of JSS
textbooks had been distributed to full and partial grant project supported schools nation-
wide and also other primary schools, thereby qualifYing them as partial grant schools.
The current consignment should bring these additional partial grant primary schools to
the desired pupil/textbooks ratio of 1:1.
Specifically in IDA-supported districts, a total of 1,876,642 copies of primary and
457,619 copies of JSS textbooks have been distributed with a 1:1 pupil/textbook ratio in
both full grant and partial grant schools.

( c) School staff and teaching materials

                                            91
The activities for the above BOL criterion were (i) that at least 50% of primary school
teachers are trained; (ii) schools with more that 150 students have a principal and (iii)
every classroom is equipped with a basic set of teaching aids.
A target of 10,000 (8,000 primary and 2,000 JSS) teachers to be trained was also set (see
PAD). This was subsequently revised to 6774 when an increase of over 60% was noted in
the unit cost of training teachers at the time (September 2004) UNICEF was being
commissioned to implement teacher training in IDA-supported districts.
At the end of the in-service teacher training in all fourteen project districts in 2008, a total
of 7,387 UU teachers had been trained, 613 more than had been targeted. Teachers
trained are distributed as follows:


                        ADB                       IDA                    Total
Primary                 3507                      2737                   6244
JSS                      543                       600                   1143
Total                   4050                      3337                   7387


Approximately twenty percent of the teachers trained were female.

Reports suggest that the teacher training objectives were met. This was confirmed by an
independent evaluation team consisting of a national and an international consultant
commissioned by UNICEF. The evaluation study titled Assessment of Teacher Training
in the Sababu Education Pr~ject was done in August/September 2008

The study makes the following observations among others:
"All the findings from the questionnaires, focus group discussions with pupils, parents,
community leaders, school administrators, assert that the UU professional practice and
competence delineated in the realms of attitudes, behavioral changes, cognitive learning,
knowledge, skills competencies have improved tremendously since the training".

"More than 90% of those who completed the questionnaires believed that the teaching
and learning materials (Modules) were relevant and met expectations".

The Evaluation Team concluded that: "The training of the UU teachers, distribution of
instructional materials to the schools, mentoring and teacher retention efforts, training of
School Management Committees (SMCs), and other associated activities of the Sababu
project, if properly exploited and aggregated, could lead to a significant sectoral systemic
change, thus strengthening of education delivery, infrastructure, and teaching and
learning throughout Sierra Leone".

21,000 of primary teachers' guides and 4,800 of JSS teachers' guides in the 4 core
subjects were provided free of charge by the suppliers, Macmillan Publishers. These
guides were distributed by MEYS Textbook Distribution Task Force.




                                             92
Recruitment activities were outside the remit of the PCU and/or implementing partners.
As such it was not feasible for this to be addressed within the project. However, in
general, most JSSs have a principal.

In September 2003, a review of the unit costs of services to be delivered by SPs was
undertaken during a bank supervision mission. The outcome of the exercise was
that some items of eligible expenditures may have to be cut. Given that the unit costs of
teac;hing and learning materials and other items of expenditure such as teacher
resettlementlreintegration, HIV/AIDS prevention and life skills had not been addressed
and also, noting that the Ministry's priority was on the construction /rehabilitation of
schools, it was implicitly agreed that these items would no longer be eligible expenditures.

(d) Participation: SMCs
All 192 primary schools in IDA-supported districts had their SMCs trained. All of these
SMCs received their maintenance grant of Le281, 379 to enable them to engage in
income generating activities to assist in the maintenance of their school. Some SPs·
utilized the training manuals to conduct additional training of more SMCs in their district
of operation using their own funds.

Component 2 - To build up the capacity ofMEYS to plan and manage the delivery of
education services

PCU Capacity
  • The PCU had the relevant staff including project director, partnership programme
     coordinator, capacity building coordinator, engineer, architects, quantity surveyor
     and procurement and finance personnel (recruitment of KPMG as FPMA).
  • The PCU conducted the project's procurement and financial management
     activities in satisfactory manner
  • Technical reviews of grant proposals for PSC approval were satisfactory.
  • The PCU provided extensive training to staff of SPs and provided technical
     support throughout project implementation
  • The PCU conducted regular supervision of project activities, monitoring of
     project outcomes and maintained a database of progress.

MEYS capacity
  • A computerized EMIS was established and fully functional until the expiration of
      the contract of the UIS consultant.
  • The Educational Management Information System component was under the
     Directorate of Planning (skills transfer)
  • Two annual schools surveys were conducted under EMIS within the Planning
     Directorate. A yearbook containing information on the first survey was produced
     but not published. The data for the second survey has not been processed yet.
  • The Finance Unit trained one Ministry staff hands on.
  • Hands-on training in procurement was provided for three MEYS staff working
     full time in the PCU and also at GIMP A.


                                            93
   •   A Ministry staff was attached to the Capacity Building Coordinator (CBC) as
       counterpart
   •   Various offices within MEYS including the Planning Directorate were provided
       with equipment and furniture by the project.
   •   Every DEO without a desktop computer and accessories was provided with one
       together with a 5KVA generator, motorbike, and vehicle. Funds were also
       provided monthly for a period of six months for repairs, maintenance of
       equipment, communication and fuel.
   •   Extensive training support was provided by the project for staff of MEYS, WAEC,
       and Statistics SL for modular courses over a two-year period in National
       Education Assessment at various overseas locations, including the USA, Kuwait
       and South Africa.
   •   Ministry staff were funded to attend workshops in the areas of: HIV/AIDS;
       Commonwealth Teacher Recruitment; International Conferences in Education;
       World Bank Education Programmes, and Leadership Skills Training Courses

3.2 Other Outcomes and Impacts
    • The project provided employment for local communities during construction and
       also provided sources of income for those who provided local materials. This was
       a visible contribution to poverty alleviation.
    • The project introduced improvement in school facilities by providing a
       comprehensive set of facilities such as offices and stores, water wells, VIP toilets
       separately for boys and girls, and for most JSSs, an administrative building.
    • The school buildings are used for other purpose like community meetings, polling
       stations, social functions etc. This is not necessarily a good thing as sometimes
       the facilities are in use seven days a week thereby opening them up to accelerated
       disrepair.
    • The wells and even the VIP toilets installed in the locality of the schools are
       mostly used by the whole community.
    • SMC members were also able to engage in income generating activities that
       would allow them to be involved in maintenance of their school.
    • The newly constructed schools attracted new pupils of both genders and created a
       general awareness for education. The message of educating the girl child was sold
       at every opportunity especially as the project director was female.
    • Location of schools in remote areas has many social benefits including less travel
       time to school; examination centres are better accessible and female pupils are
       better supervised by their parents than previously when they had to leave their
       villages to attend schools in towns under the guardianship of distant relatives with
       many social challenges attached.
    • The in-service teacher training provided participants with an appetite to acquire
       further academic training and skills. Many of the teachers are believed to have
       emolled for distant learning programmes.

3.3 Summary of Findings of Stakeholders Workshop
A Stakeholders Workshop was held on May 6-7, 2010. Participants included senior staff
of MEYS, staff of DEOs, paramount chiefs, members of parliament, PSC members,

                                            94
service providers, principals/head teachers, contractors, councilors, PCU coordinators,
World Bank and ADB personnel. A list of participants is given in the Report of the
Workshop which is attached to this Report

The Workshop focused on the objectives of the project vis-a.-vis its achievements, lessons
learnt, and recommendations for future projects.         Presentations were made by
coordinators of the PCU on the objectives, design and achievements of the project
including the implementation arrangements. Thereafter, stakeholders were required to
asses project outcomes based on their own experiences as well. In order to capture
differences in experiences and outcomes between regions, four groupings representing
the region (north, east, west and south) were put together for discussion and, for
providing feedback in plenary sessions. The level of satisfaction of stakeholders with
project outcomes was solicited by questionnaires.

Participants were unanimous in emphasizing that the project was timely and that its
achievements had gone a great way in satisfying the objectives. On the partnership school
grant programme, it was confirmed that: structures had been constructed/rehabilitated at
identified locations, though not all had received the required quantity of furniture;
textbooks had been sufficiently distributed to project supported schools to reach the
pupil/textbook ratio of 1: 1; other schools not initially identified for project support had
also benefited from supply of textbooks; SMCs and teachers had been trained as
indicated by the project. Regarding component 2 on capacity building of MEYS, the
satisfaction level was slightly lower because it was felt that more could have been done
and in a more timely manner.

Participants agreed that the project implementation posed a lot of challenges, given that it
came immediately after the civil conflict when supporting structures were not in place. It
was felt that more sensitization may have resolved some of the thorny issues of
contention between various stakeholders.

It was noted that issues such as continuity of teacher trmmng, SMC training, and
maintenance of structures need to be discussed and addressed.

The need for a project of a similar nature and scope was stressed by participants.
Eighty participants responded to the level of satisfaction questionnaire relating to project
outcomes (see Table A of Stakeholders Report). To remove biases, analysis of only 47
responses, those considered as the direct beneficiaries (excluding SPs, WMAs, and PCU
staff) was done. The indications are that for all activities, less than 10% of the
respondents were unsatisfied even marginally. For most of the activities, over 60% of
respondents were at most satisfied (satisfied and highly satisfied) and as many as 83%
and 78% were at most satisfied with primary school construction and delivery of primary
textbooks respectively (see Appendix 5).

The Deputy Directors of Education, (in charge of the DEOs) responded to a specific
questionnaire on the capacity building activities of the project relating to their offices.
The project was understandably scored unsatisfactory for those items which their offices


                                            95
did not benefit. A needs assessment survey done by the project's capacity building
coordinator informed on what each office should benefit from. Otherwise, the scores
(shown in Table B) varied but on the whole their levels of satisfaction were inclined to be
more than average.

4. ASSESSMENT OF BANK AND BORROWER PERFORMANCE

4.1 Bank Performance
The Bank's supervision missions were effective though in most cases the skills mix
required was not present for wholesome discussions and decisions. The presence of
expert with civil works background may have resulted in a greater appreciation of some
of the issues raised in school construction. Nevertheless the Task Team was responsive to
emerging situations on the ground in most instances. The Missions' Aide Memoires
captured the relevant issues and facilitated solutions. The quality of supervision was
satisfactory .

4.2 Borrower Performance
The Government maintained its commitment to the project and had an active PSC whose
members were keen to supervise and monitor project outcomes. Sensitization was
deemed important but hardly provided for. A newsletter was introduced to provide
stakeholders with progress and transparency.

The PCU provided extensive support to SPs particularly in the areas of procurement and
finance. Financial accountability and efficiency was observed as noted in successive
reports of the external auditors. The PCU had no incidence of unauthorized! unapproved
disbursements or any procurement compliance issues during implementation. Quarterly
reports detailing implementation progress were prepared. It was however difficult to
relate project outputs to sector indicators due to the dearth in statistics of the required
nature. The borrower's performance is rated as satisfactory.

6. LESSONS LEARNED

   •   Project preparation should include the team that would implement/coordinate
       project activities so that they can contribute to preparation and design and
       moreover appreciate decision regarding all aspects of the project.
   •   A thorough analysis of the capacity of participating SPs and contractors prior to
       implementation would have curtailed implementation time.
   •   Implementing partners such as NGOs have their own vision and specialized
       activities that take precedence over implementing projects on behalf of
       Government. For many NGOs, the 10% management fee being offered was seen
       as augmentation to their administrative budgets rather for providing the inputs to
       facilitate and fast track project implementation.
   •    Contractors should not be provided with advance payments; performance
       guarantees for completion of the work should be built into their payment structure
       so fmancial institutions are not involved in the implementation process.


                                           96
•     Project preparation should be able to contemplate major changes in design if a
      project is conceived during a particular period but implemented during one that is
      quite different
•     Timely receipt of counterpart funding is only possible if the donor entities are
      realistic in their assessment of the ability of countries emerging from conflict to
      provide the necessary funds
•     Targets in terms of services to be delivered are meaningful only if they are related
      to accurately estimated and stated unit costs.
•     Multi-donor funded projects are subject to implementation difficulties when
      harmonized rules and regulations are not employed. The signals sent by the
      application of different set of rules for same activities are counterproductive and
    , even affect transparency and accountability.
•     Bank supervision missions should have the right mix of expertise that should be
      available at the same time to discuss with Government and Stakeholders.

•   The application of procurement procedures across the board for all situations can
    be frustrating for borrowers with peculiar circumstances such as post-conflict
    environment. Fast track procurement and disbursement procedures are required
    for emergency response.

•   For relatively large projects such as REBEP, sensitization should be given some
    priority in terms of activities and corresponding funding.

•   Integration of a project coordination/implementing Unit staffed with non-Ministry
    staff has challenges which should be addressed at appraisal stage. The most
    important being the remuneration of Ministry staff that will be working or
    collaborating with project staff during implementation.
