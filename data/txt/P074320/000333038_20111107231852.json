(RECIPIENT-E,TF030320-FRENCH CTF FOR EXPERTISE FY03 -\n            AFR:EDUCATION FOR ALL,TF030371-DANISH CTF FY03 - SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Rehabilitation of Basic\n            Education Project for Sierra Leone were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: a thorough analysis of the capacity of\n            contractors to undertake the civil works prior to the\n            commencement of implementation should be done as part of the\n            procurement process. This will prevent the situation where\n            contracts are terminated before the contract is completed.\n            Every effort should be made to use appropriate criteria for\n            engaging local contractors to increase their participation\n            in project implementation, especially in the implementation\n            of civils works. Considering the situation in the country\n            after the civil war, the concept of using the SPs for\n            implementing the project was an appropriate and relevant\n            approach. As the service providers (SPs) were in a position\n            to access the war-affected areas, they were in a unique\n            position to execute the project activities. However, the\n            capacity of these SPs also needed to be continually assessed\n            even during implementation as there was significant staff\n            turnover. Trainers should undertake regular follow-up on\n            trainees after training and give feedback to the Ministry of\n            Education, Youth and Sports (MEYS). They should also\n            participate in the mentoring of the untrained and\n            unqualified teachers. A strategy to maintain project staff\n            after project closing especially in the Sierra Leone\n            environment where the capacity needed to be strengthened and\n            sustained is necessary during project preparatory stages.\n            Especially given that capacity strengthening can usually be\n            expected to go beyond the short term project implementation\n            period. Ambitious targets are always hard to measure and\n            more so indicators in a post-conflict and capacity\n            constrained environment. The Project delivered many key\n            inputs into the education system. Unfortunately the focus of\n            the indicators seemed to be on outcomes which are difficult\n            to meet during the relatively short implementation period.\n            It is important that projects implemented in a challenging\n            environment such as this also rely on input and output indicators."}, "docdt": "2010-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
