                                      EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
The Government of the Republic of Sierra Leone is preparing an Education For All Fast Track
Initiative (EFA FTI) Project to support the objectives of the its Education Sector Plan to
increase access and improve the quality of basic education. An aspect of the component
objective of the project is to expand and improve basic schools infrastructural facilities. An
amount of US$5,930,000.00 (five million, nine hundred and thirty thousand United States
dollars) has been set aside to fund the construction and rehabilitation of approximately 318
basic classrooms, 52 head teachers’ offices as well as stores for textbooks and exercises
books. Each school will have a special classroom for integrating children with special needs
will also be provided with equivalent 52 water wells and 52 6-compartment ventilated
improved pit latrines.

Project Components
Component 1: Expand access to basic education by enhancing the awareness of government
fee-free and other education policies, increasing enrollment especially in primary one, and
expanding and improving basic schools infrastructure.

Component 2: Improving quality of teaching and increase access to learning materials through
the expansion of teacher in-service training and professional development at basic level and
the provision of teaching/learning materials to basic schools.

Component 3:     Enhance coordination and management of the education sector by
strengthening sector capacity to coordinate and monitor education interventions and
improving human resource and teacher payroll management.

Administrative and Legal Framework for Environmental Management
At national level, a few legal instruments regarding environmental issues exist:
      The National Environmental Policy
      The Environmental Protection Act (EPA), 2008
      The Local Government Act, 2004
      International Conventions on the Environment
The administrative framework for environmental management at national level lies with the
Department of the Environment of the Ministry of Lands, Country Planning, and the Environment
(MLCPE). A National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) has been developed with World Bank
support.
The legal and regulatory framework for environmental management is the Environmental
Protection Act, 2008. The Environmental Protection Act (EPA) 2008 provides for the
establishment of the National Environmental Protection Board (NEPB) and the Sierra Leone
Environmental Protection Agency.
At the local level, the environmental functions are carried out by provincial officers of the DoE of
the MLCPE through its Assistant Environmental Officers. Community groups are often
empowered to arrest people who degrade the environment and pose threat to the health and
wealth of the community.
Sierra Leone is also a signatory to a number of international agreements including Biodiversity
and Wetlands.



                                                                                          vi
World Bank’s Safeguard Policies
The EFA FTI Project triggers the World Bank’s Safeguard Policy: OP 4.01 Environmental
Assessment. The remaining operational policies are not triggered by the EFA FTI Project.
Annex 5 summarizes the World Bank Safeguard Policies. It is not envisaged that construction
and rehabilitation of schools will require land acquisition and resettlement, but should
resettlement be unexpectedly needed, a Resettlement Plan acceptable to the Bank will be
prepared and disclosed before any resettlement occurs.

Purpose of the Environmental Assessment
The purpose of this Environmental Assessment (EA) is to provide an assessment of the
potential environmental and social impacts of the education project components, particularly
with regard to construction activities (i.e. schools construction and rehabilitation).

Selection of Districts for Environmental Assessment
Although the specific sites for rehabilitation and construction are yet to be determined, the
project will have national coverage involving all nineteen Local Councils. The EA was originally
conducted in three provincial districts, namely Kailahun, Kono, Kambia, and the Western Area.
The first three districts were severely affected by the civil conflict which ravaged the country for
nine years from 1991 and was finally resolved in 2002. During the civil conflict, Kailahun and
Kono districts were more or less the hottest spots as compared to Kambia. However, the level
of destruction of public facilities and the environment in all the three districts was high according
to various reports, personal communications and site visits.
The Western Area was chosen because it clearly contrasts with the other three districts in terms
of physical damage to educational infrastructures, environmental degradation, and institutional
arrangements for impact management. Appropriate consultations with affected groups, local
communities and NGO's were undertaken during the preparation of the EA in order to assess
the level of destruction of educational facilities in the different areas. This EA builds on the EA
for the ongoing Rehabilitation of Basic Education Project (REBEP) prepared in 2002 which has
been used successfully.

Methodology of Environmental Assessment
The selection of districts was based on a combination of purposeful and random sampling
techniques. Primary data collection involved visits to identified sites and the use of structured
questionnaires while secondary data was obtained from related assessments from various
sources (e.g. MEYS, NGOs), and from the Environmental and Social Assessment for the
current Rehabilitation of Basic Education Project (REBEP). The project will have national
coverage involving all nineteen Local Councils.

Possible Environmental and Social Impact
In implementing the EFA FTI Project, the possible environmental impact will result mainly from
the rehabilitation and construction activities. The expected environmental impact are expected
to be limited and related to creation of open pits, production of construction waste materials
(waste water, solid waste, rejection and elimination of wastes such as oils and paints), pollution,
soil erosion, loss of vegetation, as well as dust and noise during the civil works. For the
boreholes and water wells, sustaining the quality of water for drinking will also have to be
ensured.



                                                                                          vii
On the social level, construction and rehabilitation works could generate adverse effects, for
example, risk of outbreak of personal and social conflicts, occupation of private space during
works, and exclusion of vulnerable groups from participating in and benefiting from project
activities. Land acquisition/use resulting in involuntary resettlement, and/or loss of livelihoods or
access to economic resources is not expected. Measures have been identified by the EA that
shall be adopted to avoid, reduce or remedy all significant adverse impacts on the environment.

Recommendations from Environmental Assessment
i.     Construction of buildings should be in accordance with existing building code and
       enhanced provisions to reduce overcrowdings and discomfort to both staff and pupils.
ii.    Adequate latrine facilities should be provided with a proper waste disposal system.
iii.   No entertainment centers should be allowed near the educational facilities although the
       facilities itself could be used for such activities as an income generating activity.

Conclusion
The environmental analysis concluded that there are no significant environmental issues related
to this project. The proposed project sites are not likely to be affected by or likely to affect
national parks, natural reserves and national monuments, most of which were completely
destroyed during the rebel war.

Furthermore, most of the proposed project sites either already exist as schools, or have been
marked out for schools in conformity with local development plans and in accordance with the
provisions of the National Environmental Protection Act 2008, the Labor and Public Health Acts,
and Land Policy.

The findings of the EA indicate that the project is well conceived and environmental concerns
seem to have been taken into consideration implicitly. In conclusion, the environmental impacts
of the project are insignificant and manageable.

1.    INTRODUCTION

1.1   Background
The Government of the Republic of Sierra Leone is preparing an Education For All Fast Track
Initiative (EFA FTI) Project to support the objectives of the its Education Sector Plan (ESP) to
increase access and improve the quality of basic education over a three year implementation
period. The ESP, developed over a two year consultative process from 2005 to 2007 was
facilitated by the education sector group made up of in-country development partners and
sector stakeholders. In March 2007, in-country Development Partners successfully appraised
the Sierra Leone ESP incorporating the Education For All Fast Track Initiative Proposal. The
EFA FTI proposal presented a funding gap of US$19 million out of which US$13.9 million was
approved for Sierra Leone during the FTI Expanded Catalytic Fund Strategy Committee
meeting held in Bonn (Germany) in May, 2007.
An aspect of the component objective of the project is to expand and improve basic schools
infrastructural facilities. An amount of US$5,930,000.00 (five million, nine hundred and thirty
thousand United States dollars) has been set aside to fund the construction and rehabilitation
of approximately 318 basic classrooms, 52 head teachers’ offices as well as stores for
textbooks and exercises books. Each school will have a special classroom for integrating
children with special needs will also be provided with equivalent 52 water wells and 52 6-
compartment ventilated improved pit latrines.

1.2   Purpose of Environmental Assessment
It is within this framework that the current Environmental Assessment is being prepared to
ensure that the environmental and social aspects of the project construction and rehabilitation
activities are specifically considered. The current EA will ensure that the infrastructure
development is carried out in an environmentally and socially sustainable manner.
The purpose of this Environmental Assessment (EA) is to provide an assessment of the
potential environmental and social impacts of the education project components, particularly
with regard to construction activities (i.e. schools construction and rehabilitation), and for
proposed mitigation measures to be carried out during project implementation.

2.    PROJECT DESCRIPTION

2.1   Context and Objectives of the EFA FTI Project
With the acceptance of Sierra Leone into full FTI Partnership on April 27, 2008 and the approval
of US$13.9 million for activities towards achieving universal basic education, the World Bank
team together with Development Partners assisted the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports
(MEYS) in preparing the project document for the EFA FTI Project. The intended investment
will contribute to a pooled fund to support the development objective of expanding access to
and improving the quality of basic education in Sierra Leone.

2.2   EFA FTI Project Components
The project is comprised of the following three components (Please refer to Annex 1 of the
Sierra Leone EFA FTI PAD for a detailed project description):
(i)    Expand Access to Basic Education by enhancing the awareness of government fee-
       free and other education policies, increasing enrollment, especially admission into
       primary one, and expanding and improving basic schools infrastructure. The



                                                                                         1
       component is targeted at increasing the number of pupils enrolled at primary level from
       the current 1.3 million pupils by 45,000 pupils in three years and the percentage of girls
       enrolled from 40.9 percent in 2009 to 43.9 percent in 2011. The number of new
       entrants into primary one will also increase from 324,000 pupils in 2009 to 346,500
       pupils in 2011.
       Specifically, the components will consist of the following sub-components and
       activities:
       (a)    Enhance the awareness of government fee-free and other education policies
              (US$41,400.00)
              An amount of US$7,000.00 from the EFA FTI fund has been set aside to fund
              education and sensitization campaigns in targeted communities.               The
              campaign will be based on the recommendations of the out-of school and other
              diagnostic studies and will aim at improving the extending the effectiveness of
              key education policies for improving enrollments. A first step will be to conduct
              an out-of-school study with UNICEF contribution of US$34,400.00 to the
              pooled fund. The results of the out-of-school report will be disaggregated by
              the 19 Local Councils and widely disseminated to inform policy interventions
              and sensitize communities at the local level.
       (b)    Increase enrollment, especially admission into primary one (US$8,000.00)
              The component will ensure that all 19 LCs include in their Annual Work
              Plans(AWPs), the implementation of community enrollment drives, “first-day-at-
              school”, and other relevant activities to increase enrollments. An amount of
              US$8,000 has been set aside from the EFA FTI for these local level activities
              which will be assessed annually.
       (c)    Expand and improve basic schools infrastructural facilities (US$5,930,000.00)
              The number and quality of basic schools infrastructure will be improved by
              constructing and rehabilitating approximately 318 basic classrooms, 52 head
              teachers’ offices as well as stores for textbooks and exercises books. All
              classrooms will be fully furnished with teachers’ and pupils’ desks and chairs,
              as well as chalk boards. Each school will have a special classroom for
              integrating children with special needs (depending on the number of children
              with special needs in the catchment area), and will also be provided with
              equivalent 52 water wells and 52 6-compartment ventilated improved pit
              latrines.
(ii)   Improve Quality of Teaching and Increase Access to Learning Materials by expanding
       teacher in-service training and professional development at basic level, and providing
       teaching/learning materials to basic schools. The component aims at providing in-
       service training to 1,000 primary teachers and 260 Junior Secondary teachers. It will
       also enroll 100 teachers each year in the on-going distance learning program and
       distribute 850,000 sets of primary and 3,000 sets of adult learners teaching and
       learning materials to pupils and learners.
       Specifically the component will:
       (a)    Expand teacher in-service training and professional development at basic level
              (US$312,100.00)
              An estimated 1,260 untrained and unqualified teachers made up of 1,000
              primary and 260 junior secondary teachers will be provided with in-service


                                                                                         2
               training. In order to ensure teacher professional development, second tier
               distance education teacher training will be made available to teachers who
               have participated and excelled in the initial in-service training. A total of 300
               new teachers at primary level will also be admitted into the distance education
               program (100 teachers enrolled annually). Both the initial in-service training
               and the distance education teacher training will provide certification on
               successful completion. Two studies will also be conducted under this sub-
               component: (a) an evaluation of on-going in-service teacher training, and (b) a
               study on overall teacher training.
        (b)    Provide teaching/learning materials to basic schools (US$7,546,000.00)
               Approximately 850,000 sets of primary and 3,000 sets of adult learners
               teaching and learning materials will be delivered to pupils and learners for use.
               To cater for schools rehabilitated or newly constructed, around 14,400 2-seater
               pupils’ desks and chairs, 576 teachers’ desks and chairs, and 750 sets of
               technical/vocational worktables and 893 storage cupboards will be supplied for
               rehabilitated or constructed schools as well as schools in dire need of furniture.
(iii)   Enhance Coordination and Management of the Education Sector by strengthening
        sector capacity to coordinate and monitor education interventions, and improving HRM
        and teacher payroll management. The component aims at institutionalizing the review
        of education sector performance through the annual education sector performance
        review, and implement and maintain a teacher payroll and salary verification exercise.

The implementation of these project components has not yet commenced fully since MEYS is
currently awaiting the release of the funds to fill in the funding gap from the Education For All-
Fast Track Initiative (EFA-FTI) Catalytic Fund with regards to the above (i), (ii) and (iii).

2.3     Requirement of the Environmental Assessment
The requirements of the current EA is to address in detail the environmental and socioeconomic
issues associated with all phases of rehabilitation and reconstruction of damaged primary and
junior secondary school facilities and construction of additional schools at existing designated
school sites, as well as the provision of water wells and sanitation facilities.

The EA includes an environmental, socio-economic and socio-cultural assessment of potential
future impacts of the above activities and appropriate mitigation and monitoring measures. It is
also intended to satisfy the requirements of the national and local authorities.

Appropriate consultations with affected groups, local communities and nongovernmental
organizations (NGO's) were undertaken during the preparation of the EA.

Public disclosure of the EA will be by newspaper adverts and distribution of a summary to all
affected parties, local communities and NGO's. The EA and its executive summary will also be
placed in the WB's public information centre in Washington D.C as well as in its country office in
Freetown.

3.      BIOPHYSICAL AND SOCIOECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT OF SIERRA LEONE

3.1      Biophysical Environment
The Republic of Sierra Leone is a small West African country located at latitude 8 30˚ N and
longitude 11 30˚ W and bordered on the north and east by Guinea, on the southeast by Liberia
and by on the west by the Atlantic Ocean. Sierra Leone has a total surface area of 71,740 sq.
km of which 71,620 sq. km is made up of land area while water covers the remaining 20 sq. km.
The country has a wide variety of ecological and agricultural zones. In the west, Sierra Leone
has some 400 kilometers of coastline making it rich in marine resources and significant tourism
potential. In the east are Low-lying mangrove swamps, rain-forested plains and farmlands, and
a mountainous plateau with Mount Bintumani rising to 1,948 meters above it.

Soils
The dominant soils are the red to yellow-brown colored weathered and leached laterite (
ironbearing) soils rich in oxides of iron and aluminum and acidic. Kaolin clays are important in
some areas. When cultivated these soils are light, readily workable, free-draining and obtain
their productivity largely from residual nutrients from the vegetation previously cleared and
burned. In the coastal plains, the soil is agriculturally poorer because laterite soils develop on
sandy deposits instead of from basic igneous rocks which provide agriculturally better soils in
other parts of Sierra Leone.

Climate
With two seasons determining the agricultural cycle, Sierra Leone has a tropical climate. The
rainy season spans May to November, followed by the dry season from December to May. The
annual rainfall ranges from as much as 5,080 mm on the Peninsula Mountains to 2,032 mm in
the northeast. The rainy season is characterized by humid air masses blowing in from the
Atlantic. During this time, precipitation is greater on the coast than inland. The dry season is
characterized by the cool dry Harmattan winds blowing in from the Sahara Desert. Conditions
are mostly hot and humid with mean monthly temperatures ranging from 25˚ C to 28˚ C in the
low-lying coastal areas, and from 23˚ C to 28˚ C inland. In the northeast, the range in mean
daily temperature tends to be wider from 13˚ C in January to 32˚ C in March. The rainy season
tends to have cooler daily maximum temperatures than the dry season but relative humidity may
be as high as 90 percent for considerable periods during the wettest seasons from July to
September.

Hydrology
Sierra Leone has a dense drainage pattern. Numerous rivers rise in the well-waters of the Fouta
Djallon highlands of Guinea and flow in a general northeast to southwest direction across Sierra
Leone. Their middle courses are interrupted by rapids that restrict navigability to only a short
distance inland. River levels show considerable seasonal fluctuations. The drainage system
has nine major rivers and a series of minor coastal creeks and tidal streams. From north to
south, the principal rivers are the Great Scarcies, Little Scarcies, Rokel, which is known in its
lower courses as the Sierra Leone River, Gbangbaia, Jong, Sewa, Wanje, Moa, and Mano. The
Great Scarcies and Moa form portions of the border
with Guinea, while the Mano river forms much of the country's frontier with Liberia.
Relief and Vegetation




                                                                                         4
About 25-35 percent of the land area, mostly in the north consists of Savannah or grasslands.
Low bush in the south-center covers 20-25 percent and secondary forest or high bush covers
another 20-25 percent in the southeast. The remaining is made up of swampland (20 percent)
and rain forest (3-5 percent).
Sierra Leone is characterized by four distinct physical regions namely:
(i)     The Coastal Swamp region extends along the Atlantic for about 320 km. It is flat, low lying,
        and frequently flooded plain that is between 32 and 64 km wide and is composed mainly
        of sands and clays. Its numerous creeks and estuaries contain mangrove swamps.
        Parallel ridges, often separated by silting lagoons, are common and sometimes form the
        actual coast.
(ii)    The Sierra Leone Peninsula, which is the site of Freetown, is characterized by thickly
        wooded mountains that run parallel to the sea for about 40 km. The Peninsula Mountains
        rise from the coastal swamps and reach 888m at Picket Hill.
(iii)   Inland from the coastal plain is the Interior Plains region. In the north it comprises
        featureless grasslands (Savannah) that are known as "Bolilands" (“Boli” being a Temne
        word for those lands that are flooded in the rainy season and hard in the dry season and
        on which only grass can grow). The south the plains comprise rolling wooded country
        where isolated hills rise abruptly to more than 200 m. The interior contains a variety of
        landforms ranging from savannah-covered low plains to rocky scarp and hill country. The
        plateau region, encompassing roughly the eastern half of the country, is composed mainly
        of granite with a thick laterite (iron-bearing) crust; to the west it is bounded by a narrow
        outcrop of mineral bearing metamorphic rocks known as the Kambui Schists.
(iv)    Rising above the plateau is a number of mountain masses. In the northeast the Loma
        Mountains are crowned by Mount Loma Mansa (Mount Bintimani) at 1, 948 m (the highest
        point in Sierra Leone) and the Tingi Hills rise to 1,824 m at Sankanbiriwa Peak.

Wetlands
On April 13, 2000, the Convention on Wetlands came into force in Sierra Leone. The Sierra
Leone River Estuary is designated as a Wetland of International Importance. With a surface
area of 295, 000 hectares, the Estuary, located near the Freetown Peninsula, is dominated by
mangrove swamps, with lowland coastal plains to the north. As it enters the Atlantic Ocean, the
estuary widens to
about 11km and deepens to form a large natural harbor reputed to be the third largest in the
world.

Fauna
Sierra Leone has limited but exotic fauna. About 19 percent of Sierra Leone's total mangrove is
included within this site which exceeds the 1 percent threshold for at least eight bird species,
namely Ringed and Kentish Plovers, Sanderling, Curlew Sandpiper, Whimbrel, Greenshank and
Redshank, and Western Reef Heron; and is a breeding habitat for some of these birds. The
emerald cuckoo, described as the most beautiful bird in Africa is found in Sierra Leone although
it has disappeared from the rest of West Africa. Other birds include the Senegal firefinch,
bulbuls, little African swifts, didric cuckoos, bronze manakins and cattle egrets. Crocodiles and
hippopotamuses are indigenous to the river regions and the swamps and marshlands. Other
fauna include chimpanzees, Diana monkeys, red colobus, wild dogs, African elephants, African
golden cat, Buettikofer’s epauletted fruit bats, Jentink’s duikers, lions, pygmy spotted-necked
otters, West African manatees and zebra duikers.



                                                                                           5
Natural Resources
Sierra Leone has abundant mineral resources which include diamonds, chromite, rutile (among
the largest reserves in the World), iron ore, titanium ores, bauxite, columbite (a black mineral of
iron and columbium) pyrochlore, gold, platinum, and manazite. Forests cover more than one-
fourth of the country, the most important area of which is the Gola Forest Reserve, a tract of
primary tropical rain forests, near the Liberian border. The country is famous for tree species
like the African teak, the Khaya better known as the African mahogany, and the fire resistant
palm tree.

3.2        Socioeconomic Environment
Sierra Leone's population is estimated at 4.9 million with a growth rate of 5 percent in 2004,
projected to grow at 6.9 percent by 20151. In 2004, the population aged 0-14 represented 42
percent of the population. About 66 percent of the population lives in rural areas in 2004.
Between 1985 and 2004, the largest increase in population occurred in Freetown (an increase
of more than 300,000) as a result of the civil conflict (1991-2002). Increased migration has
brought with it the attendant problems of refuse disposal and waste management. For
administrative purposes, Sierra Leone has four provinces and 19 Local Councils. Each Local
Council is organized according to Chiefdoms which consist of several towns and villages.
The GDP per capita for Sierra Leone was estimated at $149 in 2003, Sierra Leone ranks lowest
on the UNDP Human Development Index out of 177 countries according to the 2006 Human
Development Report. Annual economic growth has averaged 4 percent between 2002 and
2005. Real growth rate of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita increased from 4.3
percent in 2002 to 4.5 percent in 20052. The predominant economic sector, agriculture
contributes over 36 percent to the GDP. The agriculture sector also employs over 70 percent of
the rural population. Rice is the major staple food cultivated by about 80 percent of farmers in
the country. Sierra Leone is rich in minerals, mainly rhutile, gold, bauxite, and diamonds, which
provide a significant source of export earnings, although smuggling of gold and diamonds
hamper the effective contribution to the growth of the economy.
The general consensus is that poverty in Sierra Leone is pervasive in all dimensions. The
overall poverty level is 70 percent. Sierra Leone’s poverty profile show insufficient food, poor
shelter, poor health and high infant mortality, high level of illiteracy, limited access to clean
water and lack of money as the key poverty indicators. Sierra Leone’s full PRSP (2005-2007)
strives to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and other socio-economic
indicators. The three pillars of the Sierra Leone PRSP focus on promoting: (i) good
governance, security and peace, (ii) pro-poor sustainable growth for food security and job
creation; and (iii) human development. The objective of Pillar 3 is set with reference to the
MDGs and underscores the idea that poverty reduction must be underpinned by investment in
human resources. Increasing access to basic services provide the basis for enhancing the
capacities of the poor to sustainably reduce poverty and reduce their vulnerability.


Education Sector
Sierra Leone has adopted and is firmly committed to attaining the eight MDGs. The education
goal of achieving universal quality basic education and literacy by 2015 is a key priority. To this

end, an Education Sector Plan (ESP 2007–2015) was developed by the Ministry of Education,
Science and Technology (MEST) in 2007. The ESP outlines the goals and aspirations for
education over an eight year period. The strategy emphasizes primary education and skills
training as well as relevant and appropriate tertiary education to meet pressing and future
developmental needs. It also lays a foundation for the achievement of universal basic education
and expansion of post-basic secondary education. The Education Act of 2004, the Polytechnics
Act of 2001 and the Universities Act of 2005, are key legislation guiding the education sector
and establishing institutional councils for the tertiary education sub-sector in Sierra Leone.
Much progress has been made in the education sector in the last five years. The percentage of
primary school aged population enrolled increased from 131 percent in 2002/03 to 162 percent
in 2004/05. The Gross Enrollment Rate (GER) is estimated to be sustained at over 100 percent
until 20153. The high GER is explained by the proportion of over aged pupils attending school
following the civil conflict. At Junior Secondary and Senior Secondary levels respectively, GER
increased from 38 percent to 44 percent and from 12 percent to 14 percent respectively over the
same period. Entry into primary 1 increased from about 200,000 to 300,000 between 2001/02
and 2004/05, and Primary completion rate doubled over the same period from 33 percent to 65
percent. There has also been reduction in gender disparity at primary level.
Challenges in Basic Education Sub-Sector
In spite of these access improvements Sierra Leone faces key challenges of equity of access,
quality and disparities. It is estimated that about 25-30 percent of primary and junior secondary
school-aged children (more than 240,000 children) are out of school. A common reason cited
for non attendance is economic difficulties4. Girls especially in the rural areas and the Northern
Region are less likely to attend and complete primary education and gender, rural-urban,
income and geographical disparities are more pronounced at the Junior Secondary level than at
the primary level. Most schools in Sierra Leone have poor classroom conditions and still lack
sufficient textbooks and other learning materials. About 40 percent of teachers are untrained or
unqualified. Many teachers are believed to be outside the teacher payroll because of budget
constraints and the hidden costs of education are a burden to parents even with the abolition of
all authorized school level fees and levies. Given these challenges and other risks associated
with the country’s post conflict situation and external economic environment, Sierra Leone is not
likely to meet education MDG targets by 2015.
A number of government strategies have been implemented to address these challenges.
Recognizing the need to establish in-country coordination mechanisms and to provide
opportunities for engagement and dialogue and sector review, the GoSL established the
Development Partnership Committed (DEPAC) in 2003. Co-chaired by the GoSL, the World
Bank and UNDP, DEPAC has contributed to significant improvements in the quality and focus of
policies including coordination, harmonization, resource mobilization and effectiveness. In
2002/03, the GoSL introduced the fee free primary education and made an effort to supply free
textbooks.

4.      INSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
This section outlines the legal and institutional framework for environmental management in
Sierra Leone and internationally.      The national and local institutional framework for
environmental management and protection is the overall structure which is designed to protect,
conserve and restore our environment.

In the context of the EFA FTI Project, the key elements of the framework are:.

          The National Environmental Policy
          The Environmental Protection Act (EPA), 2008
          The Local Government Act, 2004
          International Conventions on the Environment

4.1        Administrative Framework for Environmental Management
The overall institutional and legal framework for the management and protection of the
environment in the national context is the responsibility of the Department of the Environment of
the Ministry of Lands, Country Planning, and the Environment (MLCPE). The Department is
headed by the Minister. The Permanent Secretary of the MLCPE or administrative head is
responsible for coordinating the functions of the departments within the Ministry and relevant
departments like the Department of Land and Country Planning (DLCP), the Department of
Surveys and Lands (DSL) Department of Forestry (DOF) and the Department of the
Environment, (DOE). He is also the Principal Adviser to the Minister and the Vote Controller of
the Ministry's budget.
The National Environment Protection Board (NEPB) ensures that environmental and social
management is maintained. It monitors the Districts/Local Councils procedures and reports on
a regular basis.
A National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP), developed with World Bank support outlines in
two volumes, (i) an analysis of the environmental issues in Sierra Leone and the recommended
interventions, and (ii) a proposal for investments. The goals, objectives and strategies of the
National Environmental Policy (NEP) are the following:
The NEP’s goal is to achieve sustainable development in Sierra Leone through sound
environmental management.

The NEP’s objectives are to:
         secure for all Sierra Leoneans a quality environment adequate for their health and
          wellbeing;
         conserve and use the environment and natural resources for benefit of present and future
          generations;
         restore, maintain and enhance the ecosystems and ecological processes essential for the
          functioning of the biosphere; to preserve biological diversity and the principle of optimum
          sustainable yield in the use of living natural resources and ecosystems;
         raise public awareness on environmental issues and to promote understanding of the
          essential linkages between the environment and development and to encourage individual
          and community participation in environmental improvement efforts.



In order to achieve the policy goals and objectives, the following strategies are being pursued:
         establish and/or strengthen environmental protection standards, monitor changes in, and
          publish relevant data on, environmental quality and resource use;
         mandate environmental impact assessment (EIA) of proposed activities which may
          significantly affect the environment and/or use of a natural resource, to provide relevant


                                                                                            8
        information in a timely manner, to persons likely to be significantly affected by a planned
        activity, and to grant them equal access and due process in administrative and judicial
        proceedings;
       promote environmental management through the creation of administrative and
        infrastructure support with appropriate financial backing;
       co-operate in good faith with other countries and agencies to achieve optimal use of
        transboundry natural resources and effective transboundary environmental protection.

A number of government ministries are also involved in environmental management and
protection by virtue of their responsibilities. The activities of these ministries are regulated by
their various acts and are determined generally by their policies:
(i)  Ministry of Lands, Country Planning, and the Environment - is responsible for conserving
and managing Sierra Leone's natural environment. It is also responsible for addressing land
acquisition and transfer, land ownership and use, national development in a planning capacity
and to provide advisory services to the public on land matters; physical planning and
management of the forestry resources.
(ii) Ministry of Mineral Resources - is responsible for supervising mining operations in the
country. It issues licenses for all mining operations, enforces laws and provisions contained in
the Mining Act and its amendments. It is also responsible for enforcing provisions in the new
mining act relating to the rehabilitation of mined out areas. The main institutional conflicts are;
        a. the extent to which the ministry has jurisdiction over marine areas with respect to
            marine based mineral resources, offshore dredging and its impact on marine
            resources, and
        b. the overlap of water quality monitoring with the interest of the Ministry of Marine
           Resources.

4.2      Legal and Regulatory Framework for Environmental Management
The legal basis for the implementation of the NEAP and for Environmental Management and
Protection in Sierra Leone is the Environmental Protection Act, 2008. The Environmental
Protection Act (EPA) 2008 provides for the establishment of the National Environmental
Protection Board (NEPB) which has the following functions:
(i)     facilitating coordination, cooperation and collaboration among government ministries, local
        authorities and other agencies in areas of environmental protection;
(ii)    review national and sectoral policies and make such recommendations or proposals as
        may be necessary to the Minister;
(iii)   review environmental impact assessments prepared pursuant to this Act and make
        appropriate recommendations to the Director;
(iv)    investigate or cause to be investigated, any activity, occurrence or transaction which it
        considers is likely to have or result in harmful consequences to the environment and
        advise on measures necessary to prevent or minimize such consequences;
(v)     advise the Minister on areas of environmental protection and control requiring special or
        additional measures indicating the priorities and specific goals to be achieved;
(vi)    undertake or cause to be undertaken specific studies and research aimed at developing
        strategies for the protection of the environment and make appropriate recommendations to
        the Minister; and


                                                                                          9
(vii) consider any other matters which may be referred to it by the Minister and make
      appropriate recommendations or proposal thereon.

4.3    Structure of Environmental Management at the Local Level
At the local level, the environmental functions are carried out by provincial officers of the DoE of
the MLCPE through its Assistant Environmental Officers in the Northern, Southern and Eastern
Provinces, and an officer for the Western Area. These officers are also expected to collaborate
with the Area/Town Planning Committees within Town Councils.
The main tasks of the Assistant Environmental Officers operating at provincial levels includes
monitoring of environmental programs and projects, evaluation of environmental degradation
and compilation of reports. The assistant environmental officers at the provincial level are also
expected to assist the local governments in their province to carry out the requirements of
environmental management.
Town Councils, including the Freetown City Council (FCC) have statutory powers similar to
those at the Local Authority (LA) as mandated by the Local Council Act, 2004. Councils are
mandated to play a pivotal role in environmental management. The City and Town councils
have environmental units/committees which are expected to focus mainly on health and
sanitation issues.
At the Chiefdom level, community groups are often empowered to arrest people who degrade
the environment and pose threat to the health and wealth of the community. Environmental
management for the EFA FTI Project therefore envisages a bottom-up approach where in the
local communities will be assisted to develop and execute projects related to mitigation
measures identified in the EA.
Environmental and social management at the local level is sometimes carried out by Community
Based Organizations (CBOs) and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) which operate
through local groups, mainly youths. These environmental management activities are often
associated with reforestation programs, sensitization and regulation enforcement. These CBOs
and NGOs are coordinated by the Department of the Environment which has posted
environmental officers to Northern, Southern and Eastern regions of the Country.
Environmental management will be greatly enhanced if these groups are incorporated in the
management plan.

4.4    International Conventions
Sierra Leone is a party to many international agreements on Biodiversity, Climate Change,
Desertification, Endangered Species, Law of the Sea, Marine Life Conservation, Nuclear Test
Ban, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, and Wetlands. Details are listed in Annex 9.




                                                                                         10
5.       OVERVIEW OF THE WORLD BANK’S SAFEGUARD POLICIES

The World Bank’s environmental and social (“safeguard”) policies are designed to avoid,
mitigate, or minimize adverse environmental and social of projects supported by the Bank. The
Bank encourages its borrowing member countries to adopt and implement systems that meet
these objectives while ensuring that development resources are used transparently and
efficiently to achieve desired outcomes. In the use of country systems, the World Bank
considers the following:

         Equivalence and acceptability where country objectives adhere to the applicable
          operational principles as determined.
         Improving borrower capacity to address gaps if required to meet the objectives and
          applicable principles as determined.
         Borrower role and obligations for achieving and maintaining equivalence as well as
          acceptable implementation practices, track record, and capacity.
         Bank responsibility in determining equivalence and acceptability of borrower systems,
          and for appraisal and supervision.
         Changes in Borrower Systems and Bank Remedies during project implementation e.g.

         Disclosure of intent to use country systems. This required to promote transparency and
          facilitate accountability, through the Bank’s PID early in the project cycle.

The World Bank's ten safeguard policies are:
          OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment
          OP 4.04 Natural Habitats
          OP 4.09 Pest Management
          OP 4.10 Indigenous Peoples
          OP 4.11 Physical Cutural Resources
          OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement
          OP 4.36 Forests
          OP 4.37 Safety of Dams
          OP 7.50 Projects on International Waterways
          OP 7.60 Project in Disputed Areas
The World Bank’s disclosure policy requires that all safeguard documents are disclosed in the
respective countries and at the Bank’s Infoshop prior to appraisal. The EFA FTI Project triggers
OP 4.01 which may require an environmental assessment. The remaining operational policies
are not triggered by the Project.

OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment
The World Bank's environmental assessment policy and recommended processing are
described in Operational Policy (OP)/Bank Procedure (BP) 4.01: Environmental Assessment.
This policy is considered to be the umbrella policy for the Bank's environmental "safeguard
policies" which among others include: Natural Habitats (OP 4.04), Forests (OP 4.36), Pest
Management (OP 4.09), Physical Cultural Resources (OP 4.11)), and Safety of Dams (OP
4.37). OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment is one of the ten environmental and social
Safeguard used in the Bank to examine the potential environmental risks and benefits
associated with Bank lending operations. An environmental assessment (EA) of projects



                                                                                      11
proposed for Bank financing is required to help ensure that they are environmentally sound and
sustainable, and also to improve decision making.

Environmental Assessment is a process whose breadth, depth, and type of analysis depend on
the nature, scale, and potential environmental impact of the proposed project. EA evaluates a
project's potential environmental risks and impacts in its area of influence;2 examines project
alternatives; identifies ways of improving project selection, siting, planning, design, and
implementation by preventing, minimizing, mitigating, or compensating for adverse
environmental impacts and enhancing positive impacts; and includes the process of mitigating
and managing adverse environmental impacts throughout project implementation. The Bank
favors preventive measures over mitigation or compensatory measures, whenever feasible.

The EA takes into account the natural environment (air, water, and land); human health and
safety; social aspects (involuntary resettlement, indigenous peoples, and physical cultural
resources); as well as transboundary and global environmental aspects. The assessment
considers natural and social aspects in an integrated way. For the EFA FTI Project, potential
negative and social impacts due to construction and rehabilitation activities are likely to include
soil erosion, pollution of soil, ground water and air around construction sites, loss of vegetation
at construction site, creation of open pits, and production of waste materials, nuisances such as
noise and dust during construction.

6.        OBJECTIVES OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND METHODOLOGY USED

6.1        Objectives of the Environmental Assessment
The objective of the Environmental Analysis is to assess the potential environmental and social
impacts of the project components, particularly regarding the construction and rehabilitation of
schools. The analysis covered the issues detailed out in the draft Terms of Reference (TOR).
The assessment will also propose an environmental and social screening for identification
assessment and mitigation of potential negative environmental and social impacts related to the
construction and rehabilitation of schools and related provision of water wells and sanitation
facilities. The actual schools to be rehabilitated and actual location for construction under the
EFA FTI Project are yet to be identified. The results of the Environmental Assessment will
provide practical lessons for mitigation should these be required during project implementation.
The related Environmental Management Plan will provide a pre-construction screening and
environmental and social checklist, environmental guidelines for contractors, and an
environmental mitigation plan. To ensure the effective use of environmental management
tools, the EFA FTI will provide support for environmental training.
The World Bank’s OP 4.01: Environmental Assessment calls for at least an environmental
impact assessment of all similar education projects. Subsequently, the assignment of a project
environmental category, ranging from (i) Category A for a proposed project which is likely to
have significant adverse environmental impacts that are sensitive, diverse, or unprecedented;
(ii) Category B for a proposed project with potential adverse site specific environmental impacts
on human populations or environmentally important areas--including wetlands, forests,
grasslands, and other natural habitats which are less adverse than those of Category A
projects; (iii) Category C if a proposed project is likely to have minimal or no adverse
environmental impacts--beyond screening, no further EA action is required for a Category C
project; (iv) Category FI for a proposed project which involves investment of Bank funds through
a financial intermediary, in subprojects that may result in adverse environmental impacts. The
current EFA/FTI Project is classified as category B.
An Environmental and Social Screening Form (Annex 1) is proposed to assist in evaluating
planned construction and rehabilitation activities under the EFA FTI Project. The form will place
information in the hands of implementers and reviewers so that impacts and their mitigation
measures, if any, can be identified and/or for the requirements for further environmental impact
assessment to be determined.

6.2        Methodology and Techniques for Environmental Assessment
The current Environmental Assessment was prepared using both primary and secondary data.
References for secondary data include the National Environmental Protection Act 2008, the
Labor and Public Health Act, and the World Bank’s Safeguard Policies. In addition to the
literature review, consultations were held with affected persons and stakeholders including
institutions, communities, and other community based organizations. The consultative process
was done in collaboration with the MEYS, OCHA, and other relevant organizations. The
methodology employed to provide primary data included a combination of purposeful and
random sampling techniques and site visits.

Sampling Technique
The study employed Multistage Stratification based on the following clusters:
          Stage 1 – Provincial



                                                                                       13
         Stage 2 -- District
         Stage 3 – Chiefdom
         Stage 4 -- Villages

Provincial Level: This first stage of stratification was purposefully chosen since all the provinces
and Western Area were affected by the ten year rebel war and educational structures were
damaged. The provinces are: Eastern, Southern, Northern, and Western Areas.

District Level: This was the next stage or stratum selected because they reflected a
homogeneous setting in terms of socio-economic activities and the impact of the war was more
significant.

Extent of Damage: The third stage of stratification was undertaken based on the level of
damage to educational structures as examined during the site visits.

Village/Settlement: The fourth stage involved the villages/settlements in each administration
area in the Western Area where visits revealed the level of damaged educational structures.

Site Visits
The purpose for on site data collection was to assess the:
              overall damage of educational structures
              level/extent of damage, i.e. total, partial
              environmental impact
Primary data collection also provided field data in line with the objective of the project to assess
the environmental impact. It also enabled the team to double check secondary information
gathered. The information collected was used to assess the potential environmental and social
impacts of the components of construction activities

Data Collection
Primary data collection involved visits to identified sites where structured questionnaires were
administered. Observation and questions sought to address the following issues:
       (i)       assess potential environmental and social impacts of construction activities in the
                 urban areas.
       (ii)      assess environmental and social impacts of increased provisions of water supply and
                 sanitation facilities.
       (iii)     assess the need for liquid and solid waste collection, disposal and management.
Secondary data included desk reviews, consultations and visits. To complement the primary
assessment, related assessments were made with information from various secondary
sources/institutions including the MEYS, NGOs etc. Discussions and questions sought to
address the following issues:
       (i)       biophysical characteristics of the environment in the rural area/urban area covered
                 by the project.
       (ii)      review of national environmental policies and regulatory legislation.
       (iii)     administrative framework together with the WB's safeguard policies.


                                                                                          14
     (iv)   environmental Analysis

Consultations with Communities
Consultations with communities in the Kailahun, Kono and Kambia districts were facilitated by
the regional environmental officers based in Kenema in the east and Port Loko in the north
respectively. Structured questionnaires were employed to obtain data/information for the
environmental analysis.
The team visited the Kailahun, Kono, Kambia districts and sites in the Western Area. The
principal aim of the visits was to assess the level of destruction of educational facilities in these
districts, the Western Area and their surrounding areas. At the various districts, the team held a
meeting with the paramount chiefs of the main chiefdoms.

The whole assignment provided the team with first hand experience. It was clear that the project
will not concentrate on the construction of large buildings, but will undertake the rehabilitation
and construction on existing sites of small primary and junior secondary schools. The extent of
the project will determine the extent of environmental degradation and according to the
responses obtained, in this case, the impact is manageable.




                                                                                          15
7.    ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
The Environmental Assessment was based on three provincial districts namely; Kailahun, Kono
and Kambia, in addition to the Western Area. The first three districts had been severely affected
by the civil conflict which ravaged the country for ten years from 1991 to 2002. The Western
Area was selected because it clearly contrasted with the three districts in terms of physical
damage to educational infrastructure, environmental degradation, institutional arrangements for
impact management and capacity to handle management options. The level of destruction of
public facilities and the environment in the three districts was high according to various reports
and personal communications and this was confirmed during the site visits. Under the EFA FTI
Project, all districts are likely to benefit from construction and rehabilitation activities.

7.1    Administrative and Socio-Physical Characteristics of Areas covered by EA
It is important to understand the administrative and socio-physical characteristic of the areas
covered by the EA in order to develop suitable environmental management strategies for the
educational sector.
The three districts covered by the EA have similar social structure with the exception of the
Western Area. Kailahun, Kono and Kambia Districts are organized by Chiefdoms, each of
which is ruled by local chiefs representing the various ethnic groups in the Chiefdom. The
paramount chief is the overall traditional head of the Chiefdom. The Chiefdom council is made
up of traditional authorities organized by ethnic groups (Chiefdom Councilors). The Chiefdom
Councilors are set up to administer the Chiefdoms and to advise the paramount chief who in
turn coordinates with the district councils. Headmen work with village area committees to
oversee and administer the villages. The lowest level of organization is the household level.
The Western Area is administered by the Freetown City Council (FCC) which in turn coordinates
with the various villages committees in the rural areas, headmen and district councils.

Kailahun District
The administrative headquarter of the district is Kailahun town located 270 miles from Freetown.
Kailahun is located in one of four provinces with the provincial headquarter office located in
Kenema. Administratively Kailahun is divided into fourteen (14) Chiefdoms.
Kailahun district located in the Eastern province of Sierra Leone is bordered on the north by the
Republic of Guinea and on the southeast by the Republic of Liberia along the Mano river. It
covers an area of 1,490 sq. miles. The topography of the area is undulating, ranging from low
lying inland plains to more disserted upland areas with elevation between 600-700 meters
altitude. Most of the area has an average annual rainfall of over 2,500 mm, with 80 percent of
this average falling during the period of June to November, average annual temperatures vary
between 25°C and 28°C with higher values occurring in March/April when solar radiation is most
intense. The vegetation of the district is dense farm bush dominated by fast growing, fire
resistant species that thrive under the bush fallow system. The district also has over 5,000 acres
of forests reserves and protected forest areas (Gola rainforest). High trees traditionally
surround many of the villages and are used as shade for cocoa and coffee. However, most of
these forest reserves were affected by the war.
The district is predominantly inhabited by the Mendes although traditionally the Kissi dominated
area. The minority tribes include the Krim, Vai and Gola inhabiting areas along the border with
Liberia. The district which used to be under the control of rebels during the war is now under
the control of the government of Sierra Leone. The population of the district is estimated at
358,190 according to the 2004 population Census. The population accounts for 7.2 percent of



                                                                                       16
the population of Sierra Leone. Mass migration of the people occurred as a result of the rebel
war. Migration to the neighboring countries of Guinea and Liberia as well as to other parts of
the country was common during the war when the district was under rebel control. The major
economic activities in the area are agriculture, mining and hunting. Major cash crops like coffee
and cacao used to fetch a sizeable proportion of Sierra Leone's foreign exchange earnings.
Commercial activity in the area is low mainly restricted to the provision of services.

Educational and other Infrastructure Facilities
Kailahun district and the town of Kailahun in particular had several primary and secondary
schools, hospitals, medical centers, churches, and mosques before the war. Although facilities
were destroyed during the ten years of civil war as reports from various organizations (both
governmental and nongovernmental) suggests, interventions from the ongoing “Sababu Project”
(IDA-AfDB-GoSL funded Rehabilitation of Basic Education Project) has brought some
improvement to the situation. Under the ongoing project, a total of 485 school, made up of 38
primary and 10 JSS schools had been constructed, rehabilitated and handed over to
communities. Twelve (12) additional schools are currently under construction. The hospital,
many churches and mosques have been rehabilitated.
In addition to international funding which includes support from the Islamic Development Bank
(IDB), local and international NGOs have also contributed greatly to improving the infrastructure
situation in the district.

Kono District
The Kono District comprises fourteen (14) Chiefdoms. The headquarter town is Koindu and it
also serves as the administrative headquarter town.
The Kono district is located in the Eastern province of Sierra Leone. The district is bordered on
the north by Koinadugu district, on the east by the Republic of Guinea, the southeast by
Kailahun and Kenema districts and in the west by Tonkolili and Moyamba districts. The
topography of Kono district is characterized by hills to the east and lowland covered with
savanna grassland to the north. Relatively fertile inland valley swamps occupy a vast area of
the district. The climate of the area is typical of the Eastern region of Sierra Leone with an
average annual rainfall of over 250 mm, 80 percent of which occurs between May and
November. Average monthly air temperature ranges between 25°C and 28°C. In terms of
biological diversity, the district is now covered mostly with low grassland and most of the forest
cover has been lost due to intense mining activities and the rebel war. Wild life is not prevalent
and restricted to a limited species of birds and other wild animals like monkeys.
The population of Kono district was estimated at 335,401 (2004, census). This corresponds to
6.74 percent of the total population. . The main economic activity centers around mining of
diamonds which is widely believed to be the dominant source of funding for the ten year old
brutal civil war the country experienced. Agricultural activity is modest in the area as the land
for most part has been degraded by mining activities with little or no rehabilitation. Most of the
soils are ferralitic and shallow with low fertility, except for the inland valley swamps which are
relatively fertile. The district was under rebel control during the war but no longer. Commercial
and other related activities are growing in the district.

Educational and other Infrastructure Facilities
Given that Kono was the scene of intense military activities throughout the ten years of civil
conflict, there were hardly any educational facilities in the district in the time immediately after
the war. Almost all schools were destroyed in addition to hospitals and public services
infrastructure. Water storage and delivery facilities were also been destroyed. Roads were and
in some cases are still in deplorable condition and sanitation is poor. Indeed infrastructure
damage in the district was almost absolute. This situation is now a thing of the past as
infrastructural development is ongoing. Regarding schools, a total of 166 schools (15 primary
and 1 JSS) have been completed with about 17 more planned for the future.

Kambia District
The administrative headquarter is Kambia Town and the provincial headquarter office is located
in Makeni. Kambia district is administered in seven (7) chiefdoms.
The Kambia district is located in the northern province of Sierra Leone. Covering an area of
about 1,100 sq. miles, the district is bordered on the north and northeast by the Republic of
Guinea, Bombali and Port Loko districts, and on the south and west by the Republic of Guinea
and the Atlantic ocean. The topography of Kambia district is dominated by low lying plains with
heights between 50 and 250 feet. The drainage system of the Great and Little Scarcies rivers
lies within the district. Kambia district has an average annual rainfall of over 3000 mm. The bulk
of the rains falls during the rainy season as in most parts of country. Average annual
temperatures ranges from 200˚C and 250˚C. The district is mostly covered by low shrubs and
grassland. In the proximity of the Scarcies river, mangrove swamps dominate but these have
been severely degraded to make way for rice cultivation.
The present population according to the 2004 population census is estimated as 270,462
corresponding to 5.43 percent of the total population. This district was first attacked by the RUF
and AFRC forces in 1995 and was subsequently occupied by the RUF forces in 1999. This
resulted in widespread displacement of the civilian population some of which fled to neighboring
Republic of Guinea. The district was under the RUF until may 2001 when a formal agreement
was reached paving the way for RUF's withdrawal from the district. Presently the district is
under government control with the return of a sizeable number of internally as well as externally
displaced people. Commercially activity has resumed and the government is in the process of
restoring essential services in the area. Kambia district is dominated by such activities as
agriculture, fishing and hunting. The district is a major producer of swamp rice. Upland rice
production is also important in the area. Petty trading (commerce) is a growing economic
activity as the district lies on the border with the Republic of Guinea.

Educational and other Infrastructure Facilities
With regards to educational facilities, school structures are still intact in then chiefdoms. In the
town of Kambia town were all the schools were burnt down, Sababu interventions has led to the
construction of 287 (23 primary and 5 JSS) schools with only 3 to be completed under the
provisions of the World Bank. Many of the other remaining structures have been renovated
since they only had either cracked walls or damaged roofs. Other infrastructure facilities such as
health, water and sanitation have also been restored and rehabilitated.

Western Area
The Western Area is one of the four-main physical divisions of Sierra Leone and is situated
between latitude 8° 5' and 8° 30' and longitudes 130 00' and 130 15' west. It covers an area of
about 110 square miles. It has a population estimated at 947,122 - being 19.03 percent of the
total population. The population in the Western Urban was estimated at 772,873 (15.53 percent
of total population) and Western Rural was 174,249 (3.50 percent of total population) according
to the 2004 population census. The area falls naturally into two main physical divisions, the
eastern or low-lying area bounded on the North by Koya Chiefdom, the East by the Songo
Creek, the South by the Ribbi River and Yawri Bay, and on the West by the Western or
Mountain region which itself forms the other main physical region.
The relief and drainage is varied. It consists of the Peninsula mountains of the Western Area
near Freetown which are the result of a large basic intrusion of Norite and Gabbro probably of
Cambrian age. The present youthful topography with its strongly dissected mountain range
rising up to almost 3,000 feet (Picket Hill, 2912 feet) has resulted from a relatively recent uplift,
possibly of tertiary times. They stretch for some 23 miles into the Banana Island south of
Freetown. Around the base of these hills, a large number of erosional platforms have been
carved which present excellent pastures during the wet season.
The Eastern or low-lying region is made up of undulating plains, which have been described as
"Raised Beaches". This presumes that much of what is, for example Freetown, is below the sea.
These raised beaches increase in size as they approach the Bunce River in the north and Yawri
Bay in the south. After Waterloo town, they merge into the Interior Plains and Plateaux, another
physical region of Sierra Leone. The Western Area is drained by a large number of short and
swift flowing streams and rivers which rise from the Peninsula mountains. These flows are
mountain torrents during the tropical rains becoming virtually dry in the dry season. As the rivers
reach the Costal plains they flow through gorges 25 to 50 feet to empty themselves into the sea.
Notable among these are the Orugu, No.2, Whale and Sussex rivers.
The rainfall and temperature pattern is dual. The dry season spans November to April and a
wet season is from May to October. During the wet season over 90 percent of the rainfalls
occurs between Aberdeen and Kent. In the dry season only a trace amount of rain falls. Rainfall
decreases inland and with decreasing height above sea level. In the mountainous areas, over
200 inches of rain falls in a single year. In the Costal areas between 180 and 200 inches of
rainfall is registered annually. Inland rainfall decreases as low as 120 inches annually. The
average maximum temperature registered at a meteorological station in Freetown was 85.70F
and the average minimum temperature was 76.90F. Such a pattern can be said to represent the
general temperature system in the Western Area.
The soils of the Western Area are classified under three major groups: Soils of the Peninsula
mountains, Soils of the Coastal swamps and Soils of the raised beaches and terraces. The
soils of the peninsula mountains have been formed from Norite and Gabbro which are rich in
iron. Under high rainfall and a pronounced dry season, this is an optimum environment for
plinthite formation which is abundantly present in the form of gravel, boulders or hardpan. On
the steep slopes, very stony soils are shallow over bed-rock. On the foot slopes of the
mountains and on the erosional platforms, soils have developed that have less than six inches
of surface soil over hard, impenetrable highly indurated plainthite sheet. In some valleys, small
areas of thick gravel-free soils are present. These colluvial soils are very valuable especially for
vegetable growing in the dry season and are now being used for swamp rice cultivation in the
wet season.

Educational and other Infrastructure Facilities
The locations for educational institutions were initially acquired by the Ministry of Education.
Since independence new sites have been acquired and new schools built on a demand driven
basis. Schools were however systematically destroyed during the ten-year civil war and a rapid
assessment conducted in 1996 by the MEYS revealed that extensive damage had occurred.
This included burnt down school buildings, looting involving the removal of roofing sheets, doors
and windows, removal or destruction of school furniture and equipment, and loss of teaching
materials. School buildings which were directly damaged by vandalism had deteriorated
because lack of maintenance or abandonment due to the frequent attacks and threats.
Over the years following the war, schools are being rehabilitated and/or reconstructed on
existing school sites or marked out sites. Currently, seven (5 primary and 2 JSS) out of the 15
schools being constructed and rehabilitated under the IDA funded REBEP has been completed.
About 27 additional schools are being constructed and rehabilitated with the AfDB support
under the same project.
The selection of existing school sites will employ a participatory planning exercise based on
school base line data collected during preparation. The selection will be done in consultation
with NGOs, missions, Local Council representatives and Chiefdom authorities. Final approval
of school sites selection will be approved by the MEYS and the project steering committee to
ensure that schools match the needs of catchment areas for projected enrollments.

7.2    Description of Environmental and Social Impact and Mitigation Measures
The Environmental Assessment identified a number of possible impacts of the project on the
environment including, creation of some open pits, production of construction waste materials,
and pollution. These environmental impacts are likely to affect the EFA FTI Project component
on schools construction and rehabilitation and the provision of relevant water wells and
sanitation facilities. The section also attempts to provide a detailed account of measures that
shall be adopted to avoid, reduce or remedy adverse impacts identified.
In addition, the Ministry in collaboration with the Local Councils will assume a more definitive
and strategic role in responding to the needs of the local population. This requires making sure
that schools provided are demand driven with communities themselves identifying location in
discussion with the Local Councils. This will place the communities in a better position socially
if not economically to benefit from construction and rehabilitation activities.

Production of Construction Waste; Contact with Hazardous Materials
The construction of schools buildings and support structures produces waste materials which
have to be safely disposed at identified dump sites. These materials may include scrap metals,
nails, pieces of wood, broken glass, pieces of cement blocks etc. If not properly disposed, these
may cause personal injury, and lead to land degradation. The painting and decorative phase of
civil works may produce such wastes such as paint, oil, etc. which might find their way into the
soil and into nearby streams and polluting them.
A clean-up exercise will be put in place to clean up materials like nails, pieces of timber, broken
blocks, scattered sand and gravel, pieces of iron, mortar mixing, waste water, saw dust etc., and
where recycling or reuse is appropriate, this must be encouraged. For example, saw dust could
be used as manure in the experimental tree nurseries and school gardens.
To protect workers from contact with hazardous materials or substances, protective head and
body gear will be worn at the construction phase of the project in accordance to building safety

regulations. Training and relevant information will also be provided to workers to complement
this.

Dust and Noise
The project is likely to cause pollution of the environment in terms of the limited amount of noise
associated with construction of simple buildings which does not require heavy machinery.
Pollution can also be caused as a result of the abandoning and poor disposal of paint materials.
The dust associated with earth excavation for building the foundation would also be limited and
temporary and is likely to have minimal impact on the quality of air around construction sites.
Noise pollution will be an issue during the construction stage of the project but will be expected
to minimize once the schools become fully operational. Post construction/building materials
should be cleared and properly disposed.

7.3    Specific Mitigation Measures associated with Constructional Activities and Impact
       on Local Populations
A number of measures were identified to have some impact on local populations during the
construction of schools. These include location of school and land availability, employment of
community members, social programs and NGO operations, and capacity building.

Land availability
During the consultation process, stakeholders emphasized that the acquisition and use of land
for the construction of schools would not present a problem as long as there is demand by the
community for a school or additional classrooms. In the provincial areas and at Chiefdom level,
the land is owned by the community and held in trust by the Paramount Chief. The Paramount
Chief is the custodian of the land and based on the need of the community, the Paramount
Chief would give permission for land to be used for specific purposes. An analysis of this issue
indicates that the amount of land required for the project activities is not significant. The
prevailing vegetation is shrub and farm bush with an insignificant variety of wildlife.
In the urban setting the land is owned by the Government or the proprietor who is constructing
the school. Before the construction of the school is initiated, a site plan is requested together
with the minutes of the meeting at which the decision to construct a school was taken. Under
the decentralization process, all of the documents are requested to be submitted to MEYS and
must be accompanied by a document indicating that the Local Council has given approval for
the construction of a school at a particular location within that district. This procedure is usually
followed by individuals or groups dealing with school construction or related activities.

Employment of Community Members
The MEYS and Local Councils will review the opportunities for extending preferential
employment amongst the local indigenous population with the requisite skills. The MEYS and
Local Councils will need to draw on people with the required skills. Preference will be given to
local employees for most of the unskilled labor that will be required.

Capacity Building
The rehabilitation and reconstruction activities require capacity building. The perception of the
communities is that they would be key participators in the construction process from decision
making to actual implementation. Participation of communities at all phases of the process will
enhance their capabilities and capacities. Special skills that could be developed include block



                                                                                          21
laying, masonry, carpentry and painting. Other skills connected with preventing erosion and
improving aesthetics such as greening, tree planting and beautification will extend far beyond
the school to the community if capacity of community members is strengthened in these areas.

7.4    Potential Environmental and Social Impacts of Increased Provision of Water
       Supply and Sanitation Facilities
Some of the areas covered by the EA also have very poor sanitary conditions and
environmental degradation from unhealthy refuse and sewage disposal system, and depending
on poor sources of drinking water. The EA reveals that communities have low health status and
water borne diseases are common. This is particularly the case in areas where drinking water
is derived from streams or where the open bush and streams are used as places of
convenience and for sewage disposal.
Against this backdrop, the increased provisions for potable water and sanitation facilities will
have a positive effect on the communities where schools are located. Most of the areas
covered by the EA reported either having a well or pipe borne water before the war, apart from
Gorama in Kono Chiefdom.

Public Health Impact
The provision of latrines in the schools should have significant social impact especially because
it targets a significant proportion of community members, school children. Indeed if the
community agrees, school water and sanitation facilities could be extended to the community.
Although most of the Chiefdoms covered by the EA in the various districts reported having pit
latrines, the community occasionally used village streams and the open bush for sewage
disposal. Over 50 percent of these latrines were completely destroyed during the war. For the
purpose of combating the expected increase in access and providing safe hygiene there is
urgent need of not only to restore the old pit latrines, but also to construct new ones to
correspond basic hygiene education.
A potential positive impact of increased provision of water supply and sanitation facilities,
therefore, is the reduction of diseases like malaria, diarrhea, dysentery, bilharzia, lassa fever,
measles, polio etc.

8.    ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN (EMP)

8.1    Environmental and Social Monitoring Indicators
An Environmental Management Plan (EMP) for the EFA FTI Project is intended to ensure
efficient environmental management of the project. The EMP outlines (i) the relevant project
activities, (ii) the potential negative environmental and social impacts, (iii) the proposed
mitigation measures, (iv) persons and institutions responsible for implementing the mitigation
measures, (v) persons and institutions responsible for monitoring the implementation of the
mitigation measures, (vi) frequency of monitoring mitigation measures, (vii) capacity
strengthening for environmental management, and (viii) estimated cost for environmental
mitigation measures. The EMP will be used as a guideline during project implementation and
the cost of implementation will be taken into consideration in the EFA FTI project costs. A
summary of the EMP is provided in Annex 6.

8.2    Institutions Responsible for Implementing and Monitoring Mitigation Measures
The roles and responsibilities regarding environmental planning and approval for rehabilitation
activities are outlined and summarized as follows:
Coordination and Supervision
     The Civil Works Engineer/Quantity Surveyor/Architect in the Local Council will be
      responsible for completing the environmental and social screening (Annex 1) and
      checklists (Annex 2) since civil works contracts for constructing and rehabilitating basic
      schools will be their responsibility. The Civil Works Unit of the LCs will also determine the
      environmental category of the screened activity to recommend the appropriate mitigation
      measures for potential environmental and social impacts of the construction and
      rehabilitation works. Environmental training will also be provided for LCs as required.
     The ESP Coordinator will work with the Planning Division and the Civil Works Unit of the
      MEYS to analyze all information/data from the environmental and social screening and
      checklists.
     Technical services of LCs will ensure the supervision (oversight) of the implementation of
      mitigation measures which will be executed by private contractors. The ESP Coordinator
      will work with the Planning Division and the Civil Works Unit of the MEYS to ensure this.
Implementation
     Individual consultants or consultancy firm will be responsible for (i) carrying out the EIA
      studies, and (ii) drafting the environmental section of guidelines for the maintenance of
      educational facilities and related water supply and sanitation facilities.
     The contractors are responsible for the implementation of the mitigation measures as
      indicated in the Environmental Guidelines for Contractors (Annex 4).
Monitoring
     The technical services of the Civil Works Units (where educational facilities will be
      rehabilitated), will be responsible for monitoring of the implementation of the mitigation
      measures.




                                                                                        23
8.3   Capacity Strengthening for the Environmental and Social Management of the EFA
      FTI Project
Training Required
Environmental capacity strengthening will be required for technical personnel who are involved
with the civil works program of EFA FTI Project at the level of the LCs and also in the MEYS if
necessary.
To ensure that screening and EFA FTI Project activities are carried out in a manner that is
environmentally and socially sound, it has been suggested to train the ESP Coordinator and one
technical personnel in each of the LCs where schools will be constructed and rehabilitated in the
following: (i) completing the screening forms; (ii) completing the environmental and social
checklists; (iii) developing the terms of References for EIA; and (iv) recruitment of consultants.
The results of the screening and the EIA will be submitted for the approval of the Steering
Committee. The ESP Coordinator and technical personnel of the LCs will also be trained
environmental and social assessment, and on the EIA procedures to allow them play the role of
environmental and social experts during the implementation of the EFA FTI Project activities.
The ESP Coordinator will be responsible at the level of the EFA FTI for coordination and
supervision (overseeing) of environmental and social management and the EFP must make an
effort to visit all the educational facilities to be constructed and rehabilitated, at least once at the
beginning of the civil works, in order to assist LC technical personnel in completing the
screening forms.
The technical personnel of the LCs will collaborate with the ESP Coordinator on the day-to-day
monitoring of environmental and social of sites where educational facilities will be constructed
and rehabilitated. They will also follow up on environmental and social indicators and the
implementation of mitigation measures where necessary.
Capacity strengthening for environmental and social monitoring will be required at national and
LC level as follows:
     The ESP Coordinator to strengthen his capacity to apply the screening/checklist process
      as outlined in Annexes 1 and 2.
     Technical personnel of the Civil Works units of the LCs to reinforce their capacities in
      environmental monitoring.
     Selected contractors to sensitize them on environmental and social considerations.

The ESP Coordinator, Civil Works Unit of MEYS and Technical Personnel at the LCs will
conduct the following activities:
     Screening of the educational facilities and related water supply and sanitation facilities at
      each of the school construction and rehabilitation sites, using the Environmental and
      Social Screening Form
     Completion of the Environmental and Social Screening Form (Annex 1) and submission to
      Steering Committee for information
     Carrying out environmental work, i.e. recommending simple mitigation measures (Annex
      3), or, arranging for the preparation of a separate EIA (Annex 6)
     Preparation of the draft TORs for the EFA FTI Project activities requiring a separate EIA
     Submission of the TORs to MEYS and DPs for clearance
     Recruitment of qualified consultancy firms to conduct the EIAs if necessary


                                                                                             24
    Sending the EIA reports to the appropriate institutions accessible to the public.

                                       aspects


There are a few consultancy firms specialized in EIA issues in Sierra Leone who could be
contracted to design short courses that meet the capacity strengthening needs of stakeholders
who will be involved in environmental and social management.

Training Cost Estimates
The training program will be implemented by the ESP Coordinator working with the EFA FTI
implementation team. The costs estimates, including travel expenses, and training modalities
will be prepared by the ESP Coordinator with support from the relevant Local Councils.
Trainers/facilitators with the requisite skills in EIA, etc will be recruited by the MEYS to carry out
the training courses. For planning purpose, a 5-day national workshop including the Sierra
Leone Environmental Projection Authority, the ESP Coordinator, and technical personnel from
LCs (19 officials) will be organized during the implementation of the project, for a total cost of
US$15,000.

Other Capacity Strengthening Activities
The others capacity building activities the environmental and social management of the EFA FTI
Project are:
Provision for EIA: After the initial screening of sights, it might become necessary to undertake
EIAs during the implementation of EFA FTI activities relating to the construction and
rehabilitation of schools to ensure they are environmentally and socially sound. For planning
purposes about 318 schools are to be constructed and/or rehabilitated. An amount of


                                                                                            25
    US$12,000 has been set aside for an EIA should this become necessary following the
    screening of sites.
    Draft Environmental and Social Guidelines for School Maintenance: An environmental and
    social management guideline for the maintenance of schools and related facilities will be
    prepared by the MEYS with TA from DPs. The guidelines refer to all aspects of building
    maintenance, including the environmental
    The total cost for capacity strengthening is estimated at US$27,000

    8.4      Environmental and Social Monitoring Plan and Indicators
    The Environmental and Social Monitoring Plan monitoring plan covers of a set of mitigation,
    monitoring and institutional measures to be taken during implementation/construction and
    operations of schools and related water and sanitation facilities. The plan aims to eliminate
    adverse environmental and social impacts, offset them, or reduce them to acceptable levels.
    The plan also includes actions needed to implement these measures.
    The objectives for monitoring are to: (i) to alert project authorities and to provide timely
    information about the effectiveness of the Environmental and Social Management process; and
    (ii) to make a final evaluation in order to ensure that mitigation measures designed for the
    construction and rehabilitation of educational facilities have been successful in such a way that
    the pre- program environmental and social conditions have been restored, improved upon or
    worst than before and to determine what further mitigation measures may be required.

    Costs for Implementing the Monitoring Plan
    The Districts/Local Councils will be responsible for monitoring their own Environmental and
    Social Monitoring Plans. The cost of activities will be taken into consideration in the LC Annual
    Work Plans. The cost is however not envisaged to be significant since the IRCBP is already
    funding LCs to provide the same service.

    Public Disclosure
    For an effective and sustainable environmental and social management, there is the need for
    public disclosure in addition to public consultations. The World Bank’s disclosure policy


                                                                                                             26
requires that all safeguard documents are disclosed in the respective countries and at the
Bank’s Infoshop.
The Environmental Assessment and attached Annexes (Annexes 1 to 6) for environmental and
social management will be disclosed in Sierra Leone through wide distribution of the relevant
documents, notices at all LCs, and at the Infoshop of the World Bank.




                                                                                   27
9.       RECOMMENDATIONS

The EFA FTI Project will expand access to and improve the quality of basic education in Sierra
Leone. The project aims to increase enrollments especially new admissions into primary one,
and improve quality of teaching and learning. In this respect, the social benefits of the project
outweighs probable adverse effects deemed insignificant. According to the Word Bank
operational policies, the EFA FTI Project is classified as a category B because the potential
adverse site specific environmental impacts on human populations or environmentally important
areas is comparably low compared to for e.g. the construction of a dam. However, construction
and rehabilitation of schools and related water and sanitation activities could have moderate
adverse impacts, particularly in terms of pollution of ground water supplies and waste
generation during execution of the works. This EA takes cognizance of these environmental and
social considerations. The aspects relating to displacement and resettlement in the unlikely
event that persons will be displaced in order for a school or related facility to be constructed will
be tackled following a site screening exercise.
For better inclusion of the environmental and social requirements in the preparation and
implementation of the EFA FTI activities, the following recommendations are proposed before
the identification of the sites for construction and rehabilitation of school infrastructure:
         identify good environmental practice measures (environmental and social clauses) to be
          included in the contracts for construction and/or rehabilitation
         organize frequent missions (include environmental expects) for the EFA FTI project and
          ensure that the mitigation measures of the EFA FTI project recommended by the EIA are
          complied with
       recruit national expertise in EIA where necessary and for environmental training
        sessions
In addition, the following recommendations are proposed:

The ESP Coordinator and Civil Works Unit which will work with implementing agency (Local
Councils) should undertake to manage operations in a manner that protects the environment
and the health and safety of employees, clients, contractors and the public. To this effect, s/he:
         has overall responsibility for ensuring that the EMPs for the construction and
          rehabilitation activities are prepared and implemented, and that they comply with all
          legislative and contractual requirements
         ensures that non-compliance is addressed
         ensures that contractors fulfill their environmental obligations
         ensures that the RPF if required is prepared and implemented, as required, by qualified
          personnel
         advises managers, supervisors and employees on safety, health and environmental
          requirements, and holds them accountable for their performance
         monitors, evaluates and reports on performance in safety, health an environmental
          protection
         provides training when needed on topics pertaining to environmental protection
         informs personnel that failure to report incidents and willful non-compliance will result in
          disciplinary action in accordance with internal disciplinary guidelines.



                                                                                           28
Contractors will:
      Comply with the environmental guidelines described in Annex 4
      Comply with all of the requirements of the EA and EMP and shall, in accordance with
       accepted standards, employ techniques, practices and methods of construction that will
       ensure compliance with this standard and, in general, minimize environmental damage,
       control waste, avoid pollution, prevent loss or damage to natural resources, and
       minimize effects on surrounding landowners, occupants and the general public
      .Quickly agree with remedial measures and immediately implement these to prevent
       further damage and to repair any damage that may have occurred
      Organize labor, plant, transport and equipment to perform work in accordance with the
       environmental requirements
      Ensure that the EFA FTI project is implemented in accordance with the environmental
       standards specified in the EMP
      Implement agreed actions resulting from routine monitoring, or inspections

In addition the contractor shall implement their own audits to ensure performance with the
requirements of the EMP.
Technical staff in MEYS and LCs will monitor the compliance with these guidelines.




                                                                                    29
 ANNEX 1:                   PROPOSED ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL SCREENING FORM

The proposed Environmental and Social Screening Form is designed to assist in the evaluation of
planned construction and rehabilitation activities under EFA FTI Project. The form is designed to
place information in the hands of implementers and reviewers so that impacts and their mitigation
measures, if any, can be identified and/or requirements for further environmental impact
assessment determined.
The form contains information that will allow reviewers to determine the characteristics of the
prevailing local bio-physical and social environment with an aim to assess the potential impacts
of construction and rehabilitation activities on this environment. The environmental and social
screening form will also assist in identifying potential socio-economic impacts that will require
mitigation measures and/or resettlement and compensation.
