will\n            (a) assist the Government's program of further\n            upgrading its irrigation systems at relatively low cost; and\n            (b) improve drainage and flood protection to increase food\n            production and provide incidental benefits. The project\n            consists of three construction components: Serang Drainage\n            and Flood Protection (61,000 ha), Madium Rehabilitation\n            State II (65,000 ha) and the Pemali-Comal (50,000 ha) and\n            Pekalen-Sampean (70,000 ha) tertiary systems. Also,\n            engineering and design for 105,000 ha new tertiary\n            construction and for 20,000 ha main systems improvement in\n            these project areas will be completed. The project will\n            benefit about 800,000 farm families and will increase food\n            production by about 234,000 tons per year. Risks will be\n            moderate, as are normal for irrigation, flood protection and\n            drainage projects."}, "docdt": "1980-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
