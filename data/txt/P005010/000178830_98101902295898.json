"The Third Development Industrial Bank\n            Project is designed to (i) provide a part of DIB's\n            foreign exchange requirements over about two years with a\n            special effort to assist small scale industrial (SSI)\n            enterprises; (ii) assist DIB strengthening its development\n            banking functions and related organization and procedures;\n            and (iii) finance a program of technical assistance to SSI\n            through institutions other than DIB. The project will be\n            financed by both the Bank and by a loan of $8.75 million\n            from the OPEC Special Fund (OSF), the latter providing all\n            its funds to SSI projects; SSI financing under the Bank loan\n            is estimated at about 10 percent of the loan proceeds, or\n            about $4 million. At the request of OSF the Bank has agreed\n            to administer the OSF loan. The project does not carry\n            special risks."}, "docdt": "1978-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
