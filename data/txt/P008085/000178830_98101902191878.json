assist the\n            Goverment in achieving the objectives of the 15-year\n            educational development plan 1968-1983 by (i) expanding the\n            coverage of the reform in general secondary education to\n            urban and rural areas insufficiently provided with\n            educational facilities, and (ii) extending the reform to\n            technical education and informal training of adult farmers\n            to meet manpower requirements and the need to improve\n            farming productivity and standards of living in rural areas.\n            The project would promote the pattern of secondary education\n            being financed under the Bank's first loan and would\n            complement the reform of vocational and agricultural\n            education which is being supported by the Inter-American\n            Development Bank. The project would comprise: (1) design,\n            construction, furnishing and equipping of 13 secondary\n            schools, 1 teacher training college, 1 technical institute\n            and 1 farmer training center; (2) three farmer training\n            mobile units; and (3) provision of expert services and fellowships."}, "docdt": "1972-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
