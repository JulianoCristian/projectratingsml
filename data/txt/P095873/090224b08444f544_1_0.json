Originally, the survey was\n            intended to analyze both Tetum and Portuguese literacy\n            skills together, however, due to technical requirements the\n            survey was divided into two language strands ex post: Tetum\n            and Portuguese. The Tetum survey yielded interesting results\n            discussed in this report that yield important research\n            questions for future exploration. However, due to the\n            implementation of the current language and curriculum policy\n            as well as resourcing constraints of the Timor Leste\n            education system in Portuguese, findings from the Portuguese\n            survey are inconclusive and should be considered as an aid\n            to future research rather than a baseline survey. Students\n            show grade progression in Tetum language, albeit progression\n            starting from a low base and exhibiting some slowness.\n            Approximately 26 percent of students in Grades 1-3 meet a\n            fluency benchmark of 45 correct words per minute in Tetum\n            which is associated to 70 percent comprehension.\n            Socio-economic, school and specific factors associated with\n            better reading outcomes include speaking Tetum at home,\n            access to printed materials at home, teacher attendance at\n            in-service and reading with family at home."}, "docdt": "2013-12-24T06:11:02Z"}
