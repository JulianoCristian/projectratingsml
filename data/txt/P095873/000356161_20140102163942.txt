6   Building Evidence, Shaping Policy
    Findings of the 2012 Timor-Leste Education Survey
Executive Summary


Reliable evidence is needed to design policies that will allow overcoming Timor-Leste’s remaining
challenges in provision of quality education. In recent post-conflict years, aided by availability of oil
revenues, Timor-Leste has been able to considerably improve availability of schools and access to education.
However, quality of education and ensuring that children actually learn at school remain significant problems
as highlighted by numerous recent assessments and confirmed by a simple performance test undertaken
as part of this study.

This report presents findings of the 2012 Education Survey, a collaboration between the Ministry
of Education, the National Directorate of Statistics, AusAID and the World Bank. The survey collected
detailed information at all primary, pre-secondary and secondary schools in the country. Its objectives were
to support the improvement of Timor-Leste’s education quality and service delivery through building a solid
information source and analytical foundation which will allow for sound, evidence-based policy making.

The survey results indicate that student absenteeism should be a major cause for concern. More than
one third of Grade 1 students were absent from school on the day of the survey, in some districts it was half
or even more. As expected, analysis suggests that opportunity cost matters meaning that students with
longer travel times or which have to help in the household are less likely to attend school.

Students’ understanding of Portuguese, even after four years of instruction, is very low. Results show
that self-reported understanding of Portuguese, after a couple of years of schooling, is minimal with 78
percent of Grade 4 students reporting that they do not understand Portuguese at all or only very little. In
some districts such as Oecusse and Lautem understanding of Tetum is also limited. In relation to this, the
use of local languages in instruction is strikingly high. For instance in Oecusse, almost 98 percent of Grade 4
teachers make use of local languages in the classroom.

Despite ten years of investment, lack of infrastructure remains an issue in this new nation. Student to
classroom ratios are high, in particular in Dili where 48 percent of schools have more than 60 students per
classroom. 33 percent of public schools have no toilets, many no provision of water and only 21 percent of
primary schools use electricity. In regards to school materials, a quarter of primary schools lack Math and
Portuguese textbooks and the majority have no Tetum textbooks.

Education levels of primary school teachers are low, with the majority only having secondary
education. For 71 percent of primary school teachers the highest level of education is secondary school,
for 6 percent it is even lower. Further, there are discussions to convert the large proportion of volunteer
teachers, which have even lower levels of average education, into permanent teachers.

Both demand and supply side interventions are needed to tackle the challenges faced. Some key policy
areas should be: (1) Improving school attendance through creating appropriate demand-side incentives; (2)
Enhancing teacher quality; (3) Strengthening instruction language policy; (4) Improving education system
management; (5) Improving school infrastructure and learning environment; and (6) Ensuring adequate
supply of textbooks.

        Background: Timor-Leste’s Education System


        After emerging from a long struggle for independence and internal conflicts between 1999 and 2006,
        Timor-Leste has made substantial progress towards restoring stability and rebuilding the country.
        Economic growth has been in the double-digits in recent post-conflict years and non-oil GDP has increased
        from $494 in 2007 to $876 in 2010 (IMF, 2012, GDP at current prices). However, poverty rates and other
        human development indicators such as malnutrition and stunting remain high or have even increased in
        recent years. According to the Global Hunger Index, which measures national hunger as a percent of the
        population, Timor-Leste ranked 75th among the 81 countries surveyed (IFPRI, 2011).

        In 2011 the government launched its Strategic Development Plan to transform Timor-Leste into
        an upper-middle-income country by 2030. This plan recognizes that education and training are key
        to improving the life opportunities of the Timorese people as well as are vital to Timor-Leste’s economic
        development and growth. The Strategic Development Plan stresses that the first step should be to remove
        barriers to access to education, however in addition to improving access Timor-Leste has to improve quality
        and equity so that good learning outcomes can be achieved (RDTL, 2011). So far Timor-Leste has made far
        strides in the first step, improving access, however large obstacles in achieving quality education remain.

        Achievements
        With a fast increase in national budget, Timor-Leste has made great progress in restoring basic
        services to the people.1 For instance, access to education has greatly increased at each level (Figure 1).
        Total enrollment from basic to secondary education increased from 242,000 to 333,000 between 2002 and
        2010. In addition, the number of teachers more than doubled during the same period, from 5,700 to over
        12,000, resulting in an overall reduction of the student-teacher ratio from 45:1 to 28:1. Moreover, many new
        schools have been built in recent years.

8   Building Evidence, Shaping Policy
    Findings of the 2012 Timor-Leste Education Survey
The overall enrollment increases in recent years were at faster paces than the population growth
of the relevant age groups and resulted in an increase of the Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER) at each
level. By 2010, the GER of primary education was at 105 percent, and that of pre-secondary and secondary
education was at 74 percent and 61 percent respectively compared to 51 and 28 percent in 2001/2002.

Although education spending as a share of GDP decreased from 22 percent in 2004 to 9 percent in
2010, absolute levels of education spending have increased. Natural resource wealth has allowed an
increase of government expenditure from 13 percent of GDP in 2004 to 25 percent in 2010 supporting the
expansion of the education sector. The increase of public expenditure in education has mostly been at an
even faster pace than enrollment growth in basic and secondary education which equaled around 9-10
percent per annum in recent years.

There has been significant effort to improve service delivery and capacity building in the education
system. A school grants program was introduced by the government of Timor-Leste in 2006 as part of its
commitment to abolish school fees, improving the management and administration of schools and improving
the quality of education. The creation of the Investment Infrastructure Unit (IFU) in 2003 has established a
good record in identifying, designing and managing the school construction program of the MoE. MoE’s
capacity for strategic planning was also strengthened as shown in the preparation of a comprehensive draft
strategic plan for the education sector. Further, the Education Management Information System (EMIS)
was established in 2003 to gather relevant data to monitor key indicators and help in the design of policy
interventions in the sector.

Remaining Challenges
Significant challenges still remain, among others a significant access gap between urban and rural
areas. For instance, the GER at pre-secondary and secondary level are over 100 percent for urban Timorese.
However, it is only 60.5 percent for rural population at pre-secondary level, and 35.4 percent at secondary
level (Figure 2a). The income gap and affordability of education at these levels can be one factor that
contributes to this large disparity (Figure 2b). At the same time, the availability and accessibility of schools
can also be a constraining factor that keeps children of relevant age outside the school system.

When children are in school many of them are not in the right grade, mostly lagging behind in grade
promotion. In Grade 1, 54 percent of the children are older than the school entry age of 6. By Grade 5, the
proportion of overage children reaches 74 percent (Figure 3a). This phenomenon is closely related to the
very high repetition rates particularly in early grades (Figure 3b). For example, nearly 1 in 3 students in Grade

         1 and 1 in 5 in Grade 2 are repeaters. The large proportion of repeaters represents a very inefficient system,
         not only in terms of the need for larger amount of resources in the form of teachers and school places, but
         also in terms of a diluted learning process, as well as a delayed start of productive years in one’s lifetime.

         High repetition rates are often related to poor learning outcomes, particularly at early grades. The
         2009 Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA, 2009), and the 2011 Early Grade Mathematics Assessment
         (EGMA, 2011) provide evidence that education quality is indeed of concern in Timor-Leste. EGRA 2009
         assessed the reading skills of over 900 children in grades 1, 2 and 3 from 40 randomly selected primary
         schools. This assessment, which was conducted in Portuguese and Tetum, showed very poor outcomes.
         More than 70 percent of students at the end of Grade 1 could not read a single word of the simple text
         passage that they were asked to read. 40 percent of children were not able to read a single word at the
         end of grade 2. Only about a third of the students in Grade 3 could read 60 words per minute and respond
         correctly to simple comprehension questions. This is a dismal record after 10 years of continued efforts to
         improve the quality of learning.

         In terms of math, Timorese students exhibit a good concept of quantity, but a relatively weaker gasp
         of patterns in numbers or conceptual understanding of addition and subtraction processes. The 2011
         EGMA measured basic skills of 1,226 Grade 1, 2 and 3 students from 69 primary schools across all 13 districts
         of Timor-Leste. 83 percent of Grade 1 students were able to count up to 20 or more, i.e. performed at the
         expected level, and in general students were relatively comfortable with rational counting. However, only
         about a third of students in Grade 1 could solve simple additions. Barely more than half of students in Grade
         3 could solve all additions, as well as simple subtractions, all of which should be known in both Grades 2 and
         3, and most indeed as an automatic response.

         One factor that can have large influence on early grade learning, and presently one of the most
         contentious policies, is instruction language. During colonial times until 1975, Portuguese was the
         language of administration and used in schools. Under Indonesian occupation, between 1975 and 1999,
         Bahasa Indonesian was the instruction language in schools. After independence in 2002, the Constitution
         of Timor-Leste provides for two official languages, Tetum and Portuguese, and the curriculum is currently
         available in both these languages. However, most textbooks are available only in Portuguese although
         there is an initiative to ensure that early literacy materials are available in both Portuguese and Tetum.
         Despite concerted efforts by the Government, Portuguese as well as Tetum proficiency levels of children
         and teachers remain a concern and may be impeding adequate learning outcomes.




10   Building Evidence, Shaping Policy
     Findings of the 2012 Timor-Leste Education Survey
Education Survey 2012
Overcoming remaining challenges will require the right mix of policies which need to be based on
reliable evidence. The objective of the Timor-Leste 2012 Education Survey was to support the improvement
of Timor-Leste’s education quality and service delivery through building a solid information source and
analytical foundation. There is a clear lack of comprehensive analysis, in particular of what is happening
at the school-level. The purpose and scope of this Education Survey differed and is complementary
to the Education Management Information System (EMIS). Indeed, the survey was not undertaken for
administrative purposes, but for policy analysis, and gathered additional detailed information on school-
level practices and situation. These survey results will facilitate evidence-based policy dialogue among
development partners and the Timor-Leste government.

The 2012 survey obtained representative data on resources, policies and practices at the school level
through face-to-face interviews at all 1372 primary, pre-secondary and secondary schools of Timor-
Leste. The survey consisted of several modules:

   1. The largest component of the survey was answered by the school director (or if not possible, as in
      13.4 percent of cases, by the deputy director or head teacher) and included questions on education
      and background of the director, school background and school management practices.
   2. Further, enumerators completed a short section on the state and availability of infrastructure based
      on their own direct observation.
   3. Enumerators also interviewed 3 randomly selected teachers posing questions on their background,
      teaching methods and classroom conditions. Teachers were selected among those teaching in Grade
      4 for primary schools, Grade 8 for pre-secondary and Grade 11 for secondary schools. In total 3488
      teachers were interviewed.
   4. A student module was answered by 5 randomly selected students from the same grade and class at
      each school. Similar to teachers, students of Grade 4 were interviewed in primary schools, Grade 8 for
      pre-secondary schools and Grade 11 for secondary schools. In total 6829 students were interviewed.
   5. Additional to these items, field teams also conducted a brief reading assessment applying one of the
      tests used during the Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA, 2009). This particular test counts how
      many letters a student can read correctly within 60 seconds out of a list of 100 letters presented in non-
      alphabetical order. In small schools with less than 20 students in Grade 1, the test was administered
      to all Grade 1 students in Tetum. In schools with more than 20 but less than 40 Grade 1 students, 20
      students were randomly selected and tested in Tetum. In schools with more than 40 Grade 1 students
      present, 20 were randomly selected to be tested in Tetum and another 20 were randomly selected
      to be tested in Portuguese. Thus, this simple letter recognition test was conducted in Tetum in 1084
      schools and in 231 schools it was conducted in Portuguese as well.
   6. In addition to these school level questionnaires, a very brief survey was administered to all 13 district
      education authorities.

Field work was conducted from September to November 2012 with some revisits done in December
2012. The 31 survey teams visited all 1372 primary, pre-secondary and secondary schools of Timor-Leste.
The project was a cooperation between the Ministry of Education, the National Directorate of Statistics,
AusAID as well as the World Bank. Field work was undertaken and managed by the National Directorate of
Statistics with procurement and logistical support from a procurement agency working on behalf of AusAID
and with technical support provided by the World Bank. The Ministry of Education provided guidance and
input in instrument design as well as informed all schools of the upcoming survey.

         The Education Survey 2012, a census, includes all 1372 schools in Timor-Leste. As shown in Table 1,
         overall there are 249 schools that offer the entire or partial first cycle (Grades 1-4). 747 schools offer both the
         first and second cycle (Grades 1-6). Moreover, 124 schools offer all three cycles (Grades 1-9) or parts thereof.
         As can be seen, a large number of schools only offer incomplete cycles, likely because many schools are
         rather new. All these types of schools are referred to as Primary Schools or Basic Schools (‘Escola Basika’) in
         this report and a large part of analysis focuses on this subsample of schools. In addition there are 153 pre-
         secondary schools, i.e. schools only offering the third cycle (Grade 7-9). There are 82 general secondary and
         16 vocational secondary schools offering Grades 10-12 or a selection thereof.

         The majority of these 1,372 schools are public with only 210 private schools, most of which in the
         largest cities with 44 in Dili and 75 in Baucau. Many private schools are secondary or pre-secondary
         schools with only 127 being primary. Private schools receive funds from the MoE similar to public schools
         and are similarly divided into central and filial schools, however, have separate clusters to private schools. In
         general, public schools tend to perform slightly better as measured by the simple achievement test in this
         survey and which is discussed later in this report. Further, public schools tend to be better equipped with a
         higher ratio having toilets, electricity, kitchens as well as textbooks.

         About one fifth of primary schools are classified as ‘central’ schools. Since the beginning of 2012 only
         such schools receive funds directly from the ministry and are responsible for distributing resources to their

         2     Seven schools (out of 1372) have missing grade information in the survey data. For the purpose of this table, it is assumed that
               these schools have the standard amount of grades for pre-secondary, secondary and primary schools respectively.

filial schools. 62.3 percent of central schools also state that they provide teaching support, i.e. send teachers
to their filial schools if necessary. In general, central schools are larger, less remotely located and appear to
offer higher grades. As shown in Table 1, central schools appear to offer at least Cycles 1 and 2 (Grades 1-6)
or even all three Cycles (Grades 1-9), whereas many filial primary schools only offer the first Cycle (Grades
1-4) and only a very small proportion of filial schools offers the third Cycle (Grades 7-9).

         School Access and Infrastructure Issues




         Coverage of schools
         Primary schools are well-spread across Timor-Leste, many very remotely located. On average, schools
         are more than two hours from the closest bank, 30 minutes from the Chief of Suco (Chefe de Suco) office,
         50 minutes from the closest clinic, an hour from the closest police station and an hour and a half from the
         closest secondary school.3 22.9 percent of primary schools are two hours or more from the closest clinic,
         29.7 percent two hours or more from closest police station. Figure 5 shows the geographical location of all
         schools in Timor-Leste according to GPS coordinates collected during the Education Survey. It can be seen
         that some areas have fewer schools and many schools are centered along the few existing roads.




         3    These travel times refer to the most common means of transport, which in a vast majority of cases is walking.

         Catchment areas are well-defined with most areas only covered by one school. 73.2 percent of schools
         state that there are no other schools in their location. 43.6 percent of those schools that are in a location
         with multiple schools state that there is only one school that potentially competes for students. Not only is
         there little competition between schools, but schools also do not admit students selectively. The majority
         of primary schools, 71.9 percent, have not rejected any applications in the past three years. If schools do
         have to admit selectively, the first criteria of selection is the student residence’s location for 52.4 percent of
         schools. Academic performance is taken into account by 9.8 percent of those primary schools that do not
         admit all applying students.

         Travel Time
         Average students’ travel time to primary school is relatively short, however in some districts
         a significant fraction of students has to travel for more than an hour.4 Mean travel time of grade 4
         students from home to school is 21 minutes. This varies across districts ranging from an average travel time
         of 39 minutes in Viqueque, 29 minutes in Aileu to 15 in Bobonaro and 11 in Oecussi. Central schools have an
         average travel time of 29 minutes compared to 19 minutes for filial schools which are smaller and located
         more conveniently, closer to the households they are catering to. In certain areas distance to school is an
         issue despite the existence of many new schools and many very remotely located. Overall there are 10.7
         percent of Grade 4 students that take one hour or more to travel to school. Again this varies by district with
         almost a third of students in Viqueque having to travel for an hour or more to reach school (see Figure 9).

         Availability of transport to school appears very limited. The most common means of transport used by
         Grade 4 students to reach school is almost exclusively walking (98.1 percent). 0.6 percent of students take a
         bus, 0.4 percent use a bicycle and 0.1 percent use a boat and 0.9 percent other means.5 Figure 7 shows that
         buses are only common in Dili where 5.8 percent of Grade 4 students travel by bus.


         4    Again these reported travel times refer to using the most common means of transport, which for students is almost exclusively
              walking.
         5    ‘Other means’ is particularly common in Dili and is likely to include rides on scooters by family members or similar.

School Operating Hours
Primary schools are typically open for four hours per day, six days a week. In general, primary schools
have opening hours from 8am to 12am, Monday to Saturday. 70.6 percent of primary schools run one shift
per day, however 28.6 percent run two shifts and 0.8 percent of primary schools run more than two shifts
per day. Primary schools running multiple shifts are typically open from 8am to 12am, as well as for a second
four hour shift in the afternoon from 1pm to 5pm.6 Thus, schools that operate on two shifts are able to offer
the same amount of instruction time as schools that don not.

Pre-school availability
Availability of pre-schools is very low, in particular in certain districts. The Education Survey did not
survey pre-schools directly, however asked primary schools whether they have a pre-school attached.7 It
was found that only 13.8 percent of all primary schools had a pre-school attached or in close proximity. As
shown in Figure 8, there was great variability across districts with this figure ranging from none in Oecusse
to more than 40 percent in Dili. The data shows that for schools in Manatutu, Ermera, Baucau and Covalima
the figure was 7 percent or less.




6    Only very few schools hold more than two shifts. They are typically operating similar hours to schools with two shifts, being
     opened for the same length of an average of 8 hours per day.
7    According to the MoE it is planned that all future pre-schools will be attached to a primary school.

         There are some pre-schools completely separate from primary schools and the survey captured the
         majority, but not all of existing pre-schools. The Education Survey shows 154 pre-schools attached to
         primary schools, according to information from the Directorate of Pre-school Education there were 200 at
         the end of 2012. Figure 9 shows the complete number of pre-schools by district in 2012. Again, it can be
         seen that some districts have hardly any available pre-schools, for instance the entire Oecusse district only
         four in total. Most pre-schools are provided privately either by the Catholic Church or by NGOs such as Plan,
         World Vision or Child Fund.8

18   Building Evidence, Shaping Policy
     Findings of the 2012 Timor-Leste Education Survey
Possibly related to pre-school availability, some children start primary school prematurely. According
to student interviews, 13.4 percent of students started primary school before the official Grade 1 age of
6 years. On the other hand many students, 56.5 percent, first started school older than the official age.
This accords with administrative data from the MoE which shows that for the first grade only 30 percent of
students are at the official school age, with 15 percent being younger and 55 percent older (MoE, 2010).9
The fact that some children start too young and others too old, in addition to high repetition rates, means
that the age range in classes is unusually wide. At the end of the school year, when the school survey was
undertaken, age of 1st graders ranged from 3 to 13 years. On average, Grade 1 students in a specific school
had age differences of 3 years. In 13 percent of schools Grade 1 students were 5 or more years apart in their
age. This can potentially lead to challenges in terms of pedagogy and class management for teachers. Lloyd
(2011) suggests that learning is compromised when classrooms are more age diverse and effects of age
heterogeneity on learning are likely to be greatest in contexts where learning levels are low. Further, the
youngest students seem to suffer disproportionately from such age dispersion in the classroom.

Availability of Special Needs Programs
Only 12.7 percent of schools have special programs for children with special needs. Overall, only 36.7
percent of schools report that they do have any children with special needs in their school such as children
with physical or mental disabilities. This is rather low compared to WHO findings of 18.0 percent disability
rates among adults in lower income countries (WHO, 2011).10 Only 34.5 percent of these schools, i.e. 12.7
percent of all primary schools, have special programs for those children with such special needs.

School Infrastructure
Schools’ physical condition and infrastructure matter for student outcomes. Several studies have
documented that the condition of school buildings affect completion. Sey et al. (2003) and World Bank
(2004a), for instance, show that the availability of certain facilities, such as for water and sanitation,
have a positive relation with school completion. Hanushek (1995) reports that a majority of production
function studies in developing countries found a positive effect of school infrastructure quality on learning
achievement. Joseph and Wodon (2012), for example, show a positive association between availability
of toilets, water and electricity and student test scores. A study in the Philippines found that the lack of
adequate furniture had negative effects on learning levels (Tan, Lane and Coustere, 1997).

Classrooms
Shortage of classrooms is one of the most frequently voiced problems by school directors and teachers
in Timor-Leste. 55.2 percent of school directors believe that shortage of classrooms is a large obstacle to
providing quality education and 49.1 percent of them believe it hinders student learning to a large extent.
Similarly, 48.1 percent of primary school teachers believe that shortage of classrooms constitutes a large
obstacle for students’ learning, only second in importance to shortages in textbooks. 42.8 percent of school
directors, if given additional resources, would use them to increase infrastructure such as classrooms as their
first priority.


9   Some of these older children are repeaters and might have started school at the correct age.
10 In the World Disability Report (2011) the WHO estimates the disability rate among adults across 59 countries and finds an average
   disability rate of 15.6 percent, ranging from 11.8 percent in higher income to 18.0 percent in lower income countries. Disability
   rates are likely to be even higher in post-conflict countries. However, these figures relate to adults, disability rates among school-
   age children are likely to be much lower. Yet, it is surprising that 63.3 percent of schools report that they do not have any children
   with special needs. (Disability rates according to the Timor-Leste Census (2010) are only 4.6 percent, however this is likely due to
   methodology and restrictive definition of disability).

         Students to classroom ratios are very high, in particular in Dili.11 According to the survey data, on
         average there are 39 students per classroom. However, 38.3 percent of primary schools have more than 45
         students per classroom and 21.2 percent of schools more than 60 students per classroom. This shortage of
         classrooms is most severe in Dili where 67.5 percent of schools have more than 45 students per classroom,
         and 48.1 percent more than 60. Generally central schools tend to be more overcrowded, with a higher ratio
         of students per existing classroom. There is not much difference between public and private schools but
         filial schools have smaller student-classroom ratios than central schools.

         Many schools with a shortage of classrooms run two shifts in order to be able to teach all their
         students. Overall, 29.4 percent of Timorese primary schools run more than one shift per day. 28.6 percent
         run two shifts and 0.8 percent more than two. 64.8 percent of schools having more than 60 students per
         classroom run multiple shifts compared to 13.2 percent of schools with a student/classroom ratio of less
         than 45 (see Figure 11). In Dili, where classrooms are particularly overcrowded, 72.4 percent of primary
         schools run multiple shifts per day.



         11 Student to classroom ratios are calculated by dividing the total number of students, according to class lists provided by the
            school director, by the total number of classrooms at the school. Student/Classroom ratios are useful indicators of overcrowded
            classrooms.

There doesn’t appear to be evidence that learning time is reduced due to multiple shifts. The Education
Survey collected detailed timetables for one Grade 4 class in every school. Learning time according to this
information for Grade 4 students is on average 3.5 hours per day, 6 days a week. This does not appear to
differ between those schools running multiple shifts and those that do not, which indicates that schools
which are forced to run multiple shifts due to classroom constraints do not reduce learning time to be able
to provide these additional shifts, or at least not for Grade 4 students. It is possible that only teaching hours
for earlier grades are reduced. However, examining opening hours of all primary schools indicates that this
is unlikely. Schools that run multiple shifts are opened on average for 8 hours per day, exactly twice as long
as schools without multiple shifts which are on average only opened for four hours per day.

Not only classrooms but also school furniture such as desks and chairs are lacking. In some cases
students have to stand for their lesson as there are not enough available seats. According to the survey,
schools are estimated to have on average 28.5 percent more students than available seats.12 28 percent of
schools have more than twice as many students than seats, already taking into account that these schools
might run multiple shifts. 22.9 percent of schools have no desks for teachers in the classroom.

Toilets, Water Source and Electricity
Almost a third of primary schools still have no toilet facilities on site. 32.3 percent of primary schools,
in particular 37.1 percent of all filial schools, have no toilet facilities at their location (Figure 12). Such poor
sanitation conditions impact students’ health and have been shown to impact student absenteeism, in
particular of girls (see for instance, Dreibelbis et al., 2012).13 The Education Survey captures the type of toilet
facility at every school, however does not collect further information on their use and maintenance. A recent
study (World Bank, 2011) undertook a small survey of Dili schools and found that even if toilets existed
there are by far too few for the amount of students; toilets don’t meet the need of the youngest students in
terms of height and size; they are not sex segregated and are often claimed by teachers. Maintenance is also
problematic with pits/septic tanks rarely being emptied.

12 Survey interviewers were instructed to directly observe contents and state of one Grade 4 classroom. Calculations here assume
   that all classes of the school on average have the same amount of seats.
13 Dreibelbis et al. (2012) show that indicators of school sanitation quality and cleanliness are clearly associated with school absence,

         Many schools lack a safe source of drinking water and water to wash hands. 16.5 percent of schools
         have no water provision at all, relying on rainwater or rivers nearby. Only about half of schools have tap
         water available on site.

         Only a minority of schools uses electric lighting in classrooms. Although 41 percent of households in
         Timor-Leste now use electric lighting (HIES, 2011), only 21.1 percent of primary schools use electricity in
         classrooms. Even in Dili where 94.6 percent of households use electric lighting, only 48.7 percent of schools
         do. In some districts such as Manufahi and Oecusse the percentage of schools with electric lighting is below
         10 percent.

         Quality education is not only about physical inputs such as textbooks, classrooms and teachers, but
         also about incentives that lead to better instruction and learning. The provided resources have to be
         translated into services effectively and efficiently. Institutional incentives that affect learning outcomes
         are, for instance, the degree of school autonomy, school accountability as well as choice and competition
         (Bruns, 2011). If parents can choose to send their children to a better performing school, these demand-side
         pressures can provide incentives for improvement. Local decision making and fiscal decentralization can
         positively impact learning outcomes if service providers are held accountable. Many countries are moving
         towards school-based-management where schools are given more autonomy over the use of inputs and
         held accountable for using these efficiently.

         Even though decentralizing service delivery has been on the government agenda, Timor-Leste’s
         education system is currently highly centralized. Indeed, most decisions lie with the central ministry
         according to legislation. However, Table 2 shows de facto decision making authority according to school
         directors. As can be seen the director holds little authority in personnel or budget decisions, but more
         influence on teaching and student assessment decisions.14 Interestingly, 39.8 percent of directors state that
         they decide on instruction content and 35.7 percent state that they are responsible to make decisions on
         which subjects should be taught.

         Schools are expected to receive about 17 inspection visits per year from district and regional
         office staff. There are 13 district offices which currently have little independence from the central level,
         however this might change with ongoing decentralization efforts. According to regulation, district offices
         are responsible for the implementation of education policies at pre-school, basic education and recurrent
         education level. This means implementation of all policies regarding logistics, such as distribution of school
         materials and school feeding, all data collection and support for and maintenance of infrastructure and
         equipment. The five regional offices are focused on vocational and general secondary schools. According
         to office directors, regional offices inspect each school on average around 12 times per year. Additionally,
         schools can expect an average of 5 inspection visits from district offices per year, varying widely by district.
         According to office directors, district inspectors check student and teacher attendance, condition of school
         facilities, evaluate teacher and director effectiveness and check school accounting during their inspection
         visits. They provide a written report for each of their visits. The most common request made by schools to
         district inspectors is to provide more teachers to the school.

         Parents appear relatively active with Parent Teacher Associations (PTA) in place in almost all schools
         and performance information provided to them according to school directors. 97.8 percent of primary
         school directors state that student assessments are used to report student achievement to parents. 95.7
         percent of schools report on the child’s performance relative to other students, 73.3 percent report on the
         child’s performance relative to the national or district standard and 66.2 percent of schools report on the
         school’s overall academic performance relative to other schools. 57.0 percent of directors report that there
         is a high and constant pressure exerted by parents to achieve higher academic performance. 31.7 percent
         of directors state that there is some pressure on the side of parents and only 11.3 percent of schools report
         little or no pressure from parents to improve performance. Parent Teacher Associations were introduced by
         law and exist in 90.2 percent of all primary schools. 96.6 percent of those schools that have a PTA state that
         it has been active in the current school year. 57.9 percent of directors from schools with active PTAs state
         that the PTA has a large influence, 31.4 percent state that it has some influence and 10.7 percent state that
         it does not affect the way the school is run.

         Teachers receive feedback on their teaching, however there are no incentives, monetary or otherwise,
         associated with good performance. In the school year 2012, 76.1 percent of teachers received comments
         about their teaching from the director, 50.3 percent from a senior teacher or peer, 58.3 percent from a PTA
         and 45.2 percent from the district education office. 22.4 percent of those that receive feedback from their
         director receive it yearly, 30.2 percent received it every semester, 14.2 percent quarterly, and 33.2 monthly or
         more. 61.2 percent of teachers received an oral evaluation of performance from the director in this school
         year, 84.8 percent received a written evaluation assessment. It is interesting to note that voluntary teachers
         are less likely to receive an oral or written evaluation assessment. Only 47.5 percent of voluntary primary
         school teachers received an evaluation compared to 65.5 percent of other teachers, similarly only 56.0
         percent received a written performance evaluation compared to 93.7 percent of others. Only 5.2 percent of
         teachers stated that teachers who perform receive any kind of incentive, cash, in-kind, awards or other, in
         this school-year.

Director Proﬁle
The director’s role is very important; as the manager, directors are responsible for the overall
functioning of their school. They provide leadership, monitor and enforce student conduct and ensure
the curriculum is properly implemented. In addition, they support teachers, evaluate their performance,
assign them to classrooms and make decisions on hiring and dismissal of volunteer and contract teachers
and recommendations on permanent teachers. International evidence suggests that successful leadership
can play an important part in improving student learning (Leithwood, 2004). For instance, Dhuey and Smith
(2011) show, using the mobility of directors across schools to identify effects, that director quality can boost
primary school students’ performance as measured by math and reading achievement tests.15

Average education levels of Timor-Leste’s school directors are low. As shown in Figure 15, education
levels are relatively low with 51.4 percent of primary school directors only having secondary education and
1.6 percent merely primary education. 38.3 percent attended an academy and 6.9 percent university. 87.9
percent of primary school directors are male and their median age is 46. They work a median of 24 hours per
week earning an average monthly base salary of $247. In the past 12 months 12.3 percent of directors had
other jobs in addition to being school director.

15 Dhuey and Smith (2011) use data from British Columbia, Canada, to quantify the importance of school directors in the production
   of student test score gains for 4th and 7th Grade students. The paper makes use of high mobility of directors and uses longitudinal
   administrative data to estimate school director fixed effects which measure the impact of all unchanging characteristics of a
   director that are transferable between schools, such as leadership ability and personality.

         Many primary school directors are inexperienced in their role as director. On average directors have
         been at their current school for 11 years, 3 years of which as the director. However, many directors, in
         particular of filial schools, are very newly appointed. Indeed, for 23.7 percent of all primary school directors
         2012 was the first year on the job. In Aileu, Bobonaro and Covalima districts more than one third of directors
         were in their first year as a director in 2012. These newly appointed directors tend to have lower education
         levels on average than directors that have been on the job for at least since 2011 (see Figure 15).

         Table 3 provides an overview of activities performed by primary school directors. Many substitute
         absent teachers several times a week or at least once every week, on the other hand almost 30 percent
         never do. More than half of directors also help individual students with learning difficulties at least once
         per month. As expected, directors perform management activities such as observing teachers during
         instruction, recording their attendance, holding coordination meetings and managing administrative tasks.
         However, only 48.9 percent of directors have attended any type of management training in the past 6 years.
         Out of those directors that were newly appointed in 2012 and are new to the role of director, only 27.9
         percent received any type of management training in line with their new duties.

         School Feeding and School Health Programs




         Primary schools almost universally report to be providing school feeding and to be receiving food for
         this purpose in line with policy. 95.2 percent of directors state that their schools provide school feeding
         and 96.5 percent report that they have received food such as rice from the MoE or other sources in the 2012
         school year. Interestingly this does not appear to differ significantly with the remoteness of the school. 90.1
         percent of schools state that they prepare food, despite the fact that only 68.6 percent of primary schools
         have kitchens. Private schools are less likely to provide school feeding, although a much higher proportion
         is equipped with a kitchen, and fewer receive food from the MoE or other sources, 86.4 percent compared
         to 97.8 for public schools.

         Despite such reports, 21 percent of primary school students did not receive food on the previous
         school day. When interviewed only 79.1 percent of Grade 4 students report to have received school
         feeding on the day prior to the survey interview. This proportion is lower for private schools of which also
         a lower proportion reported to have a school feeding program and for which a lower proportion received
         food from the MoE. The proportion of students having received school feeding doesn’t appear to differ
         between central and filial schools. Interestingly, it appears that in public schools that do not have a kitchen,
         a similar share of students received school feeding as in those schools that are equipped with a kitchen.
         This is possible due to community and parent support. As is shown in Figure 16 the percentage of students
         receiving school feeding varies by districts with some having surprisingly low levels. In Liquica, for example,
         only 48.6 percent of students report having received school feeding. This does not appear to be driven by
         the fact that schools do not receive food inputs, in Liquica 96.5 percent of primary schools do report having
         received food from the MoE or other sources.

         A majority of primary schools report to be promoting good health practices. 86.3 percent of directors
         state that their school regularly promotes health practices such as washing hands before eating, brushing
         teeth and other practices. 43.1 percent of schools state that they provided students with deworming
         treatments during the 2012 school year.16

         16 In addition to this school-level deworming reported by directors, UNICEF has been undertaking deworming interventions at
            community level.

         Teacher Proﬁle
         Education level of primary school teachers is very low with the majority only having secondary
         education. 61 percent of Timor-Leste’s Basic School/Primary school teachers are male with a median age of
         41.17 On average, they have 7 years of teaching experience. 3.6 percent of these teachers only hold primary,
         70.8 percent only secondary education with 17.2 percent having frequented an academy and 5.8 percent
         university. In some districts (see Figure 18) more than 90 percent of teachers only have secondary education
         or less. Dili has the highest educated teachers with more than half having more than secondary education.

         17 This refers to all teachers (voluntary, permanent as well as contract teachers) in Escola Basika/Primary schools, i.e. schools that
            include grades below Grade 7 of which there are 1166. In these schools, only teachers that teach in grade 4 were interviewed.
            Three were randomly selected at each school regardless of school size. The presented results are weighted to correctly represent

Median monthly income of teachers is $23818, with teachers spending on average 24 hours per week
teaching and 2 hours performing other duties at the school.19 20 64.6 percent are paid though direct


18 This compares to an average wage of all paid employees of $174 (Labor Force Survey, 2010).
19 These self-reported working hours differ from the law which states that teachers should be working 40h/week; 24h/week on
   teaching and the rest (16 h/week) should be devoted to other non-classroom activities. It appears that much less time is invested
   in non-teaching activities than expected by regulation.
20 Average weekly hours worked by teachers are the same in primary schools that run multiple shifts and those that do not. This
   seems to suggest that schools which run a second shift in the afternoon have more teachers, and might be forced to run multiple
   shifts more due to classroom than teacher constraints.

         deposit in the bank from the treasury, 7.8 percent are paid directly by the school and 10.7 percent by the
         district office. The median travel time to collect salary is one hour and a half with 10 percent of teachers
         traveling for 5 hours or more. This is high and likely to impact teacher attendance at least once per month.

         15.1 percent of school teachers had a second job in the past 12 months. 79.9 percent of teachers with
         a second job were unpaid laborers working for the family. 8.7 percent were teaching for a second school.
         When holding a second job, the median amount of hours spent on the second job per week were 12 hours.
         Median earnings from other jobs, of those teachers with another job, in the past 12 month was $70.

         Teachers receive a considerable amount of training during the school year, yet is does not appear
         effective or sufficient given learning outcomes. In 2012, 67.8 percent of teachers received training in
         subject knowledge with a median length of 6 days and 52.9 percent in pedagogical knowledge again with
         a median length of 6 days. The highest amount of training is provided in Portuguese proficiency, with 70.6
         percent of teachers having received Portuguese training in 2012 for a median length of 8 days.21 However,
         69.4 percent of teachers receiving training saw the Portuguese training as insufficient. Interestingly, as
         shown in Figure 19, in Dili the lowest proportion of primary school teachers received Portuguese training in
         2012, only 41.1 percent compared to 89.9 in Manufahi.

         Volunteer teachers
         Timor-Leste has an unusually high proportion of voluntary teachers. Indeed, 23.7 percent of all primary
         school teachers are volunteers. In particular private schools rely heavily on voluntary teachers with 33.7
         percent compared to 22.5 percent in public schools. The share of voluntary teachers also differs by district
         with more than one third of teachers being voluntary in Oecusse and Ermera (Figure 20). Most voluntary
         teachers are completely unpaid, according to the survey 66.5 percent receive no salary. Of those that receive
         some payment, on average they receive $50 per month.

         21 The amount of training reported here includes any type of training received by the teachers. The main training provider is
            INFORDEPE which provides an intensive training program to all teachers which do not have the minimum qualifications and
            competences according to the law (proficiency in the official language; technical knowledge in their area and level of education;
            pedagogical techniques; professional ethics).

It appears that, generally, voluntary teachers are less educated and experienced than permanent
teachers. Almost all of them, 89.0 percent, only have secondary education with only 4.3 percent having
frequented an academy and 3.9 percent university. They are younger, with an average age of 29 compared
to 43 of other types of teachers, and thus also less experienced with an average of only 4 years of teaching
experience compared to 11 years for permanent or contract teachers. 45.9 percent of voluntary teachers are
female compared to 37.4 other primary school teachers.

Voluntary teachers appear to work the same amount of hours at the school, however more hold a
second job on the side. A statistically significant larger share of voluntary teachers hold a second job, 21.7
compared to 13.1 percent. Those that do have a second job worked 14 hours on average per week compared
to 12 hours of those non-volunteer teachers that had a secondary job. For 74.5 percent of voluntary teachers

         with a second job, this is also unpaid work for the family. 7.6 percent also teach in other schools and 18.0
         percent have non-teaching jobs. Median earnings from other jobs in the past 12 months was $100.

         Voluntary teachers received a similar amount of training to other types of teachers. In the school
         year 2012, 60.4 percent of voluntary teachers received training on subject knowledge, 42.1 percent on
         pedagogical knowledge and 69.1 percent on Portuguese language which is overall slightly less than for
         other types of teachers.22

         Discussion with the MoE shows that these volunteer teachers are ‘pipeline’ permanent teachers.
         There is a plan to convert a large percentage of current volunteer teachers into permanent positions as has
         been done in the past. Thus, the incentive to work without salary is to eventually receive a secure, well-paid
         civil servant job. There are no clear guidelines in how school directors select voluntary teachers, however, if
         these are converted into permanent positions quality control and training needs to be put in place.

         Class Size
         Average class size in Grade 1 is 37, however the distribution is uneven. 25.9 percent of schools have 50
         or more students per Grade 1 class, 5.5 percent of schools 80 students or more. These average Grade 1 class
         sizes vary from 51 in Ermera to 26 in Manufahi (Figure 22). For example, Dili has relatively large class sizes
         with 36.1 percent of schools having at least 50 students per class. Class sizes are largest for earliest grades
         with the average class size dropping from 37 in Grade 1 to 25 in Grade 6 (see Figure 23). This is related
         to high repetition rates in early Grades and drop-out rates at higher grades. Note that Figure 23 shows
         theoretical class sizes if all students appear to school. As discussed in the section on student absenteeism,
         absenteeism rates are highest for early grades and thus in practice class sizes of those students actually
         appearing to class might be similar in Grade 1 and Grade 6. These average class sizes compare to an OECD
         average of 21.4 across primary education (OECD, 2011).

         22 Most volunteer teachers were identified by the MoE last year, although since then more volunteer teachers have started. The
            identified volunteer teachers are equally required to take the intensive training provided by INFORDEPE if they do not have the
            specified minimum qualifications and competencies.

School Size
On average, primary schools have a total of 177 students. This varies between central and filial schools,
with central schools having an average of 304 students compared to 157. The largest schools are located in
Dili where primary schools have a median of 453 students.

Student Evaluation
Most teachers evaluate students more than once per month. Timor-Leste has national examinations at
grade 9 and 12 which are predominantly used for selection into university. Assessments at lower level and
classroom assessments are dependent on district and individual school’s policy. There appears to be limited
guidance on the use of assessments at all levels including during teacher and school director training (World
Bank, 2013). The Education Survey collected information on the actual student evaluation practice at school
level. According to Grade 4 teachers, 22.8 percent evaluate students more than every week, 30.3 percent
once every week or multiple times per month, 14.3 percent once every month or less and 32.7 percent once
every semester or less. 78.9 percent of schools give homework every week. According to teachers, student
evaluations are used to identify problems and improve the content of classes, identify students in need of
assistance and report progress to parents.

Textbooks
Availability of textbooks, in particular of Tetum books, is still very low. In 32.2 percent of primary
schools more than three students share one mathematics textbook, 24.3 percent have no book at all. This
is similar for Portuguese textbooks. The availability of Tetum textbooks is particularly restricted with 56.7
percent of schools having no books at all. Figure 24 shows the percentage of primary schools with no Tetum
textbooks or more than 20 students per textbook. Interestingly, Dili has comparatively poorer conditions
with 75.4 percent of primary schools having no textbooks.

         Shortage of textbooks is the main obstacle mentioned by teachers and directors. 59.9 percent of
         teachers believe that the lack of textbooks creates a large obstacle for students’ learning. 62.0 percent of
         directors state that it is a large obstacle to providing quality education and 59.2 percent of primary school
         directors state that it hinders students’ learning to a large extent. In line with these perceptions, international
         evidence shows that availability of textbooks impacts student achievement and can have a high marginal
         return compared to other inputs, in particular in settings where they have been scarce (World Bank, 2004).

         Language in Schools
         Instruction language is one of the most debated and controversial policies currently in place in Timor-
         Leste. During colonial times until 1975, Portuguese was the language of instruction in schools. Under
         Indonesian occupation between 1975 and 1999, Bahasa Indonesian was used. After independence in 2002
         the Constitution of Timor-Leste specified Tetum and Portuguese as the two official languages and further
         legislation stipulated that these would be the languages used in school instruction. Many have voiced
         concern that the proficiency level of children’s and teachers’ Portuguese as well as Tetum may be impeding
         learning outcomes. Proponents of switching to mother tongue instruction cite international evidence in
         improving learning outcomes through mother tongue teaching, while opponents are concerned about
         further marginalization of certain population groups (Issues Note).

         According to the Education Survey, 56.8 percent of grade 4 students have a mother tongue that is
         neither of the two official instruction languages. In line with the latest census results, for 45.2 percent of
         grade 4 students the mother tongue is Tetum, for almost the entire remaining majority, 56.5 percent, it is a
         different local language. Only 0.3 percent of students have Bahasa Indonesian as their mother tongue and
         Portuguese as a mother tongue is almost nonexistent at 0.02 percent.

A high proportion of teachers make use of local languages other than Tetum in classrooms. 97 percent
of primary school teachers state that they use Tetum, 95 percent Portuguese for instruction purpose. Teachers
might be overstating their use of Portuguese or Tetum in instruction in order to appear to comply with
national policy. However, strikingly 45.6 percent of primary school teachers report that they also use other
local languages in instruction. This means that while fierce debates have been taking place on a national
level on whether Timor-Leste should switch to some form of mother tongue teaching, effectively some
form of mother tongue teaching has been taking place in a majority of schools. In secondary schools the
use of Bahasa Indonesian is still very common with 31.5 percent of teachers also using Bahasa Indonesian
in instruction.

         In some districts the use of local languages in instruction is strikingly high. In Oecusse almost
         98 percent of teachers teaching Grade 4 state that they use local languages in instruction. In Baucau it
         is 90.5 percent and in Lautem 77.9 percent. Filial schools which tend to be more remotely located make
         stronger use of local languages as well as private schools (Figure 27). In general, a higher proportion of those
         teachers with low education levels appear to make use of local languages. Further, those teachers which
         teach Grade 1 and 2 as opposed to only higher Grades are more likely to use local languages indicating that
         local language instruction might be more prevalent during the first years at school.

         Even after four years of instruction in Portuguese, students’ self-reported understanding of the
         language is extremely poor. 30.3 percent of Grade 4 students towards the end of the school year state
         that they do not understand Portuguese at all, an additional 47.9 percent state that they understand and

speak very little. Only 3.7 percent of Grade 4 students understand and speak Portuguese well. Even among
secondary school students understanding of Portuguese is very limited. Among Grade 11 students still only
12.9 percent state that they understand Portuguese well and 65.5 percent state that they only understand
very little (see Figure 28). By the end of Grade 4, 81.2 percent of students understand Tetum well and 8.8
percent understand some. By this point, a higher percentage of students have a good understanding of
Tetum than of other local languages.

In some districts the understanding of Tetum is also still limited. In Oecusse and Lautem more than 50
percent of Grade 4 students at the end of Grade 4, i.e. after at least four years of schooling, still understand
no Tetum or very little (see Figure 30). This might not be surprising given the high level of local language

         tongue (Figure 25) and likely many students begin school without any prior knowledge of Tetum. As shown,
         many teachers (in Oecussi as many as 98 percent) communicate by using local languages. The fact that
         many children still do not understand Tetum by the end of Grade 4 indicates that these teachers do not use

         local language. Despite such concerning weaknesses in Tetum proficiency in some districts, understanding
         of Portuguese is still much more limited in every district, ranging from 93% of students not understanding
         Portuguese or only very little in Covalima to 63 percent in Manufahi.

         22.9 percent of teachers believe that students’ poor comprehension of the instruction language
         hinders learning to a large extent. An additional 17.2 percent of teachers state that poor language
         proficiency obstructs students’ learning to some extent. This is less than the share of teachers reporting
         infrastructure or material shortages as large obstacles, however, still constitutes a considerable proportion
         of teachers. Interestingly, those districts that have the highest proportion of non-Tetum mother tongue
         students such as Oecusse, Lautem and Viqueque (Figure 25) are not necessarily the districts in which
         the highest proportion of teachers report poor language comprehension as a large obstacle (Figure 31).
         Neither are those districts which report the weakest understanding of Tetum (Oecusse and Lautem) or those
         districts where students report the weakest understanding of Portuguese (Covalima, Ainaro and Aileu,
         Figure 28) necessarily those districts in which teachers complain. There are many plausible explanations.
         One possibility is that not only the proportion of non-Tetum mother tongue students matters, but also the
         distribution of local languages spoken. Oeucsse and Lautem, the districts with the lowest Tetum prevalence,
         each have one main local language, Baikenu in Oecussi and Fataluku in Lautem, making the use of local
         languages in instruction easier. Both Manatutu and Bobonaro, the districts in which the highest proportion
         of teachers reported poor language comprehension to be a large obstacle, are districts in which there is not
         one main local language, but a segregation of different language groups (see Figure 32).

Only a minority of schools provide special support to students that do not understand the instruction
language. When asked what they do about students that cannot understand Portuguese or Tetum, 82.8
percent of school directors state that in such cases the teacher will switch to using a different language that
children can understand. This statement is supported by the vast amount of teachers reporting to use local
languages in instruction. Only 9.3 percent of schools give students with language difficulties additional
instruction and only at 3.5 percent of schools do these children attend preparatory programs. In some

         percent of directors state that students with language difficulties receive additional instruction. In Oecusse
         22.6 percent of primary schools have students attend preparatory language programs.

         Grade Repetition
         Repetition rates in Timor-Leste are unusually high. 40.5 percent of Grade 4 students have repeated at
         least once, 9.8 percent have repeated more than once by Grade 4. Grade 1 repetition rate is 21.0 percent,
         varying widely between districts and ranging from 34.3 percent in Bobonaro to 7.5 percent in Dili (see Figure
         34).23 Figure 33 shows that this is high in regional comparison.

         The most commonly cited reason for high student repetition rates by school directors is student
         absenteeism. 38.6 percent of primary school directors state that the main reason for repetition is
         absenteeism, 36.5 percent state that some Grade 1 students start too young and 15.9 percent state that
         students repeat because they do not understand the instruction language. Grade 4 students were also
         asked why they had to repeat and 37.8 percent stated that they had to repeat because they still could not
         read, 27.5 percent stated that they had been sick and thus absent too often and 9.2 percent stated that they
         were too young.




         23 According to the Education Statistical Yearbook 2008/2009 Grade 1 repetition rate was 31%, i.e. higher than current repetition rates
            according to the Education survey. Newer EMIS figures are not yet available.

     Findings of the 2012 Timor-Leste Education Survey
Absenteeism
Teacher Absenteeism
13.1 percent of primary school teachers and 24.9 percent of secondary school teachers were absent
on the day of the survey. The school survey team contacted schools prior to arrival and schools had been
informed about the education survey by a letter from the Ministry of Education. Thus, this figure could
underestimate usual teacher absenteeism if teachers were more likely to appear given that the MoE had
announced an education survey.24 Teacher absenteeism rates are higher in central schools, 14.4 compared
to 12.7 percent in filial schools, and in public schools where it is 13.4 percent compared to 10.7 percent in
private schools (Figure 35).

The most common reasons cited by teachers for their absence were illness (28.1 percent) and working
on another job (28.1 percent).25 19.5 percent of teachers stated that they were absent due to the weather,
which is surprising given that the survey was undertaken in dry season. 5.2 percent of teachers were absent
due to pregnancy or post-natal care, 5 percent were attending a ceremony (Figure 36). Absenteeism rates
were higher for female teachers (15 percent compared to 11.8 percent for male teachers). Given the extremely
high fertility rates in Timor-Leste it is perhaps not surprising that 11.5 percent of all female teachers were
absent due to pregnancy or post-natal care.




24 By similar logic, these figures might overestimate teacher absenteeism if teachers were more likely to be absent on the day of the
   survey, for instance because they assumed they wouldn’t have to teach anyway because something else was happening at the
   school.
25 Survey interviewers were instructed to create a roster and write down the names of all Grade 4 teachers (in the case of primary
   schools). Then for each teacher enumerators asked whether he/she is present and if not, asked the director or other teachers for
   the reason of their absence.

         Student Absenteeism
         More than one third of Grade 1 students were absent on the day of the survey. The school survey
         collected information on student attendance in several ways. Student rosters for Grade 1 and Grade 4 provide
         information on actual attendance on the day of the survey. In addition a sample of Grade 4 students was
         interviewed and asked regarding their attendance during the previous 7 days, a timespan that is still easily
         remembered. Average observed absenteeism rate of Grade 4 students was 17.3 percent. When interviewing
         present students, 38.7 percent reported that they had been absent from school at some point during the
         last 7 days. Absenteeism rates of Grade 1 children were even higher than for Grade 4, with 35.9 percent of
         students missing on the day of the survey.

Absenteeism rates were higher in primary schools with long average travel time to school. Figure
37 shows Grade 1 absenteeism rates on the day of the survey by districts and different types of schools.
Shockingly, in Ainaro, Aileu and Ermera more than half of Grade 1 students could not be found when survey
teams visited the school.26 Absenteeism rates were lower in private than in public schools. In schools with an
average travel time above 30 minutes absenteeism rates were above 40 percent compared to 34.1 percent
in other schools.

Absenteeism rates appeared higher in those schools that did not provide food to students on the
previous school day. Those primary schools where interviewed students reported not to have received
any school feeding on the previous day had an absenteeism rate of 40.1 percent compared to an average of
34.9 percent in other schools.

Male students, on average, had slightly higher absenteeism rates. Figure 38 reports observed Grade 4
student absenteeism on the day of the survey. 19.3 percent of male and 15.9 percent of female students were
not present when the field teams visited the primary school. This is in line with research such as Schiefelbein
and Farrell (1980) or Psacharopoulos and Arriagada (1989) which show gender differences in education
attributed to the fact that forgone earnings are higher for older boys than for girls. In other contexts
however, notably in Nigeria and Uganda (Kazeem, Jensen and Stokes, 2010 and Wells, 2009 respectively),
higher absenteeism rates among girls have been found.




26 Concerns have been raised that administrative lists might include ghost students which are added by schools to inflate their per-
   student transfers. Field workers were advised to use class lists (often posted in classrooms) to determine who should be present in
   theory. The reported absenteeism rates should thus not be inflated by the presence of ‘ghost children’.

         Students in Timor-Leste appear to be performing a large amount of chores in the household. More
         than 90 percent of students report to be collecting water and firewood at home. Perhaps not surprisingly,
         given one of the highest fertility rates and household sizes in the world, many children also report to be
         helping with taking care of siblings at home (Table 5).

         Students who have to take care of siblings or livestock at home have a higher average absenteeism
         rate. Figure 39 shows the percentage of Grade 4 students that report having been absent from school in
         the previous seven days in their interview by different student characteristics. 40.5 percent of those children
         who report that they help taking care of siblings at home had been absent in the previous week. 41.3 percent
         of Grade 4 students reporting that they normally help at home taking care of livestock report having been
         absent, compared to 30.8 percent of those students that do not. Children with a low understanding of the
         instruction languages, Tetum and Portuguese, on average had higher absenteeism rates.27



         27 Note that the statistics reported here are simple correlations. A higher average absenteeism rate for children with poor
            understanding of languages doesn’t mean that a poor understanding of the instruction language causes children to stay home
            from school. It could be that children with certain household or location background know these languages less and also have
            different attendance rates because of these household or location characteristics. Similarly, it could be that children with certain
            characteristics attend school less and because of this know these languages less.

In line with these observed correlations, when asked for reasons of their absence, 37.7 percent of
Grade 4 students reported that they had been absent from school to work at home, either to take care
of a younger sibling, a sick relative or to help at home in other ways (Figure 41a).28 A similar share, 37.1
percent, reported that the main reason for their absence was illness. Grade 4 teachers were also asked about
the main reason for student absenteeism according to their information. 60 percent of teachers reported
illness as the most important reason for absence, a much higher share than self-reported by students.

         Simple regression analysis confirms that opportunity cost matters. Travel time to school as well as
         whether the household owns time-intensive livestock such as horses appears significantly correlated with
         student absenteeism when controlling for school characteristics. In terms of school conditions, whether
         the school has any type of toilet as well as over-crowdedness of classrooms is significantly associated with
         absenteeism even when controlling for other school resources and socio-economic background of students
         (see Annex A).29

         Student Performance
         Parallel to other modules of the Education Survey, a ‘letter recognition’ test was undertaken. Such letter
         reading tests are the most basic of assessments of student reading preparedness (Grove, 2006). Alphabetic
         knowledge is correlated with phonological processing, and an important predictor of early reading skill and
         reading development of children, both native and non-native speakers (Chiappe et al., 2002). During this
         assessment, the student is presented with a box of 100 letters (see Table 6) in random, non-alphabetical
         order using large and clear font. The student is then asked to read out these letters and the assessor counts
         how many letters the student can recognize correctly within 60 seconds. Letters are presented in random
         order to prevent students from reciting a memorized alphabet. This simple letter reading test was one of the
         multiple tests used during the comprehensive EGRA assessment undertaken in Timor-Leste in 2009.

            paper also uses the HIES 2011 to show that opportunity cost also matters in grade progression.

In total, 22,301 Grade 1 students were tested including students from all primary schools within
Timor-Leste that offer Grade 1. In small schools with less than 20 Grade 1 students, all students were
tested using Tetum letters. In schools with more than 20 Grade 1 students, 20 students were randomly
selected to be tested in Tetum. In larger schools with more than 40 Grade 1 students present, 20 students
were selected to be tested in Tetum and an additional 20 students were randomly selected to undertake
the same type of test using Portuguese letters. By this logic, 17,741 children were tested in Tetum, 4,560 in
Portuguese.

On average Grade 1 students, after about 9 months of instruction, were able to recognize 10 Tetum
letters correctly within one minute. Indeed, 34 percent of Grade 1 students nationwide were unable to
recognize a single letter correctly at the end of the school year. This is in line with the poor 2009 EGRA results
which showed that 70 percent of Grade 1 students could not read a single word out of a simple text passage
(World Bank, 2009).30

Figure 42 shows that the youngest Grade 1 students perform most poorly. For this there are many
possible explanations. For instance, Grade 1 students that are six years old at the end of the school year
almost certainly were below official starting age at the beginning of the year. These children might have been
less prepared and ready when starting school. Further, children starting school pre-maturely might have
a particular socio-economic background and school conditions impacting their performance. Moreover,
older children in Grade 1 might already be repeating the grade for the second time.




30 The reported 10 Tetum letters read correctly per minute is the median. The mean is higher (15.6) driven by few students performing
   very highly with up to all 100 letters read correctly. Taking school-level averages of letters read correctly, the median of school-level
   scores is 13.3.

         Figure 42 further demonstrates that students from private schools tend to perform better than those
         from public schools and that there are large variations in performance across districts. Dili, perhaps
         unsurprising to some given the overcrowded classrooms, performs below average as measured by this
         simple proxy of student attainment. Lautem, the district with the lowest student absenteeism rate, but also
         a district in which understanding of Tetum by students is low and usage of local languages in instruction is
         particularly high, performs best among all 13 districts. Although causal relations can hardly be established
         at this stage, certain characteristics of schools in these districts may be associated with performance as
         measured by this letter recognition test. Oecusse and Viqueque, the districts performing most poorly on
         the letter recognition test, are two of the districts with the lowest prevalence of Tetum as mother tongue.
         However, so is Lautem which performs best. Viqueque is the most remote district with the furthest travel
         times to school, however absenteeism rates are average despite such travel times. Viqueue is also the district
         which suffers the most from shortage of Tetum textbooks. Oecusse is a poor district with least schools
         having electricity in classrooms.

         Simple regression analysis shows that school performance is significantly associated with both
         student and teacher absenteeism rates (Appendix A). Schools with better student attendance have a
         higher average score on the Tetum letter recognition test. Such regressions are subject to endogeneity
         issues and should be interpreted with care. Further research is needed to clearly establish the causes of
         such low performance.

         Secondary Schools




         Currently, there are 82 general secondary and 16 vocational secondary schools in Timor-Leste. 38.8
         percent of these schools are private, a much higher share than for primary schools. Gross enrollment rates
         at the secondary level have grown incredibly fast, from 28 percent in 2001/02 to 61 percent in 2010 (World
         Bank, 2012a), and by now more than half of secondary-school-age children are enrolled in school. However,
         as shown in Figure 43 Gross Attendance Ratios, i.e. enrollment at secondary level, vary considerably by
         district ranging from 41.6 percent in Oecusse to 93.7 percent in Dili.

         Note: The Gross Attendance Ratio for secondary schools is the total number of secondary school students, expressed as a percentage of the
         official secondary-school-age population. If there are significant numbers of overage and underage students at a given level of schooling, the
         GAR can exceed 100 percent.

Location
Secondary schools are more centrally located than primary schools and travel times are longer. Many
secondary schools are located in the largest cities, 13 in Baucau and 24 in Dili. Figure 44 shows the number
of secondary schools by district. In general, locations are less remote than for primary schools. Indeed, on
average, secondary schools are located less than 30 minutes from the closest bank (compared to more than
2 hours for primary schools), 15 minutes from the closest clinic and 10 minutes from the closest policy office.
Average travel time to school is 26 compared to 21 minutes. 14.0 percent of Grade 11 students travel for an
hour or more compared to 10.7 percent of grade 4 students.

         Operating Hours
         Secondary schools running one shift are opened for 5 hours per day, those running two shifts for 9
         hours per day. As discussed previously, primary schools running one shift are open for four hours in the
         morning, primary schools running two shifts for four hours in the morning and four hours in the afternoon.
         Operating hours among secondary schools are less uniform. A similar proportion to primary schools, 32.3
         percent, run two shifts per day to be able to teach all students. Those secondary schools only running one
         shift are usually open from 8am to about 12.30/1pm. 27.7 percent of schools with one shift are further
         operating in the afternoon, from about 1pm to 5/5.30pm. All schools running two shifts are opened both
         morning and afternoon. Whereas primary schools that run two shifts are open exactly twice as long as
         primary schools with one shift, i.e. there are two equally long shifts in the morning and afternoon, for
         secondary schools this is not the case. Since some schools with only one shift are also opened morning as
         well as afternoon, average opening time per shift is higher for schools running only one shift. Schools with
         one shift are open an average of 5 hours and 16 minutes compared to 9 hours and 6 minutes (i.e. 4 hours
         and 33 minutes per shift) for schools with two shifts.

         Class Size
         Median class sizes are higher than for primary schools. On average, Grade 10 classes have 41 students.
         Class size for Grade 11 is 39 and 36 for Grade 12. This is higher compared to class sizes in primary schools
         ranging from 37 in Grade 1 to 25 in Grade 6. Secondary schools tend to be larger than primary schools with
         an average of 343 students. However, classroom availability is similar, or slightly better, than for primary
         schools with classrooms being slightly less crowded. On average there are 38 students per classroom and
         16.3 percent of secondary schools have more than 60 students per classroom, compared to 21.2 in primary
         schools.

         Teachers
         Secondary school teachers are better educated. 25.2 percent have frequented academy and 54.8 percent
         university (see Figure 45).

Interestingly, teacher absenteeism rates were higher among secondary than primary schools. On the
day of the survey, 24.9 percent of Grade 11 teachers were absent from school compared to 13.1 percent of
Grade 4 primary school teachers. Student absenteeism rates on the other hand were similar. 16.8 percent
of secondary school students, from Grade 11, were absent compared to 17.6 percent of Grade 4 primary
school students. Student absenteeism rates of both these grades are low compared to the shockingly high
absenteeism rates in Grade 1 as discussed previously.

Infrastructure and School Materials
Secondary schools face similar infrastructure and material constraints. Secondary schools are more
centrally located and a higher proportion is private. It is thus not surprising that in some ways they tend to
be slightly better equipped. Only 13.4 percent are lacking a toilet and more than half, 55.7 percent, have
electricity which is high compared to primary schools. However, the same proportion, 16.5 percent, lacks
water provision at the school and classroom availability, as mentioned, is similar with an average of 38
students per classroom compared to 39. Textbook availability is considerably worse than in primary schools
with 48.9 percent of secondary schools not having mathematics textbooks compared to 24.3 percent of
primary schools. 59.0 percent of secondary schools have no Portuguese textbook and 78.7 lack Tetum
textbooks.

         Key Policy Recommendations


         Despite fast progress since independence, improving access to education needs continued policy
         attention particularly in remote areas. As shown by the survey data, 11 percent of Grade 4 students need
         an hour or more to travel to school. In some districts such as Viqueque, almost a third of students do. There
         is evidence that a long commute to school is closely associated with student absenteeism, which is a major
         cause for concern according to the results of this survey. Indeed, 17 percent of Grade 4 students and 36
         percent of Grade 1 students were absent from school on the day of the interviews. Furthermore, Grade
         1 absenteeism rate is as high as 41 percent in schools with an average travel time of 30 minutes or more,
         compared to 34 percent in other schools. Since only less than 2 percent of students make use of any means
         of transport other than walking to reach school, providing transportation subsidies or other direct support
         such as school buses may be worth considering and piloting in selected geographic areas.

         Improving quality of education should be a key policy focus. According to the survey, 34 percent of
         Grade 1 students nationwide were unable to recognize a single letter correctly at the end of the school
         year. This is in line with poor results from other assessments such as EGRA and EGMA which provide clear
         evidence that education quality is of particular concern in Timor-Leste. To improve education quality and
         learning, attention should be paid in the following areas:

              Enhancing Teacher quality. Research shows that the quality of teachers, what they know and
                how they are able to teach, has significant impact on the academic performance of their students.
                Providing high quality teachers has been a problem in Timor-Leste with most teachers from Indonesia
                leaving the country during the independence struggle. In 2000 a majority of schools were officially
                reopened, but with many inexperienced and under-qualified teachers. The survey results show that
                71 percent of primary school teachers only hold secondary education, 6 percent even less. There is
                also an unusually high proportion of volunteer teachers, 24 percent of primary school teachers are
                volunteers, most of which are even less educated and experienced than permanent teachers.

                  A comprehensive review of teacher policies needs to be carried out. The policy review should aim
                  at identifying the gaps in policy coverage, clarity, implementation arrangements, monitoring and
                  evaluation processes, and overall effectiveness; and lead to necessary further revisions to support
                  the overall goal of improving teacher quality. The policy domains should cover: (1) Attracting the
                  best into teaching; (2) Preparing teachers with useful training and experience; (3) Matching teachers’
                  skills with students’ needs; (4) Monitoring teaching and learning; (5) Supporting teachers to improve
                  instruction; and (6) Motivating teachers to perform.

                  The initial teacher education programs need to be reformed to significantly improve teacher quality
                  as well as to address the teacher supply shortage in particular in certain subjects. This reform needs
                  to focus on increasing teacher training provision and standards as well as improving training content.
                  Reforming in-service teacher training programs is equally important to broaden the knowledge
                  teachers acquired during their initial teacher education and upgrade skills of existing teachers. In
                  the immediate term a key focus will be to support under-qualified teachers that do not meet the
                  minimum qualifications and competencies to enter the ‘teacher career regime’. INFORDEPE may
                  continue playing the main role in providing in-service training to teachers who have acquired an
                  equivalence to ‘bacharelato’ level under the intensive teacher training, while the National University




58   Building Evidence, Shaping Policy
     Findings of the 2012 Timor-Leste Education Survey
        of Timor-Leste (UNTL) and other higher education institutions may want to focus on the in-service
        training of all other teachers.31

    Strengthening instruction language policy. Instruction language is one of the most debated and
      controversial policies currently in place in Timor-Leste. According to global experience, language
      policy is an important factor that supports development of literacy at early grades and sets the
      foundation for advanced learning in the future. The survey highlights that comprehension of
      Portuguese, even after years of instruction, is very limited. In some districts understanding of Tetum
      is also below expectations. The survey further shows that mother tongue teaching, despite current
      policy, is widely practiced. However, since local languages are used unofficially ignoring national
      policy, there are no guidelines and training in how such languages can best be utilized to support
      learning.

        International evidence shows that with proper training and adequate policy, mother tongue teaching
        can be a powerful tool for better learning. However, without clear guidance, adequate training and
        necessary learning materials, it is unlikely that it can reach its potential in developing early literacy. In
        addition, mother tongue teaching is meant to ‘bridge’ towards using national instruction language
        later. There is no evidence that teachers currently transition away from using local languages in
        instruction during higher grades. This is possibly one of the reasons why comprehension of national
        instruction languages is so low even at later grades.

        There is a need to review current language policies. If Portuguese and Tetum remain the official
        languages of instruction even at lowest grades, language training for teachers needs to be reinforced
        and the necessary materials supplied. Enforcement of the policy and guidance to teachers also needs
        to be strengthened. If the decision is made to move to some form of mother tongue teaching at low
        grades, as is de facto currently happening, teachers again need to be provided with the necessary
        training, guidance and materials. For instance, teachers need to be instructed on how to transition
        away from local language instruction towards using national languages at a later stage.

    Improving education system management. Timor-Leste’s education system is highly centralized,
      however this might be beginning to change with decentralization high on the government’s agenda.
      Contrary to expectation, the education survey shows that school directors currently de facto take
      many decisions, for instance on instruction content and subject choice. School directors, often very
      inexperienced and under-educated, take these decisions despite the decision authority lying with
      the central ministry according to legislation and despite not having any guidance or training in how
      to take such decisions. Improving the school system, prior to any decentralization efforts, might
      first require strengthening national standards and quality assurance at central level. As a second
      stage school leadership as well as service delivery capacity at local and school level needs to be
      strengthened.

    Improving school attendance through innovative interventions. As outlined, high student
      absenteeism is a major cause of concern and strongly associated with student performance. It
      appears strongly related to the opportunity cost of schooling with children that have to help at
      home, for instance by taking care of livestock, and children with a longer travel time to school being
      absent more. The national school feeding program does not seem to be enough to counter the
      large absenteeism rates observed. Possible interventions could be scholarships or conditional cash
      transfers tied to attendance. Such CCT programs have been found to have a positive effect on school
      enrolment in multiple settings. Some research has also shown positive effects on attendance, for

                  detail see World Bank 2013b.)

              Improving school infrastructure and learning environment. Despite 10 years of investment,
                lack of infrastructure remains a large issue in this young nation. 33 percent of public schools have
                no toilet, many no provision of water and only 21 percent of primary schools have electricity. In
                particular, student to classroom ratios are also still very high. Indeed, in Dili 48 percent of schools
                have more than 60 students per classroom. According to the survey, lack of classrooms is one of the
                most frequently voiced problems by directors and teachers and is related to larger classes as well as
                the running of multiple shifts per day. Although it appears that in the case of primary schools the
                running of multiple shifts is not necessarily related to a reduction in learning time or an increase in
                teaching time by the same teachers, it can still be problematic if the conditions in the afternoon shift
                are less conducive for learning.

              Ensuring adequate supply of textbooks. Lack of textbooks is mentioned as the main obstacle by
                school directors and teachers. In line with these perceptions international evidence shows that the
                availability of textbooks impacts student achievement. Currently, 24 percent of primary schools have
                no mathematics textbooks, 25 percent no Portuguese textbooks and 57 percent no Tetum textbooks.
                In some cases this is a distribution problem rather than a matter of availability of books or resources.

         Overall, both demand and supply side interventions are needed. Timor-Leste’s education system has
         seen large progress and investment in recent years, however the largest challenges remain to be tackled.
         Improving education quality requires the right mix of policies and will be crucial on Timor-Leste’s path to an
         upper-middle-income country by 2030.

              TV          : 1 if the student’s household owns a TV

         The shown associations support the hypothesis that opportunity cost matters in student attendance. Higher travel time to school is
         significantly associated with higher absenteeism. Owning a horse, a highly labor intensive life stock, equally so. On the other hand,
         ownership of TV, a proxy for household wealth, has a negative coefficient.

The availability of toilets as well as the overcrowding of classrooms appears significantly associated with student absenteeism even
after controlling for other proxies of school resources and the average socio-economic background of the school.

         Notes: These regressions are subject to endogeneity issues and should be interpreted with caution. For instance there is likely omitted
         variable bias due to unobserved school characteristics. Further, there might be reverse causality bias, for example if performance
         contributes to the choice of which school is made a central versus filial school. Further analysis is needed to establish causal relationships.

         The regressions show that there is a significant association between performance as measured by this simple test and student and

teacher attendance. Further, schools that have math textbooks and less crowded classrooms appear to perform better. Having a strong
parent teacher association is also associated with higher performance. It is surprising to note that those schools with a higher proportion
of students with Tetum as mother tongue perform worse in this Tetum letter test. The same correlation holds when including further
geographical fixed effects, i.e. controlling for subdistricts.

Variables:
Student Attendance                      :   Attendance rate of students
Teacher Attendance                      :   Attendance rate of teachers
