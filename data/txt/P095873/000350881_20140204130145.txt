1.     Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.      The International Development Association (IDA) approved on June 19, 2007 a
grant (H310-TP) of 3.935 million Special Drawing Rights (SDR) (US$6 million
equivalent) to the Government of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste (GoTL) for
the Timor-Leste: Education Sector Support Project (ESSP); and on August 9, 2007, an
Administration Agreement with the Australian Agency for International Development
(AusAID) (TF070799) for AUD8.6 million, of which AUD1,098,422 was allocated for
Bank-executed activities, and AUD7.33 (US$6 million equivalent) was granted to GoTL
to co-finance the ESSP (TF090564).

2.      On November 25, 2010, IDA approved additional financing (AF) in the amount of
SDR 3.3. million (US$5 million equivalent), and on May 30, 2012 the World Bank, as
trustee for AusAID, approved an additional financing in the amount of AUD 3 million
(US$2.97 million equivalent). The closing date of both IDA Grants was set for January
31, 2013, while the AusAID Grants, as amended under AFII, closed on July 31, 2013.

1.1    Context at Appraisal.

3.      Background. Timor-Leste (TL) achieved independence in 2002. The years
following were characterized both by progress and turmoil. The country made progress in
rehabilitating its economy, improving human development indicators, reconstructing its
infrastructure, and building a nation. However, significant social and political divisions
remained, and disturbances by unemployed and disenfranchised youth were frequent at
the time of project preparation. The current advantage of TL is its gas and oil reserves
that were harnessed to fund social and economic development.

4.      Main issues in the education sector. Significant improvements were made in
the education sector, particularly in terms of increasing access through the provision of
new schools, and bringing the primary net enrollment rate (NER) from 51 percent in
2000/01 to 80 percent in 2004/05. The Ministry of Education (MoE) had also produced a
basic education strategy, which had won significant international backing through Fast
Track Initiative (FTI) financing. Despite these improvements, challenges remained at the
time of project preparation. Over 40 percent of adults were illiterate; life expectancy at
birth was only 62; infant mortality was above the low-income country average;
malnutrition was widespread with almost half the population of children under five being
stunted and underweight; and two in five people in TL were considered poor and unable
to attain a minimal standard of living. The following six education sector issues
underpinned the preparation of the ESSP.

5.     Lack of institutional capacity at MoE. At the time of project preparation, the
MoE experienced severe capacity constraints at all levels, tending to rely heavily on
external technical assistance to complete many of its routine operations. Most decisions
were made by a small cadre of senior MoE officials, without the benefit of strong
management, implementation, or information systems. There was no functioning



                                                                                        1
education management information system (EMIS) or means of collecting reliable system
data to support the management decision-making process. MoE staff at that time was
new with little previous experience with large-scale education reforms. The recruitment
policies put in motion by MoE weighed heavily on Portuguese language skills, perhaps at
times to the disadvantage of applicants with education and management experience, but
lacking reading and writing skills in this language.

6.     MoE’s budget execution was weak. As of March 2007, MoE’s budget execution
averaged only 33 percent of the Ministry’s FY06/07 allocation. This low level of
expenditure was mainly linked to the lack of: (i) planning and procurement capacity; (ii)
technical capacity to execute the approved Annual Action Plans (AAPs); and (iii)
required technical capacity to thoroughly review the AAPs prior to submission to the
Ministry of Planning and Finance.

7.      Low levels of students’ learning achievement, especially in numeracy skills, was
correlated with levels of poverty, as evidenced by the results of the Primary School
Assessment Survey of 2003 that tested 3,487 third and fourth graders in 95 schools. On
average, third graders answered correctly only 28 percent of the questions while fourth
graders did marginally better, averaging 37 percent correct answers. Gender disparities
existed in the results, with girls performing worse than boys. The 2006 Measuring of
Learning Achievement Study found that 80 percent of third graders failed to meet a
minimum level of reading skills. The poor quality education provided was a major cause
for the high repetition and dropout rates and inefficiency of the education system.

8.      The lack of instructional materials was also a major concern at all levels at the
time of project preparation. While all primary and pre-secondary students received the
educational Lafaek children’s magazine, there were few universally distributed texts. At
the primary level, a few basic texts that supported the new curriculum and some newly
purchased Portuguese texts were available in the country but did not reach most
classrooms. At the pre-secondary level, most available texts were in Bahasa Indonesia,
while textbooks in Portuguese, the official language of instruction at that level, were only
available for teachers to share, making teaching in Portuguese difficult.

9.       High dropout rates. MoE’s statistics and reports from district superintendents and
teachers suggested that dropouts occurred most frequently during the first three years of
schooling and in the final grades of junior secondary education. Reasons cited included:
(i) an absence of apparent benefits from schooling; and (ii) indirect and opportunity costs
in respect to working at home. In addition, teachers’ and parents’ views reflected a
concern over the quality of general schooling and a growing demand for employability
skills training.

10.    Need for improved service delivery. At the time of project preparation there was
public outcry about the lack of appropriate utilization of the country’s increasing oil
revenue to improve the quality of service delivery in the social sectors, including
education.




                                                                                          2
11.     Government’s strategy. The ESSP was anchored in the GoTL’s recognition of a
stronger education program as a cornerstone of its strategy to alleviate poverty as
articulated in its National Development Plan (NDP) 2002-2007 and in its National
Education and Culture Policy (NECP) of 2006. The WB and the International Monetary
Fund endorsed the NDP as the country's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper.

12.     The NDP and the NECP placed emphasis on: (a) expanding access to basic
education, in particular to reach universal primary education; (b) improving system
efficiency and quality; (c) expanding the teaching of Portuguese; (d) curriculum
development; (e) providing teaching materials; (f) providing vocational and skills
education; (g) strengthening management capacity to improve service delivery; and (h)
promoting and regulating post-basic education and developing tertiary education.

13.      Prior to the approval of the NECP, the MoE began to address the GoTL's
priorities through the gradual development of sub-sector strategies. The first of these, the
2005 Strategic Plan for Universal Primary Completion by 2015 (SP-UPC), integrated all
of the ongoing and proposed projects and interventions in place at that time in the
primary sub-sector into a focused, medium- to long-term program. One year after its
endorsement by the country’s development partners and its subsequent support by the
FTI in October 2006, the MoE drafted its first sub-sector three-year rolling plan. While
the SP-UPC provided a coherent strategy for the attainment of universal primary
completion, the sub-sector strategies for secondary and tertiary education remained to be
developed at the time of project preparation. Subsector plans and associated three-year
rolling plans were necessary for the MoE to: (a) gain GoTL’s commitment required to
ensure adequate budget allocations over the medium term; and (b) support the requests of
much needed donor investment in system reforms and capacity development.

14.     Rationale for Bank’s assistance. The following reasons underpinned the
rationale for WB assistance. First, the WB’s comprehensive understanding of the
country’s education sector issues acquired through the Emergency School Readiness and
the East Timor Fundamental School Quality (FSQP) projects that the Bank had supported
along with other partners. This project included support to: (i) school construction and
rehabilitation; (ii) the production and distribution of Lafaek children’s magazine to all
primary and pre-secondary students and their teachers; and (iii) policy development,
including support to the SP-UPC.

15.     Second, one year prior to the approval of the ESSP, the WB through the FTI-
financed Primary Education Support Project (PESP) supported the most critical of the
SP-UPC interventions that were not financed by other donors, including: (i) the
development of a teacher competency framework and of an EMIS; (ii) the financial
bridging for continuing with the production and distribution of Lafaek; and (iii) the
establishment of the Infrastructure Facilities Unit (IFU).

16.   Third, the attention to sector millennium development goals (MDGs) provided by
the WB through the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY 06-08 (Report 32700-TP




                                                                                          3
dated June 22, 2005), the Transition Support Program, the Consolidation Support
Program, and the FTI helped to bring focus to MoE’s programs.

17.    Fourth, prior to project preparation, the WB had become the lead donor in the
education sector, providing a trusted source of policy guidance and large scale bridge
financing to support education in advance of an increasing GoTL budget. Maintaining the
WB’s leadership role in sector dialogue and in donor coordination provided both
experience and continuity for government activities in the education sector. In partnership
with AusAID and the New Zealand Agency for International Development (NZAID), the
WB played an influencing role in MoE’s development by introducing global perspectives
on and experiences in education systems reform.

18.    Fifth, the WB presence ensured that the MoE embraced the public sector
management interventions under the then ongoing Planning and Financial Management
Capacity Building Program, mostly financed by NZAID.

19.     Finally, both the WB and AusAID were closely engaged in dialogue with the
GoTL on macro-economic and budgetary issues to improve planning and budget
execution. The ESSP was considered a vehicle to facilitate donor coordination and
harmonization, thus reducing the burden on the GoTL. Although GoTL revenues from
petroleum were expected to rapidly increase in the coming years, funding gaps persisted
relative to attaining the MDGs. The ESSP provided an opportunity to pool and focus
future donor and oil revenue funds to meet the sector’s needs, including the pressing need
for capacity development, thus allowing the GoTL to more effectively and efficiently
meet its goal of planning, executing, and monitoring its own budgetary resources.

1.2    Original Project Development Objective (PDO) and Key Indicators.

20.    The project’s PDO was to strengthen the capacity of the MoE for effective policy
development, resource management, and innovation. The following four outcome
indicators (Annex 3 of the Project Appraisal Document (PAD)) were agreed to measure
progress towards achieving the PDO:

a.     MoE staff with improved skills to effectively contribute to sector management
and service delivery, to be measured on three dimensions: (i) Directorates’ performance
against Annual Action Plans and Budget Plans; (ii) system performance data from the
EMIS; and (iii) staff surveys to assess satisfaction with change;

b.      Enhanced quality learning materials for all primary and pre-secondary students
and teachers to be determined via: (i) an assessment of the content and relevance of the
project-provided learning materials to student learning achievement outcomes; and (ii)
increased time on task;

c.    Enhanced and expanded learning conditions through quality school facilities to be
measured in terms of: (i) the percentage of newly constructed or rehabilitated classrooms




                                                                                         4
and school facilities that are built and maintained to established MoE/FSQP standards;
and (ii) net primary and secondary enrollment rates; and

d.      Improved work skills and attributes of pre-secondary school leavers to be
measured via: (i) valued added by the ESSP to student’s skills as assessed by the program
monitors; and (ii) the transition rates from pre-secondary to senior secondary and to
gainful employment of participating pre-secondary graduates as compared to those in a
control group.

1.3    Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key
       Indicators, and reasons/justification

21. The PDO was not modified during the implementation cycle, but the original
outcome and intermediate outcome indicators included in the results framework (RF)
were revised at the time of approval of the first additional financing – ESSP-AFI (under
the IDA Grant H5830) in June 2010 and again at the approval of the second additional
financing - ESSP–AFII (under the AusAID TF) in May 2012 (Table 1).

      Table 1. Changes made to the outcome and intermediate outcome indicators
                           (see also the ICR Data Sheet)
                      Outcome indicators                     Intermediate outcome indicator

              index;                             module in the pre-secondary curriculum; and
ESSP - AFI    (iii) A reduced shortfall of       (ii) Consistent participation by grade 9 students in
              classrooms at the primary level;   work skills activities
              (iv) An established system for     to:
              learning assessment at the         (a) Execution of at least 2 training contracts for post-
              primary level.                     secondary tutors; and
                                                 (b) Preparation of a feasibility study for polytechnics.
                                                 Remained the same, but the following five new targets
                                                 were added:
                                                  (i) Funding 7 Escola Básica (EB) clusters for a total of
                                                  53 classrooms (through seven tenders using the
                                                  traditional construction modality);
                                                  (ii) Financing community-based school rehabilitation
                                                  and construction in 25 EB clusters in remote areas for
ESSP - AFII   Remained the same                   75 classrooms;
                                                  (iii) Financing community-based school maintenance
                                                  in 50 schools in order to maintain and complete minor
                                                  renovation works in 259 classrooms;
                                                  (iv) Support the IFU as a management model for
                                                  effective education infrastructure work; and
                                                  (v) Reviewing: (a) school site selection procedures
                                                  and criteria to be more responsive in increasing access
                                                  in un-served and under-served areas; and (b) locations
                                                  that merited multi-grade schools.

22. It is important to underline the particular changes made in Component 4, because
by modifying the targets implicitly Component 4 was totally restructured.


                                                                                                        5
23.    This last revision under ESSP-AFII also represented: (a) a reduction in the target
for school furniture in response to a MoE request to reallocate project funding from
school furniture to school construction in Dili; and (b) an increase in the target for school
construction.

1.4          Main Beneficiaries

24.     The PAD of the first IDA grant and the AusAID TF explicitly specified and
quantified beneficiaries only for Component 1 – the MoE – and for Component 3 – 2,100
classrooms for about 65,000 additional students benefiting from a strengthened IFU
carrying out the corresponding construction program funded outside the ESSP.

25.     ESSP-AFI aimed at: (i) improving primary education services through the
procurement of school furniture for about 30,000 children in primary schools and 24,000
children in remote area schools (a total of 54,000 children) in all 13 districts of the
country; (ii) providing training to 4,500 teachers on early grade literacy and numeracy
teaching methods, indirectly reaching 140,000 students in Grades 1-3; and (iii) providing
training on leadership, school management and quality standards to 750 EB cluster
school directors, deputy directors and technical secretaries, and to 250 school board
committees.

26.     ESSP-AFII aimed at benefiting: (i) 25 EBs with community-based construction
and another 7 with traditional construction; (ii) 50 schools to be provided maintenance;
and (iii) 75 classrooms to be constructed/rehabilitated.

1.5          Original Components

27. Component 1: Capacity Building for Policy, Planning and Program Development
(US$3.6 million) through the following four sub-components:

a.     Sub-component 1.1: Policy and planning aiming to finance:

        i.         The completion of sub-sector strategies for both secondary and tertiary
                   education including a three-year rolling plan with costs and financing
                   sources and an articulation of how to best achieve key performance
                   benchmarks for each of these sub-sectors;
      ii.          A number of policy advisory notes designed to provide decision makers
                   with evidence of good practice and viable options;
      iii.         A National Education Congress in early 2008, as a means of engaging a
                   broad range of stakeholders in a consultative process around the
                   development of the sub-sector strategies;
      iv.          Workshop activity linked to the 2009 AFR to ensure that the SP-UPC and
                   the two sub-sector strategies developed under ESSP were synchronized,
                   expressed as a sector strategy, and reflected in a sector-wide medium term
                   expenditure framework; and



                                                                                           6
     v.        The continuing monitoring of the school grants program supported at that
               time by the PESP and assistance to the MoE to ensure that this program
               aligns with other MoE programs supporting school-based management.

b.     Sub-component 1.2: Higher education quality assurance aiming to finance the
establishment of a National Commission for Academic Assessment and Accreditation
(NCAAA) to oversee the accreditation and licensing of all higher education institutions in
the country, both public and private, including: (i) technical assistance in carrying out an
institutional licensure and accreditation process; (ii) a workshop to prepare for this
assessment and accreditation process; and (iii) a study of the national university with the
intention of providing the GoTL options for its focus, development and location.

c.    Sub-component 1.3: Resource management aimed at strengthening MoE’s
capacities in procurement, financial management and contract management, including
financing: (i) technical assistance in the Directorate of Administration, Finance, Logistics
and Supplies; (ii) training; and (iii) technical assistance to gradually migrate resource
management responsibilities from the consultants to the MoE’s counterparts.

d.     Sub-component 1.4: Monitoring and evaluation aiming to strengthen MoE’s Policy
and Planning Directorate capacity in sector-wide monitoring and evaluation including: (i)
staffing; (ii) training in data collection, data entry and processing, analysis, and report
writing; and (iii) the further development of the MoE’s Measuring Learning Achievement
program for Grades 3, 5 and 6.

28. Component 2: Learning Materials (US$3.7 million) through the following two sub-
components:

a.    Sub-component 2.1: Procurement policies for learning materials aiming at
financing technical assistance to develop MoE’s capacity to manage the outsourcing of
the production of textbooks, teachers’ guides and teaching learning materials, including:

      i.      Finalizing MoE’s textbook and learning materials policy;
     ii.      Establishing a unit within the MoE to manage the preparation of
              specifications for teaching and learning materials; and
    iii.      Conducting a study tour to neighboring countries to familiarize key MoE
              staff with good practice in the production of educational materials.

b.    Sub-component 2.2: Learning materials aiming at financing high quality learning
materials, such as Lafaek, for primary and pre-secondary students provided that they: (i)
were closely linked to the new primary curriculum; (ii) facilitated the introduction of
textbooks and curricula; (iii) reflected good practice in language instruction; and (iv)
were grade relevant and of high quality.

c.   Both PESP and ESSP were to finance this sub-component, with the former
covering year one of ESSP and the latter years two to five on a declining basis.




                                                                                          7
29. Component 3: Construction/Rehabilitation Design and Quality Assurance (US$4.2
million or 28 percent of the total cost of the project) through the following two sub-
components:

a.   Sub-component 3.1: Support for the IFU to ensure quality and cost-effectiveness of
the MoE-financed construction or rehabilitation of an estimated 2,100 classrooms
expected to add 65,000 new student places, including: (a) consultant services; (b) office
equipment; (c) operating costs; (d) production and dissemination of construction and
maintenance guidelines and building standards; (e) carrying out of stakeholder
workshops; and (f) building and maintaining a school mapping database.

b.    Sub-component 3.2: School-site selection aiming to finance the review of: (i) the
school site selection criteria and procedures to help MoE ensure that new school
construction and rehabilitation was responsive to prioritized needs, especially in respect
to providing to unserved and under-served areas in the country; (ii) locations meriting
multi-grade schools; (iii) existing primary school dormitories to assess the possibility of
expanding these as an option to further system expansion; and (iv) kitchen needs at
schools participating in the MoE/World Food Program school feeding program.

c.    As with the previous component, both PESP and ESSP were to finance this sub-
component, with the former covering the ESSP needs for year one and the latter for years
two to five on a declining basis.

30. Component 4: Work Skills for Pre-Secondary Students (US$2.2 million) aiming at
supporting the development and piloting of a curriculum module for the provision of
relevant work skills and attributes for students in their final year of pre-secondary school,
through the following two sub-components:

a.     Sub-component 4.1: Developing a work skills curriculum module intended to
finance the development of a compulsory ninth-grade subject built around a community
development activity, including: (i) the curriculum design in consultation with the school
community to acquire skills in areas such as water provision, infrastructure finishing,
agriculture, utilization of primary produce, and tourism; (ii) the identification of the skills
and other assets required to deliver the activity; and (iii) assessing student performance as
skills were developed and improved over the course of the year. The pilot was to include
testing, evaluation and refinement of the curriculum module developed. Once developed,
the module was to be integrated into the pre-secondary curriculum that was being
formulated at that time by MoE and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF).

b.     This sub-component was to finance a full-time international lead advisor for the
pilot program, two local, short-term community development advisors, and three short-
term international curriculum development advisors. These roles were to assist in the
development of the module and to guide, train, and provide follow-up support to lead
teachers with the Directors of Curricula and Basic and Secondary Education and their
staffs, to design and draft the intended program module, and develop and draft the
policies and operational guidelines for the pilot. This sub-component also planned to



                                                                                             8
engage up to nine lead teachers from three to twelve schools over project years two and
three, and then expand to a possible 96 schools in project year five.

c.   Participating schools were to receive lockable, transportable teaching kits for each
Grade nine class, as well as a materials grant of US$25 per year per student.

d.    Sub-component 4.2: Impact assessment aiming at financing the monitoring of the
above-mentioned skills pilot as well as a comprehensive three-year impact assessment
study of the piloted intervention in which the original 12 participating schools were to be
compared with a control group of 12 non-participating schools.

Component 1         Expanded with a new activity aimed at supporting the                No Change.
                    establishment of the EB 4, one key theme in the
                    education reform sought by the National Education
                    Sector Plan (NESP) 2010-2030.

                    Added the training of staff of the recently established
                    Inclusive Education Office within the MoE, responsible
                    for training of the EB clusters to promote education of
                    disabled and impaired children 5.

                    Added the financing of technical advice to the MoE on
                    Early Childhood Development programs 6.

  The whole primary and pre-secondary system was to be organized around 202 basic education schools, providing
education from grade 1 to 9, and pedagogical support to a network of primary education schools (grades 1 to 6), and
satellite, remote areas schools, offering grades 1 to 3, a total of about 885 filial schools. The ESSP-AFI was to be used
to build capacity within the MoE for the preparation of the manuals for inspectors, regional Ministry officers and
school directors, and to design and initiate the training of the various actors in this system, including inspectors, school
staff and school boards.

  The Timor-Leste Survey of Living Standards indicated that between 15 and 20 percent of children and youth who
dropped out in grades 3-6 did so because of some kind of disability.

                   country to the procurement of learning materials
                   focused on early reading and numeracy skills for grades
                   1 to 3 and the establishment of a Learning Material Unit
                   (LMU) within the MoE to advise on the types of
                   learning materials to provide the schools (books,
                   magazines, others), as well as methodologies for their
                   selection and their production and procurement.
Component 3        Added the procuring of school furniture for about                Added the financing of classroom
                   30,000 children in primary schools and 24,000 children           construction and rehabilitation as per
                   in remote area schools.                                          targets described in section 1.3 of
                                                                                    this ICR and provided further support
                                                                                    to the quality and cost-effectiveness
                                                                                    of the government-financed school
                                                                                    construction and rehabilitation
                                                                                    program.
Component 4        As mentioned in section 1.3 of this ICR, by modifying            No change.
                   its original targets (output indicators), Component 4
                   was implicitly restructured.
Component 5        New component - “Early Grade Learning – added,                   No change.
                   aimed at: (i) training Professional Training Institute
                   trainers, inspectors, school directors, and teachers (a
                   total of about 4,500 people), especially those teaching
                   early grades, on optimal utilization of materials and
                   young children literacy and numeracy teaching to
                   benefit about 140,000 students in grades 1-3; and (ii)

  The Escola Basica (EB) concept is underpinned in a GoTL Council of Minister’s Decree of March 17, 2010, aiming
at the creation of clusters of basic education schools under a single administration and management structure,
promoting coordination between the central and regional services of the MoE and basic education establishments in the
entire country. The four key pillars of EB at the school level include: (i) Quality School Governance: combining
effective school leadership, democratic decision-making and responsive strategic planning; (ii) Positive School
Environment: ensuring the physical and psychological wellbeing of all people within the school, developing school
behavior management, and encouraging positive relationships with all school stakeholders (students, staff, parents, and

April 21, 2010      Amendment to Agreements of IDA Grant H310-TP and AusAID TF090564: (a)
                    amended Part D of the Project set forth in Schedule 1 to the Grant Agreement and in
                    Article II, paragraph 2.01 of the AusAid Trust Fund Agreement; and (b) revised the
                    performance indicators for the monitoring and evaluation of the Project.
June 10, 2011       The first amendment to the Administration Agreement of AusAID TF070799: (i)

33.      FTI financing. The GoTL also received FTI support to carry out other activities related
to this project. Two FTI grants, to the PESP (2007-2009) and to the FTI Bridging Project (2009),
introduced innovations which were built upon through ESSP. In particular, the 2009 FTI Bridging
Project introduced interventions in four areas (school-based management, inclusive education,
early grade reading assessment, and remote area school resourcing), which were to be taken to
scale by ESSP. FTI funding was designed for rapid implementation and was fully disbursed by
June 2010. As TL’s gross national income increased, it ceased to be eligible for FTI Catalytic
Fund financing.


2.       Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1      Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

34. Weighing the achievements and shortcomings detailed in this section, in particular
a broad and unfocused project design and interventions, the lack of implementation
readiness conditions, and a results framework (RF) with shortcomings, the ESSP
preparation, design and quality at entry is rated as moderately unsatisfactory.

35. Strategic relevance and approach was appropriate. As fully described in section
3.1 of the ICR, improving the management and delivery of services in the education
sector, the main thrust of the ESSP, is in full alignment with the current Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) (Report No. 75263-TP dated February 19, 2013).


community members); (iii) Effective School Management: administering and managing all school-based operations,
including Financial, Assets, Information and Communications, and Human Resource management; and (iv) Quality
Learning Outcomes: improving teaching and learning, curriculum implementation, teacher professionalism and
assessment with school-based programs.


                                                                                                          11
36. The WB preparation team was familiar with the country political economy due to
past project engagements. Accordingly, the team displayed a sensitive approach during
the preparation phase, taking into account the post-conflict legacy, including 70 percent
of private and public buildings burned to the ground, public infrastructure demolished
and valuable files, including education records as well as property titles and civil registry,
destroyed. The team also recognized that TL was a fragile state with incipient governance
structures and associated legal and institutional frameworks displaying weak institutional
capacity for service delivery, including the education sector. The project was designed
to strengthen service delivery and MOE’s institutional capacity through effective policy
development, resource management and innovation.

37. Despite efforts by the task team leader (TTL) to keep the project design narrow and
focused, mainly to continue the implementation of a few ongoing activities under PESP
supporting the IFU and the acquisition and distribution of Lafaek, the TTL/WB
management ended up yielding to the strong expressions of interest of the then Minister
of Education to expand the scope of the proposed ESSP. The number of proposed
activities was expanded and, with the additional financing brought by AusAID, a new
skills component, disconnected from the PDO, was hastily added to the design.

38. Working arrangements with other donors were satisfactory.                     Project
preparation required interaction with other donors, like AusAID, interested in financing
skills development, and NZAID, interested in financing institutional capacity building.
Other partners included: (i) UNICEF, financing curriculum development, school based
management, learning materials, and teacher training under the Basic Education Program;
(ii) the World Food Program, financing school feeding; (iii) CARE, a non-governmental
entity involved with the school magazine Lafaek; and (iv) the Governments of Portugal
and Brazil, financing the former Portuguese language programs and teacher upgrading in
upper secondary level, and the latter, teacher development. NZAID decided very early in
the preparation cycle not to join ESSP, and instead to follow a stand-alone project for
government capacity building activities, inclusive of MoE.

39. The lending instrument – specific investment loan – and the duration of the
investment of about five years seemed to have been reasonable choices at the time of
appraisal. In fact, the completion of the ESSP required an additional six months beyond
the original closing date, in order to complete the construction of the new classrooms and
rehabilitation of existing ones under the AFII.

40. Project design was broad and unfocused covering a wide variety of topics,
including capacity building for policy, planning and program development within the
MoE, higher education quality assurance, resource management, monitoring and
evaluation, procurement and distribution of learning materials, construction and
rehabilitation design, and quality assurance and work skills for pre-secondary students.
In total, there were 4 components with 10 sub-components in a country context of weak
implementation capacity and reliance on external consultants for project preparation and
execution. Given these conditions, the project should have been more selective and



                                                                                           12
narrow in scope.

41. In particular, Component 4 was void of an operational description at the time of
Board approval. Consequently, this component displayed no physical and financial
implementation progress in 2008-10. In mid-2010, the component was restructured due to
strong interest in the expansion of the technical higher education system through
establishment of three regional polytechnic institutions providing post-basic and
advanced technical education in selected study areas. Component 4 was refocused to
address youth related skills development and employability through a feasibility study for
a polytechnic institution and training teachers in technical and vocational fields. While
both indicators were achieved, the teacher candidates, who finished their training in 2013,
are now waiting for the polytechnics to be established (physical construction to begin in
2015).

42. Implementation readiness conditions at the time of Board Approval were not
met. The early Implementation and Supervision Results reports (ISRs) indicate that some
activities which should have been completed during preparation were still being carried
out, thus suggesting that the project was not ready for implementation by the time of
Board Approval. For example, while terms of reference were available for those
consultants associated with continued activities under PESP, no terms of reference had
been drafted for consultants required for new expanded activities. An ESSP Operational
Manual was not ready at the time of Board Approval.

43. The results framework (RF), as fully explained in Section 2.3, had design gaps,
including: (i) a disconnect between the PDO and some of the outcome indicators; (ii)
proposed metrics very difficult to observe and measure in the TL context; (iii) an absence
of baseline data and benchmark targets for most of the outcome and output indicators;
and (iv) mislabeled elements, in which, for example, project outputs were sometimes
erroneously placed as outcomes and vice-versa, and actions were mislabeled as indicators.

44. Regarding AFII, prepared during the implementation of ESSP, financing made
available by AusAID on June 9, 2011 took almost one year to process and approve, with
final approval on May 25, 2012. The TTL, who was relatively inexperienced, was not
appropriately supported and tutored during a World Bank management transition,
partially contributing to the delay. The short implementation period devised for AFII
resulted in some suboptimal outcomes. Selected new community-built classrooms
experienced shortcomings, such as: (i) no electrical installation (so they can be utilized in
the afternoon shift); (ii) unavailable teachers (due to poor teacher deployment); and (iii)
school furniture shortages. Furthermore, the Operational Manual of the community-based
construction was not validated prior to the launching of this scheme in order to calibrate
the content of the Manual to the educational level of participants.




                                                                                          13
2.2         Implementation

45. The ESSP project aimed originally at providing capacity building in the MoE for
improved service delivery. During the life of ESSP, including the preparation cycle,
several different MoE teams as well as task managers from the WB 9 and AusAID
changed, leading to a very fluid situation in which the goals and components shifted in
response to changing demands. What began as a project aimed at building MoE
governance capacity shifted over time to a project that was more results-based focusing at
improving early grades learning outcomes.

46. However, the changes and expansion of the project scope made during the
implementation cycle were carried out mainly by accretion, without restructuring and
weeding out original project design structural shortcomings, like, for example, lack of a
tighter design at entry and the flawed RF. Nonetheless, there were also achievements as
highlighted in the Data Sheet, Section 3.2 and Annex 2 of the ICR. This section
highlights the key factors outside and inside ESSP’s control that either contributed to or
adversely affected project implementation. The implementation rating is provided at the
end.

47. Issues outside the ESSP that had an adverse effect on project implementation. The
political, institutional (limited implementation capacity) and economic fragility existing
in TL (a post-conflict country) at the time of preparation and the early implementation
stages had adverse consequences in ensuring a speedy and effective implementation
process, especially during the 2008-09 period. At the time of Board approval, TL was
only just emerging from the chaos of the immediate post-independence period.
Educational management systems were weak, infrastructure was in a very poor state,
materials were in short supply and the quality of teaching was low. The civil unrest
during 2006 resulted in further disruption with buildings destroyed and people displaced.
More disturbances occurred in 2008 with the relocation of displaced people back to their
communities.

48. In addition, at the arrival of a newly elected government soon after the ESSP
approval, there was a complete staff overhaul and restructuring in the MoE, resulting in
the loss of key technical assistance staff, such as the project's implementation coordinator
and the procurement officer, who participated in the preparation phase. The new MoE
counterparts were only then learning about the project. Ownership of the project had to
be developed afresh with the new MoE team. Furthermore, the GoTL made a decision not
to disburse against ESSP until the then ongoing FTI-funded PESP project closed in
December 2008. Disbursements from the IDA Grant and the AusAID TF remained flat
at US$1.045 million (the initial allocation to the ESSP Designated Account) and zero
respectively during the first 15 months after effectiveness.

49. Parliamentary and presidential elections taking place for several months until mid-
2012, and followed up by leadership changes in the MoE, resulted again in comparatively

slow project implementation in 2012 (see Data Sheet). As it took some time for the new
leadership to settle, there were some pending issues at the closing of the ESSP, like the
establishment of the: (i) Polytechnic in Tourism and Hospitality (Component 4); and (ii)
LMU, whose organic law still needs to be discussed and approved by the new MoE
authorities (Component 2).

50. Issues within MoE that contributed to or affected project implementation. The
following four key factors contributed to improve the implementation process from mid-
2009 onwards. First, the capacity build up effort in MoE, albeit limited, through qualified
technical assistance (international and local) supported by the ESSP in many areas,
including, inter-alia: (i) fiduciary of procurement and financial management; (ii) strategic
education planning and implementation; (iii) higher education accreditation; and (iv)
construction.

51. Second, GoTL maintained annual joint reviews (AJR) with all donors and other key
stakeholders as a primary vehicle for the review of and planning for MoE’s sector
program. Four AJRs were successfully conducted during the life of the ESSP. Annual
ESSP Action Plans, including the annual Procurement Plan, were submitted by the MoE
and approved by WB in a timely fashion. The MoE furnished to the WB timely semi-
annual progress reports allowing for some, though not too many, preventive and/or
corrective as well as fine-tuning decision-making actions to address observable
implementation issues, when warranted. The preliminary findings from Early Grade
Reading Assessment (EGRA) and Early Grade Mathematics Assessment (EGMA) have
gradually shifted the policy discussion in the MoE from inputs to improving learning
outcomes.

52. Third, in addition to ESSP-AFI and AFII, the ESSP implementation was also
supported by two FTI grants, which sought to be a source of quick financing for
“credible” education sector plans that abided by an indicative framework and approved
by a vetting process of local international partners. Finally, the GoTL provided the
required counterpart funds as per the Grant Agreement (GA) as reported in the 10 ISRs.

53. But there were also some glitches during the implementation cycle adversely
affecting the first half of the life of ESSP. Most of these problems originated from the
project preparation gaps explained in Section 2.1, in particular the lack of implementation
readiness conditions at the time of Board approval. One of the most relevant issues was
the unsuccessful attempt to clarify with the new authorities the operational content of
Component 4 during the first two years of the implementation cycle, leading to a
restructuring of this Component in 2010.

54. Another non-intended shortfall refers to the estimated cost of ESSP at appraisal that
turned out to be too low during the implementation cycle. It seems that a change of the
original consultant requirement plan envisaged at appraisal by the new WB and MoE
teams resulted in more consultants than anticipated, especially international ones which
are much more costly. Had there not been an ESSP-AFI, the IDA Grant and the TF
amounting to US$12 million would have been exhausted by 2010, almost three years



                                                                                         15
before the closing date (see ISR#6 in the Data Sheet and table A2.3 in Annex 2).

55. The ICR rates the ESSP implementation as moderately satisfactory given the
successful completion of most project activities (Annex 2) counterweighted by the
implementation shortcomings described above.

2.3      Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

56.     M&E design and implementation is rated as moderately unsatisfactory. This
section assesses the ESSP M&E that included the: (i) RF; (ii) the EMIS; and (iii) various
learning assessment instruments. The original RF was revised twice leaving the original
PDO intact. Table 3 below summarizes the changes. There are six key design issues with
the original and revised RFs that the peer reviewers, the QER and the WB management
never flagged during the approval reviewing of the ESSP, AFI and AFII.

57.     First, the original RF comprises a very large number of indicators (9 outcome and
12 intermediate output indicators), some of which were redundant. For example, the
intermediate output indicator “all primary and pre-secondary school children and teachers
receiving learning materials and teaching guides and the use of those materials in
learning activities” is practically the same as the outcome indicator “enhanced quality
learning materials for all primary and pre-secondary students and teachers”. Even the
revised RF continued to include an excesive number of outcome indicators (8, one less
than the original RF) and intermediate outcome indicators (11, one less than the original
RF).

58.     Second, there are connectivity issues. For example, the outcome indicator
“improved work skills and attributes of pre-secondary leavers” is disconnected with the
stated PDO of “strengthening the capacity of the MoE for effective policy development,
resource management and innovation”.

                   Table 4. Changes made to the Results Framework

                         Changes made by ESSP-AFI                   Changes made by ESSP-AFII

Outcome        (ii) Improved gender parity index; (iii) Decline
indicators     in shortfall of classrooms in primary level; and
               (iv) Establishment of a learning assessment
               system for primary education.
               For Component 1:                                   A reduction in the target for school
               (i) Satisfaction of the MoE and development        furniture in response to a MoE
               with AJRs;                                         request to reallocate project funding
               (ii) Budget Execution Rate (BER); and              from school furniture to other costs

Intermediate   materials in learning activities; and
outcome        (ii) In place a unit within the MoE for the
indicators     procurement of learning materials and
and targets    textbooks (LMU).

               For Component 3:
               (i) Classrooms and facilities built with in-place
               school siting, construction, rehabilitation and
               maintenance standards; and
               (ii) Decline in shortfall of furniture at the
               primary level;

               For Component 4: (i) execution of at least 2
               training contracts under the grant; and (ii)
               preparation of a feasibility study for
               polytechnics in the hospitality and tourism,
               fisheries, oil and gas and agriculture sectors;
               and

               For Component 5:
               (i) Percentage of Grade 3 students who can read
               with a fluency of at least 60 words a minute;
               and
               (ii) Primary education survival rate.

59.      Third, the original RF lacked baseline data for seven out of nine outcome
indicators as well as end-of project targets for most of the outcome and intermediate
outcome indicators. Fourth, there are metric issues. For example, the metric to measure
the: (i) “utility of the learning assessment system”, one of the many outcome indicators,
is confusing; (ii) time-on-task is very difficult to be measured in the current school
system of TL; and (iii) the “Satisfaction of Ministry and Development Partners with
Annual Joint Review” is a very subjective and poor measure.

60.     Fifth, there are some issues of attribution. While the gender parity index (outcome
indicator #2) improved, exceeding the end-of-project target by about one percent, this
achievement cannot be uniquely attributed to ESSP. This is in line with general increases
in completion and survival rates. Likewise, the few activities that could have theoretically
impacted improved primary completion rates, like the early grade reading and learning
materials in Grades 1 to 3, needed at least three years of effective implementation to start
observing any changes in the six-year primary level in TL, if any. These materials started
arriving in the EB clusters in 2010, thus, assuming they would have impacted completion
rates, these could only be observed at the end of the school cycle 2013 (assuming the
existence of a functional standardized learning assessment in TL, which does not exist
right now). New classrooms (very few funded by ESSP and a much larger number from
other funds outside ESSP) could have increased enrollment but not necessarily
completion rates, especially if dropout rates continued to be high.

61.     Sixth, there is mislabeling by sometimes erroneously placing outcomes as
intermediate outputs and vice-versa. For example, the intermediate outcome indicator #3
in the Data Sheet - “Policy and Legal Framework in Place” - should have been one key



                                                                                         17
outcome indicator. Likewise with the intermediate outcome #10 – “Percentage of Grade 3
students who can read with a fluency of at least 60 words per minute” – should have been
another key outcome indicator.

62.     EMIS. At the time of approval of ESSP, MoE had an incipient EMIS, being
technically supported by the PESP and UNICEF, collecting data of primary schools only.
ESSP aimed at addressing urgent issues of capacity building, including staffing and
training in data collection, data entry and processing, analysis and report writing. In
addition, MoE was conducting annual national examinations in Grades 6, 9 and 12, albeit
non-standardized, hindering the possibility of longitudinal studies because the
instruments of one year could not be compared with subsequent years.

63.      M&E utilization is a mixed story. On the positive side, the EMIS, with the
technical and financial support from NZAID in the last few years, has built capacity for
data collection, data entry and processing for students, teachers and schools in the
primary level (before ESSP), pre-secondary and general secondary (as of 2008), technical
vocational education and training institutions (TVET) (as of 2010) and adult/non-formal
education (as of 2013). The first education yearly statistics report for school year 2008-09
is out, and the one of 2009-10 in process.

64.     Non-standardized annual national examinations are currently being conducted in
Grades 9 and 12. The carrying out of one EGRA and one EGMA under the ESSP in 2011
resulted in preliminary findings about the poor levels of reading and math in the primary
education level, offering the MoE the possibility of an informed corrective and/or
preventive policy decision-making and resource allocation process in the future. This is
an important and commendable achievement by the MoE/ESSP.

65.     On the downside, the original RF did not allow for an appropriate and more
objective measurement towards the achievement of the PDO and end-of-project targets.
In addition, after five years of project implementation, the M&E and reporting system
within the MoE has not been properly set as sufficient improvements were not made
during the life of ESSP. The consultant financed by ESSP supporting the development of
the EMIS concluded his assignment without providing the MoE an Operational Manual
and appropriate documentation of the architecture of the EMIS.

66.     There is no capacity yet within the EMIS for exploitation of the database for
analytical work, and less for the MoE to underpin policy-making and budgetary
allocation decisions based on EMIS and learning outcomes findings. The findings of the
non-standardized annual national examination (a scheme operated by the MoE’s
Curriculum Directorate) are not articulated with the EMIS data, nor with the
infrastructure information collected by the IFU. There has not been any assessment on the
implementation of the NESP. Building analytical capacity within the different units of the
MoE will require, in addition to the technical support being currently provided by
UNICEF and NZAID, addressing issues of staffing, organization, space, hardware and
software and appropriate articulation of the different M&E actors.




                                                                                         18
67.    The analysis of EGRA and EGMA findings were finalized in two reports soon to
be disseminated (see Annex 9). New EGRA and EGMA surveys are being planned for
2014 under a Bank-executed trust fund program to be financed by the Australian
government.

68.    Based on all of the above strengths and shortcomings, the ESSP M&E
arrangement is rated as moderately unsatisfactory.

2.4    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

69.    Financial management is rated satisfactory. Several supervision missions
included a WB financial management specialist who would undertake a thorough review
and provide detailed reports of findings and agreements. According to various ISRs, these
missions rated the project’s financial management performance as satisfactory.

70.     The ESSP maintained a financial management system as agreed in the GA and
submitted quarterly financial management reports (FMRs) on the agreed periodicity.
Different WB supervision missions attested to the fact that disbursements of the original
grants and their additional financing, except in the early stages of the implementation
cycle, progressed at an appropriate pace.

71.     The above is a noteworthy achievement, given that as per the findings of the
financial management capacity assessment undertaken at the appraisal of the ESSP-AFI,
a central concern was flagged concerning the continued and significant dependency of the
financial management capacity within the MoE on only two key staff. Despite this
concern, Component 1 supported additional capacity building and transfer of
competencies on financial management to the MoE through training and qualified
technical assistance.

72.     There were some issues with the supporting documentation submitted by certain
communities participating in the community-based construction approach launched in
about 80 communities in 2013 against ESSP-AFII. These issues, which were in time
satisfactorily addressed before the closing of the project, mainly stem from limited
financial management training and on-site support to participating community
committees with, by and large low levels of literacy and numeracy skills. Annual audit
reports were submitted on time during the entire life of the project and they were
unqualified (clean).

73.    Procurement is rated as moderately satisfactory. As per the ISRs, several WB
supervision missions included a WB procurement specialist undertaking limited
procurement post reviews along routine physical random spot-checks of ongoing
contracts. Procurement ratings ranged from MU at the onset of the implementation cycle
to MS and S towards the second half of the implementation cycle.

74.    As mentioned before, at the onset of ESSP’s implementation, the only
procurement capacity existing in the MoE, albeit weak, was dismissed. This resulted in



                                                                                      19
considerable back and forth correspondence between the WB and MoE, prior to the
issuing of 'no objections', as most of the procurement activities in the initial years of
implementation were subject to prior review.

75.     A post review conducted in March 2011 (once there were sufficient transactions
for post review) identified as key issues poor record keeping and inadequate contract
management. The services of several individual consultants hired under earlier sector
projects were continued under ESSP. However, there was no documentation available in
the ESSP files to verify the selection and clearance process of these consultants. With the
hiring of an international procurement advisor in the second half of the implementation
cycle, procurement performance and the quality of documentation improved, including
those of the newly implemented community-based construction.

76.    Management of consultant services continued to be a shortcoming, as MoE did
not assign appropriate in-house staff to supervise the services. A report prepared by
Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited, the external auditors contracted by the Ministry of
Finance in 2012 to review MoE’s procurement processes for the period January 2009 to
June 2011, identified similar shortcomings and recommended actions that were in line
with those recommended in the WB's post review reports (see Annex 9).

77.     The community-based construction modality revealed that in some very isolated
villages it was not possible for the community to ensure three independent price
quotations, indicating that if this modality of construction is implemented in the future,
alternative options need to be considered.

78.    Taking into consideration the point of departure, MoE’s procurement capacity has
improved as demonstrated by on-track disbursement rates for recent ongoing projects in
the education sector. Detailed procurement plans were kept and regularly updated, at least
annually or as required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and
improvements in institutional capacity. No misprocurement was ever reported.

79.    The procurement capacity in MoE remained with a few key staff, on which both
the ESSP and the MoE were significantly dependent. The ESSP, through an international
procurement consultant recruited under Component 1 and to be retained until July 2015
under the Management Strengthening Project (MSP), supported the buildup of MoE’s in-
house procurement capacity, albeit still very limited.

80.    Compliance with environmental safeguards is rated satisfactory. The project was
given a C environmental rating at the original and additional financing appraisals because
the ESSP did not pose a substantial risk on the Operational Policy 4.01 (Environmental
Assessment).

81.    The strengthened supervision of the IFU ensured that: (i) appropriate construction
and maintenance techniques were used on all school sites benefiting from construction
proceeds outside the ESSP; and (ii) water supply and sanitation facilities were properly
placed. No land acquisition or resettlement took place during the implementation cycle,



                                                                                        20
as all civil works undertaken by the MoE/IFU were conducted on sites on which existing
schools were being rehabilitated, expanded or replaced, or on sites that were on vacant
government land that was free from all encumbrances, habitation, dispute, claim, and
controversy. The GoTL ratified its environmental safeguards and building code, all of
which were covered in the school construction manual and standards, as well as in the
technical specification clause of the bidding documents.

82.     Because ESSP had a nation-wide implementation and Timorese people are
considered indigenous (including 17 major languages), this project also triggered the
Indigenous Peoples (OP/BP 4.10) safeguard. ESSP did not have any negative impact on
indigenous groups. The early grade learning literacy and numeracy materials provided by
ESSP to all 202 EB clusters and 885 filial schools in the entire country, including the
training of teachers, were in Tetum and Portuguese. Different ethnic groups were
consulted during project preparation. The community-based construction approach
carried out in 2013, largely targeting rural areas, was implemented in both languages.

83.     The Construction Engineer assigned to supervise the implementation of
Component 3 reported compliance on the following three of the four key social indicators
set by the WB, including the opportunity of benefited communities to participate in the:
(i) construction/rehabilitation; (ii) procurement of materials; and (iii) oversight of school
construction/rehabilitation activities. The WB safeguard 2013 supervision mission
visiting 7 of the 27 filial schools benefiting from the community-based construction
approach noted that: (i) there was no visible ethnic exclusion in the allocation of project
resources and in the selection of schools to be rehabilitated/ maintained; and (ii) in certain
communities where Tetum was not the prevailing language, the understanding of the
community-based construction Operational Manual by participants was more difficult
than in those communities where Tetum is the mother tongue.

2.5    Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

84.     With the closing of ESSP, and despite the ongoing MSP (a Global Partnership for
Education-financed operation amounting to US$2.8 million approved in July 2012 and
closing in July 2015) supporting several of the ESSP activities (mainly those under
Component 1) and a potential forthcoming Australian Government grant directly to MoE,
a sustainability strategy still needs to be agreed and finalized between the MoE, the WB
and Australia ensuring:

a.     The continuation of the international technical assistance provided by ESSP to
       MoE’s Directorates like: (i) Planning and Development; (ii) Administration,
       Finance, Logistics and Supplies; (iii) Basic and Secondary Education; (iv)
       Curricula; and (v) Technical and Higher Education; and

b.     The continuation of the National Escola Basica Working Group (NEBWG)
       committed to effectively address the implementation and monitoring of the EB
       reform. However, this in turn requires agreement on an annual work plan and
       time-schedule including:



                                                                                           21
        i.         The long-overdue review of the existing National Quality of School
                   Standards Framework;
      ii.          Continuation of the EB cluster leadership and the leadership capabilities in
                   the Directorate of Basic and Secondary Education to roll out and manage
                   the reform strategically;
      iii.         Establishment of a clear 2014 budget and training plan for ongoing
                   support to schools; and
      iv.          Availability of qualified human and financial resources to conduct regular
                   monitoring of EB activities, ensuring effective and timely coordination
                   with District offices (assuming clarity in their roles, responsibilities and
                   accountability in carrying out these tasks).

3.           Assessment of Outcomes

3.1       Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

85.      At the preparation stage (2006). The PDO and Components 1, 2 and 3 were in
full alignment with the first and third pillars included in the GoTL CAS FY06-FY08 (June
22, 2005, Report 32700-TP). Under the first pillar intended to support delivering
sustainable services, the ESSP aimed at financing: (i) the capacity building for policy,
planning and program development within the MoE; (ii) the production/procurement,
distribution and utilization of learning materials; and (iii) school construction and
rehabilitation design and quality assurance.

86.     Under the third pillar intended to support the strengthening of governance in
particular with respect to: (a) capacity to manage for and monitor results on the ground;
and (b) improve implementation of budget execution in a transparent manner, in line with
savings policy and sustainable growth and poverty reduction goals, the ESSP aimed at
financing the capacity buildup for procurement, financial management, contract
management and monitoring and evaluation activities within the MoE.

87.     The ICR did not find an explicit CAS pillar referring to Component 4, beyond an
indirect relationship with the second pillar of the CAS – creating productive employment
– a strategy under the CAS acting on the demand-side of the productive employment
equation, while Component 4 of the ESSP addresses the supply side of the equation.

88.      At the time of the closing of the ESSP. The ESSP is aligned to the current CPS
(Report No. 75263-TP dated February 19, 2013) indicating that the WB-financed
activities in the sector will concentrate on improving the management and delivery of
services, in particular those corresponding to education. Within this overall strategic area,
the CPS identifies as one engagement area increasing access to and quality of education
through technical assistance to improve the efficiency and quality of service provision in
education and skills development. Components 1 to 5 of the ESSP fully meet these goals.




                                                                                            22
89.     Accordingly, the current relevance of the ESSP PDO and Components 1, 2, 3 and
5 of the project design are high.

3.2      Achievement of Project Development Objectives

90.    This section needs to be read together with the Data Sheet and section 2.3 of the
ICR, and reflects the achievements towards the key outcome and output indicators/targets.
As per current WB ICR Guidelines (Annex B), a split assessment of the achievement of
the PDO needs to be conducted because, although the PDO remained unchanged
throughout the entire implementation cycle, the outcome indicators were modified at the
time of approving the ESSP-AFI (made effective on January 2011), and additional ones
added at the time of approving ESSP-AFII (made effective on August 2012).

91.     The ICR rates the split achievement of the PDO as moderately satisfactory for
the reasons explained in the paragraphs below and the weighted calculations shown in
Table 5 as a function of the amount of project funds disbursed and documented pre- and
post-restructuring in which the formal changes were made.

92.     The ratings of the achievement towards the PDO evolved from MU at the early
stages of project implementation in 2007 to MS during 2008 to S during 2009 and 2010.
Therefore, the achievement towards the PDO for the first period of the split evaluation
(as reflected by the original outcome and output indicators) is rated as MS. For the
second period of the split evaluation running from January 2011 to December 2012, the
PDO ratings displayed in the ICR Data Sheet are all S. Finally, for the third period of
the split evaluation running for the period January to July 2013, the PDO ratings
displayed in the ICR Data sheet are all MS.

93.     The first achievement of ESSP concerns the creation of an education wide
approach and strategy that was absent prior to the ESSP (intermediate outcome
indicator #3). With the support of an array of consultants, a NESP is in place and is
being implemented. Consequently, the Policy and Legal framework has been
significantly developed including the Basic Education Organic Law, and a series of
decrees and regulations, like inter-alia: (i) AAPs and budgets are being produced
annually and (generally) in line with NESP; (ii) a preschool education policy is now
ready to be discussed; (iii) the Law for the Establishment of the Higher Education System
was approved in 2010; (iv) the Law Curriculum Plan and Implementation Regime for
Secondary Education was approved in 2011; (v) the strengthening of the Inclusive
Education Office in the MoE; and (vi) there is progress on the drafting of the
Strengthening of the Teacher Policy Framework along the Competency Framework and a
Career Regime. These achievements were recognized at each one of the four AJRs
conducted during the life of the ESSP (intermediate outcome indicator #1).

94.      In conjunction with the above achievement, the establishment of the NCAAA is
fully functional and has conducted two sets of accreditation of higher education
institutions: (i) the first one in 2008 financed by ESSP; and (ii) the second in 2009 fully
financed by the GoTL, a clear manifestation of sustainability, which is very
commendable. Nine higher education institutions have received full accreditation lasting
for five years, two institutions received partial accreditation, another five institutions are
at some stage of the accreditation process, and five institutions were closed.

95.    The second achievement of ESSP concerns the conduct of annual national
examinations for Grades 9 and 12 (outcome indicator #4), a scheme non-existent prior
to the start of the ESSP. However, this system still needs to be strengthened, and if
possible, standardized allowing for longitudinal and cross-sectional comparisons. This
achievement also includes TL having been among the pioneers administrating EGRA and
EGMA assessments in the region (intermediate outcome indicator #10). The
preliminary results of EGRA have shown severe shortcomings in this realm (only 26
percent of children could read at least 60 words per minute). EGRA and EGMA’s
preliminary findings have started to shift MoE’s policy discussion towards improving
learning outcomes.

96.    The third achievement of ESSP concerns the provision of early grade literacy and
numeracy learning materials along with initial training of two days to corresponding
teachers (outcome indicator #7). This is a good first step, but more needs to be done,



                                                                                           24
starting with assessing the use of these materials by teachers and students and their
impact on learning, and then gradually moving towards a more comprehensive approach
for addressing teacher issues in the EB (e.g. recruitment, pre- and in-service teacher
training, deployment, career path and on-site monitoring and support).

97.    The fourth achievement of ESSP concerns the project’s support to IFU to manage
the construction of about 1,773 classrooms (outcome indicator #3). However, this
achievement felt short by 15.6 percent of the end-of-project target of 2,100 additional
classrooms.

98.     The fifth achievement of ESSP concerns the acquisition of 16,570 sets of chairs
and desks for about 33,000 children, short of the 54,000 children established as an end-of
project target (intermediate outcome indicator #7). Notwithstanding this significant
contribution, the current shortfall stands at a dismal 139,373 desks and 105,647 chairs for
an expected number of 329,157 students.

99.    The sixth achievement of ESSP concerns the institutionalization of IFU within
MoE. IFU migrated from replacing the international consultant responsible for contract
management and supervision at the early stages of the ESSP to qualified national
consultants. School siting and construction/rehabilitation standards were developed and
adopted, which is not the case with school maintenance standards yet to be developed
(intermediate outcome indicator #6).

100. The seventh achievement of ESSP concerns MoE’s overall Budget Execution
Rate (BER) improvement (intermediate outcome indicator #2), even though the
achievement of 89 percent felt short by a little over 6 percent of the end-of- project target.
The ICR team noted that the BER registered in 2010 was 95 percent (the end-of-project
target) and 94 percent in 2011. However, as a result of the parliamentary and presidential
elections and the changes of the MoE’s leadership, the 2012 BER decreased to 89 percent.

101. The eighth and last achievement of ESSP concerns the central institutional
capacity build up to manage and deliver education services (outcome indicator #6).
Taking into consideration the starting point, a lot was achieved, even with the
participation of a large number of consultants. Greater institutional strengthening and
reliance on MoE’s staff is still warranted. For example, there is little evidence to support
that this capacity buildup has spilled over to regional and local levels. The MSP is
currently financing this required additional strengthening.

102. The following achievements of MoE cannot be uniquely attributed to ESSP. The
gender parity index (outcome indicator #2) improved, exceeding the end-of-project target
by about one percent. This is in line with general increases in completion and survival
rates. The FTI-Bridging project in 2009 included an Inclusive Education Strategy and
implementation. In addition, the GoTL acknowledgement of the importance of girls’
education and gender equity is reflected as a priority area under the National Education
Strategic Plan (NESP) 2011-2030.




                                                                                          25
103. According to EMIS data, primary completion rates 10 (outcome indicator #1) at
the closing of the project exceeded the target by 4 percent while the primary education
survival rates 11 (intermediate outcome indicator #11) also significantly surpassed the
end-of–project target. These improvements cannot be directly ascribed to ESSP since
there is no evaluation framework in place to do so rigorously. Construction interventions
could have impacted the primary completion and survival rates. However, ESSP-financed
construction activities only under AFII in 2013 and the scope of this support was limited.
One could argue that a strengthened IFU through ESSP support, executing MoE’s
construction programs outside ESSP more effectively and timely, could have contributed
to the increase in primary net enrollment rates from 72.7 percent in 2008 (baseline) to
90.4 percent in 2011 (latest available figure from the World Development Indicators,
2013). 12 Enrollment increases could have contributed to improving primary completion
rates.

104. With respect to shortcomings, in the first place, learning findings from national
assessments have had a limited role for decision-making policy (outcome indicator #5).

105. The second shortcoming concerns the lack of hard evidence to gauge the
attainment of the intermediate outcome indicator #4 - “all primary and pre-secondary
school children and teachers received learning materials and teaching guides and use
these materials in learning activities” - because: (i) the information about the final
distribution of learning materials and teachers guides was still being collected and
processed by the EMIS unit within MoE at the time of the ICR; and (ii) no measurement
instrument (like the Stallings classroom observation) was ever used to assess learning
material utilization by teachers.

106. The third shortcoming concerns ESSP’s failure to establish the LMU
(intermediate outcome indicator #5), whose institutionalization is currently being
discussed in the context of the ongoing restructuring of MoE.

107. The fourth shortcoming concerns school maintenance standards that were not
developed by ESSP (intermediate outcome indicator #6).

108. The fifth shortcoming refers to Component 4. Even though the feasibility study
for the polytechnic in hospitality and tourism was completed (intermediate outcome
indicator #9) and four training contracts awarded (intermediate outcome indicator #8)
to train 20 lecturers for the envisaged polytechnic in hospitality and tourism, the
outcome indicator #8 concerning “improved work-skills and attributes of pre-secondary
leavers” was not achieved. Furthermore, the above-mentioned polytechnic, promised by



10
   Primary completion rate is the total number of students regardless of age in the last grade of primary
school, minus repeaters in that grade, divided by the total number of children of official graduation age.
11
   Survival rate is the percentage of a cohort of students enrolled in the first grade of a given level or cycle
in a given school expected to reach successive grades.
12
   For secondary education, the only available data is gross enrollment rate, which increased from 49.5
percent in 2008 to 58.1 percent in 2011.


                                                                                                            26
MoE during the restructuring of Component 4, has not yet been approved even as a plan.
As a consequence, there has not been a professional re-entry for 19 of the 20 trainees that
completed their two-year training in Australia and Indonesia supported by ESSP, and
signed contracts with MoE to work in this polytechnic for four years upon their return.
This is an unsatisfactory outcome of ESSP with possible reputational risks for the GoTL,
MoE and the involved international partners.

3.3    Efficiency

109. Overall the economic and financial analysis finds that TL experienced increases
in gross enrollment rates during the span of the ESSP project, but equity remains a
concern. Given the rates of return to education (a global average of around 10 percent),
individual and economy-wide benefits are likely to accrue. However, gaps between urban
and rural areas persisted, and children from wealthier households are more likely to
continue to higher levels of education than children from poorer households. Repetition
rates remained high, particularly for boys at the primary level. Coupled with high
proportions of over-age children in the early grades, this implies that inefficiencies in the
system continue unabated.

110. However, the country has taken regular steps to monitor the quality of education
being delivered to its students. Multiple assessments of learning were undertaken over the
years and covered Portuguese, Tetum and Mathematics in the early grades of primary
schools. Some of these assessments were supported by the ESSP project. While the
methods and coverage of each assessment has varied, they have all consistently pointed
to low levels of learning across a number of subjects and grades.

111. In contrast to the outcomes of the system, a recent assessment of economic
efficiency pointed to improvements in the MoE’s ability to handle and disburse the
budget. Recent years have seen a striking improvement in the MoE’s budget execution
rate. The ESSP’s strong focus on capacity building for planning could have played a role.
For instance, project spending data suggests that districts with greater need are receiving
larger allocations of learning materials and resources under ESSP.

3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

112. Factoring the very low point of departure of ESSP, the achievement of the eight
above-mentioned full or partial accomplishments, the current addressing of some ESSP
shortcomings concerning MoE’s continued capacity building, especially at the regional
and local levels, and increase of information for decision making processes (through the
support of MSP and NZAID), with one key major shortcoming concerning Component 4,
the overall outcome is rated as moderately satisfactory.




                                                                                          27
3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

113. Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development. Component 3
supported the strengthening of IFU to become more effective and timely in the carrying
out of MoE’s school construction and rehabilitation programs (inside and outside ESSP).
The construction interventions were mainly targeted to poor urban and rural areas of the
country. As a consequence, the primary gross enrollment rates jumped from 103.3 in
2008 to almost 124 percent in 2011, while those for secondary education increased from
72.7 to 90.4 percent in the same period. The provision of early grades literacy and
numeracy learning materials in all schools has likely contributed to better teaching and
learning practices. ESSP has likely contributed to more poor children attending and
completing primary education and starting their secondary education as compared to the
start of this project. The gender parity index also improved from 95 to almost 99 percent
during the life of the project.

114. Institutional Change/Strengthening. ESSP largely contributed to the
establishment of an education sector wide approach and strategy amply detailed in
section 3.2 and Annex 2 of the ICR. ESSP was a minor player in having EMIS collect
and input in a database information about students, teachers and schools of 202 EB
clusters and 885 filial schools in the country every year. Based on the preliminary
findings of EGRA and EGMA surveys, addressing learning outcomes is now part of
MoE’s policy discussion.

115. (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative). 19
trainees that spent two years training in competency-based skills in tourism and
hospitality in Australia and Indonesia under scholarships provided by ESSP cannot be
employed in the promised new polytechnic that currently is at design stage and planned
to be put in operation in 2015.

3.6  Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder
Workshops

116.   Not applicable.

4.     Assessment of Risks to Development Outcome

117. Progress in fully sustaining the achievements mentioned in section 3.2 of this ICR
will largely depend on the ability of the newly restructured MoE to: (i) ensure an
appropriate 2014 budget, especially concerning the non-recurrent part (fresh resources);
(ii) re-engage with donors in a framework where the MoE is in the driver seat steering
this engagement (not the other way around), in particular with respect to continued
support to the EB scheme and emerging areas such as addressing teacher policy issues;
and (iii) to further build capacity to develop plans, manage resources and deliver services
in an effective and timely manner, especially at the regional and local levels.




                                                                                        28
118. Several examples follow to illustrate the significant risk to sustaining ESSP gains.
The EB cluster leadership and administrative cadre comprising the director, deputy
director and administrative officer last in their positions on average between two to three
years. With this significant rotation, if the EB management training is not provided in a
recurrent fashion, whatever capacity built will certainly erode. The case is similar with
trained teachers in the use of the literacy and numeracy learning materials provided by
the ESSP. When a new teacher is posted for Grades 1 to 3, training needs to be provided,
otherwise there is a risk of these materials not being used. Some replacement of learning
materials due to deterioration or loss will be needed in the near future and new
classrooms will need maintenance.

119. Despite fresh funding through MSP, UNICEF, NZAID, and in the near future
Australia, being made available to MoE to partially sustain some ESSP gains, given the
current political economy of TL and low capacity of the civil service, there is a
significant risk to sustaining the ESSP development objectives.

5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank Performance

(a)    Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry: Moderately unsatisfactory

120. The preparation cycle took about 14 months and 4 missions from identification of
ESSP in early February 2006 to its appraisal in April 25, 2007. Negotiations took place in
May 2007, Board approval on June 19, 2007, signing of the IDA Grant (H310 TP) in
August 2007, and signing of the AusAID Trust Fund Grant (TF-90564) in September
2007. The IDA Grant became effective in early January 2008, while the AusAID Grant
became effective on the signing date. The lack of an Operational Manual satisfactory to
IDA (one condition of grant effectiveness) at the time of project appraisal explains the
delay of about six months in granting project effectiveness after Board approval.

121. Only one TTL was responsible for the entire project preparation cycle. The
preparation cycle also benefited from one internal QER carried out in January 2007, four
months prior to appraisal. The QER panel recognized the extremely challenging and
volatile political, institutional and implementation environment in which the WB
education team was working, compounded by weak capacity of MoE to prepare and
implement the envisaged ESSP.

122. The QER panel endorsed the project design that build upon previous projects and
aimed at addressing the policy/strategy vacuum in post-primary education. However, the
QER panel missed flagging the complexity of the proposed project design including four
components and ten sub-components, and that Component 4 was disconnected from the
proposed PDO. Lessons learned from other projects in TL and other fragile countries
recommended much simpler and more focused project designs.




                                                                                        29
123. Section 2.1 of this ICR describes in detail the strengths and shortcomings during the
preparation phase, which will not be repeated here.

124. Weighing project preparation strengths, in particular the ability of the WB team to
work in a non-conducive environment for project preparation and deliver a project to the
Board, with the above-mentioned shortcomings, in particular: (i) the unfocused, broad
and complex project design; (ii) the lack of an operational description of Component 4;
(iii) the lack of implementation readiness conditions characterized by the absence of an
Operational Manual and Terms of Reference (ToRs) for the first batch of international
consultants required to start implementing the “new expanded ESSP activities”; and (iv) a
flawed RF design, the WB performance at preparation is rated as moderately
unsatisfactory.

(b)   Quality of Supervision: Moderately Satisfactory

125. Three TTLs and one co-TTL were responsible for the supervision of ESSP and the
preparation and Board approval of ESSP AFI and AFII. The tenure of the first TTL
(Washington D.C.-based) replacing the TTL in charge of preparation extended from
effectiveness in early 2008 until mid-2010. The co-TTL (Dili-based), participated in the
preparation of the ESSP AFI until its approval in June 2010. The tenure of the second
TTL (Sydney-based) lasted from mid-2010 until the approval of ESSP AFII in May 2012.
Finally, the third TTL (Jakarta-based) led from mid-2012 until the closing of ESSP.

126. During the period 2010-2011, ISR filings were conducted on an annual basis as per
EAP regional practice at the time [13 months between the ISRs #5 (February 2010) and
#6 (March 2011), a time period coinciding with the change from the first to the second
TTL, and another of 13 months between the ISR #6 (March 2011) and #7 (April 2012)].

127. The most desirable approach to place TTL responsibilities in-country in the case of
fragile states was, by and large, not possible. An extended term contracted staff was
based in Dili for a two-year period, although the role was primarily technical due to his
limited operational experience. An option to draw Indonesian staff from the Jakarta
office (geographically close to Dili) at the onset of the implementation cycle was
politically a sensitive matter with the GoTL. Accordingly, and as alerted in the mid-term
supervision findings, the ESSP TTL arrangements did not enable just-in-time back-up to
address operational bottlenecks as well as continuous on-site monitoring of the physical
and financial implementation process in a context of a complex project design, weak
implementation/institutional capacity and an overall difficult political and economic
macro-environment. The fact that the senior lead for the technical assistance team
contracted by the ESSP was increasingly part-time by virtue of limited ESSP funding,
magnified these issues.

128. The ESSP was subjected to 14 supervision missions, including the September 2010
mid-term review and the August 2013 ICR mission. The above implies that in the 67
months elapsing from effectiveness (January 2008) to the closing of the ESSP (July 31,
2013), on average, the WB team carried-out one supervision every 5 months. Bank staff



                                                                                       30
located in the Dili WB office provided support, mostly on operational and fiduciary
ESSP-related matters and on following up on compliance with carrying out agreed tasks
between missions. The ten archived ISRs were updated on average about once every nine
months, except for the two large waiting periods mentioned above.

129. The supervision missions included the appropriate skill-mix to carry out their
envisaged terms of reference as shown in Annex 4 of the ICR, including procurement,
financial management and on one occasion a safeguards specialist. The findings of each
supervision mission were conveyed to Bank management and to the GoTL in a clear and
straightforward manner, including accomplishments and implementation shortcomings,
potential risks, and implementation flags. Ratings were, by and large, consistent with
supervision reports, downgrading when necessary and upgrading when there were signs
of improvement.

130. At the beginning of the project cycle, the emphasis of the WB supervisions was
placed on getting inputs right and trying unsuccessfully to clarify the operational
characteristics of Component 4. From the mid-implementation cycle onwards, the WB
supervision emphasis was then rightfully shifted to ensuring that the various processes
would be carried out according to the ESSP Operational Manual, and the achievement of
targets comprised in the PDO.

131. There were other strengths and shortcomings in WB supervision. One important
achievement is the work done by the WB supervision team to influence a shift in MoE’s
policy discussion from inputs like bricks and mortars for classroom construction and
rehabilitation and provision of learning materials (characteristic of the first half of the
implementation cycle) to learning outcomes through the implementation of the EGRA
and EGMA (characteristic of the second half of the implementation cycle) and the
introduction of Escuela Nueva 13 in the country (financed by UNICEF). This shift was
reflected in the ESSP AFI Project Paper and Financing Agreement.

132. Another strength was forecasting that the original IDA grant and TF were going to
be exhausted by 2010, and then preparing and processing ESSP-AFI.

133. Three shortcomings are noted. First, as already mentioned in section 2.3, there
were deficiencies associated with the RF in ESSP-AFI. The second one refers to the
delayed preparation to process and approve the Amendment of the Administrative
Agreement with AusAID corresponding to ESSP-AFII, adding US$2.97 million, signed
on June 11, 2011. Due to lengthy internal Bank processes for this additional financing,
the Administrative Agreement with AusAID had to be amended again on May 25, 2012.
These additional funds were granted to the GoTL through an Amendment of the Grant

  Escuela Nueva is an educational model designed in Colombia in the 1970’s to improve the quality and
effectiveness of the schools, especially isolated multigrade rural schools. It benefits children, teachers,
administrators, families, and the community through four interrelated and structured components: the
curriculum and classroom, community, training, and management and evaluations. This model has been
globally recognized as a proven social innovation raising learning outcomes and completion rates.


                                                                                                        31
Agreement, signed on May 31, 2012. Although implementation was started immediately,
it was not easy for MoE to complete project activities by the closing date, July 31, 2013,
especially as it involved a National Competitive Bidding procedure for the selection of
construction firms and community-based school construction. The third flaw refers to the
quality at entry of ESSP-AFII already described in section 2.2.

134. Weighing supervision strengths, in particular addressing project preparation gaps
and turning around the physical and financial implementation pace, ensuring achievement
of most outcome and intermediate outcome indicators and shifting MoE’s policy
discussion to include improvement in learning outcomes, counterweighed with
supervision weaknesses, in particular the RF deficiencies, the ICR rates the Bank
supervision performance as moderately satisfactory.

(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

       Rating: Moderately satisfactory

135. The ICR rates the overall WB performance as moderately satisfactory because
even though the rating at the preparation stage was rated moderately unsatisfactory, the
WB performance during supervision contributed to: (i) shifting MoE’s policy discussion
from inputs to project processes and outcomes; and (ii) the moderately satisfactory
attainment of the PDO and most of the established targets.

5.2    Borrower Performance

(a)    Government Performance: Moderately unsatisfactory at preparation stage

136. Given limited project preparation capacity within MoE, the ESSP was designed
and prepared by consultants hired by the MoE through the IFU and funded by the
ongoing PESP under terms of reference per the advice of donor partners, including the
WB. Given the contextual reality existing in TL in 2006, this was probably the only
option available to prepare a project.

137. This section does not rate the performance of those consultants that prepared the
project, but rather of MoE as the GoTL institution formally entrusted with the preparation.
Nonetheless, attuned to section 2.1 and the fact that donor partners largely guided these
consultants, the government performance at preparation needs to mirror that of the WB,
and thus the rating stands at moderately unsatisfactory.

138. This significant reliance on technical assistance during preparation was
thoroughly discussed during the January 2007 QER meeting, including lack of: (i)
sufficient experienced professional and leadership/management staff within MoE; (ii) a
medium to long-term clear vision/strategy for MoE to define an appropriate
organizational chart, terms of reference of key posts, and a harmonized donor agenda;
and (iii) a merit/skills-based recruitment system. This situation was not generalized
across other Ministries of GoTL, like the health sector where projects were being



                                                                                       32
prepared and implemented by technical staff of that Ministry precisely because the
above-mentioned reasons were not present in this sector.

139. While it is a fact that this option ensured the preparation and submission of the
ESSP to the WB Board, the reliance on technical assistance during the preparation phase
had two immediate adverse effects. First, the ownership of ESSP by MoE was limited.
Second, whatever project preparation capacity was built within the MoE during the
preparation phase was lost soon after Board approval as a consequence of a complete
overhaul of staff at MoE. More than one year was required by the new MoE staff to
understand and partially start managing the implementation of ESSP with consultants’
support.

140. One positive fact of the preparation cycle was the stability of the then elected
government for the period 2002-2007, which resulted in one Prime Minister and one
Minister of Education whose tenures remained during the entire project preparation cycle
running from its identification in January - February 2006 to negotiations in May 2007.

       Rating at the implementation stage: Moderately Satisfactory

141. ESSP took place under the tenure of three elected governments comprising the
same, three-times reelected Prime Minister: (i) 2002-2007, which coincided with the
preparation cycle up to Board approval; (ii) 2007-2012, overlapping with almost all the
implementation cycle; and (iii) 2012-onwards, concurring with the last stages of the
implementation cycle and the closing of ESSP. This context, in turn, resulted in only
three Ministers heading the MoE along the same time periods as above.

142. The above political context resulted in GoTL’s timely allocation of counterpart
funds for ESSP as attested by the satisfactory rating given to this dimension of the
implementation in all ISRs. In addition, counterpart funds were included into the annual
budget of every year of the ESSP cycle allowing for their disbursement.

143. On the downside, there were times during the implementation cycle characterized
by unpredictability of education funding from the national budget. Not only did TL have
the lowest share of national budget allocated to education in the East Asia Pacific Region
(about nine percent of recurrent national budget), but the approved MoE budgets and
budget proposals experienced unpredictable cuts several times during the implementation
cycle, thus undermining the achievement of agreed education targets in the NESP.

144. Rating: Given the above-mentioned facts under a severe fragility context, the
ICR rates the Borrower performance at implementation as moderately satisfactory.

(b)    Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance: Moderately satisfactory

145. Even though the implementing entity was entrusted to MoE, ESSP was a
consultant-intensive project through the IFU, which in addition to being in charge of




                                                                                       33
Component 3, also acted as a de-facto Project Implementation Unit, accountable to the
Director General of Corporate Services of MoE.

146. International consultants were recruited to implement, for example: (i) financial
management; (ii) procurement; (iii) budgeting; (iv) EB (for developing the training
modules of inspectors, school directors, deputy school directors, technical administrative
officers, and coordinators of filial schools); (v) EMIS (one consultant to develop the
EMIS and another for writing of applications); (vi) inclusive education; (vii) IFU; (viii)
LMU; (ix) the legal department (one consultant for basic education and another for
higher education); (x) strategy (one consultant for education planning and another for
implementation); (xi) teacher competency; (xii) higher education accreditation; (xiii)
polytechnics; (xiv) EGRA and EGMA; and (xv) liaison specialist (to coordinate the
myriad of consultants). A total of about 160 consultancy contracts amounting to
US$8.69 million, or 43 percent of ESSP’s total documented expenditure (Table A2.3 of
Annex 2), were granted during the life of the ESSP, with 40 percent of these contracts
being for international consultants, who were significantly more expensive than national
consultants.

147. There were four key implementation strengths. First, some capacity build-up to
undertake ESSP’s financial management and procurement with no misprocurement or
audit qualifications during the entire implementation cycle. This attests to the visible
mentoring impact of international consultants. More capacity build up is still required,
some of which is currently being financed by the MSP, UNICEF and NZAID. As
mentioned in the Data Sheet, section 3.2 and Annex 2, four AJR meetings between the
MoE, other representatives of GoTL, and the donor community were conducted during
the life of ESSP to review capacity building accomplishments along the physical and
financial ESSP implementation progress.

148. Second, based on the preliminary findings of the EGRA and EGMA assessments,
the MoE authorities indicated to the ICR team a change of policy focus from inputs
(mostly construction and provision of learning materials) to learning outcomes, likely
including future comprehensive interventions in: (i) further strengthening and supporting
the EB scheme; (ii) teachers policies; and (iii) an M&E with sufficient analytical capacity
to articulate findings from the EMIS, national examinations, and infrastructure (physical
assets) to support informed decision-making policy and budget allocations. If this policy
focus is sustained by MoE this, in itself, is a remarkable achievement of the ESSP.

149. Third, MoE put into motion a contract management and supervision model within
the IFU (relying mostly on qualified national consultants) that could be replicated for
other interventions like the LMU (yet not established) for the procurement and
distribution of textbooks and learning materials.

150. Fourth, MoE was able to complete the first set of EB training to 202 EB clusters,
including a cadre of 65 basic education inspectors. With the additional significant support
of NZAID complementing the modest inputs provided by ESSP, MoE’s EMIS is now
capable of collecting and inputing/processing information on students, teachers and



                                                                                        34
schools of primary, pre-secondary, general, and TVET secondary and adult non-formal
education on an annual basis, and has published the first yearly school statistics for 2008-
09.

151. However, there were also some shortcomings. First, given the nature of an
intensive consultant-based implemented modality in MoE’s weak managerial
environment, the driving implementation force was by and large with consultants and not
with MoE, thus limiting ownership of ESSP. In addition, and despite the presence of a
liaison specialist consultant, there was an obvious lack of articulation among the ESSP
sub-components. Lacking somebody in MoE to ensure a more holistic ESSP
implementation approach, there was limited synergies and sharing of experiences among
ESSP actors (both horizontally among sub-components as well as vertically between the
different levels of decision making – national, district and EB clusters). Bottom line,
ESSP resulted mostly in a set of uncoupled interventions.

152. Second, despite that all consultants were recruited to be accountable to a
particular mainstream management unit of MoE, in many cases there was no appropriate
exit strategy for some consultants. This is the case, for example, of the EMIS consultant
who left no documented trace of the capacity building activities for which he was hired.

153. Third, on-site monitoring of project activities by MoE was limited at best, relying
more on consultant reports hired to manage these interventions, reports which were not,
by and large, shared among other consultants nor properly filed. Thus, for example, no
quick assessment was made on: (i) the use of the learning materials by first to third grade
teachers and students; or (ii) the observable impact of the EB training. The exception to
the above on-site monitoring was the one carried out by the IFU to supervise construction
progress and quality against technical specifications.

154. The management style displayed by MoE, albeit limited, was more reactive than
proactive. Finally, the MoE was not able to ensure completion of all activities under the
ESSP at the closing of the project. These included the establishment of the LMU, the
setting of classroom maintenance standards, and the adoption of an early child
development policy. In addition, performance of Component 4 was unsatisfactory.

155. Weighing the strengths with the weaknesses described above, and taking into
consideration that the achievement of the PDO was rated moderately satisfactory, the
overall implementing agency performance is rated as moderately satisfactory.

(c)     Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance: Moderately
satisfactory

156. The overall Borrower performance is rated by the ICR as moderately
satisfactory because the ratings of the borrower performance at the preparation was rated
moderately unsatisfactory, but the government and implementing agency performances
were both rated moderately satisfactory, and the achievement of the PDO also rated
moderately satisfactory.



                                                                                         35
6.     Lessons Learned

157. Ensure simple and focused project designs, especially in the context of fragile
countries with weak implementation capacity. The original ESSP design, comprising
four components and ten sub-components, some of which were approved lacking an
operational definition including an Operational Manual, partially explain a two-year
delay in implementing the ESSP according to the expected timetable. This important
lesson was largely overlooked during the preparation of the ESSP, the peer review
process, the QER, and WB management at appraisal.

158. MoE needs to be in the driver seat for donor-financed interventions. This was
not always the case in ESSP, given that it was largely implemented by consultants, some
of them housed in parallel project units to MoE. The current MoE, with some acquired
capacity in contract management, is now in the position to be more in control in its
dialogue with donors and required international and national assistance, ensuring an
appropriate exit strategy of consultants so that shared expertise is not lost at their
departure. The current drafting of ToRs by MoE for the selection of required technical
assistance under the MSP is a good starting point (which was not the case in ESSP where
these were drafted largely by donors). Nevertheless, even with MoE in the driver seat,
donors need to play a balancing act ensuring that project designs do not get out of hand,
and insisting on simplicity and focus.

159.     Ensuring quality at entry during project preparation is a determinant for
an early and sustained good physical and financial implementation progress. ESSP
lacked implementation readiness conditions, thus delaying effectiveness as well as
physical and financial implementation progress by almost two years after Board approval.
Component 4, approved lacking an operational definition, needed to be restructured mid-
implementation cycle.

160. Ensuring a functional M&E system, including an appropriate project RF, as
a means to make informed policy decisions and budget allocations, and gauge
achievement of project outcomes and component targets. The embryonic and largely
disconnected M&E system compounded by a flawed RF largely prevented measuring in
an objective fashion progress towards the attainment of the PDO. Currently, data is being
collected and processed in a database, but there is not yet capacity to analyze or articulate
findings from EMIS, such as the yearly national (non-standardized) examinations of
Grades 9 and 12 or IFU infrastructure information.

161. Institutionalization (mainstreaming) of parallel projects into MoE requires a
time-bound capacity building and skills transfer plan and strategy, explicitly laid out
as part of consultant ToRs. Some principles to be reflected in such ToRs include: (a)
recruitment of qualified local staff (mentees) to be paired to consultants (mentors); (b) a
clear mentoring/coaching program for local staff; (c) clear intermediate and final
measurable targets to ascertain skills/competencies acquisition; and (d) a simple



                                                                                          36
verification mechanism by a qualifying third party. This skills transfer plan and strategy
was absent in ESSP and it is still absent today in MoE. An approximation to the above
was the transformation experienced by IFU, from being a parallel project unit heavily
dependent on international consultants to a MoE department with some local consultant
support.

Annex 2.      Outputs by Component

164. This section describes the outputs of the five components. The assessment is
primarily based on the Aide-Memoires, ISRs and the August 2013 ICR mission, which
included visits to project sites in EB clusters in Dili and the District of Liquica, and
discussions with current and former project stakeholders as well as present and past
educational authorities, including the current Minister, Vice-Ministers of Basic Education
and Technical Secondary Education and key General Directorates.

165. ESSP included three sources of funding: (i) an IDA Grant with an additional
financing; (ii) an AusAID Grant with an additional financing; and (ii) government
counterpart funds. In addition, ESSP benefited directly or indirectly from other
complementary financing in the education sector, including: (a) two FTI grants; (b)
UNICEF supporting the introduction of Escuela Nueva and EMIS; and (c) NZAID
supporting institutional capacity building interventions within MoE.

166.   Two cost tables are presented to substantiate this Annex: (a) the documented
expenditure by component and by source of financing at appraisal, at the approval of
ESSP-AFI and ESSP-AFII and at the time of writing this ICR (table A2.2); and (b) the
documented expenditure by category and by source of financing at appraisal, at the
approval of ESSP-AFI and ESSP-AFII and at the time of writing of this ICR (table A2.3).

167. Component 1 – Capacity Building for Policy, Planning and Program
Development. According to Table A2.2 below, this component estimated at appraisal to
cost US$3.6 million (24.16 percent of the total cost), half financed by the IDA Grant and
the other half by the AusAID TF, expended US$7 million, 194.4 percent of the total
appraised amount. The ESSP-AFI of US$1.31 million and ESSP-AFII with an extra
US$2.72 million to recruit consultants, many more than expected at appraisal, mainly
explain this over expenditure.

168. Sub-component 1.1 Policy and Planning: ESSP achieved the completion of the
NESP 2011-2030, launched in July 2012, printed in English and Portuguese, and being
implemented ever since. The NESP includes detailed, long-term plans for seven
educational “priority programs,” and six management priority programs to strengthen
capacity for its effective implementation. ESSP also financed the initial stage of
implementation of the NESP through the hiring of an international advisor working
closely with MoE, particularly the Directorate of Planning.

169. ESSP financed the development of a number of Education laws, decrees and
regulations to strengthen the policy legal framework of the education system, like, inter-
alia: (i) AAPs and budgets produced annually and (generally) in line with NESP; (ii) Pre-
school education policy in draft; (iii) the Law for the Establishment of the Higher
Education system, approved in 2010; (iv) the Law for Curriculum Plan and
Implementation Regime for Secondary Education, approved in 2011; and (v) the Teacher




                                                                                       39
Competency Framework and a Career Regime providing a teacher policy framework, still
to be approved.

170. ESSP financed: (i) the National Education Congress of 2008; (ii) the development
of a school grants operational manual as well as monitoring of this scheme, originally
financed by the PESP and currently fully financed by GoTL, allocating to all schools in
the 202 EB clusters one dollar per student per month; and (iii) the establishment of the
Inclusive Education Office within MoE.

171. ESSP never implemented the support to policy development for the use of
mother-tongue language in early childhood education/preschool to improve school
readiness for children under the primary school age. The MSP, UNICEF and NZAID are
currently supporting work in this area.

172. Sub-component 1.2 Higher Education Quality Assurance: ESSP supported the
establishment of the NCAAA, which is fully functional. As explained in section 3.2, two
rounds of accreditation of higher institutions have been carried out.

173.     Sub-component 1.3 Resource Management: ESSP supported improved finance
and budgeting as well as procurement capacities within MoE, with support from two
international advisors. Resulting from this effort, MoE has recorded significant increases
in BERs during the project period with an increasing focus on alignment of the budget to
results-based management as well as quality of expenditure. All ESSP audits came out
unqualified (clean) and there were no cases of misprocurement during the entire
implementation cycle. The downside of the above achievements is that MoE’s budgetary
execution is still heavily dependent on an international advisor.

174. Notwithstanding the above achievements there are still challenges ahead. First,
for certain areas like information technology in the EMIS, it is difficult to retain or recruit
staff due to low salaries in the civil service. Trained staff tend to move to better-paid jobs,
even within MoE. It has been difficult to integrate project procurement with the National
Directorate of Procurement of MoE. Also, capacity strengthening efforts have not yet
spilled downstream to MoE district offices.

175. Sub-component 1.4 Monitoring and Evaluation: ESSP in collaboration with
NZAID financed the strengthening of EMIS by ensuring annual data collection and input
as well as initial processing of key education statistics concerning students, teachers and
school facilities of the primary, pre-secondary and general as well as technical secondary
levels. Recently, EMIS began collecting data of adult non-formal education. The first
yearly statistics for the school year 2008-09 is now available, and the one for 2009-10 is
being processed. However, no capacity is there to extract or analyze information for
informed policy and budget allocation decision-making. Nor is there an articulation with
the findings of the annual national examinations for Grades 9 and 12, and the condition of
physical spaces data emerging from IFU. The MSP, UNICEF and NZAID are currently
funding further strengthening of EMIS.




                                                                                            40
176. Sub-component 1.5 Planning for Improved Learning Outcomes: ESSP supported
the establishment of a National Escola Basica Working Group (NEBWG) to better
manage this priority program for Basic Education included in the NESP. Key tasks
undertaken by the NEBWG included the development of implementation plans,
improvement of the quality and effectiveness of implementation as well as monitoring,
evaluation and reporting. The Director of EB chairs the NEBWG, which includes
representatives of line Directorates, Directors Generals and development partners.

177. In addition, ESSP financed the strengthening of EB management capacity at the
local level through the training of School Directors, Deputy School Directors and
technical administrative staff of 202 EB clusters along with 65 basic education
inspectors. This training was carried with the collaboration of the National Institute for
Training of Teachers and Education Professionals (INFORDEPE). Training manuals
were developed and distributed to trainees. Pending is the training of 885 coordinators of
primary filial schools to commence during the latter part of 2013 with completion in
2014. However, as mentioned in Section 2.5 of this ICR, agreement is pending for an
ESSP post-completion workplan and schedule of the NEBWG to ensure, inter-alia, on-
site monitoring of training provided and repeat training to address EB cluster staff
rotation.

178. Rating of Component 1. Weighing the achievements and shortcomings
described above, the implementation of this component is rated as satisfactory.

179. Component 2 –Learning materials. According to Table A2.2 below, this
component estimated at appraisal to cost US$3.7 million (24.8 percent of the total project
cost), 32.4 percent financed by the IDA Grant, another 32.4 percent financed by the
AusAID TF and 35.2 percent financed by GoTL counterpart funds, ended up
documenting expenditures amounting to US$2.71 million, 73.2 percent of the total
appraised amount. The under-spending is mainly explained by the discontinuation in
acquiring Lafaek for the last two years of the implementation cycle, a shortfall in the
actual number of learning materials distributed as compared to the appraised quantity at
the time of costing the AFI, and the fact the LMU was never established.

180. ESSP supported the production and distribution of Lafaek during 2009 and 2010.
After 2010, the MoE discontinued this distribution and supported the additional
procurement of early grade learning materials in literacy and numeracy, including related
teacher training. The ICR team was informed that each Grade 1-3 school in Timor-Leste
received 148 titles and teaching-learning aids and materials through government
distribution. The ICR team assumes that the effective and continuous use of these
learning materials by teachers and students might likely, in time, improve learning
outcomes. ESSP did not carry out an impact evaluation study with a control group to
confirm or reject this assumption.

181.      An analysis on the distribution of learning materials in primary, secondary and
tertiary education institutions across the country indicated shortfalls and recommended
the establishment of a LMU within MoE to improve procurement processes for



                                                                                       41
development, purchase and distribution of learning materials. During ESSP
implementation it was agreed that the proposed LMU would reside within the Directorate
of Curriculum, and some steps were taken in that direction, including the training of three
key staff to be assigned to support the unit. However, with the arrival of a new
administration, MoE is now being restructured and the proposed LMU is under
discussion to ensure the best organizational fit.

182. Rating of Component 2. Weighing the achievements and shortcomings of this
component, especially the fact that at the closing of ESSP the LMU was not yet
established, this component is rated as moderately satisfactory.

183. Component 3 – Construction/Rehabilitation Design and Quality Assurance
According to Table A2.2 below, this component estimated at appraisal to cost US$4.2
million (28.2 percent of the total project cost), 30.9 percent financed by the IDA Grant,
another 30.9 percent financed by the AusAID TF, and 38.2 percent financed by GoTL
counterpart funds, expended US$8.57 million, 204 percent of the total appraised amount.
The AFI allocating US$2.63 million and AFII allocating another US$2.97 million,
explain the over-spending. However, only US$2.39 million of the AFII were spent out of
the US$2.97 million allocated. The fact that only three out of the intended seven
construction tenders were approved explains the under-spending.

184. Sub-component 3.1. An achievement of the ESSP was that the IFU ended up
being managed by qualified national staff replacing international consultants that had
carried out contract management and supervision of construction and rehabilitation for
primary school programs over the previous 10 years under other WB-administered grant
programs. School siting and construction/rehabilitation standards were developed and
adopted, but not the school maintenance standards. The IFU, under the support of ESSP,
developed a functional professional infrastructure design and supervision unit to: (i)
upgrade construction and school furniture standards; (ii) increase coordination on water
supply to schools; and (iii) develope and implement a Building and Maintenance
Information System, thus benefiting other school construction programs financed by
other international donors. The ICR Data Sheet and section 3.2 fully describe the
achievements of IFU’s management of the school construction program as well as the
ESSP-financed acquisition of school furniture.

185.     The AFII included two types of construction modalities: (i) community-based
approach; and (ii) conventional through a tendering process to construction firms, which
also included school furniture under a separate national bidding procurement contract.
Using both construction approaches, AFII aimed at constructing 18 additional permanent
classrooms in three EB clusters and 81 semi-permanent classrooms in 27 filial schools, in
addition to rehabilitating 259 classrooms in 52 schools (which were built eight to ten
years ago), all of which were completed at the closing of the ESSP. In addition, at the
last moment, the ESSP agreed to include MoE’s request to use part of the AFII to also
construct, through the community-based approach, six additional classrooms in the EB
cluster of Farrol, Dili, to alleviate a student saturation issue in that urban EB cluster.




                                                                                        42
186. At the closing of the ESSP, all participating communities received and used their
two tranches of the grant of about US$15,000 each. Notwithstanding this
accomplishment there were issues with: (i) the submission of supporting expenditure
documentation to receive their second and final tranche; (ii) the work program and cost
estimates associated with the second tranche; and (iii) the information to ensure
compliance with social and environmental safeguard requirements. The haste associated
with the preparation, processing and approval of the AFII, the lack of sufficient time to
develop and validate a simple and more user-friendly community-based construction
operational manual (which was never officially adopted) and conduct a more thorough
training (the one provided was of one day) and on-site support (never provided) to
participating communities (comprising members, many of whom had a low level of
reading and numeracy skills, and some not even fluent in Tetum), partially explains the
above mentioned reporting issues.

187. Existing government processes for selecting schools for community rehabilitation
and maintenance activities involved regular field visits to districts and discussion
between IFU engineers, District Education Officials, School Principals and Suco
(commune) chiefs to identify priorities based on the conditions of school infrastructure.
Site selection procedures included evidence-based decision-making such as reference to
the EMIS and the building and maintenance information system of the IFU. Engineers
from the IFU visited communities to explain the scope of work and the role of the
community in the contract agreements in a culturally appropriate manner.

188. Establishment of the Community Grant Committee and selection of community
leaders were key elements of the community rehabilitation and maintenance approach.
The selection was undertaken in coordination with schools’ Parent Teacher Associations,
including Suco (commune) and Aldeia (village) chiefs. Parent Teacher Associations
themselves were formed based on voluntary participation with all parents of community
children eligible to participate. The community leader was the community representative
responsible for coordinating decision-making and project work between the community
and the IFU. The role of the community leader was to manage and coordinate the
implementation of construction work and workers involved in the agreed projects, drawn
from the local community.

189. However, and without pretending to make the following observations applicable
to the rest of the country, the community-based construction approach visited by the ICR
team in the EB cluster of Farrol, Dili showed achievements (six classrooms were
completed by the community managing ESSP resources) and shortfalls (some of the
classrooms cannot be used because there are no teachers; insufficient school furniture to
accommodate at least 40 students/classroom; no electricity and blackboards).

190. With respect to the conventional construction approach under ESSP-AFII, the
ICR team takes note that after a lengthy selection process for seven tendering processes
for the construction of additional classrooms in EB clusters, only three were awarded for
the EBCs in the districts of Liquica, Ainaro and Cova Lima. The construction in these
three districts was satisfactorily completed including bathrooms, teacher room and school



                                                                                      43
furniture, and the classrooms are ready to be fully utilized. The IDA team visited the six
classrooms in the EB cluster of Liquica.

191. The execution of Component 3 under the AFII period experienced time delays,
mainly caused by changes in the MoE leadership at the time of the arrival of the
incoming elected government in August 2012.

192. Rating of Component 3. Weighing the achievements and shortcomings of this
component, in particular the lack of school maintenance standards, the end-of-project
school furniture shortfalls and the hastiness of translating the AFII into a construction
program that resulted in achievements but also some reputational flaws, the
implementation of this component is rated as moderately satisfactory.

193. Component 4 – Work Skills for Pre-Secondary Students. The WB Board
approved this component lacking a skills framework and an operational description. The
ISRs and Aide-Memoires for the period elapsing from ESSP effectiveness in January
2008 up to mid-2010 attest to an implementation impasse mainly generated by the new
MoE authorities not accepting the original content of this component agreed with the
previous administration. The end result of this deadlock was an agreement to restructure
this component. Accordingly, the original two sub-components concerning the
development of a work skills curriculum module (sub-component 4.1) and impact
assessment (sub-component 4.2), were never implemented.

194. The approved restructuring included the: (i) carrying out of a feasibility and cost
study for the establishment of four polytechnics in the sectors of hospitality and tourism,
fisheries, oil and gas, and agriculture; and (ii) entering contracts with internationally
recognized competency-based TVET institutions partnering with local ones to prepare a
cadre of 20 future lecturers in the hospitality and tourism sector. This restructuring was
approved against: (a) the understanding that the GoTL, through the MoE, was to establish
one polytechnic in the hospitality and tourism sector (outside ESSP funds) to be fully
functional at the time of the return of the 20 trainees; and (b) a professional re-entry
contract signed by all the recipients to be trained under a two-year scholarship provided
by ESSP, that upon their return to TL they would work in this new institution for at least
four years.

195. According to Table A2.2 below, this component estimated at appraisal to cost
US$2.2 million (14.8 percent of the total project cost), half financed by the IDA Grant
and the other half by the AusAID TF, ended up documenting expenditures amounting to
US$1.82 million, 82.7 percent of the total appraised amount. The changes in the scope of
work explain this under-spending.

196. Under ESSP-AFI, this component completed the feasibility and cost study and
provided scholarships to 20 teachers to be appointed as tutors to the future Polytechnic in
hospitality and tourism. Their competency-based training was provided under a
partnership agreement between Timorese and Australian and Indonesian institutions.
These partnerships included:



                                                                                        44
a.     The Youth Vocational Training Center in Comoro with Swinburne University of
       Technology, Australia (Certificate IV);
b.     The Dili Institute of Technology with Dhyana Pura University, Indonesia and Box
       Hill Institute, Australia (Diploma II); and
c.     The East Timor Development Agency (ETDA) with William Angliss Institute,
       Australia (Diploma II in Tourism).

197. Trainings took place in the period January 2011 to December 2012. At the time
of drafting this ICR, 19 tutors (out of 20 candidates) had completed their training and
received Certificate IV and Diploma II and were ready to be lecturers/tutors in a
polytechnic in tourism and hospitality. This new institution was still under discussion by
the new administration at the time of the ICR. The lack of a re-entry strategy for these
trainees has created a high reputational risk for both MoE and the donors.

198.     Rating of Component 4. Despite that the two targets of this restructured
component were achieved, given the original, as well as the restructured intent to address
youth related skills development opportunities in TL to better respond, in this particular
case, to the hospitality and tourism sector, the implementation of this component is rated
as unsatisfactory.

199. Component 5 – Early Grade Learning Achievement. This component was not
part of the original design, and only included at the time of approving the ESSP-AFI.
This component aimed at: (i) training Professional Training Institute trainers, inspectors,
school directors, and teachers, especially those teaching early grades, on optimal young
children literacy and numeracy teaching and utilization of related pedagogic materials;
and (ii) monitoring learning achievement in early grades through periodic EGRAs. An
EGMA was later on added to this component.

200. According to Table A2.2 below, this component estimated at the appraisal of the
AFI to cost US$0.39 million (7.8 percent of the total ESSP-AFI of US$5 million), totally
financed by the IDA Grant H5830, ended up documenting expenditures amounting to
US$0.2 million, 51.3 percent of the total appraised amount. This shortfall, which is
significant in relative numbers but small in absolute ones (US$190,000), is mainly
explained by the fact that the preliminary results of EGRA (2011) and EGMA (2011)
were partially analyzed and disseminated, and a new measurement (involving the
development and validation of comparable instruments, test administrator training, data
collection, data input, processing, analysis and dissemination) never took place.

201. Under this component, ESSP financed the training of trainers, inspectors, and
4,500 teachers on optimal utilization of materials and young children literacy teaching.
Cognizant that an EGRA pilot had already been undertaken outside the ESSP financing
before the approval of this component, the ESSP supported the carrying out of a second
EGRA in 2011 as well as the first EGMA in the same year to students in Grades 1 to 3.
The TL EGRA of 2011 was a pioneer in the East Asia Pacific region. As mentioned in




                                                                                        45
section 3.2 and the Data Sheet of this ICR, only 26 percent of the assessed students could
read with a fluency of at least 60 words per minute, a dismal finding.

202. Regrettably, the instruments utilized for the EGRA and EGMA assessments
appear not to replicate the same survey design that would have allowed for comparisons
across the two surveys. In addition, technical difficulties experienced during the 2011
survey forced the team to scale-down the activity’s findings to those of a pilot study, with
the results to be used as a diagnosis for further surveys.

203. The preliminary findings of EGRA and EGMA have caused MoE to start
discussing how to best address improvements in learning outcomes. If MoE follows
through on this expressed intend, it would be an important accomplishment of ESSP.

204.   Rating of Component 5. Weighing the achievements and shortcomings of this
component, in particular not being able to complete the analysis of the findings of the
EGMA assessment and disseminate them, the implementation of this component is rated
as moderately satisfactory.

205. According to table A2.2, the total project cost was estimated at appraisal at
US$14.9 million equivalent (40.2 percent funded by the IDA Grant, 40.2 percent by the
AusAID TF and 19.6 percent by the GoTL counterpart funding). At the closing of the
project, and factoring the ESSP-AFI and AFII, the total documented expenditure
amounted to US$20.3 million equivalent (136.2 percent of the total contracted), of which
US$10.7 million came from the IDA Grant (52.7 percent of the total documented
expenditure), US$8.38 million equivalent came from the AustAID TF Grant (41.3
percent of the total documented expenditure) and US$1.22 million came from the GoTL
counterpart funding (6 percent of the total documented expenditure).

206. As fully explained above in this Annex, there was significant overspending in
Components 1 and 3, rated respectively as satisfactory and moderately satisfactory, and
moderate under-spending in Components 2 and 4, as well as a larger under-spending in
Component 5, rated respectively as moderately satisfactory, unsatisfactory and
moderately satisfactory. The overspending mainly reflects the use of international and
national consultants in this heavily consultant-dependent implemented project.

207. With respect to the documented spending by eligible category of expenditure,
there is no consistency in the way expenditures were classified in the first IDA GA (H310
TP) and the additional IDA GA (H5830). The classification in the first GA lumps
together goods and consultants, classifying expenditures by component rather than by
category of expenditure. This is a project preparation shortcoming that Bank management
did not flag during the appraisal process. Hence, it is difficult to assess real expenditure
by category as per the expected expenditure at appraisal, because for the first three years
of the implementation cycle (January 2008 – January 2011), the classification under the
first GA does not allow this analysis.




                                                                                         46
208. According to table A2.3, the significant over-spending of incremental operating
costs of 228.3 percent against the appraised estimates, (even including the amounts
allotted under the additional financing), is a likely manifestation of management
inefficiency, as more incremental operating spending was needed but not all activities
under the grants were completed by MoE.




                                                                                   47

Annex 3.       Economic and Financial Analysis

209. The economic analysis in the PAD did not attempt to quantify an overall rate of
return for project components. This was because at the time there was little available data
with which to perform such calculations in Timor-Leste. In addition, the original project
components were largely of a capacity-building nature. As such, the authors of the PAD
felt that rates of return were difficult to quantify.

210. Instead the economic and financial analysis in the PAD presented evidence on the
importance of better educational outcomes for poverty reduction and described how the
proposed interventions could be expected to contribute to better educational outcomes. In
particular, the analysis noted that:

           a. Large gains in poverty reduction can be expected from improved
              educational outcomes in Timor-Leste.
           b. Higher educational attainment significantly increases the probability of
              getting a paid job and has a large and positive impact on monthly wage
              earnings.

211. For each component the PAD noted the contributions that ESSP could be
expected to make to the following challenges being faced by the education sector at the
time:

           c. Low and inequitable access with particular problems for the poorest
              groups.
           d. Low internal efficiency characterized by a high proportion of over-age
              children, high rates of repetition and dropouts.
           e. Poor quality and low school achievement with girls performing worse than
              boys on a variety of assessments.

212. Against this background, the economic and financial analysis in this ICR proceeds
by assessing whether and to what extent the assumptions of the analysis in the PAD were
borne out. To do so we follow the framework laid out in the PAD and assess whether the
expected contributions from the project materialized. As noted in the main text, this
assessment cannot and does not attempt to attribute causality to the ESSP project.

213.    The ICR team attempted to secure access to indicators from the EMIS but was
unable to get a complete data series covering the time span of the ESSP project.
Therefore, the World Development Indicators are used in conjunction with published
estimates of key indicators of interest. The analysis below draws heavily on recently
completed analytical work looking at the state of education in Timor-Leste. This includes
the report entitled “Building Evidence, Shaping Policy: Findings of the 2012 Timor-Leste
Education Survey” and the report entitled “Timor-Leste: Ministry of Education Economic
Efficiency Assessment.”



                                                                                        50
214. Overall the economic and financial analysis finds that Timor-Leste experienced
increases in Gross Enrollment Rates (GERs) during the span of the ESSP project but
equity remains a concern. Given the rates of return to education (a global average of
around 10 percent), individual and economy-wide benefits are likely to accrue. However,
gaps between urban and rural areas persisted and children from wealthier households are
more likely to continue to higher levels of education than children from poorer
households. Repetition rates remained high – particularly for boys at the primary level.
Coupled with high proportions of over-age children in the early grades this implies that
inefficiencies in the system continue unabated.

215. However, the country has taken regular steps to monitor the quality of education
being delivered to its students. Multiple assessments of learning were undertaken over the
years and covered Portuguese, Tetum and Mathematics in the early grades of primary
schools. Some of these assessments were supported by the ESSP project. While the
methods and coverage of each assessment has varied, they have all consistently pointed
to low levels of learning across a number of subjects and grades.

216. In contrast to the outcomes of the system, a recent assessment of economic
efficiency pointed to improvements in the Ministry of Education’s ability to handle and
disburse the budget. Recent years have seen a striking improvement in the Ministry’s
budget execution rate. The ESSP’s strong focus on capacity building for planning could
have played a role. For instance, project spending data suggests that districts with greater
need are receiving larger allocations of learning materials and resources under ESSP.

Trends in improving equitable access

217. There has been some success in improving access to education. With the rapid
increase in the national budget in recent years has come rapid progress in restoring basic
services. 16 Between 2002 and 2010, access to education increased at each level (Figure
3.2). Total enrollment in basic and secondary education increased and the number of
teachers more than doubled during the 2002-2010 period. This resulted in a substantial
reduction in the student-teacher ratio from 45:1 to 28:1. Moreover, many new schools
were built in this time frame. More recently 84 classrooms were built under ESSP AFII
and 300 more were rehabilitated.

218. The growth in enrollment in recent years occurred faster than the growth in the
school-age population. This resulted in an increase in the GER at each level. By 2010, the
GER of primary education was at 105 percent, and that of pre-secondary and secondary
education was at 74 percent and 61 percent respectively. This compares favorably to the
51 and 28 percent GER in 2001/2002. In addition there has been a steady increase in the
Net Enrollment Rate (NER) at the primary level (Table 3.1). Given the rates of return to
education (a global average of around 10 percent), individual and economy-wide benefits
are likely to accrue.

219. However, significant challenges still remain. For instance a stark access gap
between urban and rural areas persists. While the GERs at pre-secondary and secondary
levels are both over 100 percent for urban Timorese, they are substantially lower for their
rural counterparts: only 60.5 percent at the pre-secondary level, and 35.4 percent at
secondary level. Similarly, disparities by income level start to open up at the junior
secondary level, and are particularly striking at the senior secondary and tertiary levels
(Figure 3.3). Thus, it appears that gaps in equitable access were still pronounced three
years after the ESSP project started.

Trends in improving the efficiency of the education system

220. In addition to the lingering challenges in equitable access, the system
continues to be burdened by inefficiencies. When children are in school many of them
are not in the right grade for their age. In Grade 1, 54 percent of the children are older
than the official school entry age of six. By Grade 5, the proportion of over-age children

                                                                                                                      53
reaches 74 percent. This suggests high repetition rates – particularly in the early grades
(Figure 3.4). For example, nearly one in three students in Grade 1 and one in five in
Grade 2 are repeaters.

221. Table 3.2 underscores the fact that repetition rates in primary schools are higher
for boys than for girls. This gap appears to have increased somewhat in the period 2008-
2011 with one in five boys repeating a grade in primary school in 2011. Research
indicates that grade repetition has adverse effects along the following dimensions:

              a. It lowers student self-esteem: peer relationships and attitudes towards
                 school are negatively impacted and may in turn lead to absences.
              b. It hampers school operations: a large number of repeaters can lead to a
                 larger class size and a more difficult classroom to manage.
              c. It impairs academic achievement: repeaters often fall further behind their
                 non-repeating classmates.

Trends in quality of education

222. Given the strong correlation between high repetition and low student
learning, perhaps it is unsurprising that student achievement remains low. A survey
in 2006 (before ESSP started) found that 80% of Grade 3 students failed to meet a


                                                                                                                     54
minimum level of learning in mathematics. 17 The results in Portuguese and Tetum were
substantially worse.

223. The results of the 2009 EGRA indicated that things had not improved much three
years later (after ESSP was underway). More than 70 percent of students at the end of
Grade 1 could not read a single word of the simple text passage that they were asked to
read. 40 percent of children were not able to read a single word at the end of Grade 2.
Only about a third of the students in Grade 3 could read 60 words per minute and respond
correctly to simple comprehension questions.

224. The 2011 EGMA revealed that while most Grade 1 students performed at the
expected level when it came to counting (83 percent were able to count up to 20 or more),
only a third of them could solve simple additions. Similarly, barely more than half of
students in Grade 3 could solve all additions, as well as simple subtractions, all of which
should be known in both Grades 2 and 3.

225. An EGRA-like test was administered to children in Grade 1 in 2012 as part of the
Timor-Leste School survey. Children were given 60 seconds to identify as many letters as
possible. The letters were presented out of sequence in a simple grid. Across all districts,
the average number of letters children in Grade 1 could recognize was 13.3. The variation
across districts was very large – ranging from a low of 4 letters in Viqueque to a high of
30 letters in Lautem. Children in Dili were able to identify 11 letters in 60 seconds
(Figure 3.5).

  A minimum level of learning was defined as demonstrated acquisition of 50% of the
curriculum, where that 50% is comprised of those skills found to be most easily acquired.

Trends in public education spending

226. A recent assessment of economic efficiency in the Ministry of Education finds
that Education’s share of the total government budget fell to 10 percent in 2013.
Between 2001 and 2005 this share used to be well above 20 percent. However, absolute
levels of education spending have increased in this time frame. This is because natural
resource wealth has meant an increase in the government’s budget. In addition, there
seems to have been an increase in the share of the expenditure on goods and services,
while the share of expenditures on salaries and wages and capital have gone down in the
2011-2013 period.

227. Improvements in resource management have been documented but cannot be
attributed to ESSP. For instance, an economic efficiency assessment of the Ministry of
Education completed in 2013 found that “the MoE’s budget is now a more credible tool
for allocating resources.” 18 Grades for the period 2003-2007 (prior to the start of ESSP)
were consistently assigned the lowest possible score of D on almost all dimensions.
However this changed dramatically in the 2009-2011 period (after ESSP activities
commenced). In 2012, some negative assessments returned (Figure 3.7). However, there
is no way to say that these improvements or recent declines are due to ESSP.

 Figure 3.7: Ministry of Education’s resource management improved between 2009-
                                        2011




228. Budget execution performance has also improved dramatically, with actual
spending being within 5 percent of the original budget for three of the last four years. In
prior years, spending and the budget were off by more than 15 percent. This could be due
to ESSP’s support of capacity building for planning.

229. It would also appear that money is being spent on districts where needs are greater
– districts with a larger number of secondary schools received more money for learning
materials (which range from blackboards to Portuguese easels) through ESSP AFI.
Similarly, districts where the average Grade 1 repetition rates were higher received more
funds for learning materials.

Financial Analysis

230. The project’s efficiency of spending can be examined to see how well funds were
spent. As the main text makes clear, each round of financing covered a slightly different
set of components. Therefore, this section looks at the each round of financing separately.
Under the original ESSP design, spending under Component 1 was highest at 97 percent.
Under AFI spending was highest on Component 3 at 108 percent. However, only 75
percent of AFII had been committed as of June 30, 2013.

Summary

The Education Sector Support Project (“the ESSP” or “the Project”) aimed “to
strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Education of the Democratic Republic
to Timor-Leste       (“the MoE”) in effective policy development,           resource
management and innovation”. To achieve this Project Development Objective
(“the PDO”), the ESSP supported development of sector policies and
strategies; establishment of service standards; improvement of budget execution
through better financial and procurement management; development of pre-
secondary curriculum options; school infrastructure improvement; procurement of
learning materials and provision of opportunities for work skills development.

Although the Project accomplished the PDO, a very few indicators such as
establishment of the Learning Materials Unit (“the LMU”) do not fully comply with
the expected outcomes despite considerable efforts undertaken and substantial
progress made over the Project life. The main achievements and challenges the MoE
encountered in implementing the Project as well as departures from the targets are
described in more details below.


II.   What did work well in the ESSP?

       A.     Institutional strengthening

One of the most important Project accomplishments                is a drastic MoE
transformation. At the time of the project preparation and the initial implementation
stage, the MoE, as the other public agencies in Timor-Leste, had suffered from its
weak institutional capacity and overwhelmingly depended on the external technical
assistance. The ESSP vastly contributed into steady MoE capacity development that
eventually resulted in consolidating Ministry leadership in sector management
and formulation and implementation of education frameworks, strategies and
policies primarily relying on the newly established            in-house     expertise.
Strengthened MoE management capacity opened the door to full Project
integration into the MoE line operations. The ESSP eventually evolved from a
consultant-led project poorly linked with the MoE line directorates at its onset
into the one fully managed by the MoE based on a more coherent output-
based approach. As a result from the institutional strengthening, the line
directorates are now directly involved in preparation of the Terms of
References and Technical Specifications, bidding and selection processes, contract
management and supervision and assessment of consultants’ performance. This
resulted in improving identification of scope of supplies and services, which now
better respond to the MoE needs and switched focus of technical assistance from
staff substitution to capacity building and coaching; tightening control over

                                                                                    65
consultants and suppliers’ output and deliverables; and strengthening
management of available resources.
The project created positive institutional memory and had a positive impact at the
policy level, with the change of focus from inputs, quantity and access, to outputs,
learning and quality of education.
Moreover, the experience acquired by Ministry’s officials and staff during the
implementation of this project was an intensive capacity building exercise. The
lessons learned during this process are being taken into account in the existing
partnership dialogue with MoE’s development partners.

These much-needed fundamental changes targeted by the ESSP were, to a large
extent, due to the following critical accomplishments most of which were defined
as the Project outcomes on their own and which, once reached, self-reinforced the
Project and sector development:

(a)    the National Education Strategic Plan 2011-2030 (“the NESP”), aligned with
      the National Development Plan and developed with support of the ESSP, was
      approved by the Government and commended by the development partners.
      The full and short versions of the NESP in Portuguese and English were
      published and socialized. The NESP has laid a solid basis for sector
      development planning, execution, monitoring and evaluation. Its
      implementation started in 2012 in accordance with 5-year and annual action
      plans and annual budgets that embodied input of all line directorates and
      national and subnational education institutions; considered support of
      development partners and extra-budgetary funds; and set up short- and long-
      term objectives, performance indicators and costing.

      It is important to note that technical assistance provided by the ESSP to
      develop NESP and launch its implementation and monitoring had positive
      effect. The 5-year plan and the annual action plan for 2013 were prepared
      by the MoE Planning Department, which contributed to build on their
      confidence and capacity.        The Office of the Prime Minister highly
      commended the Ministry of Education’s 5-year plan and its Annual Action
      Plans, having also recommended them as a model to be followed by other line
      Ministries and Committees.

      The NESP also benefits the MoE in better coordination of development
      partners’ support with particular focus on attaining the agreed targets; more
      accurate scope of services and tasks for each contracting party; and further
      strengthening capacity of the MoE and education institutions at national and
      subnational levels.

(b)          The ESSP allocated significant portion of the grant funds towards
      establishment of institutional, policy and legal frameworks. In addition to the
      already mentioned NESP and respective action plans and budgets, enactment
      of the decree-laws in Institutional Management and Qualification of Human

                                                                                   66
Resources and Basic, Secondary, Higher and Vocational Education, most of
which were supported by the ESSP, greatly contributed into accomplishing

                 Organization and Assessment of Technical-Vocational Schools
                 (Trades and Crafts) 08/2012, of 6 February.

      The progress in developing these legal documents inspired the MoE to
      compile a reference- book of the laws and other acts and norms regulating
      education sector operations. With support of the University of Aveiro, Portugal,
      the book “The Legal Basis of the Education System of Timor-Leste” ("As
      bases legais do Sistema da Educação de Timor-Leste”) was published in
      2012 and is in high demand by education
      professionals.

      In addition, to enforce the frameworks, a number of manuals, operational
      procedures, organizational structures of MoE units, staff job descriptions
      and qualification requirements, situational analyses and various standards
      were developed. It was especially important for establishment of new units
      such as ANAAA and the Office of Inclusive Education.

(c)      Management strengthening at national and sub-national levels.
      Besides    demonstrable improvement of planning capacity as described
      above, substantial positive development was noted in all management
      areas targeted by the Project. It allowed the MoE to initiate introduction
      of management by results system and make a valuable contribution
      to development of the Management Strengthening Action Framework (“the
      MSAF”) and the Public Financial Management (“PFM”) Strengthening Plan.

      A few more examples are given below to demonstrate actual progress in
      MoE management strengthening.

      (i)        The new Government concept on establishing Escola Basica
                clusters under a single administration and management structure (as
                per the Decree-Law n.o 7/2010 of 19 May 2010) was implemented
                with support of the ESSP that resulted in significant
                improvement in school management, governance, environment and
                ultimately learning outcomes. For instance, according to Early Grade
                Reading Assessment (“the EGRA”) held in 2009 and 2011, there was
                improvement in third grade students’ reading competencies.

                To effectively manage implementation of the NESP Priority Program 2
                “Escola Basica”, the National Escola Basica Working Group (NEBWG)
                was created. Its duties included analysis of basic education development
                preceding the new concept; elaboration and carrying-out of the
                transition strategy; and planning, coordination, monitoring and

                                                                                       68
       evaluation of activities to implement the Escola Basica cluster program
       on a countrywide scale. This good practice is being continued over the
       post-project period. However some changes in the working group
       composition and the Terms of Reference are apparently needed to take
       into account experience gained, the MoE’s new organizational structure,
       involvement of development partners still supporting primary education
       in Timor-Leste and strengthened capacity at national and subnational
       levels.

       To ensure successful implementation and sustainability of this
       challenging program, the MoE and ESSP jointly financed extensive
       training for school administration and teachers that was held in
       collaboration with the National Institute for Training of Teachers and
       Education Professionals (INFORDEPE). School Directors, Deputy School
       Directors and technical administrative staff (“Gabinete de Apoio
       Técnico”) of 202 Escola Basica clusters and 65 education inspectors
       were trained on leadership, school management and quality standards.
       3,983 teachers, as well as INFORDEPE trainers, completed training in
       early grade literacy and numeracy teaching methods over the period of
       2010-2012.

       The training modules and materials were developed and distributed
       among the trainees and will be available and, if necessary, adjusted
       for subsequent teachers professional development programs that are
       sustained by the MoE using budget and extra-budget funds. As part
       of this after-project program, a 6-week training course for almost 5,000
       teachers will be held in November – December 2013 in all districts
       and is aimed to improve quality of teaching and teachers’ skills.

(ii)   Financial Management. The budget execution rate reached the target
       at 95% (97% - 2009, 97% – 2010 and 95% - 2011) and significantly
       exceeded the level of 2008 at 85%. Yet, it dropped to 89% in 2012 due
       to budget restructuring after forming of the Fifth Constitutional
       Government that followed the presidential and parliamentary elections.

       A series of initiatives to make spending more transparent and
       accountable were undertaken by the MoE in the course of the ESSP.
       For instance, bank accounts were opened by most of the primary
       schools and their administration personnel were trained in basics of
       account and resource management as part of the Escola Basica
       training program. The achieved progress contributed to improved
       accounting, recording and reporting systems and implementation of
       the new financial procedures for the imprest fund system at the
       national and subnational levels.

       The most important Project outcome concerned the initial transition of

                                                                             69
        focus of financial management, as defined in the NESP and Public
        Finance Management Reform Matrix, towards management by results,
        better expenditure forecast and control, closer cooperation with
        procurement to improve spending quality, etc.

(iii)    Procurement Management. After years of severe understaffing and lack
        of leadership, the National Director for Procurement, hired two
        procurement specialists and administrative assistant were appointed in
        early 2011. The new procurement personnel supported by the
        international and national procurement advisors and consultants
        improved the management of all procurement activities within
        the National Directorate for Procurement within a short period of
        time.

        To ensure that all involved in procurement and contract management
        have necessary skills and knowledge to perform their duties, the
        procurement training program was updated in 2011 and then
        implemented     over the ESSP period. It targeted not only the
        procurement     but also line directorates’    staff participating   in
        procurement and contract management. The program was a mixture of
        various training methods and included on- the-job training, in-house
        training sessions and workshops delivered by the international and
        national procurement advisors and consultants as well as in-country and
        abroad procurement workshops, seminars and training courses held in
        2011 and 2012 and supplemented endeavours at the initial Project
        implementation stage.

        The capacity building efforts have led to improvement of procurement
        and contract management planning and implementation, filing system,
        formalising procurement arrangements through development of ESSP
        Procurement Manual, including relevant contract management forms and
        consultants performance assessment.

        The following initiatives of the new MoE management added momentum
        to further strengthen procurement capacity upon project completion:
        - restructuring of the National Directorate for Procurement to
          equally address challenges in procurement and contract management;
        - adequate staffing of the National Directorate for Procurement;
        - introduction of internal oversight by the MoE Inspectorate General;
        - continuous professional development of all staff involved in
          procurement      and contract management and fund allocation for
          procurement training;
        - update of the Procurement Capacity Building Program to be jointly
          financed by the MoE, the Management Strengthening Project and other
          development partners;
        - request of the Ministry of Education to the Ministry of Finance and

                                                                             70
               the National Procurement Committee to provide support to the
               Ministry of Education with carrying out public procurement;
             - extension of international and national technical assistance
               to      support implementation of NESP action plans in part of
               procurement.

B.     Sustainability and Integration of Project Units and functions

 The Project intended to establish the well functioning ANAAA and Office of
 Inclusive Education and to internalize them together with the IFU by the MoE.
 This task was successfully completed. All the
 units are operational and are being led by qualified national staff. It is necessary
 to note though that
 the integration was attended with difficulties to finance these units, especially the
 ANAAA and the IFU, immediately after their integration into the MoE. To ensure
 continuity of the services provided by these two units the Project supported them
 for longer period than originally expected.

 (a)    Currently, the ANAAA is fully financed out of the MoE budget, which
       also covers staff training and participation of ANAAA’s representatives in
       the international conferences and other events of higher education quality
       assurance networks.

       As planned by the ESSP, ANAAA oversees the accreditation and
       licensing of all higher education institutions, both public and private. It
       has established panels of national and international experts to conduct the
       reviews and make recommendations on accreditation.

       Nine higher education institutions were accredited and are now regularly
       reviewed, while two universities are undergoing probation. A licensure and
       accreditation procedure for one new higher education institution was
       completed in 2013. Preparation for program accreditation is under way and is
       planned to complete in 2014 in order to commence reviews in 2015. As part of
       this process, development of operations manuals for program accreditation,
       training of national reviewers and establishment of expert panels are
       planned to complete.

 (b)   The IFU has made significant progress in building its capacity under the
       previous World Bank funded or administered education projects that
       eventually led to internalising the IFU by the MOE. Since 2010 the unit has
       comprised entirely national managers, engineers and technicians responsible
       for annual planning of construction and rehabilitation works at about
       US$8-20 million annually, detailed technical design, contract management
       and supervision of works.
       2.760 classrooms for pre-school, basic and secondary education
       establishments were constructed and rehabilitated over the period of 2007-

                                                                                    71
       2012.

       The construction and rehabilitation standards were developed and adopted
       and are regularly updated. The school maintenance standards are in process of
       finalization.

       Introducing longer-term evidence-based infrastructure planning in the
       education sector requires a short-term intervention of a seasoned advisor to
       support the IFU with development of an Infrastructure Strategic Plan
       aligned to the NESP, identification of priorities for updating and further
       strengthening evidence base, setting-up of linkage of infrastructure planning to
       cluster- specific situation maps and plans using the geographic information
       system (“the GIS”). The Additional Financing II allowed for such assistance
       but the assignment was postponed due to reconsidering strategic priorities in
       education infrastructure development by the new MoE leadership. Since this
       had not been completed by the closing date, the assignment was cancelled
       under the Project and is planned to be implemented using other sources of
       funds.

 (c)    The task on establishment of the Office of Inclusive Education was added as a
       result of changes introduced by the Additional Financing I. The technical
       assistance initiated under the FTI GPE project was further financed by the
       ESSP to provide support to the just set up office and train its staff. These
       efforts were ultimately focused on helping Escola Basica clusters
       implement initiatives to improve conditions for students with special needs
       for all education cycles from pre-school to higher education.

       The school infrastructure construction and rehabilitation standards were
       updated to include special requirements to improve accessibility for all
       children. These standards were piloted in Dili in 2012 and are planned for
       short-term nationwide implementation.

       The policy of inclusive education was developed in cooperation with the
       Ministry of Social Solidarity and UNICEF and is now being discussed with
       the Government.

       Allocation and effective management of human and financial resources at
       national and sub- national levels and specialised training for teachers in
       inclusive education along with the other measures and practices identified in
       the above policy are the issues to be paid special attention in future.


C.     EMIS

 The Education Management Information System (EMIS) was established and
 maintained with support of the ESSP and other donors. Their joint efforts resulted in

                                                                                     72
 immense progress in development of the EMIS infrastructure and applications;
 online access to education data; system maintenance; and data collection, input and
 initial processing. It has laid a basis for the introduction of evidence-based policy
 and planning, as well as the promotion of management by results. The current system
 provides the Ministry with an opportunity to measure progress in education
 sector development using basic indicators. It also resulted in regular production of
 Education Statistical Yearbooks.
 Due to the longer initial phase of EMIS establishment and inadequately coordinated
 donors support, capacity building in data analysis and consolidated reporting was to
 a large extent underdeveloped.

 It limited Ministry’s ability to use EMIS in policy making, budget allocations
 and evaluation and monitoring purposes (a core function the EMIS is aimed at).
 This issue is an area of great concern and is currently resolved through several
 initiatives led by the Ministry, including support from the ongoing Management
 Strengthening Project.

 Further integration of other Education sub-systems, such as the Building
 Management information System (BMIS) and the Human Resources Management
 Information System (HRMIS), is required for data consolidation based on EMIS as a
 data analysis and monitoring platform.

D.    EGRA/EGMA

 The use of EGRA and Early Grade Mathematics Assessment (EGMA) (“the
 EGMA”) was an important step to introduce new tools to measure learning
 outcomes and to set up an evidence basis for policy and decision making.

 The first EGRA was held with support of the World Bank and FTI GPE in 2009.
 The results revealed by the assessment were worrying enough - about 20% at the
 end of Grade 3 could not read a single word of a simple text and about one third
 of the students in Grade 3 had been able to read at least 60 words per minute.

 In 2011, the second EGRA and the baseline EGMA for students of Grades 1 to 3 were
 held under the ESSP. Although the preliminary findings of the repeat EGRA
 demonstrated improvement in primary education students’ reading competences,
 these indicators still remain at a relatively low level. For further development and
 attaining acceptable students’ learning standards, the Ministry is now undertaking
 the completion of the outstanding issues on forming education policy and
 curricula for pre-school and basic education together with longer-term
 coordinated actions of all education stakeholders in Timor-Leste.

 Taking into account that the active phase of the Project implementation started in
 2010, the above mentioned improvement could hardly entirely be assigned to the
 ESSP and is more likely due to earlier Government and development partners’
 activities. To assess the Project impact on the learning outcomes an additional

                                                                                    73
assessment is planned to hold in frame of the pilot project to be implemented in
2014 as per the 2014 Ministry of Education’s Annual Action Plan approved
by the Prime- Minister’s Office.

III.   What did not work so well in ESSP and why?

       A.    LMU not established

A fully operational Learning Materials Unit (“LMU”) was not institutionalised as
planned. The MoE encountered some difficulties when working on this task.

It first concerned selection of an international LMU advisor who would assist
the MoE with establishing the LMU, including defining unit’s scope of services,
structure, staff job description; and formulating a textbook and learning materials
policy, textbook procurement arrangements, etc.

Initially, the MoE designed narrow qualification criteria which resulted in poor
market response – as no qualified candidates expressed their interest. It took some
time to agree on and to implement a new approach to select the advisor who was
eventually contracted in October 2011. A draft textbook and learning materials
policy and initial institutional and procurement frameworks were developed. Three
national directorate staff were initially trained to perform tasks of LMU Project
Manager, Publishing and Liaison Officer and Training and Monitoring Officer.

The National Directorate of Curriculum was also supported by international and
national advisors and consultants in Early Grade/Primary Book Material and Early
Grade/Primary Numeracy Materials who assisted the MoE with identification of
needs in learning materials, preparation of technical specifications, quality
control and distribution of supplied materials.

The MoE restructuring initiated by the new MoE management delayed formal
establishment of the LMU. The working schedule of the International LMU Advisor
was amended to ensure support to the MoE with adjustment of the drafted policies
and institutional arrangements to align with the priorities set up by the Fifth
Constitutional Government. The functions of the LMU are currently integrated in
the National Directorate for Curriculum and School Assessment, as per described
in the MoE’s 5- years plan.

        B.    Delays in Implementation of Polytechnic Colleges

The two outcome indicators defined in the Results Framework as amended
by the Additional Financing I were fully completed.

The feasibility study for the polytechnic in hospitality and tourism was developed
with support of the ESSP and became a basis for establishment of polytechnics in
Timor-Leste. Currently, negotiations for preparation of detailed technical designs

                                                                                 74
for four Polytechnics Colleges, including, Engineering Polytechnic in Suai, the
Polytechnic for the service industry in Lospalos, an Agriculture Polytechnic on the
south coast and a Fishing Academy on the north coast are under way. The colleges
are planned to be put into operation in 2015.

The ESSP also supported 2-year training of 20 lecturers in hospitality and tourism in
Australia and Indonesia. All the trainees successfully completed the program.
However, due to delays in opening of the polytechnic colleges, the graduates were
not able to start working at the said establishments. 16 of 20 trainees are now
employed. The remaining 4 are planned to be hired by the MoE in 2014 with
focus on polytechnic development. All of them, as per their pre-engagement, are
expected to return to the colleges as soon as they are established.

       C.     Implementation of Additional Financing II

The major portion of the Additional Financing II funds were allocated for the
construction and rehabilitation of classrooms at seven schools and implementation
of about 80 community grants to maintain school infrastructure. These activities,
except for construction and rehabilitation of classrooms at four schools as
explained below, were successfully completed within less than a year. It was quite
a challenging task even in normal circumstances. However, in addition to the
time constraints, the Project team encountered some complications that affected
the implementation process.

(a) Preparation for, and initial stage of, the component execution coincided with
     change of the Project Team Leader and the presidential and parliament
     election campaigns resulted in a new MoE management. All these factors
     caused anticipating delays;

(b)   The Community Grant Operations Manual no-objected by the World
      Bank was based on financial management and procurement procedures
      defined in respective World Bank’s guidelines. It was a new approach the
      participating communities were not familiar with. Taking into account time
      and staff constraints, training of communities was limited to a short session.
      Although the IFU engineers supported the communities during grants
      implementation, it could not fully compensate limited skills and knowledge of
      community representatives.

      It was also identified that some provisions in the Community Grant
      Operations Manual needed adjustment to take into account specific
      implementation arrangements and capacity constraints.
      The results of grants implementation was analysed and then reflected in the
      revised Manual. Despite the above complications, the MoE considered the
      experience positive and has decided to adapt these procedures for school
      grants program financed by the Government.
(c)      Due to delays in allocating funds for the IFU by the Government, the ESSP

                                                                                   75
      agreed to continue supporting 13 out of more than 30 IFU engineers to
      ensure continuity of on-site works supervision. It was a critical minimum
      number that appeared to be insufficient due to substantially wider actual
      scope of the IFU services that included, besides purely technical issues the
      IFU is responsible for, assistance to the communities with grant management.
      As a result, the IFU staff overloading as well as inadequate initial
      community training and other mentioned factors affected timeliness of grant
      execution, e.g., allocation of the second tranches.

(d)     The works for construction and rehabilitation of classrooms at seven schools
      were bid through National Competitive Bidding. The procurement procedures
      were delayed because of lengthy process to agree the bidding documents. It
      is necessary to note that certain provisions, e.g., qualification requirements,
      as specified in the standard bidding documents cannot be fully met by local
      companies due to underdeveloped market. The bidding procedures results
      indicated that even reduced qualification requirements are difficult for
      the domestic companies, particularly those operating in the districts, to
      comply with. As a result, only three of seven packages were contracted.

IV.    What would be done differently if the Project were to be designed all over
again?

The below “what-would-be-done-if” notes were made recognising quite challenging
launching Project environment at the Project onset - MoE management and
capacity constraints, lack of strategic plans and comprehensive           situational
analyses in all targeted areas and burning needs to simultaneously address a
number of issues to ensure rapid sector development. The experience amassed by
the MoE in implementing the ESSP has revealed that, among other factors,
simplified and focused project design, more accurate input/output estimates,
implementation readiness conditions, monitoring and evaluation system of
technical assistance outputs, and better coordination with parallel projects should
have been paid more attention to at the preparation and implementation stages.

       A.     Project Structure

The ESSP design was excessively complex and with a too broad scope for the
country that had very limited implementation capacity.

The Project originally comprised 4 components that were extended up to 5
under the Additional Financing I. The disbursement categories under various
Financing Agreements differed by their content, were expressed in some
currencies and used various percentages of expenditures to be financed by each
source of funds.

The procedures for replenishment of the designated accounts initially defined in
the disbursement letters for the original Financing Agreements and the Additional

                                                                                   76
Financing I followed different approaches – cash flow forecast and expenditure-
based replenishment - that were later unified at the MoE’s request.

Project procurement was also regulated by different editions of                    the
Procurement and Consultant Guidelines dated 2004 as amended and 2011.

The intricate project design caused misinterpreting of FA provisions and
subsequent delays in planning, project implementation, funds management and
reporting, particularly at the very beginning of the Project. It also made exit
strategies for some contracts and the whole Project more difficult to develop and
implement. These complications might have been minimized had the ESSP design
been simpler, more focused on prioritised tasks mutually agreed by the
development partners and the Government and more consistent in all aspects.

       B.     Input/Output Estimates and effective Monitoring System

The consultants’ inputs appear to have often been estimated based on best-case
scenarios, including too optimistic expected outcomes and underestimation of
impact of capacity constraints and project implementation environment on
individual contracts. As a result, a number of consultants’ contracts were extended
or amended several times to ensure sustainability of achieved outcomes. It led
to substantial cost overruns under the consultant services and training categories, and
grant funds reallocation between the project categories and sources of funds.

Based on the experience gained, a more conservative approach to determine
consultants’ input and outputs seems to be more relevant in Timor-Leste context and
needs to be based on comprehensive assessment of existing conditions in targeted
directorates; expected outputs and outcomes achievable within the planned contract
period; and well balanced contract strategies.

Moreover, the Ministry is currently ensuring that all Technical Assistance is
properly coordinated, aligned to existing gaps and priorities, and is substantiated
into concrete, tangible gains towards capacity development and sustainability and
systematization of functions and operations.

Besides, being responsible for drafting all ToRs, the Ministry has now implemented
the principle of pairing the recruitment of international consultants with qualified
national consultants that can ease the capacity gap and bridge the skills transfer to
the target civil servant structure. An important step of this new Ministry’s approach
to Technical Assistance is the regular monitoring of the consultants skills transfer
and capacity-building achievements linking them to the specific outputs predicted in
the Ministry’s Annual Action Plan. The establishment of the MoE’s Performance
Assessment Framework will be fully implemented in 2014.

       C.     Coordination of Donors’ Support


                                                                                     77
Some activities financed by the ESSP were also supported by other development
partners. However, limited MoE’s leadership in donor coordination and lack of a
sector strategy at the early stages of the Project implementation and difficulties to
accord NESP objectives with donors’ priorities made coordination with parallel
projects not so effective and efficient as expected. Certain project activities were
duplicated by development partners or their support was more focused on own
agenda rather than on NESP priorities, annual action plans and MoE’s capacity
building. Most consultants working under the parallel projects reported to the
development partners only and their results and outputs were not always shared
with the MoE. Thus, the MoE had limited possibilities to assess consultants’ outputs
and performance and adjust their input in consultation with the development
partners. This issue is being taken account by the new MoE management as briefly
mentioned in the point above.

EMIS could be mentioned as one of the instances of inadequate coordination.
A number of development agencies were involved in system establishment and
maintenance, which resulted in slower progress in EMIS development.

V.    How can the World Bank as well as AusAID support be improved?

The continuous support during the whole Project life provided by World Bank
and AusAID, their supervision missions, consultants and other staff is deeply
appreciated. Their advices based on great understanding of local conditions ensured
attaining the PDO. The training sessions held by the World Bank country office
contributed in MoE capacity development and provided guidance on all project
management issues.

       A.     Using the country system

As mentioned above, one of the Project accomplishments was the Project
integration into the MoE line operations that enhanced MoE project ownership.
Based on the principles of the New Deal, which are the requirements that the group
'g7 +' advocates, the wider use of the country system is a key step to ensure that the
relations of cooperation are established in an innovative, dynamic and efficient
manner. Moreover, the harmonisation of the World Bank and national financial
management and procurement procedures may further contribute into this process as
well as capacity development and projects effectiveness and sustainability.

       B.     Establishing network of World Bank funded Projects.

Establishment of network of World Bank-funded projects in Timor-Leste and
regular meetings held by the World Bank country office for project, financial
management and procurement staff may contribute into strengthening their
capacity building, informing the project staff about latest development in
project management, financial and procurement issues having impact on the
projects and allowing implementing agencies to share their experience.

                                                                                    78
Annex 8.      Comments of Co-financiers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

The Australian aid program (formerly AusAID) welcomes this Implementation and
Completion Results Report (ICR). We have provided separate comments on the draft ICR
and will highlight a few points in this annex. We have limited our comments to the basic
education components as we do not have enough evidence to comment on the technical
and vocational education components.

1. What worked well in ESSP?
At the time of development, ESSP was in line with the MoE’s strategy and plans. ESSP
was designed to be executed by MoE as much as possible through GoTL systems. While
the modality was an issue later, at the time it showed confidence in MoE systems. ESSP
was set up to support MoE leadership and management rather than establishing a parallel
project.
As the ICR states, ESSP was established at a challenging time in Timor-Leste’s
development. We understand the pressure at the time to quickly design a program to
support an emerging MoE.
In the design stage, ESSP was set up as a trust fund that other donors could join. It
facilitated sector coordination and Annual Joint Reviews. ESSP contributed to some
better coordination and annual discussions on education in Timor-Leste. In the end, only
Australia contributed to the trust fund.
The focus on learning assessment was relevant and the project followed up on one EGRA
that had already been completed. ESPP supported activities in schools and with teachers
around improving reading in the early grades.
2. What did not work so well in ESSP and why?
ESSP was a relevant investment that had little or no sustainability. At the time of the
closure of ESSP and this ICR, there is little impact or outcomes from this investment,
apart from school construction and furniture. The budget management was weak as
unspent funds remain.
Australia is particularly concerned that the detailed analytical work that was done
throughout the program was not completed or communicated with MoE. Of concern is
the EGRA 2011, EGMA 2011 and Public Expenditure Report that have not been
completed. Australia will discuss with MoE and the World Bank how this work can be
completed and communicated, possibly through a knowledge event in early 2014.
3. What would be done differently if the project were to be designed all over again?
If ESSP was designed again, we would have discussed with MoE having a stronger focus
on the school level and learning achievement in the early grades. The scope would not
have been as broad and what was happening in the classroom would have been targeted.
We would also have discussed with MoE using a different modality as the government-
executed trust fund was a difficult for all partners to manage. We would have included
significantly more implementation support based in Timor-Leste, as both Australia and
the World Bank have done in the last two years. ESSP needed a radically different
approach to technical assistance and capacity building of MoE.

                                                                                     79
The Australian aid program support should have been better harmonised and coordinated
with the World Bank in support of MoE. Australia also did not adequately assess and
design the AUD3 million of additional financing provided in the late stages of ESSP.
