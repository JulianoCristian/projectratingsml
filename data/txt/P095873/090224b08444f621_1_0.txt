                 2011 EGMA:
                      Baseline Report


                                  ABSTRACT

In 2011, the Timor-Leste Ministry of Education, with assistance from the World
Bank and Ausaid, conducted the first Early Grade Mathematics Assessment
(EGMA) survey in Timor-Leste. More than 1200 students in 65 schools were
surveyed in Grades One, Two and Three.

The analysis of the EGMA 2011 Timor-Leste baseline survey calls for an
immediate response to safeguard the educational future of young Timorese
students. Although students perform well in basic, “Phase Zero” mathematics
skills such as oral counting and correspondence counting, “Phase One”
skills (number identification) shows signs of slow gains. Later manipulative
and calculation skills, i.e. those in “Phase Two” and “Phase Three” (quantity
discrimination, missing numbers, word problems and arithmetic) are poorly
understood and used by Timorese students. After three years of schooling,
Grade Three students can only answer 46% of simple subtraction problems
correctly on average and only 72% of addition problems -all of which should
have been understood by the end of Grade One. The low ability of Timorese
students to handle basic numeracy puts in doubt their ability to cope with an
increasingly stringent curriculum in later years.

Language use was one of the most concerning aspects of mathematics
education revealed by the survey. Although the main language of the classroom
is Tetum, students’ mathematics textbooks are in Portuguese. Some students
did not speak enough Tetum or Portuguese to complete the survey without
aid of a translator for their local languages. This linguistic diversity within the
classroom indicates that further research into how Timorese students learn
and in which languages is required.

In terms of factors that showed positive association with early mathematic
abilities, the participation in daily mathematics lessons, working with others
in those lessons and doing homework were all associated with statistically
significant improvements in mathematics outcomes at the 95% level.

The 2011 Timor-Leste Early Grade Mathematics Assessment (EGMA) survey is the result of the intention of the Ministry
of Education of Timor-Leste to improve numeracy skills of the students in the education system, with recognition
that the early years of education is the key period for foundational learning.

The report was prepared by Steph de Silva (Econometrician, World Bank), Bronwyn McNamee (Education Specialist
within the ESSP project) and Luc Gacougnolle (Education Economist, World Bank). As of 2011, Kashif Saeed, Simao
do Rosario and members of the Ministry of Education EMIS team provided assistance in school sampling, data
cleaning and data entry. The report benefitted from significant comments, editing and additions by Barbara
Thornton (International Development Consultant) and Myrna Machuca-Sierra (Education Specialist, World Bank).
Wendi Ralaingita of Research Triangle Institute (RTI) generously directed the authors to research and reports of other
countries where EGMA has been implemented and Yasmin Sitabkhan (RTI) provided helpful review comments on
the final draft report.

The 2011 Timor-Leste EGMA was implemented as a direct result of commitment, encouragement and support,
as of 2011, from Joao Cancio Freitas (Former Minister of Education), Paulo Assis Belo (Former Vice Minister of
Education), Domingos de Deus Maia (Former Director General of School Administration, Innovation and Curriculum
Development), Raimundo Neto (Former Director of Curriculum and Assessment), Alfredo de Araujo (Director of Basic
Education).

As of 2011, Filomena Sequeira (Directorate of Curriculum and Assessment), José Antonio Cardoso (Chief of
Department of Assessment in the Directorate of Curriculum and Assessment), Fernando Mouzinho Gama
(Directorate of Curriculum and Assessment) and Pedro Laurentino da Silva (ESSP advisor) formed the team for the
initial adaptation and trial of the survey.

The authors would especially like to thank and commend the EGMA core team of trainers, mentors and monitors
from the Directorate of Curriculum and Assessment. Regional and District education personnel, school directors and
teachers are commended and thanked for their generous and willing cooperation in terms of liaising and making

     Executive Summary

     Background
     In 2011, the Ministry of Education of Timor-Leste carried out an Early Grade Mathematics Assessment (EGMA) under
     the World Bank funded Education Sector Support Project1 and with technical support from the World Bank and and
     Australia’s Program for International Development (AusAID). The purpose of the survey was to set up a baseline for
     early mathematics skills in Timorese schools.

     Overall, survey results show cause for concern. Although the most basic mathematics skills, oral counting and
     correspondence counting, show healthy levels of attainment in the grades tested; other skills, such as quantity
     discrimination and simple calculations lag significantly behind curriculum expectations. Tables 1-4 give a comparison
     between curriculum expectations in Timor-Leste and the average performance of students who participated in the
     EGMA survey.

     Despite EGMA tasks are arranged as a series of sub-tests in approximately the order of skill required; this does
     not imply a pre-determined order as students acquire different skills at different rates. Overall, Timorese students
     demonstrated relatively good ability in the first two sub-tests in EGMA involving number counting (table 1). In oral
     counting –i.e. the ability to recite numbers in order from memory-- the average Grade 1 student was able to count
     to 57 in a minute, while Grade 2 students were able to count, on average, to 66 and Grade 3 students to 72. Although
     average Grade 1 results are above curriculum expectations, Grade 2 and 3 results fall behind. Timorese students also
     performed strongly in correspondence counting (i.e. counting objects individually). The average Grade 1 student
     counted 75 objects, Grade 2 students counted 93 objects on average, and Grade 3 students 96 objects. These results
     are either in line with curriculum expectations or exceed them.

     Timorese students demonstrated worrisome progress when asked to identify numbers (i.e. students are asked to
     recognize the printed form of a number ranging from a single digit to four digits) and to discriminate between
     quantities (i.e. students were required to identify the bigger of two numbers). On average, Grade 1 students were
     able to recognize 25% of the numbers presented. There is a substantial increase on performance in Grade 2 when
     students are able to recognize, on average, 65% of the numbers presented; and Grade 3 students are able to
     recognize 80% of the numbers shown. Student performance on quantity discrimination showed a similar pattern:
     on average, Grade 1 students identified the bigger of two numbers correctly 54% of the time, Grade 2 students 73%
     of the time and Grade 3 students 85% of the time.

     The next skill level is the basic manipulative skills, which allow a student to use numbers to solve both abstract and
     real-world problems. Table 3 gives the results for these sub-tests. Grade 1 students were able to answer just 19% of
     the questions correctly in the sub-test on missing numbers, while Grade 2 and 3 students were able to answer only
     36% and 50% correctly on average, respectively. Students fared slightly better with word problems with Grade 1
     students scoring an average of 28% while Grade 2 students scored 48% and Grade 3 students 62%.

     The final sub-set of skills is the skills necessary to make a beginning to formal calculation: basic arithmetic skills of
     addition and subtraction. Although not all of the number combinations tested were expected of Grade 1 at the
     time of testing (see Table 4 for details), results indicate students start from a low average base and progress slowly
     in this vital set of skills. Grade 1 students were able to answer only 21% of the addition and 12% of the subtraction
     questions correctly. Grade 2 students were only able to answer 53% and 30% of addition and subtraction questions
     correctly, while Grade 3 students answered just 72% and 46% correctly.

     The highest proportion of autostop cases was found in the numeracy skills requiring higher level reasoning: word
     problems, addition and subtraction.

Factors Associated with Better Numeracy Outcomes
A short socio-economic and classroom practices survey accompanied the EGMA survey. In it students were asked
to self-report on a number of student- and classroom-specific factors. Several of these were associated with positive,
significant outcomes on the EGMA survey:

   •	 Students participating in daily mathematics lessons is associated with increases in average scores of
      between 8 and 17% depending on the sub-test. These sub-tests included number identification, missing
      numbers, addition and subtraction.

   •	 Students working with others during lessons is associated with increases in average scores of between 6
      and 8% depending on the sub-test. These sub-tests included number identification, missing numbers, word
      problems and subtraction.

   •	 Students completing mathematics homework is associated with sub-test scores of between 12 and 23%
      higher depending on the sub-test. These sub-tests included number identification, missing numbers, word
      problems, addition and subtraction.

   •	 The household ownership of a television was a relevant socio-economic indicator and was associated with
      average scores of around 7% higher than those who did not live in a household with a television. This was the
      case for the sub-tests on missing numbers and subtraction.


Language was found to be a substantial factor associated with performance but the evidence does not support
it being considered a causative factor in performance. Students answering in Portuguese were associated with
higher scores in some sub-tests and students answering in Bahasa Indonesian were associated with higher scores in
others. Research into language practice in the classroom is needed before any conclusions can be drawn from this,
particularly in light of the results from the EGRA survey findings on this same subject of language.

Overall, the short socio-economic survey was not able to offer substantial guidance on future interventions in part
due to the age of the respondents and in part due to its short length. However, classroom practices such as a daily
mathematics lesson, working with others and homework had significant, positive associations with mathematics
outcomes. A television at home had a positive, significant association with some sub-test results, but rather than a
causal link it is likely that it is an instrument for socio-economic status.


Recommendations
Survey results call for immediate action to ensure that all students in east Timor have access to a numerate future.
Specific recommendations to be considered are as follows:

Language:
  •	 Research is urgently required into language practices in the classroom. Timor Leste is a linguistically
     rich country and students answered some sub-tests in the EGMA survey in up to three languages, indicating
     a substantial exposure to language in their community. In order to understand how and why students are
     learning, it must be known in what language and combination of languages they are actually learning in,
     rather than supposed to be learning according to curriculum mandates and workbooks provided.


Conceptual:
  •	 Further research is recommended into the confidence and skills of teachers and students to use
     effectively the current mathematics student workbooks. These are currently used as textbooks and in
     Portuguese language.




                                                                                                                         ix
    Timor Leste 2011 EGMA : Baseline Report




       •	 Further research into students’ ability to use the workbooks is required. Based on the findings of the
          2011 EGRA (Early Grade Reading Assessment) Survey, and the poor facility of students in the Portuguese
          language there is substantial cause for concern that students may not be able to use these materials
          effectively. The ownership of mathematics texts was only self-reported by students at around 80%, despite a
          national distribution and the ownership of the text was not associated with a statistically significant increase
          in performance. These results suggest that research into the use, distribution and implementation of these
          resources is warranted.

       •	 The establishment of mathematics benchmarks to monitor classroom improvements. These benchmarks
          can be used to assess students at-risk of falling further behind by a process of continuous assessment. It
          is important to consider that initial standards should be considered temporary reference standards since
          not enough is currently known about when and at what rate Timorese children should progress in learning
          mathematics. In this sense, benchmark standards should not be seen as high-stakes but an essential piece to
          monitor mathematics progression in the classroom. One way of doing this would be to use the percentage
          of zero-score students in selected sub-tests as a marker and track reductions in the shares at least biannually.
          Monitoring achievements over time will eventually provide more information on the rate and the way in
          which average mathematics skill develops in Timor. A modified version of the test could be used to screen
          students during the school year in need of additional support.

    Teaching , Teachers and the Classroom:
      •	 Support for implementing and sourcing mathematics resources in a students’ main language of
         instruction is suggested. In the light of evidence that supports early learning in the child’s first language,
         it would follow that priority should be given to the production of mathematics textbooks/workbooks and
         stimulus pictures in mother tongue.

       •	 It is recommended that training of teachers, both pre-service and in-service, be designed to improve
          pedagogical skills in deepening conceptual understandings of mathematics. It is recommended that
          Escola Basica Deputy Directors and school inspectors be involved in parallel professional development.

       •	 It is highly recommended teachers receive continued ongoing support in using the stimulus, display
          and manipulative materials that were distributed to all schools in 2010 and were further augmented in 2012.
          Pedagogy that supports deep understanding through participation, manipulation and interaction is most
          effective for mathematics learning and teachers need to be supported in achieving this.

       •	 Ongoing support in mathematics program planning, teaching methodology and formative assessment
          is essential. The future of Timorese numeracy is in the hands of its teachers. Improvements in Timorese
          children’s mathematical skill depends not only on classroom resources but on effective understanding of how
          to implement curriculum, resources and assessment.

       •	 It is recommended that the Ministry should leverage on the national distribution of materials and the
          EGMA results to identify grade-specific skills that teachers will need pedagogical methods to convey
          content knowledge to students. Without the pedagogical understanding of how to convey content to
          students, knowledge transmission cannot occur efficiently.

       •	 Research into the confidence and skills of teachers to interpret and teach according to the current
          mathematics curriculum and teacher guide for mathematics is required. Modified versions of the
          Classroom Observational Snapshot tool used in other Pacific countries and tailored to the specific needs
          of the Timorese education system will provide information on the skills of teachers, while teacher surveys
          will provide elucidation on the thoughts, concerns, backgrounds and skills of these vital components of the
          Timorese education system.

  •	 Curriculum and teacher support to provide further opportunities for students to work in groups with
     each other is recommended. Students who engaged in group activities for mathematics learning had scores
     significantly higher than those who did not. Opportunities to engage in this process provide the foundation
     not only for improving numerical skills, but gaining language and social skills that will benefit Timorese
     students. However, teachers need to be supported in their efforts to engage their students in meaningful
     group activities and this should be a priority in future curriculum and lesson planning.

  •	 Teacher encouragement and support to engage in mathematics learning on a daily basis is required.
     Students who were engaged in mathematics on a daily basis had a significantly higher score in the sub-tests
     examined than those who did not. Mathematics is a cumulative skill set, each concept building on those
     learnt previously. Especially in early grades, students are learning patterns of thinking that will be a valuable
     life-long asset. A healthy 91% of students self-reported that they engaged in mathematics learning daily,
     however, that leaves a large proportion of students who do not and this statistic may over-report the reality.
     Ensuring that each child has the opportunity to build on their foundational skills in a consistent daily manner
     should be a focus of lesson planning and teacher training.

Parents and the Community:
  •	 Promoting parent education and involvement is needed, not only to interest parents in their children’s
     mathematics education and build accountability into the Timorese education system at the village level.
     It is also needed to build parents’ confidence, extending their knowledge and strategies that will enable
     them to engage with and assist their young children in mathematics. Only a single student out of the 1226
     surveyed reported that they received assistance with their mathematics homework. Parental involvement and
     engagement in mathematics is a key method of improving outcomes for Timorese students.

  •	 The evidence in the report suggests that providing opportunities for students to engage in meaningful
     learning at home will result in benefit to students. Students who reported doing mathematics homework
     had scores significantly higher than their counterparts. However, this should not be construed as an argument
     for large amounts of rote-learning to be sent home with children on a regular basis. The importance of parental
     engagement has been outlined above, however when only a single student in more than 1200 reported
     having assistance with their homework expectations of Timorese parents must be realistic. On a related note,
     39% of students reported that their parents sell things in the market. This statistic indicates that a basic level of
     numeracy is prevalent in the community and that the community understands the need for numeracy skills.
     Providing children with the opportunity to engage in active learning at home through meaningful homework
     activities will have several effects: to encourage and cement concepts learnt in school, to engage parents
     and the community with the importance of numeracy as a concept and to increase children’s’ confidence
     in their own mathematical abilities. Examples of such activities may include assisting parents at market or in
     shopping, making change, counting and arranging items in groups in the home or market, correlating and
     observing sports scores or engaging in word problems with the assistance of every day objects (a skill many
     Timorese students struggled with). Encouraging parents to involve their children with every day numeracy
     opportunities may help demystify mathematical knowledge.

Introduction




In 2011, an Early Grade Mathematics Assessment (EGMA) was carried out in Timor Leste. Results are concerning
and call for immediate action. Although student fluency in both oral and rational counting meets curriculum
expectations in Grade 1 (though not in Grade 2 or 3), the more formal skills required for more complex numeracy
such as quantity discrimination, addition and subtraction show very poor levels of attainment, although there is
slow average progression as students advance by grade.

The report takes the following format. Chapter 2 will discuss the EGMA survey and the context of Timor Leste. Chapter
3 will discuss the implementation, design and sampling of the survey. Chapter 4 will present the results of the sub-
tests and Chapter 5 will discuss the effect of language on student performance. Chapter 6 will analyze the factors
associated with student outcomes. Chapter 7 concludes with recommendations for the future of mathematical
education in Timor.

Context, Survey Design and
Implementation


A decade after the restoration of independence, Timor-Leste is no longer a post-conflict least-developed country. It
is now considered a country with a medium human development standing of 120 of the 169 countries in the 2010
Global Human Development Report (Timor-Leste Human Development Report, 2011).

The rapid development of Timor’s economy and democracy is matched by the expansion of its education system:
particularly in the early grades. Population growth is high and near-universal enrollment has been achieved.

Net enrolment figures in primary education have increased from 68% to more than 90% from 2004/05 to 2011.
There were rapid reductions in grade-to-grade dropout from 11-12% in 2008-09 to 3-4% in 2010. As identified in
key sector diagnostics such as the Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) and the National Education Strategic Plan
itself, the sector continues to face major challenges in the quality and efficiency of education, including continued
high levels of repetition (see Table 5).

    Timor Leste faces challenges in ensuring access to quality education to all children. Gross enrolment rates are above
    100%, indicating that the country has the physical capacity to provide educational services to all children of school
    age. Meanwhile, net enrolment rates remain below 100%, pointing at part of the school age population that remains
    excluded. Other challenges facing the system include institutional capacity, efficiency, with high repetition and
    drop-out rates, and quality of education and learning outcomes.

    To tackle these challenges, the government of Timor-Leste has developed and launched in November 2010 its
    National Education Strategic Plan (NESP). Amongst its key Priority Programs is “Improving Teaching Quality”, with
    the specific short-term objective of “Improving the quality of education by substantially increasing the quality of
    teaching”. However, as the NESP recognizes, the country lacks regular, standardized, practical tools to establish
    baselines and targets, assess progress and target interventions in this endeavour of better quality of education. In
    response to this, the Ministry of Education, with financial support from the Education For All Fast Track Initiative (EFA-
    FTI, now Global Partnership for Education), provided stimulus and manipulative materials for mathematics. These
    were targeted for supporting the teaching of base competencies in the mathematics curriculum in the early primary
    grades, were supplied to all primary schools. A further scaling up of these materials is taking place at present with
    the delivery period likely to take place in mid 2012.

    It is in this context of an increased focus on monitoring of education quality in early grades, that the Ministry of
    Education conducted a first Early Grade Mathematics Assessment (EGMA) in 2011.


    Early Mathematics Learning and EGMA

    It is clear that not all children learn mathematics using the same progression or at the same pace. For the purposes
    of this report we are arranging some of the basic skills of early mathematics learning into four phases, each of which
    requiring further skill or knowledge and each of which a child will progress through individually. Children may not
    necessarily learn in the same process or order. Table 6 gives these four phases of early mathematics development.

TABLE 6.	      Phases of Early Mathematics Development
    Phase                Name                                                    Key Skills
  Phase Zero         Development          Counting: reciting numbers from memory, object counting, numeral recognition
  Phase One           Discernment         Discernment between actual quantities (groups) and patterns
  Phase Two           Manipulation        Ability to use numbers in every day life to solve simple problems
  Phase Three         Calculation         Ability to use numbers to perform simple abstract calculations



Phase Zero we can describe as a nascent Phase of developing numeracy. Children learn rote, oral counting (e.g. starting
from one and continuing in order). Children recognize patterns in the ordering of numbers. They then learn to apply
this ordering of numbers to objects in correspondence counting: the ability to number objects individually without
repetition, missing objects or numbers and to know how many objects there are in a group. Repeated practice, through
song, through number games, through other classroom activities results in a child’s automaticity in these early concepts
of mathematics: an important step if students are to apply them to later Phases of mathematics development. In this
developmental Phase, students begin to recognize numerals in print and to identify them with meaning.

Using the fundamental skills learnt in Phase Zero, most children proceed on to the next phase. This is a discernment
phase. Children begin to discern the differences between groups in a mathematical way: more and less, many and
few, bigger and smaller. They begin to discern numerical patterns and anticipate them.		

Phase Two is a manipulative phase. Children learn to manipulate mathematical concepts. Understanding the concept
of numerical patterns, they learn to manipulate them and to solve simple problems in the context of their every day
lives. Phase Three is when children develop the ability to make formal calculations using mathematical formulae.

The Early Grade Mathematics Assessment (EGMA) instrument was originally designed by the Research Triangle
Institute (RTI) in 2008. The EGMA is an individual survey administered as an interview and is suitable for students
whose reading abilities are not yet well-developed enough for them to sit a formal test. It gives information on
accuracy and fluency of skills and is based on these earliest Phases of mathematical development and the
foundational conceptual understandings, which are a topic of instruction in schools. The EGMA interview takes
about 20 minutes per child to administer.

EGMA has been adapted and implemented in a number of developing countries with the aim of providing baseline
data for mathematics achievement in the early grades. It requires adaptation in each country it is used to reflect the
standards and contextual setting for the particular country in which it is to be implemented.

In order to determine the fluency with which a student was able to complete a task, a measure of their automaticity,
some of the sub-tests were timed. The purpose of this is to determine the level at which a student has internalized
the skills: an important component for performing higher order skills at later Phases of mathematical development.
The timed data was intended to be used to compare students by “per minute” measures. However, there were
unexpected problems in the field and this will be discussed in the next chapter.

The Timor Leste EGMA presented students with 8 tasks. Table 7 presents the tasks and corresponding Phases. The
three tasks in Phase Zero were oral counting, correspondence counting and number identification. Oral counting
required students to count from one as high as they could in one minute, in order. Students were stopped when
they had made a mistake and were asked to count in the language they were most familiar with.

The second sub-test, correspondence counting, presented students with a page of circles, evenly spaced and
ordered as a grid. Students were asked to count as many circles as they could in one minute. Students were asked to
count in the language they were most familiar with and they were stopped when they made a mistake. The number
identification sub-test (Sub-test 3) presented students with a page of numbers and asked to identify as many as they
could in 60 seconds. They were stopped if they had three consecutive incorrect answers or paused for more than
five seconds.

       Phase Three          Calculation       Sub-tests 7 and 8: Addition and Subtraction



    The sub-tests corresponding to Phase One were Sub-tests 4 and 5. Sub-test four was untimed. Students were
    presented with ten sets of two numbers and asked to identify the bigger of the two in each case. Children had
    access to counters as visual and tactile stimuli, if they wished. The enumerator provided two examples on how to
    use them in the preamble to the sub-test.
    The fifth sub-test presented students with a series of numbers, one of which was missing. They were asked to
    identify the missing number. The sub-test was untimed and there were ten items in total.

    Phase Two aimed to identify children’s skills in manipulating numbers. The sixth sub-test asked students a series of
    simple word problems pertaining to familiar manipulations in numbers they might make in their everyday lives. One
    such question was, “Maria has four bananas. Her mother has five more. How many do they have now?” The questions
    were read to the child in the language most familiar to the child, although the default language was Tetum. There
    were four items in total.

    Phase Three aimed to identify children’s skills in formal arithmetic. Sub-test 7 presented students with 5 addition
    problems presented to the child in print. Sub-test 8 presented students with 5 subtraction problems presented in
    print. These arithmetic problems were simple one and two-digit problems. Students had access to counters as visual
    and tactile stimuli if required and two examples before each sub-test to show them how to use them. The children
    had two minutes to complete each sub-test and were stopped if they made three consecutive errors.

Instrument Design,
Sample Design and Execution


Instrument Design and Adaptation
In April 2011, initial adaptation of the EGMA design commenced. Eight volunteer university students from Dili trialed
the instrument and advised on the clarity of instructions, usage of symbols to assist in quick referral to interview
instructions, cultural consistency and wording, layout of the interview protocol, ease of administration with students,
timing for administration of the interview, usage and placement of the manipulative materials and minimizing
chances of errors in recording.

Following agreement from the Ministry to proceed with the EGMA program, several workshops with representatives
from curriculum and assessment directorate took place. The instrument was trialed with 24 school students in a Dili
school.

Adapting the EGMA instrument gave consideration to both the design and individual tasks. The test items were
adapted with a view to their consistency with the expectations of the Mathematics Curriculum of Timor-Leste.
Word problems were adapted to ensure the content was suitable to the context and the language structure easily
accessible to children of ages in Grades 1, 2 and 3.

The linguistic environment of Timor Leste is complex and required some careful design. The protocol was produced
in Tetum, the national language and one required to be used for 75% of contact hours in Grades 1 and 2 by the
syllabus. The NESP and Mother Tongue policy indicate that a children’s first language is to be the language of
instruction in the early years of primary school. Enumerators (interviewers) were instructed to use local language or
call an assistant for translation where necessary if the initial introductory conversation with the child revealed that
the local language would be preferable to optimize the child’s full understanding of the tasks. However for the tasks
where numbers and mathematical operations were read to the child, the language used would be Portuguese,
consistent with language used in teacher in-servicing and current mathematics student work books.

Interpretation of these higher-order mathematical tasks should be considered in the light of this policy. Although
students should be familiar with the mathematical concepts in Portuguese language, the EGRA 2011 Report
indicated that many students struggle with the most basic understanding of oral Portuguese. This may explain
some of the poor results exhibited by students and further suggests that research is required into the languages
used for instruction.


                                                                                                                          7
    Timor Leste 2011 EGMA : Baseline Report




    A second instrument was developed to accompany the EGRA survey. The student context questionnaire gathered
    information about conditions at home and school. But also about classroom practices that may impact on learning,
    as well as the status and impact of national initiatives implemented in schools.

    ‘Home’ questions included those related to assistance at home with mathematics homework, nutrition (daily
    breakfast), money-handling experiences of the family and media inputs for the family via television and radio.

    ‘School’ questions related to the students’ participation in pre-school, self-images as mathematics learners, frequency
    of mathematics lessons, experience with text/workbooks, use of manipulative materials in learning mathematics,
    teacher pedagogical practices (group work for learning), homework and the school feeding program.

    The initial Ministry of Education working group adapted the student questionnaire to reflect the current Ministry
    initiatives that the members considered should be positively impacting on development of student competencies.
    These included the Ministry of Education’s provision of text books and manipulative materials for mathematics, the
    promotion of collaborative group learning during teacher in-services and the school feeding (“merenda escolar”)
    program.

    The protocol was further adapted with input from members of the Directorate of Curriculum and Assessment who
    were delegated as associates in the training, mentoring and monitoring of the enumerators. Enumerators also
    provided input during their training program, which resulted in the final instrument.

    Due to this adaptation, the results are uniquely for Timor-Leste and not intended for international comparison. Both
    strengths and weaknesses indicated in the findings should be viewed primarily as opportunities for review of and
    planning for Ministry of Education policies and practices.


    Enumerator selection and responsibilities, training and field work
    Enumerators were required to have completed secondary school and to have commenced tertiary education in Dili.
    The enumerator teams contained at least one member who was fluent in the local language(s) in the respective
    allocated sub-districts for interviewing. There were 28 enumerators selected.

    The enumerators participated in 6 days of training in Dili. The training period included practice interviews in Dili
    schools and was fundamental to the ensuring efficiency of the EGMA implementation. Practice was followed by
    input from trainers and the Ministry training and monitoring team. The training period concluded with certification
    of interviewers as suitable for the EGMA implementation.

    Following training as enumerators, seven interview teams were formed, with three enumerators and a designated
    supervisor in each team. In every school visited, three enumerators each conducted an interview with one boy and
    one girl from each of Grades 1, 2 and 3. Each team was responsible for interviews in two or three Sub Districts over
    a two-week period.


    The Unexpected Consequences of Working in the Field
    Unfortunately, on analysis of the data, it was found that the timing data, which is used for determining student
    fluency, was unreliable. Out of range or unobservable responses were seen to be above 1%, which suggests that
    unidentifiable errors were also unacceptably prominent in the data. As a result and to ensure accuracy, the decision
    was taken to analyze the data as total scores rather than as fluency measures as intended by the EGMA survey.

Reliability of the Instrument
In order to determine the reliability of the instrument, Cronbach’s alpha was calculated. As a rule of thumb, the
minimum acceptable coefficient is 0.7. Table 8 gives the results for the entire sample and the instrument appears
reliable with an overall coefficient of 0.89.

However, large numbers of zero-scoring students can inflate measures of reliability such as Cronbach’s alpha and
in some sub-tests, zero scoring students were in excess of 20%. Table 9 gives the reliability statistics for the sample
where students scoring zero on one or more sub-tests were removed. The reliability of the instrument is still very
good with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.86.

     Correlation between sub-tests is given in Table 10. Most sub-tests are well correlated with one another, however the
     second sub-test, correspondence counting or “circles counted” has a low degree of correlation with the other sub-
     tests. Possible reasons for this are given in Chapter Four.

     Overall, despite some difficulties with the linguistic diversity of Timor and execution of the timed sub-tests, the
     instrument is reliable and offers an interesting insight into the learning of mathematics in the early grades of Timor
     Leste.


     Sample Design
     The sample was a stratified random sample using the EMIS schools list as a sample frame. The sample was stratified
     by district and school type. All 13 districts were represented in the sample. The target population was students in
     Grades 1-3 in schools implementing the national mathematics curriculum. Each grade sampled around 400 students
     and 1226 students in 65 schools were sampled, including 73 students from the piloting of the instrument. Gender
     parity was close to unity. Table 11 gives the sample frequencies by grade and gender.

Sub-test Results




This chapter will present sub-test results by grade, by gender and overall. Special attention should be paid not just to
average progression, but also median progression. Students who are particularly able can inflate average scores, but the
median gives the score of the student on the 50th percentile (the middle student) and is a good counterbalance to this.


Sub-test One: Oral Counting
In this sub-test, students were asked to begin at one and count onwards as high as they could in one minute. As
discussed in the previous chapter, timing data was dropped and the scores are analyzed in their raw form.Table 12
gives the results of this sub-test. Overall, results show average grade progression that is statistically significant. Only
one student in Grade One was unable to count at all. On average, students in Grade One were able to count to 39
and the median student was also able to count to 39. Grade Two students were able to count to 56 on average and
the median child counted to 57. Grade Three students were able to count to 66 on average and the median child
in Grade Three counted to 69. Boys and girls performed very similarly and there were no significant differences
between them. Figure 1 gives a graphical presentation of these results.

     Sub-test Two: Correspondence Counting
     In this sub-test students were asked to count a series of printed circles on a page: as many as they could in one
     minute. Table 13 gives the results of this sub-test. Like sub-test 1, students showed good results with Grade 1
     students on average able to count 25 circles, Grade 2 students, 29 circles and Grade 3 students, 29 circles also. The
     median student in each grade counted 30 circles. Only one student was unable to count any circles.

     Although there is not evidence of strong grade progression in this sub-test, this may be due to the nature of its
     presentation, rather than a particular lack in correspondence counting skills in older students. There were 30 circles
     on the page presented to students. Although some students counted up to 60 circles successfully (the page twice),
     it is possible some enumerators stopped students after they completed the page or that some students may have
     made a mistake when re-starting the page to count for the second group of 30 circles and been stopped. This may
     also account for this sub-test’s relatively weak correlation with the other sub-tests discussed in Chapter Three. Figure
     2 gives the frequency distribution of the sub-test results overall. As can be seen, an unexpectedly disproportionate
     number of children were stopped, or stopped, at exactly 30 circles (over 78% of students). Less than 1% of students
     continued counting beyond 30 circles.

Sub-test Three: Number Identification
In this sub-test, students were given 12 numbers and asked to identify them. The numbers ranged from one figure up
to four figures. The numbers were 2, 5, 9, 13, 10, 18, 65, 50, 97, 104, 468, 6430. Table 14 presents the results of this sub-
test as a percentage of correct answers. Evidence of grade progression is strong. Grade One students recognized, on
average, 35% and the median child 33%. Grade Two students recognized 65% on average and the median student
recognized 75%. Grade Three students recognized 80% on average and the median child recognized 83%. Figure
Three presents the results of this sub-test.

Only 3% of students were unable to answer this sub-test. Most of these students were in Grade One, where 9%
of students did not recognize any numbers and only 1.2% in Grade Two. However, the fact that 9% of Grade One
students unable to recognize any of 12 numbers is concerning.

Boys scored consistently higher than girls in all grades, however this difference is not significant.

     Sub-test Four: Quantity Discrimination
     In this sub-test, students were asked to identify the larger of two numbers. There were ten items in total and results
     are presented in Table 15 as a percentage. The complete sub-test is presented in Annex 2: EGMA Instrument. Results
     in this sub-test were showed reasonable grade progression. Grade One students scored an average of 54% and the
     median child 50%. Grade Two students scored an average of 73% and the median child 80%. Grade Three students
     scored an average of 85% and the median child in that grade scored 90%. The proportion of zero scoring students
     was very low at only 1.2%. Most of these were in Grade One where 3% of students were unable to answer any of
     the questions correctly. Boys performed consistently better than girls in this sub-test and there was a significant
     difference between the genders. The reasons for this are not clear and bear further investigation. Figure 4 presents
     the gender gap between students graphically.

Sub-test Five: Missing Numbers
This sub-test asked students to complete a series of missing numbers. Table 16 gives the results of this sub-test in
percentage form. There were ten items overall. Grade progression begins from a low base. Grade One students score
only 19% on average with the median child scoring 20%. Grade Two students score 36% on average and the median
child 30%. Grade Three students score just 50% on average and the median Grade 4 child 50%. There was a high
incidence of zero-scoring students in this sub-test with 18% of students overall unable to answer any questions. The
highest proportion was, as expected in Grade 1 with 30% of students unable to answer. However, Grade 2 and 3 had
substantial proportions of students scoring zero: 14% and 9% respectively. Boys scored marginally higher than girls
in this sub-test, however, these results were not significant. Figure 5 gives the proportion of zero-scoring students
by grade in graphical format.

     Sub-test Six: Word Problems
     This sub-test presented students with 4 problems, administered orally. The problems are presented in the instrument,
     available in Annex 2. A complete item analysis is given in Annex 3. The problems were simple calculations such as
     the children may have been familiar with from their every day lives in household transactions. Table 17 presents
     the results of this sub-test in percentage form. Grade One students answered on average 28% of the problems
     correctly and the median student 25%; grade progression is very slow for such simple problems. Grade Two students
     answered just 47% of problems correctly on average and the median child 50%. Grade Three students answered
     just 61% on average correctly and the median child showed no progression from Grade Two, answering just 50%
     correctly. Although the average scores in each grade show significant differences, the lack of median progression is
     deeply concerning.

     Students unable to answer any questions correctly make up a substantive proportion of this sample, 20% overall.
     The majority are in Grade One where 40% of students are unable to answer any of the questions, while in Grade Two
     17% are unable to answer any questions. Grade Three indicates that the bottom cohort of students is making some
     progress with only 5% of students unable to answer any questions correctly. Figure 6 gives these results graphically.

     Boys perform statistically significantly better than girls in this sub-test overall. By grade, the results are not significant
     in Grade One, but are significant in Grades Two and Three.

Sub-test Seven: Addition
This sub-test presented children with five simple addition problems (4+5, 8+2, 20+4, 13+12, 11+9) to be completed
within two minutes. Students were stopped if they answered three items incorrectly. Table 18 presents the results
of this sub-test. Grade progression is significant overall, but begins from a very low base. In Grade One, the average
student answers 21% of the questions correctly, but the median child cannot answer any. In Grade 2 substantial
gains are made. The average student answers 53% of the questions correctly and the median child 60%. In Grade 3,
the average child can answer 72% of the questions correctly and the median child 80%.

The proportion of zero-scoring students is substantial, 29% overall. Most of these are in Grade One, where 55% of
students are unable to answer any questions. Despite the good average gains in Grade Two a concerning 23% of
students, nearly one in four, are unable to answer any questions. In Grade 3, 10% of students are unable to answer any
questions. Figure 7 gives these results graphically. Results on basic arithmetic problems raise substantial concerns
about students’ ability to cope with the curriculum requirements in higher grades. Boys performed statistically
significantly better than girls in this sub-test.

     Sub-test Eight: Subtraction
     The final sub-test presented students with five simple subtraction problems (9-5, 10-8, 24-4, 25-12, 20-9) to be
     completed in two minutes. Table 19 gives the results of this sub-test. Grade progression is significant, but starts from
     a low base and is very slow. Grade One students are able to answer just 12% on average, while the median student
     can answer none. Grade Two students are able to answer 30% on average and the median student 20%. Grade Three
     students are able to answer 46% on average and the median student 40%. Boys performed significantly better than
     girls in this sub-test.

     The proportion of zero-scoring students is very substantial, 48% of students overall. A majority of Grade One students,
     67% were unable to answer a single question in this sub-test and 46% of Grade Two students were still unable to
     answer any questions. Grade Three students presented the most worrying statistic with almost 1 in 3, 30% unable to
     answer any of the questions. Figure 8 presents this graphically.

Conclusion
Although Timor Leste students demonstrate reasonable abilities to recognize and discern numbers with solid results
and steady, though slow grade progression in oral counting, correspondence counting, number identification
and quantity discernment; higher order early mathematics skills are lacking, progress from a low base and very
slowly. The proportion of students with no demonstrable skills in these manipulative and arithmetic skills (missing
numbers, word problems, addition and subtraction) is worryingly high and low levels of attainment even amongst
those students demonstrating some skill puts in doubt their ability to cope with a more complex mathematical
curriculum in later years.

Language and Mathematics




In the linguistically diverse environment of Timor Leste, curriculum suggests that students are taught in both Tetum
and Portuguese to a ratio of 3:1 contact hours in each language respectively. The workbooks that were distributed
as part of the national intervention in mathematical materials are in Portuguese. The EGMA instrument used in Timor
Leste was primarily delivered in Tetum with sub-tests 4 (quantity discrimination), 7 (addition) and 8 (subtraction)
delivered in Portuguese so as to remain in line with the material presented to students in the classroom. Enumerators
had language support in the form of a translator or member of the team who was proficient in local language. These
were called upon when in the conversation with the student preliminary to the survey it became clear that students
needed to be tested in their local language.

Information on languages used by enumerators and students was collected for sub-tests 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6. It is this
information that is the subject of the analysis in this chapter.

Some children and enumerators used multiple combinations of languages in each sub-test. Some children and
enumerators used up to three languages for an individual sub-test and these different combinations are difficult to
analyze individually with any clarity.

To counteract this possible source of confusion, we have divided students and enumerators into groups: those who
used Tetum in a sub-test and those who did not; those who used Portuguese in a sub-test and those who did not;
those who used another language (Bahasa Indonesian or local languages) in a sub-test and those who did not.
These form the basis of our comparisons. Given that some students and enumerators used multiple combinations
of languages it is impossible to consider the language groups mutually exclusive and this should be borne in mind
when interpreting the results.

     Languages Used by Enumerators
     The majority of the survey was in Tetum, however some parts were in Portuguese. The Portuguese-language
     sub-tests did not have accompanying language data collected. Enumerators were directed to use the language
     the student felt most comfortable with, information gathered during a preparatory conversation with the child
     to put him/her at their ease. Enumerator language information was collected for four sub-tests: oral counting,
     correspondence counting, number identification and the word problems. Comparing these to child language data
     collected for the same sub-tests we can see the relationships between child and enumerator conversations. These
     cross tabulatations are given in Tables 20-23. For example, in Table 20, we can see that in the oral counting sub-test,
     although the enumerator most often used Tetum (1052 surveys), the child did not respond in kind. Most students
     responded in Portuguese (1172 surveys). Only 73 students used another language than Tetum or Portuguese. In 50
     of these cases, the enumerator did not respond in a third language.

Table 20 indicates that although the enumerator may ask the child a question in one language, the child will often
choose to answer in a different language. This is especially true of sub-tests in which the child is asked a question in
Tetum but may choose to respond in Portuguese. This is a direct contrast to the 2011 EGRA results, which indicated
that children tested in Portuguese were unable to answer many, if any listening comprehension questions asked. It
is likely a result of rote memorization of numbers and other numeracy concepts in Portuguese. This may be a direct
result of the workbooks distributed and used extensively for mathematics teaching in Timorese classrooms. It may
reflect the different strengths of the children’s vocabulary in the different languages at their command and their
inherent facility at “switching” between languages in a multilingual environment.


Language and Performance
This section compares groups of students by the language(s) they answered the sub-tests for which there are
language data available. Note that some students chose to use combinations of languages. These groups are not
mutually exclusive and thus, the results should be interpreted with caution.

Table 24 gives a comparison by language for the first sub-test, oral counting. It indicates that whilst there are no
significant differences between students speaking Tetum and not speaking Tetum, between speaking Portuguese
and not speaking Portuguese; there is a significant difference between students answering in another language
and those who do not. That is, there are statistical differences between those students speaking in a third
language and those who do not. Students who answered this particular sub-test with at least one other language
than Portuguese or Tetum scored significantly higher than those who did not. This unexpected result required
further exploration.

Looking specifically at students who answered in Bahasa Indonesian (also in Table 24), it appears that these students
have a substantially higher mean and median result than other students. This may be due to some unspecified
socio-economic factor for which we do not have data.

Table 25 gives the results of the second sub-test, correspondence counting, by language. Due to the unexpected
enumerator behavior described in the last chapter where most students were stopped at the end of the page (rather
than repeating it), the vast majority of students stopped counting at 30 and there are no significant differences
between the languages used.

Table 26 gives the results of the third sub-test, number identification, by language. It indicates that students who
do not use Tetum have significantly better scores in this sub-test than those who do. Conversely (and not mutually
exclusively) those who use Portuguese have significantly better results than those who do not. Other languages
were not significant. This may indicate that those students able to understand Portuguese well enough to identify
numbers are better able to absorb the mathematics curriculum which is, anecdotally at least, taught predominantly
in Portuguese. This suggests that children unable to understand basic mathematics vocabulary in Portuguese are at
risk of falling behind in the curriculum. Further research is required into how mathematics teaching is taking place
in Timorese classrooms.

The missing number sub-test had a similar outcome. Table 27 gives the results of this sub-test by language. Table
27 indicates that whilst other languages are not significant, students who answer this sub-test in Portuguese are
associated with higher scores than those who do not.

Table 28 gives the results for the word problems sub-test by language. Although none of the language variables
are statistically significant, students answering in Portuguese have an average score higher than those who do not.

Overall, it appears that amongst those skills for which language data was collected, language is an important factor
associated with student performance. However, it should not be seen as a causative factor in student performance,
but rather one associated with performance. In an educational environment as linguistically diverse as Timor Leste,
language is complex. Without data on the use and purpose of each language and its frequency, it is impossible to
determine how concepts, pedagogy and language combine in the classroom to promote learning. Given that these
results diverge substantially from what might be expected based on the EGRA 2011 assessment, more research into
actual classroom language practices and possible socio-economic correlations is urgently required.

Factors Associated with
Better Numeracy Outcomes


As an accompaniment to the EGMA survey, a brief socio-economic survey was undertaken at the same time in order
to determine which school- and student-specific factors have an association with early mathematics outcomes.
The contents of the socio-economic survey were necessarily brief and decided on by the ministry in accordance
with the research questions that were of interest. Specifically, during 2011 and 2012 an intervention in the form of
mathematics workbooks (in Portuguese language) and physical resources such as manipulative objects was rolled
out nationally. The ministry was interested to know how these affected mathematics outcomes.

When interpreting the results of this survey, it is important to note that the variables in this survey are self-reported
by very young children. The results should be treated cautiously. Table 29 gives the basic statistics for the socio-
economic indicators collected. Table 30 gives the relationships of the indicators to several key sub-tests of the EGMA
survey. Significant variables are given in bold and the difference in average sub-test scores between groups with and
without the indicators is also given. The significance level used in Table 30 is the 95% confidence level. Please note
that whilst these indicators may have an effect on student performance, the results given in Table 30 should not be
construed as causative but as associative. There are many factors that may be associated with student performance
and these statistics given cannot account for them all. The figures in Table 30 should be used not as predictive
measures but as measures of association.

Five sub-tests were chosen to compare the association of the socio-economic factors chosen for inclusion in the
survey. These were chosen partly for reasons of brevity and partly to avoid misleading results by including the early
sub-tests (oral counting and correspondence counting), which were discussed at length in previous chapters. The
sub-tests chosen concentrated on the skills with which students had the most difficulty; as these are the skills most
likely to require intervention in the near future. These were: number identification, missing numbers, word problems,
addition and subtraction. Full statistics are given in Annex One.

     Timor Leste 2011 EGMA : Baseline Report




     Approximately 37% of students reported that they had attended preschool. Whilst this figure may seem quite high
     for a country of the development status such as Timor Leste, it should be noted that in other Pacific countries, the
     definition of “preschool” is an amorphous one. It can mean anything from an hour’s activities in the church hall on
     a weekly basis to a five-day per week specific early childhood development program. Its meaning to the young
     children answering the question is not defined. Attendance at preschool was not significantly associated with any
     of the sub-tests. Although students who self-reported as attending preschool had lower mean scores in each of
     the sub-tests than those who did not, these differences between estimated scores with and without attending
     preschool are very marginal and close to zero.

     Just over 91% of students self-reported that they had mathematics lessons daily. The statistic is encouraging, but
     should be treated with caution since it is possible some local translators used were the children’s schoolteachers.
     Also encouraging is the fact that students who self-reported they had daily mathematics lessons had significantly
     higher sub-test scores on average in all sub-tests examined excepting word problems. The sub-test average scores
     were between 8% and 17% depending on sub-test higher for those children who had daily mathematics lessons.

     Textbook ownership was high with 80% of students reporting they owned the text. However, given that the texts
     were distributed nationally, this figure may in fact be too low. Ownership of the text conferred no significant
     advantage to students over those who did not: although students with the textbook had on average higher sub-
     test scores than those who did not, these were not significantly different from zero at the 95% confidence level.

     Students also reported high degrees of using objects in mathematics lessons (75%) and working with others (83%).
     Whilst both items had positive associations with better sub-test scores on average, only working with others was
     significant for the number identification, missing numbers and word problems sub-tests.

     Over 90% of students reported doing homework, but only one student in the entire sample reported having help
     with homework. This suggests that parental involvement with mathematics in early grade education is minimal or
     non-existent. Doing homework had a significant, positive effect on all sub-test scores with increases ranging from
     between 12-23%,

     It was considered possible that the many Timorese children whose parents sell goods in the market place may have
     access to a means of numeracy education outside of school. Nearly 40% of students (38.5%) indicated that they
     engaged in this practice. However, there was no significant association with learning outcomes.

     Childhood nutrition is known to be an important determinant of educational outcomes. Students were asked if
     they had eaten breakfast that day (89% had eaten breakfast), if they ate breakfast everyday (92%) and about school
     participation in the school feeding program merenda escolar (95%). The fact that fewer students had eaten that
     morning than eat breakfast every day can be ascribed to two things: either a random quirk from small children self-
     reporting, or that some children felt compelled to reply in the affirmative for reasons of pride. There is a statistically
     significant difference between the proportions of students who eat breakfast every day and those who had eaten
     that morning. That is, students self-reported incorrectly to a significant degree. This result urges caution in ascribing
     reliability to this section of the data. Furthermore, although all three nutritional variables had a positive association
     with sub-test average scores: none of them were statistically significant at the 95% level.

     Lastly, students were asked about two consumer durables in their home: the presence of a TV (41%) and/or a
     radio (56%). Both of these had a positive association with student outcomes. Having a television in the home was
     significantly associated with positive outcomes in both the missing numbers and subtraction sub-tests at the 95%
     level and may reflect a positive socio-economic association with education. Another possibility is that the presence
     of a television in the home may offer exposure to languages used in the classroom whicb may not be in regular use
     in the home.

     Overall, the short socio-economic survey was not able to offer substantial guidance on future interventions in part
     due to the age of the respondents and in part due to its short length. However, classroom practices such as a daily
     mathematics lesson, working with others and homework had significant, positive associations with mathematics
     outcomes. A television at home had a positive, significant association with some sub-test results, but rather than a
     causal link it is likely that it is an instrument for socio-economic status.

Conclusions and
Recommendations


The analysis of the EGMA 2011 Timor Leste baseline survey calls for an immediate response to safeguard the
educational future of young Timorese students. Although students perform reasonably in basic, “Phase Zero”
mathematics skills such as oral counting, correspondence counting and number identification; this may be in
part due to a misinterpretation of the correspondence counting sub-test by many enumerators. Higher order
discernment skills show signs of slow gains. Later manipulative and calculation skills, those in “Phase Two” and “Phase
Three” (missing numbers, word problems and arithmetic) are poorly understood and reproduced by Timorese
students. After three years of schooling, Grade Three students can only answer 46% of simple subtraction problems
correctly on average and only 72% of addition problems: all of which should have been understood by the end
of Grade One. The lack of facility for basic numeracy skills sets in doubt Timorese students’ ability to cope with an
increasingly stringent curriculum in later years.

Language use was one of the most concerning aspects of mathematics education revealed by the survey. Although
the main language of the classroom is Tetum, students’ mathematics textbooks are in Portuguese. Some students did
not speak enough Tetum or Portuguese to complete the survey without aid of a translator for their local languages.
This linguistic diversity within the classroom indicates that further research into how Timorese students learn and in
which languages is required.

Survey results call for immediate action to ensure that all students in east Timor have access to a numerate future.
Specific recommendations to be considered are as follows:

Language:
  •	 Research is urgently required into language practices in the classroom. Timor Leste is a linguistically
     rich country and students answered some sub-tests in the EGMA survey in up to three languages, indicating
     a substantial exposure to language in their community. In order to understand how and why students are
     learning, it must be known in what language and combination of languages they are actually learning in,
     rather than supposed to be learning according to curriculum mandates and workbooks provided.




                                                                                                                          31
     Timor Leste 2011 EGMA : Baseline Report




     Conceptual:
       •	 Further research is recommended into the confidence and skills of teachers and students to use
          effectively the current mathematics student workbooks. These are currently used as textbooks and in
          Portuguese language.

        •	 Further research into students’ ability to use the workbooks is required. Based on the findings of the
           2011 EGRA (Early Grade Reading Assessment) Survey, and the poor facility of students in the Portuguese
           language there is substantial cause for concern that students may not be able to use these materials
           effectively. The ownership of mathematics texts was only self-reported by students at around 80%, despite a
           national distribution and the ownership of the text was not associated with a statistically significant increase
           in performance. These results suggest that research into the use, distribution and implementation of these
           resources is warranted.

        •	 The establishment of mathematics benchmarks to monitor classroom improvements. These benchmarks
           can be used to assess students at-risk of falling further behind by a process of continuous assessment. It
           is important to consider that initial standards should be considered temporary reference standards since
           not enough is currently known about when and at what rate Timorese children should progress in learning
           mathematics. In this sense, benchmark standards should not be seen as high-stakes but an essential piece to
           monitor mathematics progression in the classroom. One way of doing this would be to use the percentage
           of zero-score students in selected sub-tests as a marker and track reductions in the shares at least biannually.
           Monitoring achievements over time will eventually provide more information on the rate and the way in
           which average mathematics skill develops in Timor. A modified version of the test could be used to screen
           students during the school year in need of additional support.

     Teaching , Teachers and the Classroom:
       •	 Support for implementing and sourcing mathematics resources in a students’ main language of
          instruction is suggested. In the light of evidence that supports early learning in the child’s first language,
          it would follow that priority should be given to the production of mathematics textbooks/workbooks and
          stimulus pictures in mother tongue.

        •	 It is recommended that training of teachers, both pre-service and in-service, be designed to improve
           pedagogical skills in deepening conceptual understandings of mathematics. It is recommended that
           Escola Basica Deputy Directors and school inspectors be involved in parallel professional development.

        •	 It is highly recommended teachers receive continued ongoing support in using the stimulus, display
           and manipulative materials that were distributed to all schools in 2010 and were further augmented in 2012.
           Pedagogy that supports deep understanding through participation, manipulation and interaction is most
           effective for mathematics learning and teachers need to be supported in achieving this.

        •	 It is recommended that the Ministry should leverage on the national distribution of materials and the
           EGMA results to identify grade-specific skills that teachers will need pedagogical methods to convey
           content knowledge to students. Without the pedagogical understanding of how to convey content to
           students, knowledge transmission cannot occur efficiently.

        •	 Ongoing support in mathematics program planning, teaching methodology and formative assessment
           is essential. The future of Timorese numeracy is in the hands of its teachers. Improvements in Timorese
           children’s mathematical skill depends not only on classroom resources but on effective understanding of how
           to implement curriculum, resources and assessment.

        •	 Research into the confidence and skills of teachers to interpret and teach according to the current
           mathematics curriculum and teacher guide for mathematics is required. Modified versions of the
           Classroom Observational Snapshot tool used in other Pacific countries and tailored to the specific needs
           of the Timorese education system will provide information on the skills of teachers, while teacher surveys
           will provide elucidation on the thoughts, concerns, backgrounds and skills of these vital components of the
           Timorese education system.

  •	 Curriculum and teacher support to provide further opportunities for students to work in groups with
     each other is recommended. Students who engaged in group activities for mathematics learning had scores
     significantly higher than those who did not. Opportunities to engage in this process provide the foundation
     not only for improving numerical skills, but gaining language and social skills that will benefit Timorese
     students. However, teachers need to be supported in their efforts to engage their students in meaningful
     group activities and this should be a priority in future curriculum and lesson planning.

  •	 Teacher encouragement and support to engage in mathematics learning on a daily basis is required.
     Students who were engaged in mathematics on a daily basis had a significantly higher score in the sub-tests
     examined than those who did not. Mathematics is a cumulative skill set, each concept building on those
     learnt previously. Especially in early grades, students are learning patterns of thinking that will be a valuable
     life-long asset. A healthy 91% of students self-reported that they engaged in mathematics learning daily,
     however, that leaves a large proportion of students who do not and this statistic may over-report the reality.
     Ensuring that each child has the opportunity to build on their foundational skills in a consistent daily manner
     should be a focus of lesson planning and teacher training.

Parents and the Community:
  •	 Promoting parent education and involvement is needed, not only to interest parents in their children’s
     mathematics education and build accountability into the Timorese education system at the village level.
     It is also needed to build parents’ confidence, extending their knowledge and strategies that will enable
     them to engage with and assist their young children in mathematics. Only a single student out of the 1226
     surveyed reported that they received assistance with their mathematics homework. Parental involvement and
     engagement in mathematics is a key method of improving outcomes for Timorese students.

  •	 The evidence in the report suggests that providing opportunities for students to engage in meaningful
     learning at home will result in benefit to students. Students who reported doing mathematics homework
     had scores significantly higher than their counterparts. However, this should not be construed as an argument
     for large amounts of rote-learning to be sent home with children on a regular basis. The importance of parental
     engagement has been outlined above, however when only a single student in more than 1200 reported
     having assistance with their homework expectations of Timorese parents must be realistic. On a related note,
     39% of students reported that their parents sell things in the market. This statistic indicates that a basic level of
     numeracy is prevalent in the community and that the community understands the need for numeracy skills.
     Providing children with the opportunity to engage in active learning at home through meaningful homework
     activities will have several effects: to encourage and cement concepts learnt in school, to engage parents
     and the community with the importance of numeracy as a concept and to increase children’s’ confidence
     in their own mathematical abilities. Examples of such activities may include assisting parents at market or in
     shopping, making change, counting and arranging items in groups in the home or market, correlating and
     observing sports scores or engaging in word problems with the assistance of every day objects (a skill many
     Timorese students struggled with).

Annex Three:
Word Problems Per-Item Analysis

Sub-test 6 asked the student to answer four word problems. The problems were in Tetum and the text is given in
Annex 2. An English translation of each of the problems is given as follows.

   1.	 Maria has 4 bananas. Her mother has 5 bananas. How many do they have in total now?

   2.	 Jose has 6 bananas. He eats 3 bananas. How many are left now?

   3.	 Diva has 8 pencils. Pedro has 3 pencils. How many pencils does Diva have more than Pedro?

   4.	 I have 3 sweets [bananas]. How many more bananas do I need if I want to give one sweet [banana] to my 9
       friends.

Table 29 gives the percentage of students able to answer each item in this sub-test correctly. Problem 2 was
answered correctly most often, which was surprising given that most students found the subtraction sub-test 8
more difficult than sub-test 7 (addition). Problem 1, an addition problem was answered correctly by 64% of students
overall. Problem 3, was answered by only 20% of students while Problem 4 was answered by only 27% of students.
These were also subtraction problems but required a more complex reasoning.
