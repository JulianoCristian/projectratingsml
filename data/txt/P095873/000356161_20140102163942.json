education. In\n            recent post-conflict years, aided by availability of oil\n            revenues, Timor-Leste has been able to considerably improve\n            availability of schools and access to education. This report\n            presents findings of the 2012 Education Survey,\n            collaboration between the Ministry of Education, the\n            National Directorate of Statistics, AusAID and the World\n            Bank. The survey collected detailed information at all\n            primary, pre-secondary and secondary schools in the country.\n            Its objectives were to support the improvement of\n            Timor-Leste's education quality and service delivery\n            through building a solid information source and analytical\n            foundation which will allow for sound, evidence-based policy\n            making. The survey results indicate that student absenteeism\n            should be a major cause for concern. More than one third of\n            grade one students were absent from school on the day of the\n            survey, in some districts it was half or even more.\n            Education levels of primary school teachers are low, with\n            the majority only having secondary education. For 71 percent\n            of primary school teachers the highest level of education is\n            secondary school, for 6 percent it is even lower. Both\n            demand and supply side interventions are needed to tackle\n            the challenges faced. Some key policy areas should be: 1)\n            improving school attendance through creating appropriate\n            demand-side incentives; 2) enhancing teacher quality; 3)\n            strengthening instruction language policy; 4) improving\n            education system management; 5) improving school\n            infrastructure and learning environment; and 6) ensuring\n            adequate supply of textbooks."}, "docdt": "2013-08-01T00:00:00Z"}
