                         change. Progress towards achieving the Project Development Objective (PDO) is solid. Significant progress has been made towards achieving the projectâ€™s Key Performance and
                         Intermediate Outcome Indicators , mainly the target for Primary Completion Rate and Gender Parity Index have been slightly exceeded. Majority of the Intermediate Indicators have
                         also been achieved. Some highlights are: the Budget execution rate of the Ministry has increased from 87.5 percent in 2009 to 89 percent in 2012; National Education Strategic Plan
                         is in place and and being implemented. Legal framework significantly developed including Basic Education Organic Law and and a series of decrees and regulations; and significant

                         improvement of the availability of school facilities such as furniture and learning materials. The project also supported the establishment of the higher accreditation body (ANAA) and
                         the inclusive education unit in the Ministry of Education. By end of July 2013, there will be additional 18 classrooms in 3 Escola Basica Centers, 84 classrooms in 27 primary schools
                         and rehabilitation of 259 classrooms in 52 primary schools .

                         Regarding the Intermediate Indicators, the highlighted achievements include: the development of the National Education Strategic Plan has completed and its implementation has
                         started; Policy and Legal Framework is in place; Primary education survival rate has reached 76.6 percent (compared to target of 50 percent and baseline 38 percent); Budget
                         execution rate of the Ministry has significantly improved to from 87.5 percent in 2008,to 94 percent in 2011, but decline to 89 percent in 2012, mostly due to the slowing down of
                         some activities during the general elections and leadership changes. However, there are a number of intermediate results that need to be further reported: (i) Data on whether the
                         target that all primary and pre-secondary school children and teachers received learning materials and teaching guides and the use of those materials in learning activities is still
                         being collected/ processed by the EMIS unit; (ii) the Learning aids for early grade children (and teaching aids for the teachers) have been procured; (iii) the establishment of a
                         functioning learning materials unit is still under preparation by the Ministry, to fit with the new organic structure.

                         The Project consisted of three parts. The original part, effective in January 4, 2008, co-financed by IDA Grant H3100 (SDR 3,935,000) and AusAID TF090564 (AUD 7,329,578); the
                         second, Additional Financing I, effective February 2011, financed by IDA Grant H5830 (SDR 3,300,000); and the third, Additional Financing II, effective August 14, 2012, financed by
