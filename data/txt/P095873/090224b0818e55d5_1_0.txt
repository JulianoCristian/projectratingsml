                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Key Decisions for Disclosure
                         The Project has achieved the Project Development Indicators. Primary Completion Rate is 83.24, exceeds the target of 80; Gender Parity Index in Primary Education is 98.98, slightly
                         exceeds the target of 98; System for learning assessment at primary level is now in place. The target of 2100 additional classrooms built or rehabilitated at the primary level resulting
                         from project interventions has not been fully achieved. The speed of the school construction and rehabilitation is subject to the availability of the Government funds, while the ESSP is
                         supporting the planning and implementation. Up to date, the number achieved is 1,773 classroom. However, the ESSP Additional Financing II (P128178) will contribute to additional
                         259 classrooms by July 2013.

                         Regarding the Intermediate Indicators, the highlighted achievements include the development of the National Education Strategic Planning and it is in initial implementation; Policy
                         and Legal Framework in place; Primary education survival rate is 76.6 (compared to target of 50 and baseline 38); Budget execution rate of the Ministry has significantly improved
                         87.5 in 2008 to 84 in 94 in 2011; the rate of 2012 has not been reported. However, there are a number of intermediate results need: (i) Data on the whether the target that all primary
                         and pre-secondary school children and teachers received learning materials and teaching guides and the use of those materials in learning activities is still being collected/processed
                         by the EMIS unit. This activity is funded by the Government. (ii) the Learning aids for early grade children (and teaching aids for the teachers) have been procured. Currently it is

                         being distributed to the schools by the District offices; (iii) The establishment/ a functioning learning materials unit has net been completed; it is still under discussion with the Ministry.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
