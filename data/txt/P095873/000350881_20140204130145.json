satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            ensuring quality at entry during project preparation is a\n            determinant for an early and sustained good physical and\n            financial implementation progress.  Ensuring a functional\n            Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system, including an\n            appropriate project Results Framework (RF), as a means to\n            make informed policy decisions and budget allocations, and\n            gauge achievement of project outcomes and component targets.\n            Institutionalization (mainstreaming) of parallel projects\n            into MoE requires a time-bound capacity building and skills\n            transfer plan and strategy, explicitly laid out as part of\n            consultant ToRs. Some principles to be reflected in such\n            ToRs include: (a) recruitment of qualified local staff\n            (mentees) to be paired to consultants (mentors); (b) a clear\n            mentoring/coaching program for local staff; (c) clear\n            intermediate and final measurable targets to ascertain\n            skills/competencies acquisition; and (d) a simple\n            verification mechanism by a qualifying third party. This\n            skills transfer plan and strategy was absent in ESSP and it\n            is still absent today in MoE. An approximation to the above\n            was the transformation experienced by Infrastructure\n            Facilities Unit, or IFU, from being a parallel project unit\n            heavily dependent on international consultants to a MoE\n            department with some local consultant support."}, "docdt": "2014-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
