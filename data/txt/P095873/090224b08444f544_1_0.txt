           2011 EGRA:
                 Tetum Pilot Project


                                ABSTRACT

In 2011, a second Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) survey was carried
out in Timor Leste to diagnose reading levels in the country after the expansion
of access to primary schooling. Originally, the survey was intended to analyze
both Tetum and Portuguese literacy skills together, however, due to technical
requirements the survey was divided into two language strands ex post:
Tetum and Portuguese. The Tetum survey yielded interesting results discussed
in this report that yield important research questions for future exploration.
However, due to the implementation of the current language and curriculum
policy as well as resourcing constraints of the Timor Leste education system in
Portuguese, findings from the Portuguese survey are inconclusive and should
be considered as an aid to future research rather than a baseline survey.

Students show grade progression in Tetum language, albeit progression
starting from a low base and exhibiting some slowness. Approximately 26%
of students in Grades 1-3 meet a fluency benchmark of 45 correct words per
minute in Tetum which is associated to 70% comprehension. Socio-economic,
school and specific factors associated with better reading outcomes include
speaking Tetum at home, access to printed materials at home, teacher
attendance at in-service and reading with family at home.

     Executive Summary and
     Recommendations

     A survey was carried out under Word Bank funded1 Education Sector Support Project (ESSP) during October and
     November 2011. The study was carried out by the Ministry of Education with financial and technical support from
     the World Bank and AusAID. Its intent was to determine the levels of early-grade reading abilities in Timorese
     schools after different programs had been implemented to improve the teaching and learning of reading abilities
     in Timorese primary schools.

     The 2011 survey was the second EGRA assessment in Timor Leste. The 2009 diagnostic assessment carried out by the
     Ministry of Education revealed worryingly low levels of reading skills in early grades. A similar observation is made
     in this limited survey. However, the increase in access to education and high levels of grade retention should be
     considered when interpreting and comparing against the 2011 results.

     The 2011 survey was carried out in an attempt to replicate the 2009 diagnostic assessment to monitoring changes
     in the learning outcomes between 2009 and 2011. However, the two surveys are not directly comparable. A
     significant increase in the number of newly enrolled students, undocumented differences in the implementation of
     the language policy in Grades 1 to 3, as well as methodological challenges faced by the 2011 EGRA survey render
     the sample unsuitable for comparisons.

     In order to draw adequate conclusions from the 2011 survey, the data was divided into two language strands ex post:
     Tetum and Portuguese languages. The Tetum language survey can be considered a non-nationally representative
     pilot of early grade reading acquirements, but the Portuguese language survey should be considered as a pilot that
     has rendered important questions for future research. Due to the capacity constraints of the education system in
     Timor, particularly in regard to the Portuguese language, the information from this part of the survey suggest that
     students tested are understanding very little of the Portuguese language and that the assumption of bilingual
     education in each Grade 1 and 2 classroom –as indicated by the syllabus requirement of a 3:1Tetum to Portuguese
     ratio of teaching time-- may not be occurring in practice. Further research in this area will be required to draw more
     definitive conclusions about reading development and/or transfer of reading skills into Portuguese language in
     Timor Leste.

     Student data in Tetum language appears to have captured important information about reading development
     among pre-readers and beginning readers. However, despite minimum sample size considerations for a nationally
     representative survey were taken into account during sample design, given the lack of ex ante information about the
     languages effectively used in instruction in the early grades, both in terms of the purpose and frequency in their use,
     the effective sample size of Tetum data should be seen as a large-scale pilot generating important policy questions
     for future exploration.

     Overall, student results in Tetum show cause for concern. Slow levels of grade progression and low levels of fluency
     are apparent. Although average scores per grade appear reasonable given the Timorese context, median scores are
     very low with modest increases across grades, indicating a large body of students making little progress.

     An analysis of average oral reading fluency and reading comprehension levels suggest that students learning to
     read in Tetum are able to understand, on average, 70% and more of the text they read once they are able to read a
     narrative passage with an average fluency of 45 correct words per minute (CWPM). Setting a reference benchmark
     for fluency at 45 CWPM, 26% of students in the sample as a whole attained this benchmark. As expected, most of
     the students attaining this reference benchmark were in Grade 3. In Grade 1, only 3% of students of Grade 1 students
     attained the reference benchmark. Among Grade 2 students, only 14% of students were able to read at that level.

At the end of Grade 3, 61% of Grade 3 students are able to read at the reference benchmark of oral reading fluency
suggesting it is in Grade 3 where most Timorese students “break into reading” –i.e. consolidate basic reading skills
and transition from reading the words in the text to read for comprehension.

An initial exploration of the student, teacher and school characteristics was carried out to identify student and
teacher characteristics that associate with better reading outcomes. The effects of these factors were examined
on only four of the eight sub-tests for reasons of brevity: oral reading fluency, reading comprehension, listening
comprehension and dictation. Table 1 below summarizes the factors that demonstrated statistical significance at
a 95% level (in bold and green). Briefly, grade progression and age had significant effects, as did the language a
student speaks at home, teacher certification and in-services. Student absenteeism associated with negative effects
on early grade reading. Age was modeled as a quadratic variable, allowing for changing marginal effects: students
very old or young for their grade were presupposed to be at a disadvantage in acquiring literacy.

     The Timor-Leste 2011 EGRA: Tetum Pilot Results




     Survey results call for an immediate response to improve reading instruction to help all Timorese children develop
     the abilities needed to become skilled, independent readers. Specific recommendations to be considered are as
     follows:

        •	 More research is needed to understand how instruction takes place in the classroom, both in terms
           of the languages used, their purpose and frequency. To improve instruction, it is crucial for Timorese
           educators and policy makers to better understand how instruction takes place in the classroom both in
           terms of the pedagogy and resources used as well as on the languages used in instruction. The current
           language syllabi require a 1:3 ratio of Portuguese to Tetum instruction in the grades of focus; however survey
           results suggest this may not be happening, especially in the case of Portuguese language. Without a clear
           understanding on the share of instructional time that takes place in a given language and its purpose –i.e. as
           a medium to explain concepts or as the actual vehicle of content--, it is difficult to assert the extent to which
           reading results in either Tetum or Portuguese are truly representative of the average reading skills of Timorese
           students. Classroom observations mapping pedagogical activities as well as the languages used in instruction
           are a useful vehicle to collect information at both the teacher and student level and can provide relevant
           information the degree of implementation of current curriculum and language policies.

        •	 Better understanding of children’s average language and cognitive skills of children prior to
           primary education is also essential especially in light of expansion of system. Students in the 2011
           EGRA assessment were not asked questionnaire about attendance to kindergarten –as a proxy for school
           readiness—or more specific questions about their experiences in languages other than Tetum and Portuguese
           prior to primary education. Given the linguistic diversity of Timorese schools, it is important that a better
           mapping of children’s linguistic background and basic proficiency in the languages of instruction is developed
           to assess the share of students who are unable to understand these languages. If most of the lessons in
           Grades 1 and 2 takes place in a language most students are not familiar with; they miss on the opportunity
           to develop critical language and reading skills in a language they understand. Given the substantial increase
           in the expansion of access to education in Timor Leste, it is expected that many children now enrolling will
           come from more vulnerable contexts than before, which will impose serious challenges to the teaching and
           learning of curriculum in the early grades.

        •	 Identify instructional approaches that build solid language skills to develop phonological
           awareness and phonics in students. Data suggests students were either not receiving any instruction
           to develop phonemic awareness or this training was not sufficient or appropriate. Without the ability to
           distinguish the sounds in words and a solid understanding of how letters and sounds go together to create
           words, students are bound to struggle in their reading development and have a limited understanding of
           what they read. However, improvements in reading instruction should not focus on phonics exclusively but
           should be incorporated into a comprehensive system of reading instruction aimed at developing reading skills
           as early and comprehensively as possible. A review of how the current curriculum addresses these important
           skills are crucial to better understand not only where these skills are expected to develop to identify if there
           is any space in the current curriculum where improvements to the teaching and learning of pre-reading and
           reading skills could be introduced to help more students achieve curriculum expectations.

        •	 Provide support to teachers to understand and practice relevant teaching methods relevant to
           reading development. The 2011 EGRA data suggest in-service is strongly associated to student’s better
           reading outcomes especially in oral reading fluency. A revision on the approach used to ongoing in-service
           programs addressing oral reading fluency has the potential to inform additional in-service courses possibly
           leveraging on its success to add modules focused on reading comprehension. A high-quality in-service
           program focusing on equipping teachers with essential skills to teach reading will contribute to improve
           instructional outcomes for all Timorese children.

•	 Establish reference reading standards to monitor improvements across classes. As the MOE moves
   on to establish an oral reading fluency benchmark for the early grades to monitor reading improvements, it
   is important to consider that initial standards should be considered as temporary reference standards since
   not enough is currently known about when and at what rate Timorese children should progress when learning
   to read. In this sense, reading standards should not be seen as high-stakes but an essential piece to monitor
   reading progression in the classroom. One way of doing this would be to use the percentage of zero-score
   students in selected sub-tests as a marker and track reductions in the shares at least biannually. Monitoring
   achievements over time will eventually provide more information on the rate and the way in which average
   fluency develops in Timor. A modified version of the test could be used to screen students during the school
   year in need of additional support.

•	 Support teachers to develop easy-to-use assessment tools that can help them monitor learning
   throughout the school year. In order to determine appropriate grade progressions within the school year
   and to identify students in need of additional support, teachers need to plan goals for their students that
   are easy to measure and monitor throughout the school year. This could take the form of a given number
   of correct letter sounds by the end of Grade 1. The actual number of items to be aiming at would have to
   be set forth using available data to help teachers establish learning targets that are realistic to achieve and
   educationally significant. These targets though that should not be place in isolation and would have a greater
   chance of bringing positive effects on students outcomes if accompanied by clear pedagogical activities
   and support strategies for students falling behind to avoid increasing the gap in learning between emergent
   readers and non-readers.

•	 Increase the availability of books and other reading materials to children to read at home, both in
   Tetum and Portuguese. Survey results showed how students who have reading books at home have better
   reading outcomes and are more likely to become fluent. Having access to books at home and the possibility
   to read and develop a sense of enjoyment will be critical to ensure students engage in reading on a regular
   basis. Production of reading books, classroom materials and stories in Tetum written by the Timorese would be
   important not only to allow students to read child-appropriate stories but to preserve the rich oral tradition of
   Timorese story tellers.

•	 Introduce policy actions that increase student exposure to literacy outside the school. Making more
   books available to students will not per se ensure better reading outcomes. Along with access to more and
   relevant reading materials, children will need support to develop a reading habit beyond the requirements of
   the school curriculum. One way of improving this would be to develop community literacy programs where
   schools become focal point of literacy in the community. Building on the success created by the school-
   grants program, schools can encourage parents and literate siblings to become more involved in the reading
   development of young children by participating in ‘peer readings’ and activities, reading clubs both in school
   and at home.

Introduction




In 2011 a second Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) survey was carried out in Timor Leste. Results were
concerning, indicative of slow progression and a low performance amongst students.

This report indicates that the Tetum language results should be considered as a pilot and not representative of the
national level of reading skill in early grades. It is based on the assumption that all students tested receive substantial
instruction in the Tetum language. Given that 95% of the population speaks Tetumand the syllabus mandates 75%
of instruction in Tetum in Grades 1 and 2, it is a reasonable assumption that the students tested in that language had
received instruction in literacy in Tetum.

The Portuguese language results should be treated with caution. They should not be considered a survey, rather an
experimental pilot study. The instrument was developed as a translation of the Tetum instrument and it is likely that
despite a syllabus-mandated 25% of hours be taught in Portuguese in Grades 1 and 2, students were not receiving
substantial Portuguese instruction due to resource deficiencies in that language. Results in listening comprehension
indicate that at least 50% of students do not understand Portuguese language at the most basic level. As a result,
these results have been excluded from this analysis. The linguistic complexity of Timor is such that future surveys
will require a slightly different format in the sampling stages to capture an accurate reflection of education in the
multiple languages of Timor Leste.

The report takes the following format. Chapter Two discusses Survey Implementation and the difficulties the team
experienced in such a complex linguistic and socio-economic environment with limited resources. Chapter Three
discusses the sub-test results and Chapter Four concludes with recommendations and questions for future research.

Survey Implementation




BACKGROUND
A decade after the restoration of independence, Timor-Leste is a country in transition from post-conflict stabilization
to development, and from low income to medium-income status, changes which have created different needs in
the education sector since independence in 2002.

Human development outcomes for Timorese in both health and education remain among the weakest in the East Asia
Pacific region and population growth is high. Total primary enrolment soared from 157,516 students in 2004-2005 to
238,936 students in 2011, a 52% increase. Gross and net enrolment figures in primary education increased consistently
over the period. There were rapid reductions in grade-to-grade dropout from 11-12% in 2008-09 to 3-4% in 2010.
However, as identified in the National Education Strategic Plan itself, the sector continues to face major challenges in
the quality and efficiency of education, including continued high levels of repetition (see Table 4).

It is of particular interest in the context of this study to note the evolution of enrolment between the two years of
the implementation of the EGRA assessment. Despite major increases in enrolment in the previous years, primary
enrolment increase was sustained at a high pace between 2008/2009 and 2011, with a 9.2% increase. The Net
Enrolment Rate reached 94% in 2011, indicating that some of the last children out of school are being brought to
the system, and suggests that more and more disadvantaged children have joined school classrooms. This is an
important consideration to keep in mind when interpreting the analysis below: the increase in enrolments over
previous years not only widens the size of the systems (and often of classes), but also brings into the system children
previously excluded with a socio-economic and family context that are often less favorable to school success.

In 2009 the first Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) in Timor Leste was carried out. The 2011 survey is not
directly comparable to the 2009 survey, in part due to the changes in the school system described above and in part
due to the structure and design of the survey discussed below.

The two official languages of Timor Leste are Tetum and Portuguese. Of these, around 95% of the population speak
some form of Tetum as the local lingua franca, but in part due to generational changes under Indonesian rule, only
around 5% of the population speak some form of Portuguese. This has resulted in some serious constraints on the
education of children in Portuguese, which will be discussed below.

    INSTRUMENT AND SAMPLE DESIGN
    This section provides background on the implementation of EGRA in Timor-Leste, including the adaptation and
    trailing of the EGRA protocol, training of interviewers, fieldwork and data input.

    As in 2009, the Ministry of Education in Timor-Leste was the responsible implementing agency for the EGRA exercise.
    The process was facilitated by an Education Specialist and national Education Adviser in the Ministry of Education,
    and led by the Director General for School Administration, the National Director of Basic Education and the National
    Director of Curriculum.

    The process of adaptation of the instruments was carried out in May and June of 2011, on the basis of the previous
    questionnaire. The Tetum and Portuguese instruments are direct translations of each other and, although, they were
    checked by a linguist for comparable difficulty, may not take into account the relative familiarity of certain sections.
    In general, EGRA sub-tests on familiar words are built from vocabularies of words used commonly in the syllabus
    of the grades tested: direct translations may not be familiar even if they do not present obvious phonetic difficulty.
    The fundamental approach to language in the 2011 (and possibly 2009) EGRA was the assumption of bilingual
    education in Tetum and Portuguese in every classroom. The syllabus mandates that 80% of instruction in Grades 1
    and 2 is carried out in Tetum and the rest in Portuguese. However, given the well-known capacity constraints of the
    education system in general and in the Portuguese language in particular; this may not be the case. Students were
    randomly assigned to testing in either language from within the same classroom and results suggest that bilingual
    education is not being carried out in any great degree.

    Due to the results in Portuguese language, which suggests that most children understand very little, if any,
    Portuguese, this language has been dropped from this analysis.

    The sample itself was composed of 100 schools and 901 students were tested in Tetum language.

RELIABILITY OF THE INSTRUMENT
In order to determine the reliability of the instrument, Cronbach’s alpha was calculated on each of the languages
and on sub-sets of the data to ensure that the instrument is reliable. Table 3 gives the reliability statistics for the
Tetum sample, while Table 4 gives the reliability statistics with zero-scoring students removed to avoid spurious
inflation of Cronbach’s alpha due to the high proportion of zero-scoring students. In the complete sample, the
reliability of the instrument appears very high, at 0.9 or above. However, removing students who scored zero in one
or more of the sub-tests, the alphas drop below 0.8. The minimum acceptable level for Cronbach’s alpha is 0.7 and
the instrument is reasonably reliable.

When the statistics were further calculated on subsets of the data by grade, Crombach’s alpha dropped below 0.7 in
some sub-tests, however this is possibly due to small sample sizes rather than difficulties with the instrument itself.
These statistics are available in Appendix 1.

ON READING DEVELOPMENT AND THE EGRA TOOL
Though not all children develop their reading abilities in the same way or pace, the literature shows that all readers
progress through a series of phases or stages -sometimes simultaneously- in their reading development process.

Children learn to apply the foundational reading skills (Stage 0) with a certain level of reflex or automaticity, they can
move beyond the task of decoding a text (Stage 1) to begin deriving its meaning (Stage 2). As children learn sounds
that link to form words, they can begin connecting those sounds to printed words and the idea behind those words.
Then they can link words to form sentences, paragraphs, and stories. In other words, children transition from “reading
it” and “getting it” (Stage 3 and beyond) with comprehension being the ultimate prize.

    The Timor-Leste 2011 EGRA: Tetum Pilot Results




    The structure of the EGRA tool used this knowledge as a reference point during the adaptation of the tool to local contexts.
    The Timor Leste EGRA tool assessed 8 basic reading competences among students learning to read in the Tetum language:

       •	 Stage 0 = letter name knowledge, letter sound knowledge, phonemic awareness
       •	 Stage 1 = familiar word reading, invented word reading (or decoding)
       •	 Stage 2 = Reading comprehension

    Additionally, a short listening comprehension story and a dictation exercise were included, as they have been
    identified by the literature to be predictors of reading fluency and comprehension. Listening comprehension
    sections were intended to proxy language competence in the primary language of instruction Timorese students.
    In the case of the dictation exercise, writing helps students stabilize memory, hence its inclusion.

    The Timor Leste EGRA tools measure competence in each skill listed above in two dimensions:
      (A)		 overall knowledge, as measured as a percentage of correct answers, or;
      (B)		 fluency, measured as number of correct items read/identified per minute.

    By fluency, the test measures speed or automaticity, accuracy, and expression in reading be it single letters, words or
    a full paragraph.

    In particular, the Timor assessment focused on measuring these skills plus basic listening and writing skills through
    nine modules or sub-tests: (1) orientation to print; (2) letter name knowledge; (3) identification of initial sounds in
    words; (4) letter sound knowledge; (5) familiar word reading; (6) invented word reading; (7) oral reading fluency with
    comprehension; (8) listening comprehension; and (9) dictation (see Annex for copies of the EGRA instrument). Table
    5 below shows how these skills relate to each of the EGRA components, measures and indicators.

RESULTS BY SUB-TEST
Overall, the results from most of the subtests showed progress in each of the three grade-levels tested. However,
this progress is extremely slow and in certain sub-tests have confidence intervals that overlap across grades when
zero-scoring students are excluded. When measured by the number of students who scored zero on a given sub-
test, there is evidence of progression amongst the poorest-performing students.

Tables 6, 7 and 8 give a summary of these results.

GENDER DIFFERENCES
This section examines differences in performance between genders in the Timor Leste EGRA. It concentrates on
the final four sub-tests of the interview: oral reading fluency, reading comprehension, listening comprehension and
dictation as these provide a good summary of the higher-level literacy skills examined by the interview.

Table 9 gives the mean scores overall by gender and the proportion of students scoring zero. Table 10 indicates
that in oral reading fluency, the average of girls is significantly higher than that of boys in Tetum language. The
proportion of zero-scoring students is not significantly different.

In reading comprehension, girls have a higher average than boys and fewer girls score zero, these differences are mildly
significant. In listening comprehension, this relationship is reversed. Boys speaking Tetum perform significantly better
than girls and there are significantly fewer boys scoring zero overall. In dictation, girls perform significantly better than
boys however, there are not significant differences between genders in the proportion of students scoring zero.

Overall, there are small differences between genders, but these are not consistent over all sub-tests. This may be
partly due to small sample sizes in this pilot study.

     PERFORMANCE IN ORAL READING FLUENCY AND READING
     COMPREHENSION

     The Timor Leste EGRA results show a high degree of correlation between reading comprehension and oral reading
     fluency in Tetum, as indicated by Figure 2. A medium degree of reading comprehension of 60% or more starts
     (excepting some outliers) with oral reading fluency of around 40 correct words per minute, with the bulk of
     observations occurring with 45 correct words per minute or more. Although reading comprehension is not the
     only marker for oral reading fluency, it is an easily observed or monitored skill in the classroom and can be used
     by teachers to identify students at risk of falling behind. This is supported by research in other languages, which is
     particularly pertinent in multilingual educational environments such as that found in Timor Leste.

     Table 12 indicates the average reading comprehension rates of students in Tetum. Students achieving a baseline
     level of fluency of 45 CWPM have an average reading comprehension of 72% and a median comprehension rate of
     over 83%. Overall, 26% of students reach this benchmark. Alternatively, students achieving a baseline fluency of 35
     CWPM have an average reading comprehension of 66% and a median comprehension rate of 67%. This indicates
     the importance of reading comprehension as a marker for overall reading fluency.

Student and Teacher Factors
Associated with Better
Reading Outcomes

This section analyses the student and teacher factors associated with reading outcomes. Here, we use a series of
Logit models on the EGRA subtest data to determine which factors are statistically significant in the acquisition
of early literacy skills. Student specific factors such as family literacy, the language spoken at home and indicators
such as absenteeism were significant predictors of reading skill-acquirement. Teacher and school factors such as
resources and teaching training were also significant predictors.

A notable feature of the EGRA survey in Timor Leste was the very high number of zero-scoring students. These
students are qualitatively different to those able to answer some sub-test parts correctly, particularly in the higher-
order reading skills such as oral reading fluency. The logit model examines a binary dependent variable: students
able to answer some questions on the sub-test correctly and those able to answer none. The proportion of zero-
scoring students is above 50% in some sub-tests. The logit model discerns the probability of students belonging to
the category that are able to answer some questions correctly.

This section concentrates on only four subtests: oral reading fluency, reading comprehension, listening
comprehension and dictation. These subtests were chosen due to space constraints. These models are not suitable
for predictive use due to a large number of pertinent variables that were not collected by the EGRA sub-tests and
accompanying survey, but they provide a useful summary of those relationships that were observable.

Tables 11 and 12 give a summary of student factors effecting literacy skills acquisition in the Tetum language.
Significant p-values are given in bold. The effect of a students’ age on their acquisition of early reading skills is
modeled as a quadratic polynomial and one or both coefficients associated with age is significant in all the sub-tests.
The models also showed strong positive grade progression: students in higher grades are significantly less likely to
be in the group of students unable to answer any questions correctly.

     The language a student speaks at home has a mildly significant effect on a students’ attainment in literacy skills
     in Tetum. Speaking Tetum at home had a positive effect on all sub-tests and was significant in both listening
     comprehension and dictation. Speaking Portuguese at home was insignificant amongst students tested in Tetum,
     however, it was close to significance in oral reading fluency and had a positive influence. It is possible that this
     variable is acting as an instrument for socio-economic indicators not collected by the survey given the small number
     of the population speaking this language generally.

     Student-reported resources had a mixed effect. Student-reported libraries in school had an insignificant effect,
     however reading materials at home were positive and strongly significant for all sub-tests excepting dictation.

     Students reading with family at home had a strong positive, significant effect on all sub-tests and absenteeism
     greater than 1 week had a strong, negative significant effect.

     School and teacher-specific variables such as an alimentary feeding program had a significant effect. Students in
     a school with a supplementary feeding program were significantly less likely to be unable to answer any sub-test
     parts correctly. Teacher certification had a mixed and insignificant effect, as did the presence of a teacher-reported
     classroom learning corner. In-service attendance by a teacher had a largely positive, significant effect on all sub-tests
     excepting listening comprehension, while FTI was insignificant.

     Overall, it is clear that acquisition of literacy in Tetum has some features associated with improved performance such
     as alimentary feeding programs in schools, teacher in-services and student-specific variables such as availability of
     print materials in the home and reading with family members.

Conclusion:
A Reading Future for Timor
Leste

This report has examined the EGRA 2011 survey in Timor Leste. Grade progression in Tetum language starts from a
low base and moves slowly. Just 26% of students in Grades 1-3 reach a basic fluency standard of 45 correct words
per minute. The pilot is able to distinguish some factors, which have a positive association with student reading
outcomes in Tetum and these include teacher in-service attendance, the language the student speaks at home, and
access to printed materials at home. However, more research is required into the classroom practices, resources and
languages before definitive conclusions can be drawn.

   •	 More research is needed to understand how instruction takes place in the classroom, both in terms
      of the languages used, their purpose and frequency. To improve instruction, it is crucial for Timorese
      educators and policy makers to better understand how instruction takes place in the classroom both in
      terms of the pedagogy and resources used as well as on the languages used in instruction. The current
      language syllabi require a 1:3 ratio of Portuguese to Tetum instruction in the grades of focus; however survey
      results suggest this may not be happening, especially in the case of Portuguese language. Without a clear
      understanding on the share of instructional time that takes place in a given language and its purpose –i.e. as
      a medium to explain concepts or as the actual vehicle of content–, it is difficult to assert the extent to which
      reading results in either Tetum or Portuguese are truly representative of the average reading skills of Timorese
      students. Classroom observations mapping pedagogical activities as well as the languages used in instruction
      are a useful vehicle to collect information at both the teacher and student level and can provide relevant
      information the degree of implementation of current curriculum and language policies.

   •	 Better understanding of children’s average language and cognitive skills of children prior to primary
      education is also essential especially in light of expansion of system. Students in the 2011 EGRA assessment
      were not asked questionnaire about attendance to kindergarten–as a proxy for school readiness—or more specific
      questions about their experiences in languages other than Tetum and Portuguese prior to primary education.
      Given the linguistic diversity of Timorese schools, it is important that a better mapping of children’s linguistic
      background and basic proficiency in the languages of instruction is developed to assess the share of students
      who are unable to understand these languages. If most of the lessons in Grades 1 and 2 takes place in a language
      most students are not familiar with; they miss on the opportunity to develop critical language and reading skills in
      a language they understand. Given the substantial increase in the expansion of access to education in Timor Leste,
      it is expected that many children now enrolling will come from more vulnerable contexts than before, which will
      impose serious challenges to the teaching and learning of curriculum in the early grades.


                                                                                                                             17

        •	 Identify instructional approaches that build solid language skills to develop phonological
           awareness and phonics in students. Data suggests students were either not receiving any instruction
           to develop phonemic awareness or this training was not sufficient or appropriate. Without the ability to
           distinguish the sounds in words and a solid understanding of how letters and sounds go together to create
           words, students are bound to struggle in their reading development and have a limited understanding of
           what they read. However, improvements in reading instruction should not focus on phonics exclusively but
           should be incorporated into a comprehensive system of reading instruction aimed at developing reading skills
           as early and comprehensively as possible. A review of how the current curriculum addresses these important
           skills are crucial to better understand not only where these skills are expected to develop to identify if there
           is any space in the current curriculum where improvements to the teaching and learning of pre-reading and
           reading skills could be introduced to help more students achieve curriculum expectations.

        •	 Provide support to teachers to understand and practice relevant teaching methods relevant to
           reading development. The 2011 EGRA data suggest in-service is strongly associated to student’s better
           reading outcomes especially in oral reading fluency. A revision on the approach used to ongoing in-service
           programs addressing oral reading fluency has the potential to inform additional in-service courses possibly
           leveraging on its success to add modules focused on reading comprehension. A high-quality in-service
           program focusing on equipping teachers with essential skills to teach reading will contribute to improve
           instructional outcomes for all Timorese children.

        •	 Establish reference reading standards to monitor improvements across classes. As the MOE moves
           on to establish an oral reading fluency benchmark for the early grades to monitor reading improvements, it is
           important to consider that initial standards should be considered as temporary reference standards since not
           enough is currently known about when and at what rate Timorese children should progress when learning
           to read. In this sense, reading standards should not be seen as high-stakes but an essential piece to monitor
           reading progression in the classroom. One way of doing this would be to use the percentage of zero-score
           students in selected sub-tests as a marker and track reductions in the shares at least biannually. Monitoring
           achievements over time will eventually provide more information on the rate and the way in which average
           fluency develops in Timor. A modified version of the test could be used to screen students during the school
           year in need of additional support.

        •	 Support teachers to develop easy-to-use assessment tools that can help them monitor learning
           throughout the school year. In order to determine appropriate grade progressions within the school year and
           to identify students in need of additional support, teachers need to plan goals for their students that are easy to
           measure and monitor throughout the school year. This could take the form of a given number of correct letter
           sounds by the end of Grade 1. The actual number of items to be aiming at would have to be set forth using available
           data to help teachers establish learning targets that are realistic to achieve and educationally significant. These
           targets though that should not be place in isolation and would have a greater chance of bringing positive effects
           on students outcomes if accompanied by clear pedagogical activities and support strategies for students falling
           behind to avoid increasing the gap in learning between emergent readers and non-readers.

        •	 Increase the availability of books and other reading materials to children to read at home, both in Tetum
           and Portuguese. Survey results showed how students who have reading books at home have better reading
           outcomes and are more likely to become fluent. Having access to books at home and the possibility to read and
           develop a sense of enjoyment will be critical to ensure students engage in reading on a regular basis. Production of
           reading books, classroom materials and stories in Tetum written by the Timorese would be important not only to
           allow students to read child-appropriate stories but to preserve the rich oral tradition of Timorese story tellers.

        •	 Introduce policy actions that increase student exposure to literacy outside the school. Making more
           books available to students will not per se ensure better reading outcomes. Along with access to more and
           relevant reading materials, children will need support to develop a reading habit beyond the requirements of
           the school curriculum. One way of improving this would be to develop community literacy programs where
           schools become focal point of literacy in the community. Building on the success created by the school-
           grants program, schools can encourage parents and literate siblings to become more involved in the reading
           development of young children by participating in ‘peer readings` and activities, reading clubs both in school
           and at home.

     Annex Two:
     Administration of the Assessment

     The Timor EGRA assessment was administered via face-to-face interviews of about between an enumerator and the
     student. Each interview lasted 15 to 25 minutes from the onset of the test to completion of the student background
     questionnaire. In six of the nine sub-tests in the Timor EGRA instrument, students had 60 seconds to complete the
     sub-test in order to assess automaticity in a given skill. To be successful readers, basic reading competencies have
     to be automatic. Fluency measures assess not only whether or not a child knows something, but also whether
     they have integrated the knowledge and can process the information automatically (Linan-Thompson, 2007). Time-
     limitation allows proper comparison of fluency across slow readers and fast readers who may register the same
     scores at different periods of time (RTI, 2009).

     In EGRA, student scores in time-limited sub-tests are calculated as the number of correct items (i.e., letter names,
     letter sounds, or words) read per minute. If a student completes all of the words before the time expires, the time
     of completion is recorded and the number of items correctly read per minute is estimated on that time period.
     Selected sub-tests applied an “early-stop rule” to discontinue the administration of a sub-test if students were unable
     to correctly respond to any of the items in the first of ten lines (Sub-tests, 2,4,5,6, and 7), or if their responses for the
     first five items were incorrect (Sub-test 3). In this situation, the enumerator was asked to mark the box that read
     “Check this box if the exercise was discontinued because the child has no correct answers in the first line” and
     to proceed to the next sub-test in the test (RTI, 2010). The justification to discontinue a sub-test has two reasons.
     First, the early stop rule helps avoid frustration among students whose dispirit may affect their performance in
     subsequent sub-test. Second, the early stop rule is also an approximation of zero-scores throughout the test: as in
     most psychometric tests, it is assumed that students who fail the first initial items will fail the remainder of the test,
     especially if the first items are also the easiest, as it was in the case of the Timor EGRA. Sub-tests 8 and 9 did not
     apply the “early stop rule” so results in these sub-tests relate to the total sample of students and report percentage
     of correct answers over the total number of items in the sub-test.
