    TEACHER POLICY GOALS                                                                        STATUS

    1. Setting clear expectations for teacher                                                  Established
       There are clear expectations for what students and teachers are supposed to do and
       policies define the variety of teacher tasks and provide appropriate time to complete
       them all.

    2. Attracting the best into teaching                                                       Established
       Starting teacher pay is competitive and teachers have opportunities to grow in their
       careers, but working conditions are weakly monitored to be attractive.

    3. Preparing teachers with useful training and experience                                  Established
       All teachers must complete some form of tertiary program. Teachers’ entrants have
       classroom experience and beginning teachers take part and induction/mentoring
       program.

    4. Matching teachers’ skills with students’ needs                                          Emerging
       There are some policies to encourage teachers to work at hard-to-staff schools, but
       no policies exist to address teacher shortages by subject.

    5. Leading teachers with strong principals                                                 Emerging
       Principals are expected to support and improve instructional practice by assuming
       several responsibilities, but policies do not ensure principals develop leadership
       skills.

    6. Monitoring teaching and learning                                                        Emerging
       Policy recognize teachers evaluation based on multiple criteria, including classroom
       observation.

    7. Supporting teachers to improve instruction                                                Latent
       Primary and secondary teachers are required to participate in professional
       development, but there is no recommended amount of time that teachers should
       devote to professional development activities nor professional development is
       assigned based on teachers perceived needs.

    8. Motivating teachers to perform                                                          Emerging
       Teacher performance carries career opportunities and has salary implications, but
       poor performance does not result in dismissal or finish open-ended contracts with
       public administration.

                                                Policy Goal and Levers                                           Score

         2. Attracting the best into teaching                                                                  Established

         Policies do not exist to ensure working conditions appeal for talented applicants.
          Timor-Leste could develop other standards than school infrastructure for example by ensuring
            that schools have available toilets and access to water.
          Timor-Leste could develop mechanisms of lowering the pupil-teacher ratio.

         4. Matching teachers’ skills with students’ needs                                                     Emerging

         Policies do not exist to address teacher shortages by subject.
          Timor-Leste could formally identify subjects of teacher shortage and adjust the overall supply
            of such teachers, including the opening of new education tertiary programs.
          Timor-Leste should ensure that teachers’ skills and competences match with the subjects they
            teach.

         5. Leading teachers with strong principals                                                            Emerging

         Policies do not ensure principals develop leadership skills.
          Timor-Leste could develop a leadership program for teachers who want to become school
            leaders.

         6. Monitoring teaching and learning                                                                   Emerging

         Policies ensure teachers evaluation based on multiple criteria, but do not specify each of the
         criteria to have an effective system in place.
          Timor-Leste could develop further mechanisms to put teachers evaluation in place.
          Timor-Leste should use students’ assessments to inform teaching lesson plans and instructional
             practices.
          Timor-Leste could empowering the school community to monitor teachers’ performance and
             may also increase civil-service teacher efforts and subsequently student learning.

         7. Supporting teachers to improve instruction                                                           Latent

         Teachers are required to participate in professional development activities, which are focused
         on providing teachers with a minimum of qualifications and competences, but should also be
         complemented by teachers perceived needs.
          Timor-Leste should define an amount of time that teachers should devote to professional
            development activities.
          Timor-Leste could develop significant professional development activities based on teacher
            perceived needs.
          Timor-Leste should start focus its efforts on providing professional development in activities
            such as observation visits, participation in teacher networks, participation in school networks.

The Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER) initiative
produces comparative data and knowledge on education policies and
institutions, with the aim of helping countries systematically strengthen
their education systems. SABER evaluates the quality of education
policies against evidence-based global standards, using new diagnostic
tools and detailed policy data. The SABER country reports give all parties
with a stake in educational results—from administrators, teachers, and
parents to policymakers and business people—an accessible, objective
snapshot showing how well the policies of their country’s education
system are oriented toward ensuring that all children and youth learn.

This report focuses specifically on policies in the area of workforce
development.
