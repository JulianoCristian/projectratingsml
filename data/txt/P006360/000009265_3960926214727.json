The main objectives of this Program are: (a) to\n            develop private irrigation in the highlands; (b) to\n            decentralize planning and execution of irrigation\n            investments; and (c) to prepare policies and an\n            organizational framework for continued expansion. The\n            project will comprise three main components: (1)\n            construction of electric power distribution lines for\n            pumping, mainly along water courses; (2) construction of\n            public drainage, small dams and other water control\n            structures; and (3) institutional development. On-farm\n            development will be financed through existing lines of\n            credit and supported by institutional development."}, "docdt": "1988-05-16T00:00:00Z"}
