           fuelwood for domestic use in rural areas through the\n            establishment of 44,000 ha of plantations in Jammu and\n            Kashmir and 67,000 ha in Haryana on private and public\n            wastelands throughout the States. It would also provide\n            poles, bamboo, small timber, fodder, fruit, oilseeds and\n            other forest products from the same plantations, generate\n            paid employment for the rural poor, improve environmental\n            conditions, and establish and strengthen the Social Forestry\n            Wings of the Forest Departments of both States. The main\n            project risk is that the free distribution of seedlings\n            might lead to some waste. Experience in other projects\n            indicates strong demand for seedlings but statistics of\n            their survival rate are inadequate. Another risk is that\n            village panchayats might lack sufficient leadership and\n            incentive to assume responsibility for village woodlots.\n            These risks would be minimized by the careful monitoring and\n            supervision of planting programs, and public information and\n            education efforts."}, "docdt": "1982-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
