                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER



SUMMARY
1.      The proposed restructuring includes: (i) cancelling US$1,440,439 of the loan
amount because some project activities have been and will still be fully or partially
financed with local funds; (ii) revising the withdrawal schedule to reflect the partial loan
cancellation and reallocate funds between expenditure categories; and (iii) revising the
project costs and the financing plan accordingly.

2.      With the partial loan cancellation the Borrower also requested a grace period of
four months, until April 30, 2012, to process payments and withdrawal applications in
respect of eligible expenditures made before the loan closing date of December 31, 2011.



PROJECT STATUS
3.     The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to support the Borrower in
achieving an efficient and sustainable urban transport system for Metropolitan Santiago.

4.      The PDO is likely to be achieved with moderate shortcomings. Project
implementation, while slow over a number of years, has considerably picked up since the
second half of 2010. It was rated satisfactory after the last supervision mission in May
2011. Twelve project activities were successfully completed, two activities are under
implementation, and the procurement of goods and services for the six pilot projects is
ongoing. The pilot projects and the two ongoing activities will not be fully completed
before loan closing. The Borrower committed itself to conclude these activities with local
funds. It is likely that they will be completed before the submission of the
Implementation Completion and Results Report at the end of June 2012.

5.     The project has disbursed US$1.98 million of the total loan of US$4.8 million
(41%).



PROPOSED CHANGES
6.      The proposed change consists of (i) cancelling US$1,440,439 of the loan amount
because some project activities have been and will still be fully or partially financed with
local funds; (ii) revising the withdrawal schedule to reflect the partial loan cancellation

                                             4
and reallocate funds between expenditure categories; and (iii) revising the project costs
and the financing plan accordingly.

7.       The reasons why the Borrower has financed and will still finance project activities
totally or partially with local resources include the following: (i) project activities, such
as the implementation of the financial and fare management system and the network
analysis, were included in the scope of ongoing contracts awarded according to local
procurement rules and procedures. This reduced the cost of these activities significantly;
(ii) at the end of certain fiscal years, Transantiago-SE had local resources available to
finance larger portions of project activities than envisaged; and (iii) some project
activities will only be completed after the loan closing date, so the respective payments
cannot be made with loan proceeds.

8.     The reallocation of funds between expenditure categories is necessary because
more pilot projects than originally envisaged are being carried out.

9.     The revised project costs as well as the reduction and reallocation of loan
proceeds by expenditure category are presented below. The revised financing plan is
included in the data sheet.
