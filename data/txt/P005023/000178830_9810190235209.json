"abstracts": {"cdata!": "The objective of the project is to\n            reduce Egypt's reliance on imports of liquified\n            petroleum gas (LPG), gas oil, and kerosene by replacing it\n            with natural gas, a locally available source of energy. The\n            gas would be used to supply a gas distribution network in\n            four districts of Cairo: Helwan, Maadi, Nasr City and\n            Heliopolis and to provide fuel to two gas turbine plants.\n            Specifically, the project would comprise: (i) construction\n            of a high-pressure pipeline, (ii) an odorizing unit and four\n            pressure-reduction stations, (iii) a distribution network of\n            medium-density polyethylene pipes and related connection\n            services, (iv) external and internal installation of pipes\n            in households and related services as well as conversion of\n            existing LPG appliances to natural gas, (v) supervisory\n            control and cathodic protection for the gas pipelines, and\n            (iv) technical assistance, training and project related studies."}, "docdt": "1980-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
