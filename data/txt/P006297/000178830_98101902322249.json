      imports with domestic production which would rely on\n            Brazil's abundant hydroelectric resources for power and\n            ample reserves of bauxite for raw material. Also, it would\n            serve as a training ground to prepare the skilled management\n            and manpower needed to develop the aluminum industry in the\n            Amazon region, which has enormous potential. Moreover, it\n            would introduce to Brazil an advanced aluminum reduction\n            technology. At full production, the project's output\n            would reach 86,000 tons per year and substitute imports with\n            an estimated yearly value of US$145 million. The main\n            project components would be: a carbon plant to provide\n            anodes, a rectifying substation to supply direct current, a\n            potline of electrocytic cells for the reduction process, and\n            a cast house to cast billets, slabs, and ingots. The project\n            faces no special risks."}, "docdt": "1979-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
