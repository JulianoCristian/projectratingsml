PROJECT COYPLETION REPORT
INDIA
National Seeds I and II Projects
(Ln. 1273-IN/Cr. 816-IN)
PREFACE
1.     'The Project Completion Report reviews the experience of the two
National Seeds Projects financed by the Bank Group in India.
2.      Tlhe National Seed Project (Loan 1273-IN), known as the First National
Seed Project (NSP I), was appraised in October/November 1975 ana was approved
by the Board in May 1976.  The loan was signed on June 18,-1976, ana amounted
to US$25.0 Mb. Total project cost was estirated at US$52.7 M (including
duties and taxes), with a foreign exchange component of US$11.1 M. 'l'he loan
became effective on August 10, 1976, and the closing date was June 30. 1984.
Final disbursements reached 85% of the total loan &mount. The four states of
Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Matsarashtra and Punjab were involved in this
project, which also included some national components.
3.      T'he Second National Seed Project (Creait 816-IN), appraised in 1976,
was originally intended to cover the cemaining states showing interest and to
complement the First National Seea Project.  However, delays in the demand
studies for certified seed couplea with slow implementation of NSP I and late
preparation of NSP II, resulted in appraisal not taking place until April/May
1977, with approval in May 1978. 'The Credit Agreement was signed on August
17.-1978 and the Project became effective on December 20. 1978.  The original
closing date was December 31. 1984, which was later extended-to the end of
1985. The credit was for US$16.0 M equivalent against an estimated overall
cost of US$34.9 M (including duties and taxes), of which foreign exchange
accounted for US$6.0 M4. The credit was fully disbursed at closing. Five
states Bihar, Karnataka, Orissa, Rajast.han ana Uttar Pradesh were inclui±ed in
this project.
4.      It was concluded that the close similarity of NSP I and NSE II, their
intended complementarily and their overlap in time made separate completion
reports unnecessary.  This PCR therefore covers both NSP I and II, but refers
to each, independently where appropriate, particularly with regard to
specific project components.
5.      Information sources used in preparing the .rCR include: the NSP I
Staff Project Appraisal Report (No. 1064a-IN of May 17, 1976); the NS? II
Staff Project Appraisal Report (No. 1725a-IN of May 17, 1978); all NSP super-
vision miss6in reports; correspondence and information files of the Bank's
New Delhi Office (NDO); draft PCR (for NSk I) prepared by the Seed Division
Department of Agriculture, GOI, May 1985; draft of review entit.ed "Seed
Industry" prepared by  WDO, May 1980; field visits and discussions with offi-
cials and representatives of all participating states, the GOI, NSC, ICAR,
SFCI, NABARD, AFC, NDO, ana with private sector companies.  lhe mission
consisting of Mr. Richard Cox (Consultant) was undertaken during February and
March 1986.
6.      A copy of the draft report was sent to the Borrower on March 19. 1987
for comments, and these have been incorporated in the main text where           -
appropriate, and attached as Annex 7.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
INDIA - FIRST AND bECOND NATIONAL SEEDS PROJECTS (b  I AND II) (Loan
1273-IN and Credit 816-IN)
Evaluation SummaEy
Introduction
1.      The two projects represented the second and third Bank group assisted
operations aiding India's seed industry development.  The projects were
designed and timed to respond to the perceived need to ensure that a higher
proportion of the seed used by Indian fanners was of good quality, higb
yielding varieties, thereby facilitating the achievement of the country's
sectoral objectives.
Objectives
2.      The increased availability of seed of High Yielding Varieties (WVs)
has been a crucial determinant of India's agricultural development. The
basic objective of the two projects was therefore to continue to ensure that
the availability of HYV seed nationwide would not be a constraint to agricul-
tural development. by further developing the institutional structure of the
seed industry and adding to the existing seed processing capacity. Under the
two projects, Seed production, processing, storage and marketing activities
were to be decentralazed through establishment of State Seed Corporations
(SSC). SSC were expected to take over the production which the National Seed
Corporation (NSC) had performed previously in the absence of other institu-
tiOns, NSC was expected to gradually phase out of its past role as the major
seed producer and processor for food grains and other major crops. the
projects were also expected to support seed industry expansion in the private
sector.
Implementation Experience
3.      Both projects were subject to long delays in implementation with some
components yet to be completed (see Annexes 1 & 2). The initial delays were
related in part to the fact that formal cabinet approval of NSP I did not
coe until September 1977; also, various organizational problems resulted
from delays in recruiting senior executives to NSC. a prime executing agency.
Supervision reports indicate that little improvement was seen until the
latter part of 1979 when the Plroject Management and Monitoring Committee
(PMKC) became more active.  However, many of the problems persisted, includ-
ing lack of coordination among participating entities at the state level.
uncertainties in funding arrangements (especially between commercial banks
and AUs), and poor relations between SSC and NSC aggravated by the continuing
high levels of competitive production by NSC. Ite compliance with covenants
or conditions relating to the loan and credit was poor on several key issues.
of which the most crucial proved to be the failure of NSC and SSC to agree on
their respective responsibilities/functions and the low priority given to
assessing product demand and marketing aspects.



- vii -
Results
4.      The main benefits from the Projects were to be derived from higher
crop production as a result of increased use of certified seed (see Annexes 3
& 4). Besides creating jots in participating project institutions. it was
estimated that some 3 M farm families would benefit as a result of NSP I and
a further 1.35 M as a result of NSP II. However, incremental seed distribu-
tion (having made allowance for carryover) in NSP I as a result of the
Project has reached only about 21,000 t per annum (1984/85) as against the
target (at project completion) of 76,000 t, and in NSP II only about 18,500 t
(1985/86) against a target of 108,500 t. A change in crop mix distorts the
figures but overall impact has so far probably been only about 33Z and 20Z
respectively of that anticipated. However, on the positive side. capacity
has been installed to deal with a much larger demand as it develops and, aore
importantly, the institutional framework has been created.
5.      At this stage, estimates on financial and economic ROR could not ba
revised due to lack of consistent information. However, it would be
reasonable to assume that both the financial and economic rates of return of
these projects have been marginal and most likaly less than the prevailing
opportunity cost of capital in India (estimated at 10-12Z). 'the very high
appraisal estimated economic ROR of both NSP I (65x) and NSP II (158%) were
certainly not achieved in the light of high investments costs and slow
progress towards production goals. Most, if not all, SSCs are in varying
degrees of financial difficulty with the continued existence of some in
doubt. Likewise, a number of AUs are in financial difficulty as regards
their foundation seed programs. Four State Seed Certification Agencies run
at a substantial loss largely as a result of state policies (on pricing of
services, etc.) and another two have been forced into considerable retrench-
ment of activities.
6.      The SAR paid insufficient attention to the commercial conditions
necessary for various components to be viable and to the concept of quality
seed and the vital function of varietal development. In hindsight, it would
have been desirable for the Bank to have insisted on remedial action in 1979
(i.eo, before major investment had taken place) over the non-compliance with
important covenants and conditions relating to the respective roles of NSC
and SSCs and to management issues, demand projections and marketing perfor-
mance matters.
Sustainability
7.      The main uncertainties facing the project relates to the development
of markets for certified seed produced by the SSCs and their continued
viability given their present adverse financial situation and unfavourable
future prospects. Initially, the public sector corporations would have to be
restructured, with their financial viability restored. Eventually, their



- viii -
roles have to be clearly defined and their operations organized along comer-
cial lines (i.e. they should be given independence in production. pricing and
marketing decisions without Government interference). The development of the
market for certified seed would also depend on whether the plant breed-
ing/variety development systems in operation can be oriented and induced to
produce seed which meet farmers' requirements.
Findings and Lessons
8.      The major problems encountered can be classified under three head-
ings:
(a) delayed implementation brought about by the organizational
constraints and probably more fundamentally as a result
of lack of an adequately clear delineation of roles or
sufficiently conmercial orientation of the SSCs and the NSC.
(b) inadequate understanding of the emerging seed market and slower
than expected demand for seed reflecting both the fact that many
varieties being developed by the plant breeding programs in the
country did not meet farmer requirements and also the fact that
original estimates of seed replacement rates were overly
optimistic. The effects (on corporation viability) of the lower
effective demand were in some respects compounded by NSC
continuing to produce certified seed. NSC deemed this necessary
partly as past experience had shown some reluctance of states to
release seed for contracted inter-state trade during time of
shortage; and
(c) financial problems which may be attributed not only to low
turnover but in the case of SSCs to pricing policies and lack
of business expertise within some SSCs.
9.      The implementation experience of the two projects illustrates many
lessons which should help in the design of further efforts to strengthen and
rationalize India's seed industry.
(a) It is clear that in order to stimulate and/or maintain demand
for seeds of the self-pollinatea varieties, new varieties
meeting farmers requirements, should become available on a
frequent basis. The problem is not so much to do with the
number of new varieties coming out of the plant breeding program
in India, but that only a very few of them are commercially
acceptable. This suggests that a review of India's plant
breeding/variety development. testing and release programs
is necessary in order to determine whether the system is
designed (and incorporates the appropriate incentives) to
respond to farm level requirements.



- ix -
(b) It is also clear that seed replacement rates used to calculate
seed demand have been overly optimistic, resulting in excessive
investment in seed processing capacity. It should be recognized
that most of the production of seed of self-pollinated varieties
will continue to be produced by the fazaers themselves or transferred
between farmers. Hence, the SSCs producing these seeds should
only produce enough to complement what is produced in the
unorganized sector. the focus should As,-, be towards ensuring.
through extension work, that the farmers are kept informed about
new technology as it becomes available. In this respect, it is
also vital to recognize the importance of the linkage between
seed production and extension, and identify the bottlenecks which
constrain demand for seed,
(c) 'the implementation experience also suggests that in order to
develop an effective and efficient industry it is necessary to
cotceptualize and clearly define the roles of public and private
secApr involvement in the industry given its special
characteristics, The underlying assumption of the two projects
was that, given the particular circumstances of the demand for
seed of self-pollinated varieties, pzoduction would logically
be mainly a public sector function. The identification and
removal of any remaining direct or indirect entry barriers and
disincentives (e.g., the subsidies given to public companies)
to private initiative in the production of self-pollinated
varieties could well demonstrate the assumption to be at
least partly incorrect.
(d) 'the SSCs are i.n very serious financial difficulties, Hence,
in evaluating their plans, it is necessary to take into account
the likely commercial viability of existing and projected
operations of the SSCs, the prospects for disposal and
alternative use of excess capacity, SSC's ability to service
current and future debts given the market conditions for
seed production, and the prospects and means for solid management
improvements.



I. BACKGROUND
A. Agriculture in India
1.1     India now has a population well in excess of 750 million and growin
at around 2.11 annually. Total surface area is estimated at 3.7 million km
of which 491 is cultivable, with 11 being irrigated. National income has
grown at an annual rate of close to 41 since 1950.  Agriculture is the
dominant sector and mainstay of the economy in broad terms engaging 70Z of
the labor force, contributing 401 of GNP and providing the basis for 601 of
exports.
1.2     During the past 20 years, The Government of India's (GOt) development
plans have aimed to raise foodgrain production through expanding irrigated
areas and the greater use of inputs such as fertilizers, agro-chemicals and
high quality seeds. Attention has also been given to improved research,
extension and credit facilities in support of these objectives intended to
increase yields per unit area. GOI's aim is to raise the growth rate of
agricultural output from 2.3 to 31 per annum.
B. Seed Industry
1.3     Before the 1960s, the seed industry was little developed apart from a
few private sector companies (some long established), dealing in high value
vegetable and flower seeds. The public sector's involvement was limited to
that of disseminating improved reed from small government farms in each
Community Development Block. However, difficulties in managing so diffuse a
scheme often resulted in pvor quality seed and an imbalance between supply
and demand.
1.4     The spurt in the growth of the seed industry in India was fueled by
the release of HYVs in the 1960s. Mexican dwarf wheat varieties were first
introduced in 1963 and met with some success, but subsequently locally
adapted varieties from these introductions met with even greater success.
Three dwarf paddy varieties from Taiwan were released in 1965 and the I11I
variety 'IR 8' was introduced in 1966. The decade also saw the release of
hybrid maize, pearl millet and sorghum. Research associated with their
release was assisted by the Rockfeller Foundation and others working closely
with the private sector in Tamil Nadu, though coordinated by the Indian
Council fi Agricultural Research (ICAR).
1.5     As a result of the introduction of HYVa, there was a rapid growth of
private sector seed companies. In the public sector, GOI, recognizing that a
wide scatter of small seed farms was inappropriate to the technological needs
of hybrid seed production, decided to create a central seed organization.
GOI also decided to promote legislation to establish quality control. Thus
in 1963 the National Seed Corporation (NSC) was established and in 1966 a



-2-
Seeds Act was passed. NSC was charged to promote seed industry development,
from production through processing, storage and marketing, and to establish a
system of quality control.
1.6     Through the mid sixties seed output expanded rapidly.  The certified
area increased from 360 ha to 35,000 ha between 1963-64 and 1968-69, but this
expansion was mainly confined to the private sector, though the Terai Seed
Corporation (TDC) also became a force after 1969. During this period NSC
was concerned mainly with foundation seed production and, after the passing
of the Seed Act in 1966, with seed certification. However, demand for seeds
did not materialize as expected and was not commensurate with seed produc-
tion. In the self-pollinated crops, especially wheat and rice, farmer reten-
tion and farmer to farmer transfer accounted for much of the seed used,
whilst some of the HYVs were inferior in grain quality to traditional types
and thus lost favor among farmers. Substantial overproduction occurred and
large stocks accumulated with State Governments and private sector producers,
resulting in a period of retrenchment between 1968-71. Many private com-
panies withdrew from seed production, several went into liquidation and State
Governments curtailed production.
1.7     Demand began to pick up in 1971-72, but the private sector seed
industry now lacked the resources and confidence to meet it. NSC stepped in
and developed a program which in 1974/75 produced 73,000 t of seed (about 50Z
of national output), making NSC by far the largest seed producer in the
country and initiating large scale public sector involvement in seed produc-
tion.  Seed was produced almost entirely through contracts with progressi-e
farmers. A feature of this NSC program was the introduction of scientific
seed processing, whereas previously much seed had had little or no process-
ing, to the detriment of quality.
1.8     Following the considerable changes which took place in the seed
industry in the 1960s, GOI commissioned a Seed Review Team in 1968 1/ which
studied in depth the seed situation in the country. A further review of the
seed industry was carried out by the National Commission on Agriculture in
1971. 2/ Based on their findings, and the encouraging experience with the
Tarai Seeds Project, GOI decided to reorganize and expand t. i seed industry.
A Working Group, based on NSC personnel, was thus established in 1975 to
prepare proposals for a National Seed Program (NSP).
Previous IDA Involvement in the Seed Industry in India
1.9     The Bank Group's initial support for the Indian seed industry came
through a loan of US$13.0 in 1969, for the Tarai Seeds Project (Loan 614-IN).
This project was approved at a time when the imports of foodgrains had become

a serious drain on foreign exchange, and when technology was available to
improve yields of major foodgrains. The project focussed on multiplication
of locally tested high yielding varieties, improvement of seed processing
facilities and quality control. At the time of the project, quality of seed
produced was a problem as it was undertaken by scattered inefficient farms
which were rarely equipped with proper processing or storage facilities.
Arrangements for breeder stock and foundation seed stock were also weak. The
project was therefore conceived to address these weaknesses and problems.
1.10    The Tarai Seeds Project experienced some changes and several
problems. Some of the important revisions included the gradual abandonment
of the idea to construct new seed processing plants in ftvur of expanding
capacities of existing plants and the deviation of projected crop areas from
those planned. The project also experienced considerable implementation
delays, and slow pace of disbursements. However, despite the above changes
from the appraisal concept and problems, the project was generally considered
to have been successful, and most of the project objectives were more or less
achieved. This view is also generally backed up by the Bank's recent Impact
Evaluation Study on this project.
1.11    Several factors contributed to the project's success.  First, demand
exceeded available supply of seeds. Second, the Tarai area generally had a
suitable climate and good soils to produce quality seeds. Third, project
management was highly motivated and qualified. Fourth, the project was well
supported by all agencies concerned and finally the concept and timing of the
project was basically sound. As a result of the success thi TDC formed the
basis for the setting up of SSCs in the subsequent national projects.
II, PROJECT OBIGIN
A. Formulation
2.1     GOI's Working Group which examined the functioning of the seed
industry concluded that a key to greater productivity was the spread of
improved crop varieties and that quality seed was therefore an input essen-
tial to the continued development of Indian agriculture. On the basis of
this conclusion, a nationally coordinated seed development program was formu-
lated to support all facets of seed production from breeder seed supply to
marketing of certified seed.
National Seed Program (NSP)
2.2     A major feature of the Program was the proposed establishment of
State Seed Corporations (SSC), similar to the TDC, to take over the produc-
tion role which NSC had performed by default. SSCs were to be created in
regions which possessed comparative advantage for producing particular crops.
Each crop was to be produced by more than one SSC, to ensure competition and
safeguard production. Certified seed was to be produced in compact areas
around each plant by growers with a shareholding in the SSC. This contrasted
markedly with the past NSC pattern of scattered production by contract. The



-4-
new approach was expected to improve efficiency in quality control, supervi-
sion and transport. Quality was also expected to benefit from the
shareholder grower's interest in ensuring the seed industry's success.
2.3     Breeder seed production was to be coordinated by ICAR, and facilities
improved to increase output and quality. Foundation seed production was to
be coordinated by NSC, again with support for improved production. Agricul-
tural Universities were to be assigned a major role in breeder and foundation
seed production. Plant breeders, and other scientists, in the seed industry,
were to be closely involved and oriented toward achieving quality improve-
ments.
2.4     NSC was also given the responsibility to coordinate interstate seed
marketing and in doing so to establish seed stores to improve distribution
and help maintain seed quality in the marketing chain, and operate a reserve
stock scheme to buffer supply/demand imbalances. Independent State Seed
Certification Agencies (SSCA) were to be developed or strengthened to ensure
the quality of foundation and certified seed and special arrangements were
also to be taken to monitor breeder seed quality. The basic rationale for
the two projects wast therefore, to lay the foundation for the National Seed
Program.
B. Preparation, Appraisal, Negotiation and Approval
2.5     Both the preparation and appraisal missions for NSP I felt that NSC,
the central project institution, was competent to perform its functions in
the project. With regard to NSP II, the organization and management arrange-
ments developed and made operational during NSP I were generally adopted.
However, since some of the delays in implementing NSP I were attributed to
prolonged vacancies in key managerial positions in NSC and the SSCs, the
appointment of an executive chairman of NSC was made a condition of effec-
tiveness for NSP II. Similarly, the appointment of full-time managing direc-
tors for SSCs of NSP I states was made a condition of negotiation for NSP II.
2.6     It was clear that where NSP I was concerned, there was little doubt
about GOI's support or commitment to the project. This was evident as GOI
had made provisions in the Fifth Plan for assistance to states to create
SSCs. On the other hand once implementation of NSP I got underway and
progress was slow there were some doubts about GOI's long-term commitment to
the National Seed Program. However, the NSP II appraisal mission inves-
tigated this issue and was satisfied that delays in implementation of NSP I
did not indicate a lack of commitment on the part of GOI for NSP II.
2.7     One problem that ultimately had an adverse impact on implementation
of NSP I was that the GOI agencies responsible for the project, in moving
quickly to negotiations, had failed to consult other GOI agencies (such as
the Public Investment Board (PIB), Planning Commission, etc.), resulting in
delays in clearance by PIB and approval by cabinet which slowed down project
implementation. In order to avoid this coordination problem, the appraisal
mission for NSP II, took particular care to establish an early dialogue
between project agencies and government institutions involved in the project.



-5-
2.8     During project preparation of both projects, there was a controversy
between NBC and SSC8 (and the State Governments) over three basic issues.
(a) Compact area approach for the production of seed. Participating
states were not happy with this approach, which was, ultimately,
adopted for both NSP I and II. States' criticisms were: (i) that
the past pattern of scattered seed production led to the emergence of
a number of experienced seed producers all over the states which
would not have oncurred if the new approach were to be taken; (ii)
that agroclimatic conditions in a compact area did not permit produc-
tion of all crops and varieties that the states may wish to produce.
(b) Abolition of contract seed production within compact area in favor
of making seed growers shareholders in the 8SCs. This position was
adopted for both NSP I and II. The states' concern was that the
project may not have enough to offer the growers to tempt them to
join.
(c) NSC's role in inter-state marketing. Under both NSP I and II, NSC
was made responsible for inter-state marketing. Justification for
this at the time of project preparation appeared valid -- on grounds
of economy, coordination of production, storage and transport,
improvement of services, and the states generally but with some
reluctance accepted this position. However, another important reason
was that NSC wanted to provide employment for existing staff who
would otherwise have been retrenched by the decentralization of seed
processing activities. The States were concerned about having a
single marketing agency with no other outlet through which seeds can
be sold if such an agency proved to be inefficient. These issues may
have contributed to coordination problems between NSC and SSC. which
surfaced later on during the implementation of the projects, as they
were largely unresolved at the time of appraisal.
2.9     Another important issue at the time of appraisal was on the quality
of information which formed the basis for the ultimate seed supply and demand
projections. The NSP I appraisal mission found that the projections were
inadequate, but was convinced, after preliminary analysis, that the increase
in certified seed production envisaged under the project would probably meet
the greater part of demand by 1981. Completion by GOI of an extensive seed
demand survey was made a prerequisite to consideration of US? II. The first
draft of the survey was completed and reviewed before appraisal of NSP II.
The coverage was found to be inadequate and not representative enough to
establish future seed demand patterns and doubts were expressed as to whether
the National Council on Applied Economic Research (NCAER) had the appropriate
mix of personnel to carry out the analysis required. To complement this
initial survey, funds were provided in NSP II to undertake a demand survey
under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank. In the final analysis,
however, a major problem experienced by both projects eventually was that
demand for certified seed never increased to the extent anticipated.

National Seeds Project I (NSP I)
2.10    Selection of the four States - Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Maharashtra
and Punjab - was based on the preparedness of their proposals; their current
and proposed importance as producers of major crop seed; and, except for
Andhra Pradesh, the need to produce certified cotton seed as an essential
input to the Integrated Cotton Development Project (610-IN).
Specifically the Project comprised components to:
(a) improve breeder and foundation seed production, the former at 20
Institutes and Universities, the latter at 5 Universities; and
develop three large scale farms for certified seed production;
(b) remodel canals supplying irrigation water to large project farms in
Haryana;
(c) establisb and equip a SSC in each of the four States;
(d) support expansion of private sector seed operations;
(e) expand seed storage capacity and establish a reserve stock;
(f) expand quality control facilities through assistance to the four
SSCAs and to Seed Testing Laboratories;
(g) provide equipment for the expansion of NSC's vegetable seed opera-
tion;
(h) develop seed technology research at 5 Universities; and
(i) provide training and technical assistance.
2.11    The size of the loan was US$25 M, being approximately 50X of the
total project cost net of duties and taxes (or 47.91 of the US$52.7 M with
duties and taxes) and was expected to finance all the US$11.1 N Foreign
Exchange costs and about US$14 X of local costs. The remaining local cost
was to be financed by GOI (24X), G00 (81), ARDC (superseded by NABARD) and
participating commercial banks (8X), and sub-borrowers (20.51). The loan,
with a maturity of 20 years and a grace period of 5, was made to GO at an
interest rate of 8.51 per annum.
2.12    It was stipulated that the bulk of Bank funds (US$18.2 M) would be
channelled through the ARDC (now NABARD) to commercial banks for financing
sub-borrowers' investments in seed production, processing and marketing
facilities. GGI would make Bank proceeds available to ARDC (NABARD), repay-
able partly over 9 and partly over 5 years at interest rates of not less than
6.51 and 7%, respectively with GOI bearing the exchange risk. ARDC (NABARD)
would onlend the funds to banks at an annual interest rate of not less than
8Z. The banks, in turn, would lend to SSC, NSC, IJfRDCt SFCI, private
processors and State and Central Warehousing Corporations (SWC, CWC), at a
minimum annual rate of 11% for periods ranging from 5 to 15 years. Lending



-7-
rates under the project would be in line with prevailing interest rates*
Bank funds (US$6.8 M) for agricultural universities, quality control, train-
ing and technical assistance, and canal remodelling would be according to
the Borrower's standard arrangements for development assistance to ICAR and
the States. In order to expedite project implementation, US$500,000 of
retroactive financing was made available against procurement of selected
items provided such procurement was consistent with Bank guidelines.
2.13    The project was expected to provide a number of important economic
benefits. The main project benefit was expected to be increased crop yields
resulting from the improved availability and quality of seed. Projected
annual incremental cereal production at full development was expected to be
200,000 t of wheat, 170,000 t of paddy, 95,000 t of maize, 200,000 t of
sorghum, and 250,000 t of pearl millet. Total value of these crops was
estimated at about US$145 M per year. The project was also expected to
increase and improve the production of cotton seed, estimated to be worth
about US$3.7 M per year at full development. Lesser quantities of other seed
was also ta be produced. About 3 million farmers were expected to benefit
from the use of project seed. Employment effects was expected to result in
the creation of about 14,000 man years of seasonal work during harvesting and
about 800 jobs to carry Out the work of the SSC and SSCAs. Based on the
quantified incremental costs and henefits, the economic rate of return of the
project was estimated at 65%. Large farm development and the buffer stock
scheme were evaluated separately but found acceptable.
2.14    In respect of risks, it was considered that as the seeds market was
already fairly well established, there was little danger that the increased
certified seed produced as a result cf the project would not be utilized.
The most significant risk was considered to be the possible adverse impact of
the fairly complex organizational arrangements involved in project implemen-
tation which could lead to the project moving more slowly than expected.
National Seed Project II (NSP II)
2.15    NSP II did not get off the ground as scheduled, because of the delay
experienced in conducting the seed demand survey (para 2.9) and appointing
NSC's executive Chairman it late 1976 (after the vacancy arose). The Bank
Group's approval of the Second National Seed Project could not take place
until mid-1978. Although nine States were interested in participating in the
project, four States (Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal)
were unwilling to abide by the principles of NSP and the disciplines con-
sidered necessary for success of the NSP. Thus this Project comprised five
states only - Bihar, Karnataka, Orissa, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh - but it was
anticipated that other states would be covered in a subsequent project.
2.16    The Project was designed to have components similar to those of NSP
I, but with fewer national components. IL comprised:
(a) establishment of a SSC in each of the five states and equipping them
for production, processing, storage and marketing of certified seed
(US$11.92 M);



-8-
(b) development of State Agricultural University (AU) farms for founda-
tion seed production and development of 4,000 ha of SFCI farms for
certified seed production (US$3.93 M);
(c) assistance to six AUs for laboratory, f^rm and processing equipment
necessary for breeder and foundation seed production and processing
(US$3.1 M);
(d) expansion of SSCA (US$0.72 M) and Seed Testing Laboratories (STL)
(US$0.28 4);
(e) provision of incremental permanent working capital required by AUs
and SSCs (US$6.37 N);
(f) technical assistance and training necessary to support seed technol-
ogy research, processing, quality control and marketing (US$0.40 M);
and
(g) incremental reserve stocks (US$0.13 M).
2.17    The total credit was US$16 M to cover about 501 of the total project
costs net of tax and duties (or 461 of the US$34.9 4 with taxes and duties).
The credit was expected to cover the foreign exchange component of US$6 M and
about US$10 M of local cost. The remaining local cost was to be financed by
GOI (191), GOS (9%), ADC (NABARD) and participating commercial banks (291),
and sub-borrowers (seed growers) (81). The credit was to GOI on standard IDA
terms of 50 years duration, including 10 years grace period, free of interest
except for 0.751 per annum service charge.
2.18    It was planned that the bulk of IDA funds (US$14.5 M) would be chan-
nelled by GOI through ARDC (NABARD) to participating banks for financing
investments in production, processing and marketing of foundation and
certified seeds and for farm development by AU. The preparation by ARDC
(NABARD) of a banking plan satisfactory to the Association was a condition of
Credit Effectiveness. IDA funds for research, breeder seed production,
quality control, training and technical assistance (US$1.5 M) would be chan-
nelled through the COS and the NSC. The main onlending terms from GOI to
ARDC (NABARD) were fixed at an interest rate either of 6.75Z per annum over 9
years or 7.257 per annum over 5 years with 0.25X rebate for prompt payment;
ARDC (NABARD) to Commercial Banks at an interest of 81 per annum with 901
refinancing of banks' loans and repayment to coincide roughly with repayment
by ultimate borrowers; Banks to Borrowers at an interest of 117 per annum,
grace period on loan up to 5 years and repayment within 15 years (loans up to
701 SSC/SFCI investments or 75% for AU); on Lending by GOI to ICAR, NSC and
GOS was expected to be in accordance with standard arrangements.  Again, in
order to expeO'te project implementation upto US$200,000 of retroactive
financing was made available, as long as Bank procurement guidelines were
followed.
2.19    Similar to NSP I, the main project benefits were expected to be
increased crop yields resulting from improved availability of better quality
seed. At full development, the annual increase in production of commercial



-9-
grain and other crops was expected to be 245,0OO t wheat, 325,000 t paddy,
85,000 t maize, 60,000 t sorghum, 85,000 t pearl millet, 40,000 t potato,
15,000 t groundnut and 90,000 t of other crops including jute, pulses and
oilseeds. The incremental value of these crops was estimated at about US$158
M per year against the incremental costs of US$17.5 M per year for seed
production and processing. It was estimated that 1.35 million farm families
would derive direct benefit from the project which would provide adequate
seed for 2.7 million ha. In addition, 13,500 man-years of seasonal employ-
ment would be created for harvesting the incremental crops produced and
within the SSCs, SSCAs and marketing outlets, some 1,250 posts would be
created. Based on quantified costs and benefits, the economic rate of return
was estimated at 158%.
2.20    The most significant risk recognized was that seed demand might be
lower than expected. Safeguards were taken by planning production and
processing on the basis of conservative demand estimates and by emphasizing
the marketing function, improvement in demand studies, and market research
and sales promotion. Another significant risk noted was the possible adverse
impact of the fairly complex organizational arrangements on project implemen-
tation. A further risk mentioned was the fact that the long-term success of
the project would depend upon gaining consumer confidence in the quality and
reliability of supply, of the seed produced.
III.  IMPLEMENTATION
A. Conditions of Effectiveness
3.01    The principal conditions on which loan effectiveness was dependeat
for NSP I included:
(a) the completion of arrangements satisfactory to the Bank for the
transfer to the SSCs of suitable processing plants of NSC; and
(b) the completion to the satisfaction of the Bank of lending arrange-
ments between ARDC (NABARD) and the participating banks for loans
to the SSC.
Disbursement was also subject to the following conditions:
%a) against farm development costs - completion of satisfactory farm
plans;
(b) against processing plant costs - prior Bank approval for SSC process-
ing plant designs; and
(c) against any project cost for a state - establishment of SSCs in each
state with articles of association satisfactory to the Bank, and the
signing of a project agreement between the SSC and the NSC.
3.02    With regard to NSP II the following conditions were stipulated for
credit effectiveness.



-10-
(a) completion of arrangements for transfer of plant and equipment by
NSC to SSC;
(b) preparation of a banking plan by ARDC (NABARD);
(c) functioning of the Executive Chairman of NSC in that capacity on a
full-time basis.
The following conditions were applied with respect to disbursements;
(a) against investments by AUs - transfer of adequate land suitable for
foundation seed production by the GOS to the AU;
(b) against processing plant costs - approval by IDA of the design of
each seed processing plant;
(c) against any project cost for a state - execution of the agreement
between NSC and SSC setting out their respective responsibilities
under the projecc.
B. Project Revisions
3.03    There were two fairly major modifications to the projects as designed
and a number of smaller ones which were very much of detail. The two major
revisions were:
(a) Some relaxation in the concept of compact areas for certified seed
production. Although originally a basic component of NSP, it was in
practice interpreted too rigorously. The concept was relaxed in
order to allow the interpretation of compact areas to be a matter
of judgement, compatible with a specific SSC's and associated SSCA's
resources and economy of operation (alternative areas of production
to those listed at appraisal were similarly considered to be a matter
of judgement). However, the PCR Mission found HSSC to be seemingly
unaware of this relaxation and still had such a request pending with
GOI.
(b) A change in the storage component of NSP I. Originally it had been
proposed that five bulk stores would be constructed by the Central
Warehouse Corporation (CWC) in climatically suitable areas and leased
to NSC. In the event CWC were not prepared to proceed without
guarantees of use by NSC. Eventually the component was entrusted to
NSC, after considerable delay, who decided on a large number (48) of
small (300 t) transit stores shared between - NSC (26); NSP I SSCs
of Andhra Pradesh (1), Haryana (4), Maharashtra (6); NSP II SSCs of
Karnataka (5), Rajasthan (6).



-11-
C. Implementation
3.04    Delays,  During a supervision mission for NSP I in Ncvember 1977,
some 15 months after loan e.ffectiveness, the initial slow rate of implementa-
tion and some delays in setting up institutional and managerial arrangements
were noted and attributed to doubts about GOI's support of the project (which
were not rpmoved until Cabinet approval in September 1977). During the
initial period of uncertainty, there were problems in coordination and
monitoring, and problems in finding replacements for both the Chairman and
Managing Director of NSC who had resigned in December 1976 and September 1977
respectively. These problems and delays in the completion of the seed demand
survey report hampered the preparation of NSP II which was two years late in
becoming effective. The projects were also not completed in time. Disburse-
ments under NSP I were eventually terminated on December 31, 1984, well over
8 years from when the l1an became effective and disbursements under NSP II
ceased on December 31, 1985 over 6 years from when the credit became effec-
tive. Thus, the two projects spanned over 9 years.
3.05    The status of the main physical components in 1981 and 1984 (at the
time of the last supervision mission) are shown in Annexes 1 and 2 for NSP I
and NSP II separately and indicate considerable delays in both projects, more
especially in NSP r. It should be pointed out, however, (see borrower's
comments, Annex 7) that the complex nature of the. project made some delays in
vitable. Such delays resulted in cost escalations and the delay in the
construction of certified seed processing plants restricted the production
capacity of the SSCs, a contributary reason for NSC remaining in production
notwithstanding the original NSP intention. The delay in the construction of
processing plants and onfarm development by the AUs severely restricted the
availability of foundation seed, resulting in the continued widespread use of
'truthfully labelled' rather than certified seed and encouraged both NSC and
SFCI to continue to be involved in the production of foundation seed.
3.06    Supervision Reports gave several reasons for continued delays.  Early
causes were - inadequate coordination and monitoring at State and National
levels; uneven commitment by NSC's management to the major principles of NSP;
delays in recruitment of senior level staff for NSC's and SFCI's Engineering
and Project Implementation Cells; uncertainties in funding arrangements; poor
relationship between NSC and SSC arising partly from the former's continuing
presence in certified seed production, their control of foundation seed
supply, and their pricing of seed handled; concentration by NSC and SSC on
short-term operational needs at the expense of project implementation; reluc-
tance of most participating agencies to appoint key executive personnel
essential for project implementation; and inadequate dialogue between the
State level implementing agencies and the National level coordinating agen-
cies. From the latter part of 1979 there was some improvement, but little
progress was made in narrowing the implementation gap because of further
bureacratic delays in procurement and in arranging loan finance, and some
apparent continued lack of resolve on the part of beneficiary agencies and
coordinating institutions. These weaknesses had not been iully overcome even
at the end of the project periods.



-12-
NSP I Components
3.07    Annex 5 (Table GI) summarizes the actual component costs in the
project. The main increases in cost over the SAR estimates are reflected in
the overall expenditure of Maharashtra State, the transit store component and
the reserve stock scheme. Lower costs are shown in the overall expenditure
of Andhra Pradesh State, the private sector component and the ICAR
Institutes. An explanation of these variations is given belowl reference
should also be made to Tables G2-G5 (Annex 5). The NSP I components are
divided under 12 headings, for convenience.
3.08    (i) Breeder Seed Production.  The breeder seed component was divided
between ICAR Institutes and AU, but all had funds provided in the form of
a grant channelled through ICAR. The SAR suggested that breeder seed produc-
tion should normally be under the control of the originating breeder, but
that production personnel might be recruited who would also staff the founda-
tion seed unit where applicable.
3.09    The 7 ICAR Institutes included (with an eighth intended to share
facilities with APAU, being located on the same campus) did not avail them-
selves of all the funds that were available probably because their potential
for breeder seed production was limited by land and staff constraints. This
was compounded by the frequently reluctant and tardy approach to construction
adopted by PWD, which had many other commitments.
3.10    The 13 AU covered actually fall into three categories - 6 in lSP I
States; the 2 which effectively became absorbed into NSP *i; the remaining 5,
comprising the AU in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu besides the 2 at
Pantnagar and Varanasi in UP which were not included under NSP II. The
expenditures at all 6 AUs in NSP I States were as anticipated, but as it
turned out, initial funds were totally inadequate to construct
air-conditioned stores, the costs of which had been seriously underestimated
at appraisal due to lack of knowledge about their design. The result is that
few air-conditioned stores have yet become operative, restricting the amount
of carryover stock and aggravating the overall inadequate production of
breeder seed. In fact, a number of the processing units have been only
recently commissioned.
3.11    The genetic quality of the breeder seed has been uneven, and com-
plaints about inadequate supplies resulted in both NSC (with GOI assistance)
and even SFCI entering into production. Poor quality and supply may be
attributed to lack of interest on the part of breeders (perhaps understand-
ably as seed production is not their primary concern), and difficulties in
managing and motivating the workforce (some field work for certain hybrid
crops needs to be completed by 0700 hrs.) The situation might have been
improved if AUs had been able to create revolving funds which could finance
inputs and additional staff.
3.12    (ii) Foundation Seed Production.  Under the Project all 6 AUs in the
4 States covered wers to receive assistance for both the construction of seed
processing plants and the development of production farms for which the
government provided land if it was not already available. Funds were made



-13-
available as a 25X grant from GOI (in the absence of equity from the AU) with
the balance as term loans (sanctioned by NABARD) through commercial banks.
Considerable delays resulted from the following: (a) both Universities and
Banks frequently found problems in initiating a suitable loan procedure as
there was little precedent; (b) delays by NSC or SFCI in release of the grant
from GOI, (c) delays in preparing proposals for processing plants by AUs
which delayed appraisal of these proposals by NSC and AUs objecting to the
fees charged by NSC (some of which are still outstanding); (d) reluctance by
AUs to commit themselves to loans on commercial terms.
3.13    As regards processing plants, KAU took the grant but met the balance
requirements from its own funds; PAU managed largely with existing equipment
so reducing project costs; APAU decided to make use of the SSC plants (the
Managing Director of the SSC 4; on deputation from APAU), so reducing project
cos. s; all three AUs in Mahar itra tried to avail themselves of project
funds with Akola and Rahuri experiencing steep price escalations which added
to project costs whereas Parbhani had difficulties in establishing a loan and
only obtained its equipment from NSC at the end of 1984 on the insistence of
OI.
3.14    In respect of the farms, the situation is similar to that for plants
in that HAU took the grant and then managed with its own funds, but this farm
is now in danger of going out of production through salinity problems; PAU
did not take a loan; APAU did not utilize its NABARD sanctioned loan and
developed only one farm out of 3 proposed; all three Maharashtra AUs availed
themselves of the project provisions and all, especially Akola, have
experienced large cost escalations mainly as a result of implementation
delays, the farms only very recently becoming fully operative. The par-
ticipating AUs also had problems obtaining farm machinery, which were to be
procured by ICB with the processing being coordinated by SFCI. However, many
problems surfaced, particularly with regard to procedures and specifications.
For instance, there were disagreements for some time as to the optimal size
of tractors and whether the 55 hp model which OI favored and could be
procured within India (without ICB tendering and so precluding use of UB
funds), or the 70 hp model favored by SFCI was more efficient. (Initially
there had also been a disagreement between SFCI and WB regarding the size of
larger tractors, but eventually WB left the matter of tractors to be decided
locally). Eventually the tender invitation for the tractors and some other
machinery were issued late in the extended life of the project and due to an
irregularity in evaluation (which proved impossible to rapidly resolve) could
not be completed, so accounting for some of the under disbursement, By
necessity some AUs purchased small tractors locally which were in case not
compatible with machinery purchased earlier by SFCI.
3.15    The initial situation of inadequacies in the supply of foundation
seed to meet demand shifted to worries over excess production during the life
of the project. AUs encountered under-utilization of capacity as a result of
lower than anticipated overall foundation seed sales, competition from NSC
and SFCI and the fact that SSC were finding it cheaper to prodvce with
growers who had not undertaken large capital expenditure (although there was
a risk that not all seed would be returned) or on their own or DOA farms. In



-14-
the event of there being no alternative profitable use for the AU farm it is
expected that prospects for loan repayment would become a major problem.
3.16    (iii) Seed Technology Research.  Five AU in the 4 States received
assistance under the project with funds being channelled through ICAR and all
probably now have most of the basic facilities required. There is some
apprehension about undue duplication of effort between AUs and the immediate
or relevant value of some of the research work being undertaken. The greater
dialogue and coordination between the various institutes, needed to resolve
these problems, is yet to develop fully. The Project had assumed that the
respective SSC would eventually contribute to research expenses, but since
most are very short of funds, ICAR has had to continue to meet costs.
3.17    (iv) State Seed Corporations (SSC).  The intention of NSP was that
SSCs should be created to assume the production role of NBC, but with NSC
still maintaining an inter-state marketing function. The Project assisted in
the construction of processing plants, based mainly on anticipated cereal
requirements with further provision in Haryana, Punjab and Naharashtra for
cotton seed processing. A further component, besides Stores, was working
capital, but this was not directly supported by the loan/credit and has
sorAtimes been a constraint. The credit provisions were utilized in all four
States. The NSC was required to appraise the plant and machinery, and handle
ICB procedures and some delays were probably due to the NSC's original under-
estimation of costs.
3.18    Broadly, the design of the plants was satisfactory, though some
problems emerged in the use of locally manufactured equipment. The design
incorporated the use of several bucket elevators which frequently proved to
be difficult to clean. Up to 8 hours were required to fully clean the plant
and as a result plants were not cleaned between lots of the same variety
which can throw doubt on the continued certification of individual lots when
200 kgs of an 800 kg lot may be retained in the system. The NSC does plan to
make some modifications to existing plants, though there is a widespread
feeling that the standard 5,000 t plants are too large anyway. This com-
ponent, which was tne principal component of the project both conceptually
and investment-wise, is facing serious financial problems. The experiences
of individual States SCs are explored below.
3.19    Andhra Pradesh.  Two plants were constructed as proposed, although
locations were changed. There was some cost escalation through delay, but
overall savings were effected by reducing the size of the larger plant to
5,000 t. The newly commissioned plan; at Nizambad is likely to face seed
procurement problems from certified growers as a result of a change in crop-
ping pattern and the introduction of high value crops as an alternative to
seed production. The current low levels of turnover are also due to an
increase in lower value paddy seed production to meet both interstate trade
and a local demand fuelled by a policy of subsidizing paddy and wheat, which
reduced the demand for hybrid sorghum and millet seed. Although APSSC is
well placed to produce paddy seed, there is stiff competition in the
inter-state market from NSC who have well over 7,000 t processing capacity
within the State. Profit margins are also further squeezed by price controls
and high cost of production experienced by shareholder growers which is



-15-
passed onto the SSC. Although the SSC has shown a consistent profit (Table
G6 of Annex 5), this is very modest. Cash flow problems have threatened to
become acute in respect of loan repayment and may cause the SSC to experience
severe financial constraints in the future. The SSC is now receiving some
interest-free advances from COS and loan repayment has been rescheduled.
3.20    Haryana.  Three cereal plants were proposed to be built with cotton
plants to be associated with 2 of these. There were some changes of location
and substantial cost savings were achieved by dropping the cotton plant at
one site and exploiting the advantages of acquiring a sound NSC cereal plant
at Hissar. Nevertheless, the overall expenditure has exceeded estimates due
to cost escalation from delays especially with the cotton unit (due to dis-
cussion over the most suitable method of delinting -- wet acid was chosen
which took time for approval by the environmental authorities). The plants,
which are somewhat elaborate and sometimes include residential housing, have
given the SSC a total capacity of near 40,000 t against their estimated state
requirement of 10,000 t. The SSC also face competition within the state as
NSC (and SFCI) still produce independently in Haryana. The SSC is further
handicapped by having too few resources to aggressively market out-of-state
and also their public sector clients have proved unpredictable. With large
carryovers especially of wheat and generally under-utilized cereal plants the
financial future of the SSC is bleak.
3.21    Maharashtra.  In keeping with the proposal, two cereal processing
plants, along with cotton units, have been established at Akola and Parbhani.
The Akola cereal plant was functional by 1980, but the Parbhani plant was
constructed considerably later and was subject to cost escalation. Neither
cotton unit was commissioned until 1986 as it took a long time before the
nature of the delinting unit was decided (dry acid was chosen) during which
time costs escalated. As a result, despite a decision to reduce capacity,
there was an overall rise in component cost. A drop in demand for cereal
seed (the SSC has also considerable carryover stocks) has resulted in one of
the two cereal lines being taken out of use at Akola. The SSC has shown
modest profits (Table G6 of Annex 5), but these have not necessarily found
favor politically. As a result of GOB dictates, the SSC recently increased
its production of cot.on to guarantee supplies of grower preferred varieties
(there had been 2 adverse seed production years). The SSC now has a very
large carryover of cottonseed and has gone into a deficit position. There-
fore, GOS's preparedness to financially back its policy decisions will be a
key factor in determining the ability of the SSC to remain viable or repay
its loans.
3.22    Punjab.  The SSC established three cereal plants, one with a cotton
unit, albeit with some modification of location. Some cost savings were
effected by eliminating non-essential elements. However, the situation is
now almost identical in all respects to that in Haryana (3.20). The SSC has
a processing capacity of over 27,000 t, much higher than the State require-
ment (e.g., SAR put target wheat seed production at 25,500 t whereas local
demand stands at 4,000 t). The scope for inter-state marketing has also been
limited leaving the SSC with large carryovers, idle plant, trading losses,
and the inability to repay loans. To counteract this the SSC is looking to
broaden its crop range, but possibilities appear to be limited. For



-16-
instance, cotton should be profitable and a dilinting plant is now operative
(since 1985), but the AU has advised against the use of hybrids as not fit-
ting into the cropping pattern. The SSC therefore does not produce hybrids
but this may have adverse consequences for the sale of cotton seed by the
SSC, since hybrids are gradually becoming popular in the State. In respect
of some other crops, the SSC has also lost a potential market for new
varieties as a result of the AU releasing promising material directly to
farmers. The continued financial survival of the SSC is unlikely, in its
present operating context.
3.23    (v) NSC Vegetable Production.  Seven vegetable seed plants were
proposed at various locations. Eventually eight plants were constructed with
some revision of location. Two plants, at Agra and Hyderabad, were to have
packeting lines, but these are yet to be installed. The accounting and
recording systems of NSC preclude a ready assessment of this component in
isolation but it appears to have been successful in that the vegetable seed
enterprise as a whole is profitable and production rose from 700-800 t
annually (prior to the first new plant being commissioned), to over twice
this by 1984/85 (33% or so being heavy seeds such as peas).
3.24    (vi) Stores.  As described previously this component was revised and
thus delayed to the extent that some of the 48 transit stores are yet to be
completed. This has resulted in inevitable cost escalationi.
3.25    (vii) Large Farm Development.  The SAR proposed that assistance be
providedt, through loans from commercial banks, to develop three large farms.
One of these at Hissar (Haryana) belonged to the SSC which did not conform
with NSP policy and so was transferred to another public corporation HLRDC.
The other two farms are operated by SFCI, one in Haryana and one in Punjab.
Overall, the objectives of large farm development has largely been achieved.
3.26    The HLRDC Farm.  This farm of 600 ha availed itself of the loan
assistance available. The main benefits accrued from improved canal linings
since water was a limiting factor. The farm supplies seed to meet indents of
HSSC and seeds are a major profit center but the published accounts do not
permit analysis of this. However, observations indicate that this farm is
reasonably successful.
3.27    SFCI Farms.  Final investments were in line with SAR estimates.  Seed
production at Hissar (Haryana) has risen from an annual average before the
project (1975/76-1977/78) of 1,550 t to 3,800 t (1982/83-1984/85) whilst
total profits in this latter period have been Rs 8.9 million, a little above
SAR estimates. However, the fact that over 60% of production is foundation
seed and up to 5% is breeder seed is hardly in keeping with the original NSP
intentions or guidelines. The picture is not so good at Ladhowal (Punjab)
which shared some 402 of the total subloan amount, with annual production
on this farm only increasing from 2,000 t in 1975/76-1977/78 to 2,200 t
(1982/83-1985/86). Profits in the latter period have averaged only
Rs 300,000 per annum though following a substantial loss in earlier years.
3.28    (viii) Canal Remodelling in Haryana.  The HAU foundation seed farm,
the MLRDC farm and the SFCI farm at Hissar, all included in the project,



-17-
suffered from lack of irrigation water. This component was aimed at
alleviating this constraint and was handled by the Irrigation Department. In
the event much of the work was completed under another World Bank Project
with consequent savings in cost to this Project.
3.29    (ix) Quality Control.  This component was aimed at improving the
capability of the SSCAs and autonomous bodies, to perform seed certification
functions and assisting the Seed Testing Laboratories (STL) of the GOS.
Funds were to be allocated as a grant. The SSCA now have adequate resources
to function satisfactorily with most cost savings (compared to SAR estimates)
having resulted because of the continued use of rented premises in the
absence of alternative sites. The main constraint appears to be the lack of
facilities for grow-out tests. The recruitment of staff to replace those on
deputation from DDAs has sometimes been rather slow and has inevitably led to
charges of partiality when senior SSC staff are similarly on deputation.
There have been problems in the slowness of performing the certification
function (important as many seeds have a short turnaround time if carryovers
are to be avoided). This is sometimes related ,o the time taken to transport
samples to the STL and delays thereafter.
3.30    The Project envisaged that the SSCA should recover operatiag costs
from fees. The APSSCA has managed to operate (1979/80-1983/84) at a profit
exceeding Rs 600,000 per annum. During the same period both HSSCA (despite
some grants from COS in early years) and PSSCA have operated at some loss,
Rs 100,000 per annum and Rs 180,000 per annum respectively. This is not too
serious but the situation has recently deteriorated with the reduced produc-
tion by the two 88Cs, and as a result staff have been made redundant. The
case with Maharashtra is different in that the State Government insists on
nominal fees to encourage certification and allows a high staff:crop ratio.
In 1983/84 losses were over Rs 2.7 million and are expected exceed Rs 13
million by 1989/90. If all SSCA were to be brought to a satisfactory finan-
cial status and allowed to charge reasonable fees, the respective SSC would,
of course, be that much worse off as in the present context they are directly
or indirectly the main clients.
3.31    Generally, the STL are now adequately equipped having also received
assistance under a USAID project earlier.  However, generators, as an
insurance against power failure, and improved 'grow-out' test facilities are
sometimes requested. (A recurring problem is the lack of suitable paper for
germination tests leading to inconsistency in results).
3.32    (x) Reserve (Buffer) Stock Scheme.  This componernt, financed by GOI,
is administered by NSC, though since 1984/85 SSC have acted as sub-agents.
The apparent cost escalation would seem to be partly the reoult of NSP I and
II being combined in the records, but must be mainly due to the extended
duration of the Project.
3.33    (xi) Technical Assistance and Training.  This component, which
assisted many of the aspects of the Project may be divided into technical
assistance from outside the country, local consultancies, overseas training
and local training.



-18-
3.34    Outside technical assistance was used to:
(a) plan the seed technology research programs and seems to have been
considered valuable even if not vitall
(b) guide NSC in planning the layout of cereal plants and more especially
the cotton units of which they had no experience. This assistance
was much appreciated; and
(c) advise NSC on the vegetable packaging lines and this was considered
to have been useful.
Local consultancies were carried out on:
(a) marketing by AFC who sub-contracted the assignment. The report is
detailed but, presumably from misguided instruction (after consider-
Ing overall seed demand), concentrates on how NSC should market its
seed in competition with other agencies such as SSC, whereas the
intention should have been to guide NSC in its role of coordinating
inter-state marketing;
(b) quality control by NSC who prepared a useful reference book, though
not finally approved (with amendments) by the Central Certification
Board until 1986;
Overseas training was afforded in:
(a) seed technology for advanced degree. Although considered useful,
it is felt that greater advantage could be obtained by sending more
people abroad for short courses. In fact the APAU candidate did not
go and the MAU (Parbhani) candidate returned early for domestic
reasons;
(b) cotton processing: A study tour for engineers from each cotton plant
(as proposed in SAR), numbering only 4 in place of 6 as the number
of plants had been reduced, were joined by 2 from NSC. The trip was
regarded as very informative by the participants; and
(c) quality control: a total of 16 officials from the 9 ISP I and II
States went abroad. It was felt by the project authorities that the
visits were considered very useful but that more people should have
gone, especially from the SSCA where a number of deputed staff who
toured are no longer at post.
Local training was given principally by NSC, to processing engineers and
quality control officers.
3.35    (xii) The Private Sector.  This component was in actuality outside
the main thrust of the Project. It was formulated on the basis of surveys on
the private sector carried out by AFC in the mid-1970s which though not
designed to be definitive, gave useful background information. It was
estimated that the private sector accounted for the following level of seed



-19-
production - maize 401; sorghum 90%; pearl millet 701; cotton (mainly
hybrids) 1001; vegetables over 90%.
3.36    The survey divided the sector into 4 categories - individual growers
(estimated at 1,000-2,000); small producers or associations (estimated at
250); medium producers or associations controlling 1,000-1,500 ha of produc-
tion (estimated at 30); large scale producers (estimated at 6). The SAR
proposal was that 3 large, 10 medium and 25 small companies should be given
loans through commercial banks.
3.37    The uptake of funds was very disappointing, finally amounting to no
more than about Rs 285 lakhs as against Rs 512.5 lakhs available, despite
price escalations. A number of reasons for the poor response have been put
forward, including:
(a) lack of awareness in the private sector of how to proceed with
obtaining loans or even of the existence of the facility. The AFC
had made attempts to publicize the opportunities;
(b) apprehension that government policies would not go far enough to
allow the private sector to thrive;
Cc) unsatisfactory project terms and conditions particularly with regard
to land acquisition for research and varietal development;
(d) no provision of funds for working capital, so vital to the industry,
it being assumed, incorrectly, as readily forthcoming from domestic
funds;
(e) delays in clearance of loan proposals due to the multi-institutional
approach, which required that the loan proposal be cleared by ArC,
NSC, NABARD and various levels of hierarchy in the commercial banks.
This was regarded as excessive bureaucracy, resulting in undue delays
and entailing relatively high consultancy fees;
(f) unwelcome technical scrutiny by NSC as it was regarded as giving a
public sector competitor inside knowledge;
(g) the poor quality of many proposals both technically and commercially;
and
(h) excessive delays by commercial Banks to process loans. Commercial
banks at branch level would sometimes take a year to consider an
approved loan proposal and after that refuse the smaller ones.
3.38    Normally the AFC was entrusted with the task of appraising the
proposals but their panel comprised an agronomist, an engineer and an
accountant, and lacked a commercial orientation. Of the three companies
finally participating - the most successful (and the largest) designed its



-20-
own proposal independently of AFC; one company is not operating the process-
ing plant it built because of legal action; and the other is in repayment
difficulties through a weakness in pursuing too narrow a product range.
NSP II Components
3.39    This section considers the implementation of the various components
under NSP II. Annex 6 (Table HI) summaries the actual component costs in the
project. Main increases in expenditure to date have been in Bihar and Rajas-
than States (with further significant expenditure anticipated in Karnataka)
and in the Buffer Stock component as explained previously. Lower expenditure
is shown by the SFCI Farm, to some extent by Uttar Pradesh, and with the
non-IDA assisted component of working capital for the SSC and AU (which in
the event had to be raised by these bodies as normal transactions with com-
mercial banks and has sometimes been inadequate). An explanation of
implementation progress is given below; reference should also be made to
Tables H2-H6 (Annex 6). The components are divided under 7 headings for
covenience.
3.40    (i) Breeder Seed Production.  The AU in each of the NSP II States,
Bihar, Karnataka, Orissa and Rajasthan, were to be as-sisted through ICA&
grants to set up breeder seed units. The CSAUAT at Kanpur and NDEPVK at
Faizabad, both in Uttar Pradesh, though included under NSP I were to be
absorbed as part of NSP II and receive additional support.
3.41    Expenditure has exceeded estimates, and in some cases is not yet
complete. This is partly because of the underestimates on the costs of
providing air conditioned storage with subsequent delays and consequent lack
of reserve stocks. It is also partly due to the fact that the AUs which were
to receive only limited assistance (Rajasthan and CSAUAT) embarked on full
programs (with ICAR support). The building in Orissa was constructed on the
farm at Gambharipalli but will now be used for foundation seed storage as the
equipment is being installed near the breeding program at the main campus of
Bhubaneshwar (some 350 km away).
3.42    The general comments made previously are again valid in respect of
the appropriateness of the equipment and the quality of the seed (para 3.11).
Some AU complain of indents not being honoured, leaving them with unpaid
stocks and some complain of very late establishment of indents.
3.43    (ii) Foundation Seed Production.  The project made provisions to
assist all the six universities covered in constructing seed processing
plants and developing farms (at two sites each in Karnataka, Orissa and
Rajasthan). Assistance was to be in the form of 25% grants (in lieu of
equity) with the balance as loans from commercial banks. The procedure and
problems have been as previously described with the additional problems of
working capital (para 3.12).
3.44    As regards the processing plants:
(a) Bihar followed the proposal though making some savings by using a
renovated rather than new building.



-21-
(b) Karnataka has completed two plants but the airconditioned stores are
still to be completed by USC. The large price escalation has been
due to delay and early underestimates of the cost of air conditioned
storage plants. State staff have expressed dissatisfaction with the
NSC delays and with the USC choice of machinery;
(c) Orissa decided that with the availability of its own breeder seed
processing plants and the plants of the SSC which would be con-
structed relatively near the farms, the component was unnecessary and
would certainly create an unwarranted financial risk (the decision
was probably justified);                    e
(d) Rajasthan decided that only one plant was justified and that it
should be as simple as possible both as regards building and plant
size, and so keeping investment costs (and size of loan) to a mini-
mum.  If necessary the SSC plants were to be used, but this could
prove to be difficult as the busy periods inevitably clash (however,
this decision was probably financially wise); and
(e) In Uttar Pradesh both CSAUAT and NDEPVK have proceeded along the
lines of the original proposals although NSC are only just completing
the plants. The delay has resulted in substantial price escalations
as a result of the NDEPVK farm being in an isolated location neces-
sitating the provision of housing and other amenities.
3.45    In respect of farm development:
(a) Bihar has completed its farm development but found the original cost
astimates inadequate. This was aggravated by procedural delays in
the number of agencies involved and because the 25% grant from GOI
via SFCI was not made available. Machinery was purchased locally
to avoid further delay. The farm runs at a profit but lacks indents
for foundation seed (008 is now investing in DOA farms for foundation
seed production) which will further affect the financial status of
the AU in this work.
(b) Karnataka has developed two farms but has problems with SFCI having
provided machinery which is not compatible with the locally purchased
tractors it eventually resorted to buying after the problems
experienced with the overseas purchases (para 3.14);
(c) Orissa took the 25% grant but thrught better of saddling itself with
a loan for the development of two farms and has relied on its own
budget resources. The farm near Cuttack, essential for potato and
groundnut work, was taken over by the Cuttack Development Corporation
after some expenditure had been incurred, for which the AU has yet to
be compensated. No replacement site has been located and the AU is
showing little enthusiasm for potato work (although keen to proceed
with groundnuts). The Cambharipalli farm needs further development;
in particular the threshing floor which is so poor that it has lead



-22-
the SSCA to threaten the rejection of foundation seed lots should be
improved;
(d) Rajasthan has developed two farms as proposed, price escalation being
due to delay and additional costs on developing one of the farms
which is on very sandy soil. Unfortunately for the AU, not only has
the demand for foundation seed proved less than expected because of
lower than anticipated certified seed demand but now SFCI has entered
production and the SSC is entering production on its own recently
acquired farms;
(e) CSAUAT (UP) has developed the farm though further expenditure on
boreholes is anticipted; and
(f) MDEPVK have created a farm in very difficult circumstances. The main
campus of this fairly new University was situated in a relatively
isolated and barren location on highly saline soils. The land allo-
cated to them for their farm is adjacent. The costs of development,
especially of a suitable irrigation system, have been much higher
than originally envisaged and together with investments in plant have
resulted in the University incurring a beavy loan repayment schedule.
Unfortunately yields on the still margi.- soils are improving only
slowly and as a result, at the foundation seed prices negotiated with
UPSSC, the farm is currently operating at a deficit. There are fears
of a deteriorating situation if adequate foundation seed indents are
not forthcoming as there are no other obvious enterprises for the
farm.
3.46    (iii) Seed Technology Research.  All six universities received assis-
tance for developing programs, funds being channelled through ICAR. This
component is treated with great importance by Universities and now all are
probably adequately equipped for basic work but most have expansion plans,
especially with regards to staff. Rajasthan managed to effect substantial
savings by using an existing building, but both the AUs in Uttar Pradesh
undertook full development programs rather than the very modest investments
proposed in the SAR. The matters previously discussed on appropriate
research and funding are relevant here also (para 3.16).
3.47    (iv) State Seed Corporations (S8C).  The project components regarding
the SSC were working capital (not an IDA financed component) and the provi-
sion of infrastructure in the form of headquarters buildings and processing
plants. These infrastructural components, to be financed largely through
loans from commercial banks, are considered below State by State. As in NSP
I, most of the SSCs are facing a financial crisis.
3.48    Bihar.  The SSC decided not to construct a new headquarters and
burden itself with a loan, but to manage in existing rented accommodation.
(There was apparently also some dispute about the best location for the HQ).
The processing and storage plants have been the source of many problems.
Firstly, the delays have caused cost escalations (the cold store for potatoes
is yet to be completed). More seriously the costs of the cold store were
very much underestimated and despite proposed savings by reducing the



-23-
air-conditioned part of the atore by 50X, cost escalations will still be
dramatic. It was found that the creation of only a single central store at
Kudra (in fact not centrally located) is resulting in major logistical
problems of distribution and substantial transport costs. The cereal plant
has already been modified in that the maize line has been relocated, but the
overriding problem now is that with a limited turnover and no assets
inherited from DOA or NSC, the Corporation is unable to generate profit (see
Annex 6, Table H 7) to repay the loans. To increase turnover will be dif-
ficult with the lack of new and popular varieties, the continued seed produc-
tion by DOA and competition from NSC and UPSSC who are also probably dumping
wheat seed. The situation is aggravated by the late payment for seed dis-
tributed by DOA.
3.49    Karnataka.  The new headquarters complex should be completed later
this year and the final cost will be above the SAR projection because of
delay, partially due to poor performance of some local building consultants,
slowness of PWD and the non-availability of cement for most of 1984.
Suitable tenants (such as SSCA) are being solicited in the hope of rent
offsetting some of the costs. The processing plants are still to be com-
pleted. The Chickballapur plant costs have been held close to estimate by
deleting the potato cold store, a crop which the SSC considers too risky
commercially to handle anyway (doubtless with justification). Subsequently,
two of the processing lines have been moved elsewhere as the success of
sericulture in the area has limited the potential for seed production. The
other plant was relocated and has experienced very major cost escalations
with expenditure still not complete. The escalation seems to be due to
original underestimation and subsequent delays. The SSC finds itself in a
similar situation (though possibly not so extreme) as that in Bihar with the
limited turnover producing insufficient income to repay the loans. The
position is similarly aggravated by the lack of new popular varieties and NSC
activities (but DOA production is minimal). The SSC also finds itself very
much dependent on its shareholder growers who demand high prices.
3.50    Orissa.  The new headquarters complex is complete but the renovation
of the groundnut and potato plant on the same site is still to be completed,
especially the installation and commissioning of equipment by NSC. Expendi-
ture has been kept within estimates with considerable savings having been
made by reducing the potato component. The plant is anticipated to be kept
busy supplying the groundnut seed required to implement government policy on
oilseeds. The other plant, at Bargarh, has been partially operating since
1983/84, but the airconditioned store is still to be completed. The escala-
tion in costs, despite some pruwing of the plant, is attributed to delays
arising from problems with land acquisition. The problem now is that there
have been changes in cropping patterns and supplies of seed for processing
are difficult to obtain. The SSC now anticipates only 50% utilization of the
new plant, as it also plans to continue to operate a small plant at Sambalpur
which is nearby. The financial position of the SSC is more favorable than
some others, largely as a result of GOS policy in subsidizing almost all seed
handled through DOA. DOA, either from its own production or that of SSC,
therefore has a virtual monopoly on seed distribution except for NSC handled
vegetable seeds. The SSC has, however, had problems with shareholder growers



-24-
demanding excessive prices. Alsa, as in other States, the current low turn-
over suggests that loan repayment could become a major problem.
3.51    Rajasthan.  A new headquarters complex has not been constructed but
some funds have been deposited towards a new building to house much of the
DOA and associated bodies. All three plants have been completed except for
minor works at Suratgarh and Sriganganagar. There has been a shift away from
maize production in the Kota area but some modifications are being made for
the plant to handle soya seed for a neighbouring project. However, there is
concern that seed demand has levelled out, at least temporarily, and the
plants will be seriously underutilized. The situation is further aggravated
by the fact that the SFCI has installed its own plants to clean the certified
seed produced for the SSC on the farm supported uider NSP II. (SFCI also
undertakes some of its own iarketing). The SSC Suratgarh plant was planned
to handle this production utld now stands largely idle. The SSC is in a
precarious financial position (Annex 6, Table H7) and will probably not be
able to meet loan repayments through internal cash generation.
3.52    Uttar Pradesh.  The SSC, with experience from its TDC heritage, did
not want to become burdened with more than minimal loans and decided to
manage in its existing headquarters complex, reduce the Pantnagar investment
to a level it could meet from its own funds and reduce the plants at Kanpur
and Faizabad to an absolute minimum (801 of production is near Pantnagar).
The start of these plants was delayed as the NSC appraisal considered the
plants to be financially unviable and spare equipment from Pantnagar was
temporarily used in rented premises. Both these plants are now nearing
completion and very significant cost savings have been accomplished.
However, the SSC still has more than adequate plant capacity for present
demand (though some lack of storage is evident). The present financial
position is not very good and loan repayment looms as a problem. The current
financial problems (Annex 6, Table H7) are attributed to: a large carryover
(some 55,000 t of wheat) produced at the behest of GOI who asked for produc-
tion to be doubled; continued seed production by DOA; competition from SFCI
and from NSC who are also burdened with surplus; and a subsidy policy in the
traditional markets of Bihar and West Bengal which discriminates against
imports from other States.
3.53    (v) SFCI Large Farm Development.  The SFCI farm at Suratgarh (Rajas-
than) was to be assisted with a comnercial bank loan of up to 701 of cos
(balance as GOI equity) to develop 4,000 ha for the production of certified
seed for RSSC. The lower than projected expenditure is due to the fact that
much of the irrigation work is still to be done and much of the farm
machinery was not obtained before the end of the project because of the
protracted discussion over tractor size and an irregularity in the ICB proce-
dure (para 3.14). However, a processing plant was established on the SFCI
farm, leaving the new adjacent RSSC plant redundant. Despite a heavy SFCI
involvement in producing foundation seed (not in line with NSP) financial
performance has been poor, as indicated below, with the recent improvement
probably being due to SFCI undertaking the marketing of its seed (see table
below). This component cannot be regarded as having been satisfactorily
executed.

grant, to SSCAp and autonomous bodies, to improve their service and to
similarly assist the Seed Testing Laboratories (STL) of G08 who have the
responsibility of analyzing certification and law enforcement (Seed Act)
samples.
3.56    The situation with SSCAs is as followss
(a) Bihar. The SSCA made substantial savings on investment costs, but
now lacks district offices.  It was projected to recoup operating
costs after the first two years but it has been GCO policy to hold
down fees and of late the SSC, the main customer, has ut back
production. The result is the accumulated loss from 1979/80 to
1984/85 of Rs 1,927,000 (Rs 656,000 in 1984/85). All staff are
deputed from DOA;
(b) Karnataka. Investments have been in line with SAR projections and
SSCA now lacks only 'grow out' test facilities. It has put emphasis
on speed of certification after harvest. No operating losses were
anticipated, but the average annual losses between 1978/79-1983/84
inclusive were Rs 176,000, though subsequently a breakeven situation
has pertained. An increasing number of staff (70X) are agency
employees;
(c) Orissa. The SSCA is small because of the limited demand for its
services and some small cost savings on investment have been
achieved. It was anticipated that the Agency would operate at a loss
for the first two years but this has continued and now revenue is
less than Rs 200,000 against costs of over Rs 1,000,000. This is due
to scattered DOA farms requiring a high staff:area ratio, tight
government control on fees and the reluctance of the DOA and SSC (the
only clients apart from the AU) to pay their bills (SSC on behalf of
growers from whom they collect the money);
(d) Rajasthan. The SSCA made some savings on investment costs. A small
operating loss was anticipated for the first year, but in fact the
Agency has run at a profit in all years except 1980/81; and



-26-
(e) Uttar Pradesh. The SSCA expended the total of funds available but
still requires more offices, laboratories and especially 'grow out'
facilities. It was not envisaged that this Agency would run at a
loss but in fact GOS treats it as a service and keeps fees low. A
profit was made in 1978/79 but subsequently up to 1984/85 inclusive,
losses have averaged Rs 887,000 per annum.
3.57    The position with the STLs is that most should be adequately equipped
having also received earlier assistance from USAID. However, conditions vary
with some, such as Bihar, being inadequately equipped and unable to repair
faults in equipment, whereas Orissa received extra funds and has a library
and conference room. Almost all want 'grow out' facilities. There are
widespread complaints that certification samples take too long to process and
a number of SSCA wish to develop their own laboratories. There seems a
distinct danger of dupli-ation of investment.
3.58    (vii) Technical Assistance Consultancies and Training.  This
component which assisted a number of project aspects may be divided into
Technical Assistance from outside the country, local consultancies, overseas
training and local training. The funds available under this component were,
however, fully utilized.
3.59    Technical assistance from outside the country was restricted to seed
technology research and combined with the same component in NSP I.
Originallyt local consultancies were planned to:
(a) assist the SSCA with certification procedures and was presumably
added to the hSC input under NSP I; and
(b) assist each of the SSC with marketing but this was not utilized by
all the States and seems to have had little impact.
In overseas training only four of the six universities managed to send can-
didates for advanced degrees in seed technology and there is some feeling
that shorter courses but for more people might be more useful; however, for
its purposes, ICAR appears to consider anything but a PhD course as short. A
member of each SSCA and STL also went on a study tour. Local training has
been given, mainly by NSC, to processing engineers and quality control
officers.

3.62    Supervision missions highlighted these issues and received various
assurances from concerned agencies. The most important breaches as regards
their adverse impact on the projects are considered to be:
(a) the failure of the NSC and SSC to come to terms, resulting in idle
capacity and waste of assets within the public sector;
(b) the apparent low priority and lack of urgency given to demand surveys
and marketing aspects.
IV. IMPACT
A. Incremental Output
NSP I
4.1     By completion the project was intended to benefit some three million
farm families, mainly by providing (a) 915,000 t additional cereal production
per annum; (b) 14,000 man years of work during crop harvest; and (c) creating
800 jobs in the SSC and SSCA. This last measure has probably been achieved
but the wider production impact has not. First, attention is drawn to the
key indicators of seed production (Annex 3). It may be seen that in all
states but Maharashtra, production is well below the SAR targets. Some of
the deficit has been made up by the NSC which, for example, distributed



-29-
49,000 t of wheat, 14,500 t of paddy and 11,400 t of 'hybrids' I/ over the
years 1980/81 and 1981/82. The 1980/81 incremental production from any of
the SSC's was with limited assistance from the Project, since none of the new
processing plants were in use at that time, and so arguabl7 only production
above that level should be attributed to the Project.
4.2     Therefore, state by state, the situation is:
(a) Andhra Pradesh shows a declining rerformai.. :e in production of seeds
for hybrids, but a large increase in paddy, a subsidized seed crop
with also some interstate demand. However, now production is tending
to outstrip demand. In any event the net impact of the project must
be considered to be relatively small. The groundnuts are handled
under contract to the DOA, few are certified and processing is mini-
ma;;
(b) Haryana shows an increase in wheat seed production of which it now
has a considerable carryover as has the NSC (which is still producing
despite the NSP guidelines). The modest increase in paddy seed
production has also outstripped demand. The net impact of the
Project has therefore been negligible;
(c) Maharashtra has shown a very marked increase in production of
hybrids, cotton, wheat and lesser seeds. However, wheat seed produc-
tion is likely to decrease to more evenly match demand and was never
intended to be a major crop, whilst the large increase in cotton has
resulted in a carryover equivalent to at least one year's demand.
The main project impact is therefore from the increased production of
hybrids which are partly marketed out of state (not through NSC as
the NSP had envisaged). The high production of 1982/83 did, never-
theless, result in a considerable over supply. 'Ae subsidized seed
production of oilseeds and pulses has increased, but production of
these seeds was not specifically mentioned in the SAR; and
(d) Punjab has fared very badly and little positive impact can be
attributed to the Project, as it now has significant carryovers,
especially of cotton and wheat, despite a considerably lower level of
production than envisaged.
4.3     Overall the main impact of the project must be gauged from the
incremental amount of seed which could be produced and marketed each year as
a result of the project by the four SSCs. In 1984/85 total production was
estimated to be - heat 28,400 t; paddy 9,000 t; hybrids 18,600 t; cotton
2,500 t; a total of 58,500 t (see Annex 3). This is an increase of about
21,000 t over the base year 1974/75, although only about 10,000 t over
1980/81, as against the SAR target of an incremental production of 76,000 t
and therefore the impact can only be around 33% of target (with some
allowance for change of crop mix). Of course an increase in lesser seeds,
1/ Maize, sorghum and bajra whether hybrid or not.



-30-
especially vegetables produced by NSC, and other components would also have
some impact, but these had already been anticipated in the SAR. On the
positive side, however, the installed capacity may enable a greatly increased
demand for seed to be met in the future and more importantly some construc-
tive elements of an overall institutional framework have been established.
NSP II
4.4     This project was intended to benefit about 1.35 million farm families
through supplying seed to increase annual production of cereals by 770,000 t,
potatoes by 40,000 t, groundnuts by 15,OOO t and other crops by 90,000 t.
Side benefits would be the creation of 13,500 manyears of personal employment
and 1,250 posts in SSCs and SSCAs. The latter has possibly been met, though
the major production impact has not as yet been achieved. The key indicators
of seed production (Annex 4) show all five states to be producing below the
SAR targets overall and for nearly all crop categories, although groundnuts
are close to targets due to a very large production in Karnataka (which had
not been envisaged), whilst cotton production is above target, partly through
unanticipated production in Karnataka. A case could be made for treating
1982/83 as the base year _or SSC production as project assistance was still
minimal with none of the new processing rlants being operative. To date
there has been little increase in prodaction ot3r that level and competition
from NSC and NSP I states has been a significant factor in some cases.
4.5     On an individual state basis the situation is as follows:
(a) Bihar has a total cereal seed production near that planned but this
is due to a very high production of paddy, whereas hybrids are well
below target and declining. Potato production is well short of
target and is also declining;
(b) Karnataka has reached a cereal seed production close to target; but as
in Bihar this is due to a heavy production of paddy whereas 'F.ybrid
production is declining. The anticipated production of potatoes has
not taken place, but as mentioned above groundnuts and to some extent
cotton have become important;
(c) Orissa remains well short of the target in paddy, potato and ground-
nuts with potatoes actually declining;
(d) Rajasthan is producing only ebout 33% of the overall target, but
cotton has become a major rather than a minor item; and
(e) Uttar Pradesh is producing well below target on all crops and has
not entered significantly into the planned production of potatoes
and groundnuts.
4.6     Overall project impact is best measured by the incremental seed
produced and distributed annually. Annual total production/distribution was
estimated in 1985/86 to be cereals 68,000 t, potatoes 6,000 t, groundnuts
4,500 t, cotton 1,500 t, others 4,500 t (see Annex 4). These values repre-
sent incremental production over the base year 1977/78 (or 1982/83 as



-31-
described in 4.4) of cereals 23,500 t (1,700 t), potatoes 3,900 t (decrease),
groundnuts 4,400 t (3,500 t), cotton 1,500 t (800 t) and others 3,200 t
(1,800 t). This compares with the SAR target (for incremental production)
of cereals 80,000 t, potatoes 31,000 t, groundnuts 4,700 t, cttton 200 t and
others 10,600 t. The SAR assumed 18,000 t increase (mainly cereals) would
occur from TDC irrespective of the Project, so project cereal increase
becomes 5,500 t as opposed to a target of 62,000 t. Total estimated
incremontal increase of all seed was therefore 18,500 t against a target of
108,500 t. A change in crop mix will distort figures but it is doubtful if
more than 20% of the anticipated impact has so far been achieved. Of course,
as before on the positive side, the capacity is now installed to handle a far
greater volume of seed when required and the institutional infrastructure has
been established.
B. Rates of Return
4.7     Due to delays in the implementation of the Project and a much slower
than anticipated increase in demand for certified seed, the financial and
economic rates of return under the two Projects are most certainly far below
the original estimates. Furthermore, given the continued uncertainty over
whether current excess capacity can be redirected to other remunerative use
(and duplication within the public sector seed industry reduced) and whether
demand and production will ever reach original estimates, it is extremely
speculative to try to estimate a revised Economic Rate of Return (ERR).
However, it would likely be below the opportunity cost of capital in India.
Some comments on the prevailing situation are given below.
Financial Returns
4.8     The SARs laid a basis for considering the financial aspects of the
following components: foundation seed production by Universities; perfor-
mance of the SSCs; performance of NSC; performance of SFCI and HLRDC; situa-
tion of certified seed growers; to which may be added the performance of the
SSCAs.
4.9     Foundation Seed Production by Universities.  As already described,
there is widespread uncertainty over whether sufficient indents will be
placed for foundation seed to make AU investments profitable. The situation
with Rajasthan and NDEPVK in particular is already critical and few if any
AUs, who have taken substantial loans, are in a position to repay them as
yet.
4.10    SSCS.  The plight of all the SSC has already been discussed.
Haryana, Punjab and probably Bihar are in critically poor situations and
Rajasthan, Karnataka and potentially Andhra Pradesh are at or near a crisis
point.
4.11    The NSC had four sources of revenue projected:  vegetable seed
production; interstate trade; consultancies; and administration of the buffer
stock scheme. These are discussed in more detail below:



-32-
(a) the vegetable seed component is probably financially viable, but the
nature of N3C records prevents verification of this;
(b) with regard to interstate trade, after early problems when the N8C
claimed to be failing to cover costs on a 5X margin for handling SSC
interstate trade, levels have risen to an extent to elicit complaints
from SSCs (over 25% quoted in some cases). However, since NSC now
handles mainly its own production and little of the SSCs' this item
is no longer a significant source of revenue; and
(c) total consultancy charges invoiced stand at Rs 16,096 thousand (a
number of service charges were probably hidden whilst down payments
for equipment were for investments), but the fees were apparently too
high for the willingness or ability of the recipients, as Rs 5,248
thousand remain outstandinge
4.12    SFCI.  SFCI has earned consultancy fees for designing large farm
development (AU in particular) and also from machinery procurement (some down
payments were invested and are yet to be returned to universities). The main
SFCI component is the development of three farms of which Hissar appears to
be financially successful to date, albeit by growing foundation rather than
certified seed, whereas Ladhowal and Suratagarh are running at a minimal
profit or at a loss. The HLRDC farm is financially sound. Overall the large
farms appear to be doing less well than projected though not giving the same
degree of cause for concern as the SSCs.
4.13    Certified Seed Growers.  In general the growers appear to be the
prime beneficiaries of the project, especially where shareholder growers
still predominate, as they have been able to dictate producer prices. Their
financial position must therefore be sound, although the costs of many inputs
have risen faster than the value of seed.
4.14    SSCA.  It had been anticipated that SSCA would, once established,
recoup operating costs from fees, but in Bihar, Maharashtra, Oriasa and Uttar
Pradesh, GOS policy has been to keep fees minimal despite large operating
losses, whereas a number of agencies, especially Haryana and Punjab are now
esperiencing problems and reduced operations. In general the SSCA pay no
fees to the STL for sample analysis.
4.15    In summary, therefore, the current financial situation of the two
major NSP components, AU farms and SSC is mediocre to poor whilst GOS policy
often dictates that SSCA should operate at a loss. Some minor NSP components
are more satisfactory and certified seed growers are probably very satisfied.
C. Economic Returns
4.16    As noted in 4.7 above, uncertainty about the outcome of several key
factors makes it extremely speculative to contemplate the eventual economic
benefits of the projects or their individual components. First, at
loan/credit closing the two projects were not fully completed (3.04-3.05 and
Annexes 1 & 2); though investment costs were running at about 8X over SAR



-33-
projections for NSP I and 112 over for NSP II (Annexes 5 & 6). It is uncer-
tain whether the projects will eventually be completed as originally
envisaged.  If completed, the estimated total investment costs are expected
to be about 18% over SAR projections for NSP I and about 512 over for NSP II
(Annexes 5 & 6).  Second, the expected benefits from the two projects began
to come on stream much later than originally anticipated and were also well
below the expected levels.  At loan/credit closing, even taking into account
the extensions granted (3 years for NSP I and 1 year for NSP II), full
development benefit levels h&d not been achieved and it is extremely uncer-
tain whether full development levels will ever be achieved. A further com-
plication in estimating project benefits arises as a result of the large
stocks being carried by the SSCs. SAR calculations were largely based on
the assumption that all certified seed produced by the SSCs will ultimately
result in increased crop production. In reality, due to the severe marketing
problems being faced by the SSCs this assumption is no longer totally valid.
Third, it is also extremely uncertain whether the projected yield increases,
particularly for the self pollinated varieties actually did occur on farmers'
fields. It seems clear that the marketing problems faced by the SSCs are due
mainly to the fact that their certified seed does not necessarily give sig-
nificantly higher yields than other seed used by the farmer (either retained
from an earlier crop or obtained from another farmer), particularly for self
pollinated varieties (6.4).
4.17    A reasonable evaluation of the situation is that impact is much
delayed from that which was originally projected and is probably little more
than one-third of that anticipated in NSP I and one-fifth for NSP II. The
eventual ERR are therefore likely to be much lower than the unusually high
returns predicted in the SAR at 65X and 158%, respectively. In this situa-
tion it is reasonable to expect the ERR from the two projects to be marginal
at best, and likely less than the opportunity cost of capital prevailing in
India (currently estimated to be about 10-12Z).
V. BANK PERFORNANCE
5.1     While many of the major problems were either foreseen in the SAR or
identified at a very early stage by supervision missions, hindsight suggests
that insufficient importance was given to certain aspects and inadequate
corrective action was taken over some problems.
5.2     The following were identified in the SAR as possible risks, which
did, in fact, materialize:
(a) the danger of a complex organizational 3tructure leading to delays in
implementation; and
(b) the possibility that seed demand might be lower than anticipated;
the SARs contain reference to the fact that even during the 1960's
(the main years of HYV release) demand grew rather more slowly than
expected resulting in an overproduction of seed.



-34-
On the other hand, in retrospect, the SAR did not adequately examine the
details of NSP and some of its implications. For instance, it was intended
that:
(a) each crop be produced by more than one SSC to ensure competition and
safeguard production. The assumption must therefore be that surplus
production was envisaged entailing carryovers and occasionally under
utilization of plant. The original NSP financial analyses considered
that since 80% of production costs were variable (at the level of
production specified) the rate of return was insensitive to sales
volume, but did not elaborate on problems of carryover and underutil-
ized plant at lower levels of production;
(b) the implications of seed being produced in compact areas by
shareholder growers were ignored particularly the possibility of such
a group becoming a powerful lobby for excessive producer prices
(ironically, the number of shareholders recruited has often been
below target), adding to the liquidity problems of the SSC; and
(c) breeder and foundation seed would be produced by AU (whereas this
would more normally be a commercial activity). In fact, the SAR
contended that breeder seed production should be the responsibility
of the original breeder. However, this would presumably mean that
the more successful the breeder the more time would be spent on
breeder seed production and less on plant breeding.
5.3     Overall, two aspects were possibly insufficiently covered:
-   the commercial nature of the main components of the Project.  This is
reflected in detail by the statement that 'SSC would be independent
in their price determination and establish prices which would cover
all fixed and variable costs and provide an adequate financial rate
of return on capital employed". In reality, however, the main deter-
minants of price were what the market would bear or GOS would allowt
which often proved less than what the SSC would have wished, and
which often also reflected GOS and other influences on SSC seed
production patterns which did not necessarily reflect real farmer
preferences. The lack of commercial accountability by SSC, NSC and
SFCI also contributed to the considerable duplication of investment
and lead to near anarchy in the public sector side of the seed
industry. It was, in retrospect, incorrect to assume that the ini-
tial success of TDC could be widely repeated.
-   definition of the term quality seed.  It was contended that to breed
new varieties is of little point if there is no seed multiplication
system to distribute them. Conversely, the success of the NSP
required, inter alia, a continuous flow of improved varieties which
could only come from an energetic and productive breeding program in
all crops. It was further intimated that many of the more recent
releases lacked the impetus of those of the 1960's. The Projects,



-35-
however, took no further account of the plant breeding aspects and so
could not influence the supply of the vital raw material - new
improved and attractive varieties. There has subsequently been a
rather loose interpretation of the term "quality seed" with the
demand being correctly equated with seed of high genetic potential of
interest to the grower (for self pollinated varieties such as wheat
and paddy, often meaning new varieties with improved potential)
whereas the quality seed supplied refers only to characteristics such
as genetic purity and good germination. The crucial difference is
apparently not widely appreciated.
Supervision Missions
5.4     In retrospect, there seems to have been far too few supervision
missions, especially when moderate problems were identified early on project.
For example, following the November 1977 mission, although a number of short
term missions were undertaken and the NSP II appraisal mission was in the
field, the next major supervision was not until 1979 and limited to NSP II
only. From 1981 onwards, despite all missions reporting at least moderate
problems, supervisions averaged no more than one a year, the last being in
1984, 6 months before loan completion on NSP I and 18 months before credit
completion on NSP II.
5.5     The 1979 mission was crucial in that it followed the vital meeting of
the PMMC at which the SSCs agreed to go ahead with specific parts of the
planned investment. The mission found however, that matters were still
unsatisfactory and recomended amongst other things:
(a) early resolution at highest possible levels among the agencies con-
cerned on steps neoded to ameliorate the problems related to:
-   increased seed production by NSC instead of phasing out as
envisaged under the National Seed Program;
- misunderstandings on the roles of NBC and SSC in marketing of
cereal seed procured by NSC for interstate trade, within the
territory of producing States;
- offering of unremunerative prices by NSC to SSC for certified
seed intended for interstate marketing;
- alleged haphazard allocation by NSC to SSC of certified seed
production for interstate trade; and
- sharing of foundation seed in short supply between the par-
ticipating corporations.
(b) early appointment by NSC of the processing and marketing consultants.
If the fact that little or no progress had been made on assessing seed demand
as required as a condition or covenant under both Projects, is added to point
(b), it could be seen that problems were reaching critical proportions.



-3':o -
Perhaps disbursement should have been withheld until these matters had been
resolved since little substantive expenditure had yet been incurred by the
participants and, in the event, the circumstances were calling into question
the basis for the size and scope of the investments planned.
5.6     Subsequent missions identified and highlighted both the persistent
and new problems affecting the Projects but little remedial action was taken
on major issues, although following upon the 1979 visit, the next mission was
able to report a great improvement in the workings of the PMKC. The lack of
progress on the marketing and seed demand aspects was particularly unfor-
tunate given the major capital investment being committed. More attention
should also have been given by both GOI and the Bank to the underlying deci-
sion-making procedures which enabled NSC to create additional processing
plants in competition with the SSC and which resulted in unnecessarily large,
and in cases inadequately directed commitment of public sector resources in
the seed industry.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
Analysis of the Problems
6.1    The major problems may be divided into three closely interrelated
groups:  delayed implementation; inadequate analysis of seed demand; and
inadequate and incomplete consensus on the overall institutional and policy
framework for the viable long-term development of the seed industry (as
evidenced by the current financial predicament of some of the implementing
agencies).
6.2     Delayed Implementation,  Much of this has been attributed to the
rather complex organizational arrangements for implementation of the project
and is closely related to the third of the three problems noted in 6.1 above.
However, weaknesses in start-up management per se have doubtlessly been the
major cause of problems in the breeder seed and foundation seed components;
the ICAR experienced procedural difficulties and the AU encountered problems
in negotiating loans and acquiring farm land. The problem was aggravated by
the lack of experience by the agencies in handling any such component in the
past.
6.3    However, in the case of the SSC component, the unsettled matters of
the overall institutional framework and the respective roles o' the States
and the Center were critical. The situation was reflected in '.ne commercial
rivalry and duplication of public sector investments. The SSC were therefore
reluctant to proceed with the investments, especially where (as in Haryana
and Punjab in particular), they would be very dependent upon NSC handling
their programmed inter-state production, since internal state demand would
only account for a small part of their capacity. They eventually proceeded
on assurances that could not be fulfilled. Apparently, the Project Manage-
ment and Monitoring Committee (PMMC) was not vested with enough pow--r to
adequately coordinate the public agencies participating in the Projects.
Since these agencies also lacked real commercial accountability, competition
proved costly.



-37-
6.4     Understanding of the Emerging Seed Market.  As far as the SSC are
concerned, lower demand for their product may be attributed to three main
causes.   Firstly, there was a lack of popular new varieties.  This was
especially true in the self pollinated crops which currently account for the
vast majority of the SSCs overall production. Some individual SSC such as
Maharashtra are rather less dependent on these crops. Once the farmer has
obtained seed of an HYV, he is often able to produce his own seed, at least
for several generations, of near equal quality to certified seed on offer.
Such few trials as have been done rarely use a fair comparison but even so,
show very little difference in yield from farm produced and certified seed of
many pulses and only fairly modest gains in cereals. Further, the better
farmers will supply their neighbors, and a number of certified seed growers
will withhold some seed anyway. However, the regular release of distinctly
improved varieties will stimulate the market as farmers seek to replace the
existing variety. With hybrids the seed should be replaced each season, but
superior varieties will again corner the market.
6.5     Secondly, in the light of the above, the government estimates on the
purchase of seed for replacement by farmers were too optimistic but there is
a further and probably more important influence. Suppose a farmer does wish
to meet the objective of replacing self pollinated cereal seed every fifth
season (i.e., the 201 replacement rate proposal). Rather than replace all
his seed every fifth year or 201 of his seed every year (making his seed on
an average two years away from being certified), he is more likely to mul-
tiply his seed. For instance, if seed multiplication rate for wheat is taken
as twenty, he could purchase just a percentage of his seed every year, mul-
tiply once and plant all his crop to second generation seed in the subsequent
year. In practice this principle is doubtless followed, substantially reduc-
ing certified seed requirement.
6.6     Thirdly, the 88C suffer from competition by NSC, SFCI and sometimes
DOA (all undermining the NSP principle of well-defined public sector roles)
and the private sector. The latter not only compete with varieties but their
public variety certified seed is frequently cited as being of better quality
and often cheaper. The quality aspect is possible with regard to field
performance as this is sometimes determined by vigour, a quality enhanced by
good production and handling techniques but not controlled by certification.
Lower prices may be a result of greater flexibility in the market, greater
efficiency, and less fixed investment in large plant and machinery.
6.7     It is pertinent to examine further why NSC continues in production.
Apart from commercial profit considerations, two further important reasons
are put forward by NSC:
(a) the intended producing States, more particularly Haryana and Punjab,
are not ecologically suited to producing some of the varieties
required in the consuming States such as West Bengal and Assam; and



-38-
(b) supply cannot be guaranteed as GOS will first consider State require-
ments and have a history of preventing exports during shortage. In
its increased activities in breeder and foundation seed production,
NSC received GOI support. (See also borrowers comaents in Annex 7.)
6.8     The Results of Unsatisfactorily Defined Roles and Policies.  In
addition to the low demand and turnover discussed above, which is obviously
a major factor affecting the 5SC and the foundation seed production by AU,
there &re a number of other equally important factors which have emerged as
contributors to and reflections of an inadequate overall institutional
framework in the industry. It is instructive to consider five aspects
affecting the SSC.
6.9     Firstly, many of the SSC now have relatively large plants aimed at
producing large quantities of notoriously low margin certified paddy and
wheat seed. The private seed sector (as opposed to traders) takes little
interest in these crops (apparently, in part, because some of the public
sector companies have been able to continue to operate only with considerable
Government financial backing). The creation of the capacity well before
comparable generation of demand has resulted in excess ovetheads. The con-
centration on certified seed has left little flexibility in the quality of
crop handled. The SAR suggested that only 20-25% of the seed need be dressed
initially, the rest having chemicals applied later if required, ignoring the
fact that certification requires that seed be sealed after processing thereby
making subsequent dressing near impossible. Since there is little commercial
grain demand for carryover or deteriorated seed stocks once treated, little
seed is in fact treated making it even less attractive to the farmer.
6.10    Secondly, the breeder and foundation seed generation would more
commonly be regarded as of greater commercial importance to the genuine seed
producing organization than the certified seed generation. In the case of
an SSC, such responsibility would allow it greater commercial flexibility
and influence over the quality of these generations so important to it. If
SSC were to take control of the breeder and foundation seed production, this
would remove the financial and managerial burden from the AUs.
6.11    Thirdly, the crop range handled by the SSC is too limited with the
potentially highly profitable vegetable seed production having been assumed
(under the Projects) to be under the domain (at least insofar as the public
sector was concerned) of NBC. Hybrid and sometimes variety cotton, hybrid or
composite cereals and gram are about the only regular profit earners and even
gram is dependent upon seasonal increases.
6.12    Fourthly, GOS policies frequently influence profit margins by price
fixing (whereas a pricing policy differentiating between varieties, etc., is
required) or forcing the SSC into uncommercial production ventures without
recompense. Of course, a high degree of direct or indirect subsidy also
supports many SSCs.
6.13    Finally, the SSC themselves frequently show limited commercial aware-
ness with but scant attention having been given to marketing and sales, with



-39-
reliance being put on DOA and Cooperative distribution networks. The com-
position of the Board and senior staff must be questioned in that as able
as they may be they are almost invariably taken from government service and
not chosen on the grounds of business acumen.
Conclusions
6.14    The Projects have created infrastructure and ample capacity to meet
likely seed demand over the next few years. Howeverp it is likely that some
of the processing plants are not satisfactorily located geographically or
ecologically. Also the existing spare capacity is under the control of State
agencies who may not always be aware of or able to fulfill national require-
ments. While the projects have not succeeded in generating the economic
returns forecast at appraisal, they have helped GOI identify a number of key
issues in the definition of the policies and institutional framework govern-
ing public sector performance in India's important seed industry. The
process has set in motion a major initiative by GOI and the states to ration-
alize and improve the efficiency of the industry in responding to farmers'
emerging needs.

BORROWERS COMMEN1TS ON DRAFT REPORT
Sub:    Comments on the Project Completion Report:
India-First and Second National Seeds Projects
NSP I & II (Loan 1273-IN and Credit 816-IN)_
(a)     Delayed impleme-tation brought about the organizational constraints
and probably more fundamentally as a result of lack of an adequately
clear delineation of roles or sufficient commercial orientation of
the SSCs and the NSC.
Comments:
NSP being a multi-agency multi-state and multi-component project.
organizational constraints in one form or the other were bound to
occur. There was no single line control on Project implementation
for all the agencies. The Government of India had to move through
the respective State Governments and ICAR for the implementation of
the components in more than 50 implementing agencies. Lack of han-
dling such a complex project and initial rivalry between NSC and 8SCs
were the main reasons for the slow progress in project implementa-
tion. But following the resolving of the monitoring problems in the
year 1981-82 when Government of India set-up State level project
monitoring bodies under the Chairmanship of the concerned Secretary
(Agri.)/APC. the project implementation gathered momentum and all the
participating agencies implemented the Project.  It is true t .at
there was initial rivalry between NSC and SSCs but the same was
expected. It is also true that SSCs were slow in making investments
in the earlier years because they were not sure of seed demand in the
initial stages. However, in a meeting of the PZMMC held in August
'79. detailed year-wise, crop-wise production projections in SSC8 and
NSC were formulated and mutually accepted. Following this meeting
the Project moved towards implementation and the respective roles of
NSC and SSCs also got clearly defined. Because of the inherent
commercial interests, there have been allegations and
counter-allegations from all the parties but that is a part of the
game in such a complex project with large number of participating
agencies with conflicting commercial interests.
(b)     inadequate understanding of the emerging seed market and slower than
expected demand for seed reflecting both the fact that many varieties
being developed by the plant breeding program in the country did not
meet farmer requirements and also the fact that original estimates of
seed replacement rates were overly optimistic. The effects (on
corporation viability) of the lower effective demand were in some
respects compounded by NSC continuing to produce certified seed. NSC
deemed this necessary partly as past experience had shown some reluc-
tance of states to release seed for contracted inter-state trade
during time of shortage.

Comments:
This observation is correct because major seed producing agencies
for low-cost high-volume self-pollinated crops in Punjab. Haryana
and U.P. and Rajasthan, which have dry climates and where the farmers
are able to retain their own seeds for future multiplication, had to
carry large quantities of wheat and paddy seeds in the last two years
of the Project. Decade old varieties still hold the ground. Unless
varietal break-through is achieved periodically and existing
varieties are replaced every 4th/5th year. farmers of these regions
generally would not go in for regular procurement of certif ed seed,
'The Bank has also decried the impact of NSP I and II saying that
incremental seed distribution (having met allowance for carry-over)
in NSP I reached only 23,800 MTs p.a. as against the target of
76,000 Mrs and in NSP II only 18,500 MT8 against a target of 108,500
sT. 'the Bank feels that the overall impact of the Project is to the
tune of 23X and 20S respectively. It has, however, been conceded
that capacity has been installed to deal with much larger demands in
future.
We are not sure as to from where the Bank has obtained the above
referred figures of seed distribution. The distribution figures for
the final year of the project i.e. 1984-85 for Phase I States on the
basis of information furnished to the bank from time to time through
the quarterly progress reports was as under:-
(Lakh Qtls.)
APSSDC                               1.52
HSDC                                 1.88
NSSC                                2.13
RSSC                                 1.23
6.76*
Similar information for NSP I for the year 1985-86 is as under:-
(Lakh Qtls.)
BRBN                                 1.20
KSSC                                 0.45
USSC                                0.57
RSSC                                 1.05
UPS & TDC                           3.51
6378'
* Crop-vise details appended as annex.
It may be added that NSCs figures for the two years should also be
added because NSC had also developed seed processing/storage
facilities during the project period were as under:-

(Lekh Qtls.)
1984-85             1985-86
NSC             3.77                 3.83
It may thus be seen that even without adding NSC'a figures, seed
distribution for Phase-I agencies were 671800 tons against the target
76,000 We and for iase-I1 the sales figures was 67.800 MT1s against
1.08 lakh Me. However, in case NSC's figures are added, seed dis-
tribution for NSe I states for the said year comes to 105,500 MTo
against the target of 76,000 ITs and for NSP II it was 106,100 M'W
against 108,500 Mrs,8
Eurther, it may also be pointed out that there appears to be some
mistake about the targets for NSP II.  The targets for Phase-II
states as indicated in 'table 5 of Appendix 13 of the SAR, are 9.14
lakh qtls. and not 10.80 lakh qtls. as is evident from the following
relevant extract:-
(Lakh Qtls.)
State        Wheat     Paddy    Maise    Jowar   Bajra    Total
Rajasthan    0.93       -        0.08       -      0.13     1.14
U.P.         1.90      0.39       0.06             0.03     2.38
riaiar       2.20      0.45       0.60      -       -       3.25
Orissa       0.48      0.80        -        -       -       1.28
Karnataka     _        0.15       0.11     0.7±    0.08      1.09
Total     5.51      1.79.    0.85       0.75    0.24     9.24
It may thus be seen that we have to evaluate the impact against the
above targets and not 10.80 lakh qtls. for Phase-II. In addition,
these SSCb also haIdled considerable quantities of seed of other
crops. TXhe picture may. therefore. be adjudged from the following
table:-

The impact of seed distribution compare quite favourable to the
figures arrived at by the World Bank. This may kindly be pointed
out to the Bank suitably.
(c)     financial problems which may be attributed not only to low turnover
but in the case of SSCs to pricing policies and lack of business
expertise within some SSCs.
Comments:
It may be seen from the above that the sales turnover of the SSC8
was not as 1ow as has been made out. As regards pricing policy, the
Govt. of India has since taken a liberal stance. SSCs and NSC have
been allowed to determine their seed prices independently and the
same are related to the market forces. As regards lack of business
expertise it may be mentioned that SSCs have since gathered suffi-
cient marketing experience and except for one or two organizations
they posses necessary expertise.

Comments on the Various Points Raised by the World Bank
No.   Points Raised by WoLld Bank                       Comments
1.   NSC did not comply with the         As envisaged under NSP. NSC started
provision of agreement where       phasing out its certified seed produc-
NSC was to phase out of seed       tion programs after having offered
production (except vegetable      infrastructure facilities to SSCs in
seeds) as SSCs developed pro-      the year 1974.  Production program has
duction ability and to mako       been brought down to the level of only
the SSC in each State. a sole     2.51 lakh qtls during the year 1976-77
distributor of seed produced      against 7.51 lakh qtls during the-year
by other SSC8.                     1974-75.- Production of certified seed
of NSC up to the year 1980-81 was



69-                      ANNU 7
Page 7-
fluctuating around 4 lakh qtls.
including pulses and oilseeds.
The period between 1976-77 and 1980-81
when NSC was phasing out-certified seed
production program and handing over the
infrastructure facilities to SSCs was
very critical. Most of the consuming
states like Assam, West Bengal. Bihar.
Maharashtra could not get the required
quantities of seeds from NSC. Otw of
the important reasons for those short-
ages was that the state seed corpors-
tions would not implement full procuction
progrm offered by NBC and even if pro-
gram was Implemented. the comitted
quantities were not handed over to NSC
because the demand went up within the
state itself and state Govt. did not
permit SSCs to supply seeds to NSC.
This resulted in non-fulfillmtent of the
commitment in the states who were com-
pletely dependent on NSC for their
internal requirement. It was also
observed that some of the 6SC did not
supply committed quantities to NSC and
instead enter into interstate marketing
against the concept of NSP. SSCs had
also appointed dealers outside the state
to take up interstate marketing, and
thus the whole discipline of NSP was
disturbed.
It was not only the problem of supplying
seeds to NSC after accepting the produc-
tion program but also there were problems
in accepting production program. The
jroducing 8SCs were interested in
accepting only the programs which were
more remunerative and remaining program
were left to NBC e.g. in case of maize
the production program of composite
-warieties were not accepted, even in
hybrids only the higb yielding varieties
were accepted. In self-pollinated crops
like paddy also varieties like Jaya and
IR-8 were preferred while production pro-
grams of varieties like Puss-2-21 and
Ratna were not accepted. Similar situa-
tion was observed in other crops also
like wheat. sorghum and bajra. NSC was
also not in a position to organize pro-
duction program of non-remunerative



-70-                      ANNEX 7
Page 8-
varieties because best production areas
have been included under the project
areas and seed growers wanted production
program of both remunerative and nonr
remunerative varieties together.
It was envisaged under NSP that NSC
would concentrate on production program
of vegetable. pulses and oilseeds and
NSC started sincere efforts on these
crops, some of the SSCs al80 started
producing vegetable seeds not only in
tueir states but also outside the
state. Although NSP provided that the
state government will not produce
procure and distribute seeds directly
to other states but some of the state
governments not only supplied seeds but
also floated tenders and purchased
seeds from private agencies outside
the state.
In view of the above situation, it was
felt by the Government of India that
NSC may start direct production of
certified seed through contract growers
and accordingly the production program
was started by NSC and infrastructural
facilities were again revitalized.
2.    Offer of unremunerative            'Xhe services agency system of producing
price of NSC to SSCs for           and distributing certified seed for
certified seeds intended           interstate marketing as envisaged under
for interstate marketing.          NSP could not be implemented success-
Haphazard allocatiou by NSC        fully due to various reasons including
to S<^'& for certified seeds       those stated above.  Similarly four-
production for interstate          party agreement which was the basis of
trade.                             organizing production program by SSCs
and its interstate marketing by NSC was
also not executed/implemented uniformly.
This is also not correct that the pro-
cduction programs were offered to SSCs
on non-remunerative procurement prices.
Actually the procurement prices were
fixed by negotiations between two
organizations and wherever dispute had
been observed the matter was referred
to Government of India and Additional
Secretary/Dy.Secy. (Seeds) or Director,
Seed Division heard the arguments of
both the organizations and decided the
procurement prices. Actually this is
not the question of giving low pro-



- 71 -                     ANNEX 7
Page 9-
curement prices, because the parallel
prices were offered by NSC to its
contract growers also, the SSCs in fact
prefer to sell the seed directly in the
interstate marketing rather than giving
it to NSC against the principle of NSP.
Even in cases where the difference
between price margin given by NSC and
that demanded by SSCs was as low as
Rs 5 per qtl the decision of Arbitrator
has also not been accepted by SSCs in
some cases.
3.    Delay in recruiting the            In this connection, it may be stated that
senior level executives of         although NSP-I & II became effective in
NSC'u engineering and project      October, 1976 and December* 1978 respec-
Implementation Cell.               tively, formal Cabinet approval for
NSP Phase I came in September. 1977.
Further NSC was assigned specific-role
of moeal agency only after kl31C came
into existence. However, as soon as the
role of modal agency was assigned to
NSC, the NSP work was taken up by the
concerned divisions of the Corporation,
with the help of available staff. As
soon as the workload increased. it was
felt necessary to have a separate NSM
Cell to exclusively look after this
work on behalf of GOI and subsequently
officers of various levels were identi-
fied and a separate NSP Cell to exclu-
sively look after this work on behalf
of GOI and subsequently officers of
various levels were identified and a
separate NSP Cell was formed in the
Corporation.
There was some delay in recruiting the
required engineering personnel to take up
the appraisal/consultancy work under NSP
as the interested SSCs/AUs/ICAR institutes
took their own time to appoint NSC as the
consultant for taking up establishment of
various project components under NSP I &
II on consultancy basis. This affectea
the estimation of the total workload to
decide the requir-ements of engineering
personnel to take up the project work on
long-term basis. Further as some of the
posts advertised by NSC were for fixed
period, well established, qualified and
experienced engineering personnel did not
feel interested to leave their regular jobs
to take up shorr-teru, appointments in NSC.



-72 -                      ANMKX 7
Page 10
As such 8ame of the engineeridng personnel
were taken on deputation fro other Govt.
Departments/oranizations but they also
preferred to leave the Corporation as and
when they got regular pramotions to our
parent organizations. However, due to our
continued efforts by the time NSP gained
momentum NSC had recruited the required
engineering personnel for taking Up con-
sultancy work most of which have since
been successfully completed under the
project.
4.   'Jhe design of plant was            Under NSP I & II, seed processing capacity
satisfactory though some          was to be augpented on such a large scale
problems emerged in the use        in the country for the first time. As
of locally-manufactured            such keeping in view the operational
equipment.  Tlhe design incor-     simplicity effective supervisions and
porated the use of several         economic factors "Single Store.ed/Linear
V.B. Elevators which                lon" plant design incorporating several
frequently proved to be           V.B. Elevators was adopted instead of
difficult to clean with the        sophisticated klmultistorey Vertical Flowr'
particular model being used        system.  Initidl cost of single storeyed
apparently designed more for       buildings is relatively less and
bulk grain rather than seed.       installation/replacement/maintenance/
repairs or processing equipment is easier
as compared to multi-storeyed plants.
Regarding quality of V.B. Blevators, it
may be mentioned that elevators procured
under NSP are equipped with self-
cleaning type buckets, easily removable
slide gates in the 'V' bottom boot
assembly for easy and fast cleaning of
elevators required for handling of
"Seeds", 2%ese V.B. Elevators have been
manufactured locally on the design of
elevators received under USAID program
for handling seeds. As such it is not
correct to say that these are not
suitable for bulk seed handling.
5.    Processing plants established      The primary objective of seed processing
under NSP are not being            is to clean and grade seed lots which
cleaned between the lots of        confirm  to prescribed field stndards
the same variety which can        for genetic purity and identify of a
make mockery of the continued      variety.  Under NSP, high capacity
certification of the indivi-       processing plants have been installed
duel lots when 200 kg of a        wich a view to undertake cleaning and
200 kg lots is retained in         grading of big size seed lots of the
the system.                        same variety in quick succession and
cleaning of the machine after the change
of individual lot is time consuming and
may not be desirable. It is further



73                         ANN  7
Page 11
clarified that the final certification
of the seed lot is undertaken only after
getting report for seed standards fran
the seed Testing Laboratory and there-
fore, the procedure being followed cannot
be said to be mockery of the continued
certification., even when some quantity of
the different seed lots of the same variety
is retained in the system.
6.    Vegetable seed processing           It may be mentioned that NSC is maintaining

viability of our Vegetable seed operations.
Whatever, records were sought by World Bank,
the required information was made available
by the Corporation promptly.
7.    Cotton seed processing plant        Commissioning of cottonseed processing
of MSSC were not commissioued      plants of MSSC was delayed due to initial
until 1986.                        delay on the part of MSSC in selecting the
acid delinting technology for their plants.
Decision about selection of acid delinting
processing was taken by MSSC as late as in
1983. 'This was followed up with prepara-
t.ion of specifications for equipmen'
tendering and procurement. Both these
plants were commissioned in 1986.
8.    Employment of consultants           It may be mencioned that GOI had
for Seed Certification was         appointed NSC as consultants in March,
to be done before 12.31.78.        1979 to render seed certification
It has been mentioned that         consultancy services to CSCB for NSP
the report of certification        Phase I states.  Tshe seet  certification
consultants (NBC) was              consultancy report was submitted by NSC
approved in 1986.                  as early as 9/19/80.  Thereafter GOI
had invited comments on report from
various SSCs, SSUAs and later referred
the report along with their comments to
a committee headed by Dr. K.S. Gill,
Director (Research), PAU Ludhiana in
August, 1984. Ihe report was finally
approved by GOI in Nov.1985. Since the
report consisted of various operational
procedures to be adopted for implementa-
tion, consultation of concerned agencies
took more time which was inevitable.
9.   Audit accounts and finan-            It may be mentioned that NSC is

related reports were to be         provisions contained in the Companies

each year.  ?ut the audit          before the shareholders in the AGM
completion took much longer        within 6 months of the close of finan-
than the stipulated period.        cial year.  The Department of Companies
Law Affairs can further extend the
period for presentation of the accounts.
Accounts of NSC like other public sector
undertakings are also being audited by
the GOI as well as the Controller of
Audit General of India before the same
are adopted in the AGM. It may be men-
tioned that there have been actually no
delay oa the part of NSC in preparation
and presentation of annual accounts.
In fact the period prescribed under the
Companies Act and the period mentioned
in agreement signed with the World Bank
are not uniform. The annual accounts
have been prepared and furnished by the
Corporation within the statutory provi-
sions and there have never been any
infringements of the Act so far.
10.   Transit seed stores com-           Under NSP I and II provision existea
-   ponent was revised and              for construction of 69 bulk and transit
delayed to the extent taat         seed stores by CIC/MSWs with a total
some of the godowvs are yet        capacity of 4.55 lakh qtls at an
to be completed which has          estimated cost of Rs 284 lakhs.  As both
resulted in inevitable cost        CWC and SWCs expressed their inability
escalation.                        to construct the envisaged storage
capacity, a decision was taken by GOI
in PMMC meeting in March. 1979. to allow
NSC and SSCs to create required storage
capacity under the Project. As per the
decision. NSC was to construct 2,225
lakh qtls storage capacity at 26 loca-
tions. Of these, transit stores at
24 locations (2,025 lakh qtls cap.)
have already been completed and work at
remaining 2 locations namely Bharatpur
and Agra is also expected to be completed
by October, 1987. Construction of
transit seed stores have been delayed
beyond the closing date of 12/31/84,
due to following reasons:
i) Decision to construct transit seed
stores by NSC in place of CWC/SWCs
was taken at a late date in
March, 1979.



75-                      AN-  7
Page 13
ii) Lot of difficulties vere faced in
identifying/acquisition of land
from the local authorities for
constructing seed godownas.
iii) During the progress of work some
contractual problems cropped up
which further delayed the com-
pletion of seed godowns.
iv) 'there was also some delay in
getting sanction of the required
funds for implementing this
component.
v) Since iuception of NSP and during
the current of this project period,
upward revision in cost occur red
due to general rise in price index
for various inputs relevant to
construction works.
11.   There is a widespread feeling      Under NS? I and II high capacity seed
that standard 5,000 tons          processing plant module of 5,000/104000
plants are too large.            MkT were established based on the expe-
rience gained while implementing Terai
Seed Project in UP State with World Bank
assistance. However, as the compact
area approach for organizing seed pro-
duction and establishment of seed pro-
cessing plants did not work under NSP
Phase I and II for various reasons,
some of the seed processing plants estab-
lished under the project look somewhat
larger in the changed cirrumstancese
However, keeping in view the experience
gained under NSP Phase I and II. size
of optimum seeu processing plant
modules proposed to be established under
NSP III have been considered are of
1,000/2,000/3,000 tons capacity except
few locations where medium capacity
plants of 5,000 tons (in temns of wheat)
have been considered to be economically
justified.
12.   Total consultancy charges,         It may be mentioned that NSC's consul-
invoices stand at Re 160.96        tancy charges are very nominal and quite
lakhs but NSC's fees were          comparable to other piblic sector com-
apparently too high for            panies especially keeping in view the
the willingness and ability        remote locations where seed processing
of the recipients and              plants were to be established umder the
Rs 52.48 lakhs remained            Project.  Moreover, the consultancy
outstanding.                       charges were finalized by our Board of

collecting data from other public sector
organizations engaged in stitable
similar project works.
13.   Two vegetable seed process-        NSC was to have two packaging lines at
ing plants for NSC were to         Agra and Hyderabad under NSF-I as per
have packaging lines but           recommendations made by Mr. O.C. Barker
these are yet to be                appointed under NSP I.  As procurement
installed.                         of the automatic packaging lines as
suggested by Mr. Barker was got delayed,
NBC had gone ahead with the procurement
of local heat sealers for mechanizing
packaging of vegetable seeds. Further
due to delay in execution of related
civil work*, procurement of packaging
equipment was deferred and is proposed
to be procured under NSP III.
14.   Delay in appraisal of              As far as NSC is concerned, there was no
foundation seed processing         d4elay in appraisal of proposals received
plant proposals of AUs.            from AUs for creating foundation seed
procesiuing facilities under NSP I and II.
Harever, as AUs were not Living the
r-quired expertise in preparation of
detailed Techno-Economic Eeasibility
Reports, some of them chose to entrust
the work of preparation of detailed
reports to NBC on consultancy basis.
While certain universities did not avail
of NSC's consultancy services and pre-
pared the reports themselves for NSC's
appraisal. As such the aelay in
appraisal of some of the foundation seed
processing plant proposals by NSC was on
account of delay in finalization and
submission of proposals by AUs who had
to revise their proposals number of times
due to lack of required expertise avail-
able with them for such specialized job.
15.   Regarding foundation seed          'there has been no delay on the past of
processing plants there            NSC in designing/commissioning of foun-

plant of OSSC at Bhudneshuar       OSSC has been delayed because of delay
is still to be completed           in procurement of specialized convey-

tencers. PerY*cmance of Inclined Belt
Conveyor procured on trial basis has
now been assessed and it is expected
that the required equipment will be
procured and plant fully commissioned
by the end of this year.
17.  Bargarh plant of OSSC has           Initially OSSC while appointing NSC as
been partially operated in         its consultant hae entrusted the work
1983-84 but the AC store           of establishment of Bargarh plant on
is still to be completed.          "Turnkey basis' including AC seed
store. Subsequently, OSSC decided not
to proceed with the construction of
AC seed store at Bargsrh and accord-
ingly asked NSC to drop this component.
Accordingly. NSC after completing the
civil construction work did not proceed
with the air-conditioning works at
Bargarh.
18.   NSC's delay has resulted            It may be mentioned that NDUAT had
in substantial price               decided to establish seed processing
escalation in case of              plant complex in a very remote area
NDUAT's processing plant.          with very poor communications.  As a
result, very few contractors came
forward to take up the civil construc-
tions works/air-conditioning works.
In case of civil works. NSC had
rescinded the work as the contractor
had adopted delay tactics and no
contractor came forward to take up ie
balance work which haa been undertaken
departmentally and completed. Diffi-
culties were experienced in the case
of AC work also where NSC could not
finalize the contract on account of
poor response from the bidders. Even
now only one part has quoted against
our AC works tender and the same is
under consioeration whether we would
award the work on the basis of single
quotation basis as other parties have
not shown interest in the work because
of remote location of the seed process-
ing complex. Delay in completion of
NDUAT's Faizabad plant was to some
extent responsible for upward revision
or total project outlay at NDUAT.
Yaizabad.
19.   Ezpeaditure on air conditioned    As per World Bank's appraisal report AC
seed store has exceeded the        works for JiSPUs were to be taken up
estimates and the works at         by NSC on consultancy basis.  As AUs/ICAR

most of the places is               institutes did not approach NSC till 1980
still to be completed.             for undertaking the air-conditioning
works, decision was taken in a meeting
held under the chairmanship of DG, ICAR
on 1/11/80 that air-conditioning and
dehumidification equipment for BSPUs
might be purchased by the concerned AUs
to suit the requirements of their parti-
cular conditioned stores. As AUs and
ICAR institutes were finding difficulties
in arranging the air-conditioning and
insulation in respect of breeder seed
stores constructed by them under NSP I
and II, it was finally decided in a
meteting held under the chairmanship of JS
(PP&S) in the Ministry on 7/20/b2 that
NSC might take up this work for the
interested institutions on consultancy
basis. Further the concerned institu-
tions took their own time in entrusting
the consultancy work to NSC and making
available required funds for undertaking
the AC works primarily due to delay in
release of funds by ICAR. NSC also
faced difficulties in getting the suitablo
air-conditioning designs prepared from its
consultants, NIDC/NCDC. for individual
locations as it was not possible to follow
modular designs for all locations due to
different sizes of stores, different
ambient conditions and different storage
periods for different crop seeds to be
handed at various locations. Further.
when NSC awarded tenders for 9 institu-
tions in June. 1984. some of the institu-
tions were still to complete the civil
works and make available the required
funds for implementing this component.
This further delayed the implementation
of AC seed stores component of the nine
locations, AC works have been almost
completed at only 2 locations namely BHU
Varanasi ana IGERI Jhansi. AC works
contract for the remaining locations was
terminated subsequently as the contractor
was demanding unjustified cost escalation.
'renders for remaining locations were
reinvited in August 1986 and technical
evolutions has since been completed.
Price bids have also been opened on
4/13/87 and work is expected to be
completea during 1987.

plant of the store by 50%          funds by BRBN at the appropriate time.
cost escalation will still         Subsequently on reviewing the potential
be dramatic.                       for production and distribution of seed
potato, BRBN in consultation with state
govermnent decided to go ahead with
air-conditioning of potato cold store
of 4,500 M  capacity only.  The original
AC works contract has since been ter-
minated as the contractor was asking
unjustified escalation. As resolved
in the meeting held with APC Bihar on
3/3/87, NSC is pursuing the matter with
t state-goverzment/BIBN to work out the
modalities for proceeding with air-
conditioning and related works of
potato cold stores at Kudra. It has
also been clarified that NSC would not
be in a position to proceed further with
this work unless NSC's outstanding dues
are cleared by BRBN and total required'
funds are also made available for under-
taking air-conditioning works at the
time of award of contract, in the
interest of work.
