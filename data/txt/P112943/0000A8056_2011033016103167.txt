                          The project implementation has slowed down considerably since August 2010, posing substantial risks for meeting project outcomes. The loss of momentum is linked to a number
                         of factors, notably: (i) lack of dedicated staff at the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU), including a full-time Program Manager; a Procurement specialist; and a Financial Management

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                           Recognizing the recurring challenges and its changing needs, the Government has formally requested the Bank (via letter dated February 11, 2011) to redesign the delivery
                         instrument from an investment project to sector-DPL. It may be noted that this request covers both investment lending projects in the FPD portfolio i.e. MSDCP and METAP. The
                         main impetus for moving towards a sector-DPL emerges from: (i) Government's desire to broaden the development outcomes beyond the project-level FPD objectives; (ii) a strong
                         preference for budget support operation - like most middle income countries ­ as Bank's fiduciary procedures are viewed as too intrusive and time-consuming; and (iii) continued
                         implementation challenges of the two projects, that is reflected by low disbursement rates. Subject to Bank Management's concurrence, this would lead to (a) cancellation of the
                         investment lending project under implementation; and (ib) simultaneous preparation of a programmatic three-year FPD-focused DPL operation, utilizing the un-disbursed allocation
                         from the FPD investment projects. Prior to sending a formal response to the Government, AFTFP Management shall consult internal stakeholders as to the feasibility and process
                         involved in moving towards this path. During the transition period, the Bank team shall (i) continue to support the implementation of the project, within the parameters of the existing
                         Financing Agreement; and (ii) work closely with counterparts to identify a menu of potential FPD policy reforms that could be supported under a proposed FPD-DPL series, subject to
                         receiving a green signal from Bank Management.
