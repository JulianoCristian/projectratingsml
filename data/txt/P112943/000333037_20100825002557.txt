October 2006, and the provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreement.  The various 
items under different expenditure categories are described in general below.  For each 
contract to be financed by the Loan, the different procurement methods or consultant 
selection methods, the need for pre-qualification, estimated costs, prior review 
requirements, and time frame are agreed between the Borrower and the Bank in the 
Procurement Plan.  The Procurement Plan will be updated at least annually or as
