I.        STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE

A.        Country and Sector Issues

1.     Development Context: Mauritius, a small island country situated east of Madagascar, has
achieved remarkable economic and social success. Major structural transformation of the
economy over the last two decades has moved the country from a mono-crop economy with a
low per capita income to a more diversified Middle Income Country (MIC). In 2008, the
population of 1.3 million had a Gross National Income (GNI) per capita of US$6,700, up from
US$230 in 1970. Underpinned by good governance, exceptional use of preferential trade
agreements for its sugar and textile exports, a wide-ranging reform program, and the
development of significant tourism and financial services industries, economic performance in
Mauritius has been robust by regional and international standards.

2.      With its small domestic market size, historical development path, and remote geography
in the Indian Ocean, Mauritius faces significant development challenges. The country is
undergoing transition from dependence on trade preferences to global competition. As an open
and small economy, Mauritius remains vulnerable to external shocks. To boost economic growth
through higher productivity, to increase reliance on value-added and innovative skill-intensive
activities, and to develop human capital while preserving its long standing commitment to social
welfare in a multi-ethnic milieu, is a key challenge for the Government of Mauritius (GoM).1

3.      Macroeconomic risks: More recently, the deterioration in the global economic outlook
has confronted Mauritius with macroeconomic risks. The official 2009 growth forecast has been
reduced to 2.5 percent from 4 percent, a significant drop from the average growth rate of 5.2
percent registered between 2006 and 2009. Unemployment rate is expected to increase to 8.1
percent in 2009 from 7.2 percent in 2008.2 Deterioration in performance of the tourism and
textiles industries, the key growth sectors ­ has consequent negative implications on foreign
exchange earnings and balance of payments. At the same time, lower tax revenues, counter-
cyclical spending, and high public debt poses concerns on the fiscal sustainability front.

4.       There are initial signs of some domestic resilience, coinciding with a global financial
markets rally that has renewed hopes for a world economic recovery by end of 2009. Firms in
tourism and textile, while still expecting negative growth during this year, no longer espouse the
earlier `worst-case' scenario of a freefall of more than 10 percent decline. Both sectors were able
to alleviate some of the unfavorable impact from weak global demand by exploring new markets
and discounted travelling in the case of tourism. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows have
displayed similar resilience.3 Financial intermediation has kept momentum albeit profitability is
expected to deteriorate, particularly if the real economy in regional markets continues to slow
down and overseas profit decline. The Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and

  Total employment has declined by approximately 14,000 between the last quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009 in a total
labor force of 560,000. Seasonal effects in employment and labor market participation flows complicate a clear assessment of
quarter on quarter labor market statistics (see Central Statistics Office; and Bastos, F. July, 2009).

  Earlier in the year, the government was expecting a fall of at least 50 percent between 2008 and 2009. However, provisional
figures for the first 5 months of 2009 indicate that FDI inflows are at almost 40 percent of its 2008 value already. See Bastos, F.

                                                                 4
Business Processing Out-Sourcing (BPO) sectors have had a positive performance and continues
to benefit from cost-saving measures around the globe. Outlook for inflation remains favorable
and 12-month inflation in August amounted to 1.0 percent.

5.      The real economy around the world, nonetheless, continues to be frail and uncertain.
While the unemployment rate for 2009 represents only a mild deterioration in labor market
conditions, there are significant upside risks to this forecast. Jobless economic growth in 2009
for Mauritius is a real possibility. As part of its fiscal stimulus package, GoM has been pursuing
a series of short-run interventions to save jobs based on direct support to firms and workers, and
targeted sectoral incentives. Jobs have been saved, but there is cognizance that such interventions
are not sustainable beyond the short-term horizon and in a more protracted downturn. The
Government's emphasis astutely remains on continuing to support the competitiveness agenda
for development of the manufacturing and services sector.

Role and Contribution of Manufacturing and Services in Mauritian Economy

6.      There is widespread agreement in the public and private sector that given the size of the
domestic market, the distance from export markets, and the lack of natural resources, Mauritius'
strategy for private sector-led industrial development must lean toward high-value, knowledge
intensive, and niche markets in manufacturing and services sector. Within this long-term vision,
Mauritius must first, diversify and expand its export base and, second, improve its
competitiveness. This becomes all the more critical in the midst of a global crisis where many
export-oriented companies would need to undertake restructuring to remain competitive.

7.     Table 1 indicates the varying contribution of the economic sectors to Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) growth over the last few decades. The steep decline in agriculture has been

matched by the impressive rise in the contribution of the services, particularly, tourism and
financial sector. The manufacturing sector as a percentage of GDP, while taking a dip over this
period, has remained a strong contributor to GDP growth and employment in Mauritius. The
range of manufactured exports is small and concentrated. Mauritius exports textile and
apparel, fish, jewelry and precious stones. Textile and garments represent 70 percent of the
value of exports.

8.      Large vs. SME Distribution: 4 Within the overall economy, the contribution of large-scale
enterprises (LSE) and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) varies. The overview of
employment in industries reveals a comparatively large manufacturing sector, employing 38
percent of the workforce. It is estimated that 40 percent of employment is in large firms (more
than 500 employees), while medium sized firms (between 50-499 employees) employ about 44
percent and smaller firms (employing up to 49) about 15 percent, assuming a proportional share
of manufacturing establishments among those small firms employing less than 10. The high
share of employment in large and medium size firms highlights their importance in
strengthening growth and employment creation in Mauritius.

9.      The contribution of SMEs in Mauritius can only be estimated because of data
classification issues. While there is currently no legal definition of SMEs,5 a provision has been
made in the draft SME Bill that has been recently presented to the Parliament. According to this
provision, enterprises with turnover up to MUR 10 million would be considered as "small"
where as enterprises with turnover between MUR 10 million to MUR 50 million would be
categorized as "medium."

10.     According to the recent Census of Economic Activities for Small Establishments and
Iterant Units by the Central Statistical Office (CSO) in 2007, there are nearly 92,000 small
establishments employing less than 10 persons. Small enterprises are estimated to contribute
around 20 percent to GDP (CSO 2007). Seventy percent of the small units have one or two

  This sector draws from Jenders, S. Industrial and SME Strategy, June-August 2008; and data from CSO, GOM.
5
  Central Statistics Office (CSO) defines small establishments as those employing less than 10 and all others are considered large.
CSO conducts CEA every five years covering all economic activities except agriculture. The recent 2007 Census of Economic
Activities (CEA) has two phases: phase I covers a sample of small production units (less than 10 employees) and phase II covers
large units. As consequence of the unclear definition of what constitutes an `SME', some segments of the market appear not to be
covered by any organization (for example, `medium' firms or promotion of domestic investors.


                                                                6
employees, and wholesale and retail trade continues to be the most important activity.6 The
small units predominantly operate with the objective to sustain livelihood and may not have the
potential to grow into dynamic domestic or export-oriented firms. Not surprisingly, SEHDA ­
with the mandate to support enterprises with less than 10 employees - has only 7,303 registered
firms, of which 2,344 are operational.7 The thrust of GoM's policy towards supporting dynamic
private-sector development thus needs to be geared more towards medium-size firms in the
manufacturing sector and services sector. The linkages between large firms and SMEs are also
critical as the former helps spawn SME growth through sub-contracting and cluster-based
linkages.

Investment Climate Reforms and PSD Support Initiatives

11.     Economic diversification and competitiveness requires both the enhancement of existing
products as well as the discovery of new sectors, finding niche markets, establishing links among
sectors, and increasing the knowledge component of products. To achieve this objective, the
policy and institutional set-up of an economy - which in turns determines the quality of the
business environment - must be globally competitive. Competitiveness of the institutional
framework implies flexibility in reacting to changes in the investment climate and opportunities
at the national and international level.

12.    GoM has embarked on aggressive, multi-year structural reforms aimed at restoring
macroeconomic balance and diversifying the economy into new growth sectors such as BPO, a
seafood export-hub, manufacturing activities and light engineering knowledge hub and specialty
tourism.8

13.     Prior to 2006, Mauritius' competitiveness had begun to erode. This was correlated with
deterioration in business environment. Some important areas of business environment needing
reform included business registration procedures, labor regulations, land-titling, and trade
incentives and tariff barriers. A key element, largely addressed in the 2006/07 Budget, was
eliminating bureaucratic obstacles to starting a business. The Registrar of Companies was
designated as a one-stop focal agency for business registration and the Board of Investment
converted from an administrator of programs to facilitator and promoter. A recurrent obstacle to
operating a business in Mauritius had been the shortage of human capital. Entry of foreign
workers was eased to overcome skill shortages by combining residence and work permits into a
single occupation permit to be issued within no more than three days for workers earning above
pre-set thresholds. At the same time, measures were taken to encourage the return of the
Mauritian Diaspora to work in Mauritius. Implementation of labor markets reforms aimed at
increasing flexibility, tying wages more closely to productivity by replacing tripartite wage
setting mechanism with a National Pay Council, and relaxing the need to seek approval for lay-
offs, was successfully undertaken.

6
  CSO separates SMEs into 10 groups including manufacturing; construction; wholesale and retail trade; hotel and restaurants;
transport, communications; financial intermediation; real estate, education; health and social work; and other services.
7
  The remainder firms are newly registered, set-up between 2005-2008. According to Jensen (2008), "[s]tart-up grants may have
motivated many to register. It is not known what share of SMEs operate in manufacture, service or trade, nor is it known how
many small firms are operating without being registered with SEHDA.

14.     Substantial progress has been made in the business environment. Mauritius has received
high ratings as an investment and business location, and is ranked 17th out of 183 countries in the
ease of doing business (Doing Business Report, 2010). The government's goal is to reach to top
10 Doing Business rank in the world by 2011.

15.      Over time Mauritius has moved from a first-generation of reforms to a second generation
reform environment where coordination among multiple ministries/agencies as well as broader
institutional capacity in the public sector is needed. At the same time, the Government has
undertaken several "market completing" interventions,9 focusing on skills and training,
technology development, and information services gaps. For instance, in line with GoM's
emphasis on SME development,10 a number of public institutions are providing direct and
subsidized non-financial services - also known as Business Development Services (BDS) to
SMEs.11 The objective is to provide targeted subsidies to address market failures. Key agencies
include: the Small Enterprise and Handicrafts Development Authority (SEHDA) that targets
firms with less than 10 employees;12 the Enterprise Mauritius that caters to manufacturing firms
­ and more recently service industries - directly or indirectly linked to the export market; and the
National Women Entrepreneur Council (NWEC) which is similar to SEHDA, but with a special
focus on firms led by women. The Development Bank of Mauritius (DBM), established to
respond to the financing needs of SMEs, provided different loan schemes. GoM also set up an
abundance of Development Funds catering for the needs of several sub-segments.13 The
performance and results of these public sector institutions, however, have been less than
satisfactory (Jenders 2008).

16.     The Government, nonetheless, remains committed towards private sector and, in
particular, SME growth. In consecutive budgets, including the recent May 2009 Budget, several
measures and incentives have been articulated aimed at sharpening the competitive edge of the
Mauritius firms by improving the business environment, facilitating the flow of business
services, improving access to finance to SMEs, and opening up of opportunities for
businesswomen. An Industrial and SME Strategy outlining GoM's emphasis on SME
development was drafted last year.14

and access to finance (see Figure 1 and Table 3). When viewed through the lens of enterprise
size, these perceived constraints are greater for SMEs than large firms.

Current Supply of BDS Services

18.    In spite of the multiple SME initiatives and substantial resources dedicated by the
Government for BDS, results have been less than satisfactory. Part of the reason behind this less
than satisfactory performance is that publicly provided BDS in Mauritius tend to be generic,
supply-driven, and of poor quality. While firms are well-informed about available support
programs, the recent work by Agence Francaise de Developpement (France Development

15
  Of the total firm sample in the 2009 Mauritius ICA, SMEs represent 73% and large enterprises 27%. The ICA for Mauritius
defines small firms as having 3-9 employees; medium 10-49 employees; and large as having above 50 employees (in order to be
consistent with the definition used by the GoM).




                                                             9
Agency (AFD)), (2008) indicates that existing support is regarded largely ineffective and not
well-aligned with the needs of firms.16 BDS providers often lack information on international
markets for inputs and sales, on domestic suppliers, purchasers and market trends as well as lack
manpower with appropriate skills to encourage technology absorption and diffusion among the
manufacturing and services industry. There is widespread agreement - both within the private
and public sector - that a multiplicity of service providers with overlapping roles and
responsibilities hinders the ability of firms to identify and obtain the required support.17

19.      The results have been no different with regard to subsidized financial services. Directed
and subsidized credit programs by public sector institutions have done little to achieve the
fundamental objective of increasing the access of small enterprises to financial services. This
apparent dichotomy can partly be explained by lending instruments and schemes that do not fully
align with the needs of SMEs. The government schemes and programs have not done well as
indicated by the low utilization rate of the existing financial support schemes and to the
significant volume of non-performing loans made by public sector outlets to the SME sector.
They may have often fostered a `non-payment culture' among enterprises. The poor performance
of the Development Bank of Mauritius (DBM) is a case in point.18 Restructuring of the DBM is
underway, that may involve implementing a "soft liquidation" of DBM's banking assets and
liabilities, as well as the sale of its industrial real estate and subsidiaries, and converting DBM
into a development agency.19

20.     Cognizant of the urgent need to improve quality and sustainability of BDS,
rationalization and consolidation of existing public sector SME institutions is in the works. This
involves, among other things, strategic alignment of services with outcomes, strengthening
capacity-building, and setting up systems of greater accountability. At the same time, the GoM is
keen to incorporate lessons learnt from global best practices that indicate that facilitating the
provision of BDS by private providers and stimulating the demand for them by small enterprise
clients is an effective way to raise the coverage, quality and sustainability of services.

21.     Demand for BDS Services: While the public sector BDS provided fall short of their goals,
the private sector has not stepped-in to fill in the gap. Table 4 shows that a smaller percentage of

   Different organizations use different `operational' definitions of SMEs based generally on number of employees and/or on
turnover. This not only obfuscates operational and monitoring matters, but makes it more difficult to tailor and target
interventions. Cognizant of this, the Government is currently revising the SEDHA Act, where the definition of SMEs, among
other things, shall be revisited in the context of a new SME policy. SEHDA is leading the drafting of the SME policy.
17
   For details pl. refer to Jenders (Nov. 2008), Mauritius: Industrial and SME Strategy, Final Report. For an overview of services
offered and functions performed by existing institutions, see Table 11 (p. 39 of main text; for detailed review Annex 9.

   The GoM recently commissioned a restructuring study on DBM, undertaken by the International Financial Consulting Group
of Canada (IFCC). The IFCC Report (2009) provides a detailed diagnostic of the institution, and the development of a road map
to restructure the operations of the Bank. Key weaknesses identified include (i) a lack of clear objectives, mission and strategic
direction; (ii) weak corporate governance; (iii) structural losses in all business lines except industrial real estate; (iv) negative net
worth and reliance on funding from public sector entities; (v) poor asset quality; (vi) weak risk management and internal controls;
(vii) serious liquidity, interest rate and forex exposures; (viii) a high operational risk profile; (ix) no visible role as a catalyst or
facilitator with other public or private institutions serving the SME sector; and (x) a tainted reputation and brand name, with a
perceived high level of political interference IFCC Report (2009 . The report makes clear that maintaining the status quo is not a
viable option. DBM is already insolvent, and continued operating losses could lead to a liquidity crisis where the Bank would
not be in a position to meet its obligations.
19
   At the same time, the GOM is planning to rationalize existing government programs which support SMEs by merging a
number of existing entities, notably the restructured DBM, SEHDA, the National Women's Council, and possibly other
government programs.


                                                                  10
Mauritius firms offer formal training to their employees than is average in Sub-Saharan Africa,
despite the status of Mauritius as a middle income country. Similarly a lower percentage of firm
employees receive this training in Mauritius relative to other Sub-Saharan Africa countries.

22.    SMEs continue to identify major gaps in the areas of product and market development
support, up-grading skills and training, standards and quality certification, and finance (AFD,
2008). Most enterprises anticipate skills shortages primarily in middle management, technical
and professional positions for 2008. This pattern is expected to continue in the short and medium
term.

23.     Technology absorption is another area where gaps exist. For employers in the ICT
sector, skills shortages in lower end operations like call centre operatives are being addressed
through training, but recruitment is more difficult for occupations at higher levels such as
knowledge process outsourcing. According to 2009 enterprise survey data, a majority of
Mauritius firms use e-mail to communicate with clients, but firm websites are used by
approximately one-third of firms.

24.    Access to finance continues to be perceived as a constraint for SME growth. Yet,
Mauritius is well-served by a vibrant commercial banking sector, 20 with many individuals
having more than one bank account. The latest Mauritius Enterprise Survey (2009) indicates that
nearly all enterprises hold checking or saving accounts and one of two firms has a loan from a
bank (Table 5). Each commercial bank aggressively pursues depositors and SME borrowers.
Not surprisingly, private sector credit to GDP has increased from 54 percent in 2000 to 72
percent in 2007.

25.      The overall financial intermediation picture yields a relatively well-banked view.21 There
is some difference, albeit small, amongst the various segments. The large corporate sector has
little or no problem in sourcing funding. Commercial Banks are already lending substantially to
SMEs using up-to-date techniques, and forecast 15-20 percent growth in this business. SME can
typically access short-term and longer-term financing although they may be relatively more
constrained than large firms (see Table 5).

26.    Further analysis indicates that the issues with access to finance may lie outside the credit
market, underlining demand side constraints.22 Although Mauritius is relatively well banked,

20
   The banking sector comprises a total of eight banks (excluding off-shore banks). The three largest commercial banks (CB) are
the Mauritius Commercial Bank (MCB) with market share of roughly 45%, the State Bank of Mauritius (SBM) with 25% market
share, followed by Barclays Bank with around 12% market share). CBs also offer leasing products. MCB offers import factoring
via MCB Factors and plans to offer export factoring in 2009.
21
   According to the Banking the Poor Report (World Bank), Mauritius is rated 3rd in the world and 1st in Africa.
22
   The factors behind Doing Business ranking ­ with Mauritius standing 84th out of 181 economies ­ also highlight issues outside
the financial sector (Doing Business, Mauritius 2009).


                                                              12
nearly 40 percent of firms do not produce audited annual financial statements, which limits their
ability to obtain credit (see Table 4). The findings from the 2009 Enterprise Survey also reveal
that objective indicators do not match the perception indicators, reinforcing the view that access
to finance may not stem from supply-side constraints (Table 5). Commercial banks highlight the
following obstacles to access to finance for SMEs: (i) lack of equity capital of local SMEs,
which constrains borrowing and growth of these firms (see table 5); (ii) lack of capacity to
prepare bankable projects without technical support; and (iii) lack of adequate collateral or
guarantees.

27.     GOM's Response to Global Financial Crisis: As part of an action plan to `ride out the
global crisis', the GoM has set up a Saving Jobs and Recovery Fund (SJR FUND). The objective
of SJR Fund is to provide direct support to help firms on three main fronts: (i) to reengineer to
become more competitive and ensure long term survival; (ii) to improve access to financing, in
particular working capital; and (iii) to restructure debt.23 The SJR Fund covers enterprises of all
sizes and sectors. Facilities under the SJR will be made available on a temporary and targeted
basis until December 2010.

28.     As part of the earlier Additional Stimulus Package (2008) GoM has established a
Mechanism for Transitional Support for the Private Sector (MTSP) to facilitate enterprise-level
restructuring of debt.24 Thus far, 25 larger firms have entered the MTSP workout program, while
another 25 or so have made inquiries. In addition, the Government has announced an MTSP
"lite" workout program for SMEs. The government anticipates several hundred SMEs could
apply for such relief.

B.       Rationale for Bank Involvement

29.     Mauritius, through its Ministry of Finance & Economic Empowerment (MoFEE),
requested World Bank Group support for a new private sector operation with the objective to
strengthen development and competitiveness of manufacturing and services sector in Mauritius.
The project was agreed between the GoM and the World Bank as part of the early 2008 annual
business plan meetings that are developed in parallel with the Government's planning and budget
processes.

30.     Mauritius has a strong track record of reforms and was named as one of the top 10
reforming governments in 2008 (Doing Business Report, World Bank, 2009) and continues to be
among the top 20 countries globally for doing business. The proposed project would underpin
GoM's on-going reform efforts to support enterprise competitiveness ­ particularly that of SMEs
­ through provision of quality BDS; strengthening of policy and institutional support for existing
public sector institutions which support SMEs; and enhancing access to finance. The operation
has become more salient and timely with the onset of the global financial crisis. Some enterprises
are in need of urgent restructuring.



23
  See Budget, May 2009, Government of Mauritius (GoM) 2009.
24
  See "The Mauritius Approach: Proposed Guidelines to Facilitate Restructuring of Bank Borrowing", GoM. The Mauritius
approach" to out-of-court workouts for distressed businesses has been modeled after the "London approach" of the early 1990s.


                                                             13
31.     The Bank's involvement in Mauritius is consistent with its comparative advantage as a
knowledge institution in line with the MIC approach. The project is supported within the
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), 2007-2013.25 It supports all four pillars of GoM's reform
program: improving trade competitiveness; improving investment climate; democratizing the
economy through participation and sustainability; and improved public sector efficiency. The
project also synergizes and complements on-going Bank support in similar areas, notably the
Development Policy Lending (DPLs) series and the Mauritius Economic Transition Technical
Assistance Project (METAP).

32.     The challenge for the GoM is how best to align content and delivery mechanism of
business development services, particularly SME, to good practice models around the globe that
fit the needs of enterprises in Mauritius. The GoM will benefit from the wealth of knowledge
that the Bank has garnered from supporting similar projects in private sector development the
world over. Annex 4 captures some `best practice' principles learned from Bank's experience
globally in the development of SMEs.

33.     The lessons learnt from recent global experience show that facilitating the provision of
services by private providers and stimulating the demand for them by small enterprise clients is
an effective way to raise the coverage, quality and sustainability of services, and to increase their
impact on small enterprise performance. With regard to improving SMEs' access to financing,
there is a need to formulate a market-oriented strategy which focuses on reducing the risks and
transactions costs associated with this segment of the market, strengthening the capacity of
financial institutions to serve smaller clients, and increasing competition in financial markets.

34.      Lastly, the project would also support the goal of donor harmonization, through the
Bank's role as a donor coordinator in Mauritius. There are concurrent private sector development
initiatives by other donor agencies, namely the AFD, European Union (EU) and United Nations
Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO). The Bank's ability to facilitate discussions and
coordinate amongst donors, as well as its interaction with the larger circle of stakeholders in
order to ensure reaching consensus over important decisions are important to the Government.
In 2008, the Government made a formal request to all donor agencies present in Mauritius that
they interact together and in a coordinated manner to more effectively provide support. And
given the multiplicity of initiatives to support enterprises within the Mauritius government, the
World Bank can play a role in minimizing overlap and ensuring proper coordination and
synergies between the many initiatives for industry and SME development.

C.        Higher level objectives to which the project contributes

35.    The World Bank's Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Mauritius for 2007-2013,
approved in October 2006, recognized the problem of limited access to financial and non-
financial services in the country by small entrepreneurs as an important obstacle to economic
growth. The CPS identifies assistance to strengthen the policy and institutional framework for
SMEs, improve business development services and enhance access to finance, as specific


25
   The CPS, prepared in partnership with GoM and close coordination with the European Union, is based on three guiding
principles: (i) alignment with the Government's support; (ii) flexibility; and (iii) harmonization with other development partners.


                                                                14
measures of the Bank program. The project would also support building the capacity of local
financial and consultancy service providers.

36.     The project would contribute directly to the Mauritius strategic priority of supporting the
private sector as a driver of growth and improving export competitiveness, job creation and skills
enhancement.


II.    PROJECT DESCRIPTION

A.     Lending instrument

37.    The Project will be supported by a Specific Investment Loan (SIL) in the amount of
US$20 million equivalent from International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)
resources.

38.     Project activities have been identified through extensive economic sector work, policy
dialogue with the Government, as well as through consultations with a wide range of
stakeholders, including the private sector, civil society and other development partners. The
project will be implemented over six years. Key Bank documents that have informed the design
of the project include: Mauritius Investment Climate Assessment (ICA), Doing Business Report;
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) and non-lending Technical Assistance (TA) on
corporate vulnerability. In addition the work being supported under the METAP project and
Development Policy Loans (DPLs) have provided useful insights and lessons.

B.     [If Applicable] Program objective and Phases

39.    N/A

C.     Project development objective and key indicators

40.      The overall objective of the proposed project is to support enterprise growth,
competitiveness and employment creation in manufacturing and services sectors. This will be
achieved by improving access to quality Business Development Services (BDS); strengthening
institutional and policy support; and increasing access to finance to credit constrained businesses.

41.    Monitoring and evaluation indicators would include results at the enterprise level such as
increased sales; results at the intermediary level such as number of new business services to
SMEs; and efforts at the policy level to improve the enabling environment for business growth.

42.    The key performance indicators which will measure the Project outcomes and the
intermediate outcome indicators are in Annex 3. These indicators have been developed jointly
with the beneficiary/implementing agencies and have been integrated into the Project's
monitoring and evaluation system. They will be reviewed at mid-term, and revised if necessary.




                                                15
D.      Project components

43.     The Project will be structured around the following components:
        Component One: Improving access to quality Business Development Services (BDS);
        Component Two: Strengthening Institutional and Policy Support for existing public-
                            sector SME related institutions; and
        Component Three: Increasing access to finance to credit constrained businesses.
        Component Four: Project Coordination and Management

44.     A detailed Project description is given in Annex 4.

Component One: Improving access to quality Business Development Services (BDS)
 (Project funds allocated - US$12 million from IBRD loan; in addition US$8 million contributed
from private sector to cost-sharing grants)

45.    This component supports enterprise productivity and competitiveness, specifically in
areas of skills and training, technology upgrading, standards and marketing constraints facing
SMEs. BDS services provided by public agencies are often not well-aligned with the needs of
private firms. Facilitating the provision of services by private providers and stimulating the
demand for them by private firms raises service coverage, quality and sustainability.

46.     Under this component, the Mauritius Business Growth Scheme (MBGS) unit, which is
already functioning,26 shall be further built up and human resources strengthened once the
project becomes effective. The Scheme will deliver two "products" to individual firms, intended
to complement each other:

        ·    Cost-sharing or matching grants, to buy specialized outside expertise;
        ·    Hand-holding, or "mentoring" services, to support beneficiary private sector firms
             with the planning and implementation of a plan for business growth, provided by the
             MBGS Unit, free of charge;

47.     These two "products" will be available to any privately-controlled commercial entity,
operating legally within Mauritius. These two products can be used to support any commercial
activity contributing to the economy of Mauritius, and operating for profit, including commercial
agriculture and commercial fishing.27 Annex 4 provides further details on eligibility criteria,
MBGS Manual and staffing.

48.     It is expected that a new official definition for SME will be gazetted soon. This is likely
to define "small" as having sales below MUR 10 million and "medium" as having sales from
MUR 10-50 million. It is likely that most of the firms that access the MBGS will be "SMEs,"
under these new definitions. Only a very small proportion of the total population of firms has
sales above MUR50m. However, it is important to note that MBGS support will be open to all


26
   The MBGS was announced as part of the May 2009 Budget. Currently the scheme is being managed by the
MoBEC. Once the project becomes effective, it shall be managed independently.

   Financial services and trading oriented to the domestic market are the only activities expressly excluded.


                                                        16
private firms, in all size categories, since the overall objective is to facilitate private-sector
growth.

49.      Funding: The total MBGS funding to be made available over the project period would be
US$12.0 million. Of this total allocation, US$8 million shall be allocated towards the cost-
sharing matching grants to buy specialized outside expertise; US$1.6 million towards Hand-
holding and mentoring services to SMEs; and US$2.4 million towards operating costs of the
MBGS Unit. The Hand-holding and mentoring services for SMEs has been set up to address
demand side issues related to access to finance constraint. These Hand-holding services, that are
free of charge, may include the preparation of business plans and loan applications, in order to
secure bank borrowings. This could involve processing a further 500 standard business-plans.
Since this allocation could add considerably to the workload for the MBGS Unit, with lots of
little applications from unsophisticated, hand-holding intensive firms, one additional MBGS staff
Advisor would be dedicated solely to managing this allocation and workload.

50.    Implementation & Management of MBGS: World Bank experience with such schemes
highlights the importance of operational independence. The MBGS Unit must be able to
withstand the inevitable attempts that will arise, to influence its decisions on specific grant
applications. The Bank-supported MBGS Unit would, therefore, be set up as a fully independent
operational unit but accountable to a joint private-public Mechanism for Transitional Support for
Private Sector (MTSP) Committee, with the MBGS Manager reporting to the Committee.
Program Coordination Unit (PCU) at Ministry of Business Enterprises and Cooperatives
(MoBEC) shall be responsible for administrative functions related to fiduciary aspects.

51.     A second MBGS "Window," outside of the Project. The Government wishes to give
firms applying for MBGS assistance a choice of two alternative forms of support. The first is a
straightforward 50 percent outright grant, with no obligation to repay. The second option is a
much more generous 90 percent grant, but this is a conditional "payback grant." If the activities
supported by an MBGS grant succeed in increasing sales, then the recipient firm will be obliged
to pay back the 90 percent grant received, in the form of a royalty on sales, spread over several
years. However, this second 90 percent conditional payback grant will not be financed by the
World Bank-supported project itself and will be entirely financed by the Government. Of the
three Advisors who shall be recruited to manage the MBGS Unit, one shall be dedicated to the
management of the 90 percent conditional payback grant scheme. This Advisor shall be hired
through Government funds.

52.     Within the World Bank-supported project itself, when the project becomes effective,
there will be one single level of support applying to those grants utilizing project funds. The
project will support 50 percent cost-sharing grants, on a re-imbursement basis to firms, as per the
Manual. These are outright grants, with no attached obligation to repay.

53.     Project funding will be provided for technical assistance to the Government, to assist it
in working out the detailed operational, legal and repayment arrangements required, in order to
introduce these 90 percent payback grants and help ensure the scheme pays special attention to
quality hand-holding by providing the right incentives for the fund manager. Once these details
have been worked out, then it is anticipated that a request will be made by the Government to the



                                                17
Bank, to extend project funding to cover these separate "payback grants." Subsequently, the
World Bank will undertake a comprehensive due diligence to evaluate whether the detailed
arrangements in place comply with OP 8.30. Only if and when it is found that the arrangements
for the payback grants are in full compliance with OP 8.30, would project funds be extended to
fund this second separate category of grants.

54.     Starting MBGS As Quickly as Possible: The May Budget (2009) announced the
establishment of the MBGS, underlining GoM's commitment to this scheme. Keen to start
operations as quickly as possible, a small MBGS unit has been set-up within the MoBEC. Once
the project becomes effective, MBGS Unit shall be managed independently, with strengthened
human resources. The Bank team has therefore worked closely with the senior team within
MoBEC, to assist them in this task to ensure that the scheme is aligned to the agreed project
design and Bank guidelines.

55.    The Government has requested Retro-active Financing for costs incurred in setting up the
Unit, and in funding the 50 percent cost-sharing grants, ahead of project effectiveness. It has
been agreed with the Government that a provision of US$300,000 of the total loan amount has
been made available as of October 1, 2009 as Retro-active Financing.

Component Two: Strengthening Institutional and Policy Support for existing public-sector
SME related institutions
(Project funds allocated - US$3.9 million)

56.    This component focuses on: (a) rationalization and consolidation of existing public
sector SME institutions and programs; and (b) establishment of a Monitoring & Evaluation
(M&E) unit to evaluate SME programs to strengthen performance and accountability.

57.      With respect to the first sub-component, which supports Government's initiative to
restructure and convert the Development Bank of Mauritius (DBM) into a Development Agency
(DA),28 and the consolidation of the SEHDA, and the NWEC, following are the agreed key
activities of support: (a) to identify and rationalize key services based on a thorough analysis of
market gaps and needs; (b) to minimize duplication and overlap of functions; (c) to assist in
drafting requisite legislation and regulations for the new agency; (d) to provide technical
assistance in establishing appropriate corporate governance arrangements, risk management
systems, and internal controls; (e) to prepare a human resources plan and develop and conduct
staff training programs; (f) to acquire the appropriate software and/or equipment; (g) to develop
new products aimed at improving the creditworthiness of SMEs and catalyzing private financing,
including partial risk guarantees; (h) to assist DBM in winding down or disposing of
discontinued lines of business; (i) to develop and implement a communications strategy to
explain the transition and rationale for the conversion to stakeholders, staff, and the general
public; and (j) to establish a budget and financial plan for the new agency.


28
  While an action plan is being prepared by the DBM committee, charged with overseeing the restructuring of DBM
and other entities (notably SEHDA), the proposal for the restructuring of DBM and the proposed merger has not yet
been submitted to cabinet for approval. The government of Mauritius does not plan to retrench staff in the
restructuring.


                                                       18
58.     There remain outstanding questions regarding the mandate and activities of the proposed
new entity. While all parties agree that DBM should not engage in direct lending in market
segments where commercial lenders are willing and able to provide credit, there is some
uncertainty as to where there are genuine market failures in Mauritius. Two options that are
being explored include: (i) supporting start-ups, and (ii) providing loans to firms with turnover
under MUR 5 million. In the absence of hard data, the project proposes to finance a more
detailed analysis to determine where genuine market failures exist, the reason for these failures,
and to propose solutions for addressing them in a sustainable fashion.

59.     There is also broad agreement within the Sub-Committee on DBM Restructuring which is
responsible for overseeing the restructuring of DBM and other entities - on the need to avoid
interference in DBM's operations going forward, to ensure proper checks and balances, and to
strengthen corporate governance of the institution. It is, therefore, proposed that the project
finance technical assistance to establish appropriate corporate governance arrangements, risk
management systems and internal controls. A requirement to work with private lenders on a risk-
sharing basis as recommended above would considerably reduce the scope for interference in the
agency's operations, and would also minimize problems associated with the perception among
borrowers that they do not have to repay DBM/government loans.

60.     Consultations will be done on the possibility of transferring DBM's industrial estates and
disposing of DBM's portfolio of non-performing loans. In this regard, the following options will
be considered: (i) transferring non-performing loans (NPLs) to DBM Financial Services or
another legal entity; (ii) selling some or all NPLs outright; or (iii) outsourcing collection to an
existing bank or credit institution (or some combination of the above). It is difficult at this stage
to know which would be the least cost solution. It would be important to get an independent
valuation of the likely recovery value of the portfolio as soon as possible in order to properly
assess the various options. It is also important that DBM work with its auditors to re-state its
accounts in accordance with Interim Financial Reports (IFRs) in order to get a true and fair value
of the business. This will involve, inter-alia, reversing accrued interest on non-performing loans,
and taking provisions against bad debts based on the usual prudential requirements for banks.
The Sub-Committee on DBM Restructuring plans to submit its final recommendations to the
MoBEC by 30th June 2010, which, thereafter, shall be submitted to the Cabinet for consideration.

61.     The second sub-component would support the establishment of a Monitoring and
Evaluation (M&E) unit. A lack of systematic monitoring and evaluation has been a notable
weakness of past government programs to support SMEs. This new M&E system will help
Mauritius to better design future SMEs support programs by providing a meaningful evaluation
of the impact of earlier programs. A good M&E system requires the creation of a dedicated and
independent unit in charge of: (a) recruiting and training its staff to conduct, manage, and
supervise M&E activities; (b) selecting the support schemes to be evaluated; (c) identifying
specific aspects to be evaluated; (d) creating data systems and procedures; and (e) disseminating
the findings to the appropriate stakeholders. This sub-component will fund an assessment of
existing M&E functions and their strengths and weaknesses. The sub-component will support the
setting up of the unit, the creation of a database of schemes for SMEs, undertaking the
evaluations, and dissemination of findings.




                                                 19
62.    Governance of M&E unit: While the M&E unit would be housed in the new agency, it
would be autonomous and involve private sector associations ­ including Mauritius Chambers of
Commerce and Industry (MCCI) and SME Federation - as oversight bodies and key
stakeholders. For this effort to be valuable and effective it is important that the M&E unit be
independent from any particular agency in charge of service provision. All surveys should be
out-sourced to ensure independence. Finally, it is equally important that the findings of the
evaluation be publicly available in order to mobilize civil society as user of the government
services.

63.    Implementation Arrangements: It was agreed that the Support for Small and Medium
Enterprises (SSME) Committee, along with the MTSP Committee, broadened to include
representation from DBM, shall oversee and inform the design of this component. The
designated Implementation agency shall be the MoBEC.

Component Three: Increasing access to finance to credit constrained SMEs
(Project funds allocated - US$1.5 million)

64.     Informed by technical work and discussions, this project will address the following
impediments to access to finance for SMEs: (i) lack of capacity to develop and present bankable
proposals; (ii) a lack of collateral required by banks in support of lending; and (iii) a temporary
constraint linked to the global crisis, which has resulted in a tightening of credit to riskier
segments of the market. These impediments to access to finance will be addressed through TA
that will also finance further analysis of market failures, the reasons for these gaps, and propose
solutions to address them.

65.     As the binding constraints for access to finance for SMEs appear to stem primarily from
the demand side of financial markets, they would be best addressed by focusing on technical
assistance to SMEs to develop and present bankable proposals to lending banks. This technical
assistance will be provided under the BDS component.

66.     Component 3 will provide technical assistance in the following areas: (i) to assist in the
design of partial risk guarantees and other financial products aimed at catalyzing market finance;
(ii) to provide technical assistance and strengthen implementation of the new MTSP/SME
program; (iii) to undertake a thorough analysis of supply and demand for finance among MSMEs
to identify possible market failures, and reasons for the gaps; and (iv) to propose appropriate
solutions for market segments where private lenders may not be willing to assume credit risk
(e.g. microenterprises and start-ups).

67.     The new support mechanisms for access to finance will build on the MTSP/SME
approach that was recently developed. This program represents a promising departure from
earlier SME support programs. Under prior schemes, credit has generally been provided directly
by state-owned entities such as DBM with little regard for clients' ability or willingness to repay,
resulting in extremely high default levels. Financing under the MTSP/SME is provided by
private lenders, backed by partial government guarantees, and beneficiaries must submit credible
restructuring plans vetted by external consultants and lenders. Under the project, the government
will draw on lessons learned during implementation of the MTSP/SME and feedback from



                                                20
lenders and SMEs to design longer-term support mechanisms for SMEs. It is envisaged that the
program would be implemented by the new Development Agency.

68.     As is the case with the MTSP/SME program, the objective will be to leverage
government support to catalyze financing from private intermediaries, who would be involved in
project selection, credit appraisal, monitoring, risk-sharing, and collection. However, unlike the
MTSP/SME, it is expected that financing will be done at market interest rates. While a
concessional rate (the repo rate under the MTSP/SME) may be appropriate for a program
designed to support firms affected by the crisis, it does not represent a sustainable business
model for commercial lenders.

69.    Implementation arrangements: It was agreed that the MTSP Committee, broadened to
include representation from DBM, shall oversee and inform the design of this component. The
designated Implementation agency shall be the MoFEE.

Component Four: Project Coordination and Management
(Project funds allocated - US$ 0.6 million)

70.     Project Coordination and Management: To support overall project coordination,
management and facilitation among MBGS Unit MoFEE and MoBEC, a PCU has been
established under MoBEC. The PCU would carry out the project management functions in
accordance with project objectives and agreed GoM and World Bank guidelines, facilitate
coordination among implementing agencies, undertake day-to-day facilitation including
provision of the needed financial management and procurement support, facilitate necessary
actions based on the implementation progress, and prepare the quarterly progress reports for PSC
monitoring and Bank's supervision. The project shall provide part of the operating costs to
support operations of the PCU.

71.   It may be noted that the total component costs amount to US$18 million. An additional
US$2 million has been included towards contingency costs (US$1.95 million) and front-end fees
(US$0.05million).

E.     Lessons learned and reflected in the project design

72.    This project has been designed drawing upon the World Bank Group's experience in
Sub-Saharan Africa and other regions and has benefited from the inputs of various World Bank
Group specialized teams, and from the utilization of a strong in-country dialogue with
stakeholders. Specifically the Project draws upon the large amount of analytical work carried
out by the World Bank Group and the Government of Mauritius in recent years, including the
2006 Aid for Trade Report, the 2006 and 2009 Investment Climate Assessments (ICA), the
annual Doing Business surveys, FSAP, Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), the 2006
Governance and Anticorruption Report (GAC), and literature referencing best practices for SME
development programs around the world (2002). Lessons have also been learned from the
experiences of projects supported by other development partners in the sector and from the
experiences of Mauritius Chambers of Commerce and Industry (MCCI), the Joint Economic
Council (JEC) and the Board of Investment in promoting a competitive business environment in
Mauritius.


                                               21
The Project design reflects the following key lessons learned:

73.    Complementarities in Interventions. One issue that had arisen in previous PSD
interventions is the need to make project components more complementary to each other so that
the impact of the project can be enhanced and efficiencies realized. So, for example, the
business growth scheme could target SMEs that could also be potential recipients of credit
through the MBGS. On the policy side, the policy initiatives that are being advocated at the
national level could be vetted, and subsequently discussed through coordination mechanisms
such as increased public private dialogue.

74.     Matching Grants and the need for thorough analysis in identifying market failures.
Lessons from previous World Bank matching grant schemes in Africa29 have highlighted the
importance of identifying market failures and targeting of assistance to those specific market
issues (examples include markets for technical training, technology, entrepreneurship, and export
know-how) and specific target group (such as firm size, sub-sector and ownership status). It has
also highlighted the need for thorough market investigation to determine additional demand for
services at proposed subsidized prices. In the case of this project, this analysis has led to a
careful estimation of fund size and life, with regard to adequate continuity and sun-setting. The
Mauritius Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) has informed the areas for support under the
matching grants scheme.

75.     Effective Utilization of Subsidies. The basis of the recommended design for component
1 is that the facilitation of BDS utilization should be on the basis of buyer subsidy. World Bank
experience over the past 25 years has not yet come up with a better mechanism for delivery of
buyer subsidy in this context than the matching grant scheme. However, international best
practice with respect to such schemes has evolved. In recent schemes, two complementary
interventions are involved. Firstly, generalist consulting assistance is provided directly, limited
to the planning of a plan for business growth, and then providing hand-holding, or mentoring, to
support its implementation. Secondly, within such a plan for business growth, all specialized
services required are supported on the basis of cost-sharing, or "matching," grants.30

76.     Best practice indicates the following key features should be incorporated into the design
of Component One: The subsidy must be on the basis that the beneficiary firm pays a
meaningful proportion of total costs. Most schemes are on the basis of a fixed single 50 percent
rate of subsidy. This ensures real commitment from beneficiary firms, and also prepares them
for eventual "graduation," where they are prepared to pay full market rates for BDS services.
Payment is made strictly on a re-imbursement-only basis, based on verification of completion of
agreed activities by agreed suppliers, and based on proof of payment in full by the beneficiary
firm. Both the grants and the direct supply of business growth mentoring (or hand-holding) are
delivered by an independent unit, staffed by individuals recruited under term contract, bringing
to the task direct experience in business consulting. This unit is deliberately placed outside the
public service, to be seen as independent, and commercial in its approach.

   These schemes are now referred to as "business growth schemes," or the like, rather than just "matching grant schemes."


                                                              22
77.     Greater Access to a Range of Key Services to MSMEs. A principal conclusion of
reviews of MSME interventions, including from Implementation Completion and Results
Reports (ICRs) of International Development Association (IDA) projects, is the diminished
results that accrue where MSMEs are unable to access the full range of services they require. The
evidence is very strong that active intervention does not work unless the basic environment for
the private sector is in place. In light of this, the current project strives to increase access to all
the key services required by MSMEs and tackle business constraints.

78.     Building Capacity for Reforms: The project design reflects the fact that for policy
reforms to have a real impact, they need to be properly implemented and the private sector needs
to be informed of any changes. Therefore, the focus of the policy and institutional component is
on strengthening public sector capacity to implement reforms.

79.     Building strong public-private dialogue and buy-in. The importance of building an
effective private-public dialogue is a key area in the Africa Region's Private Sector Development
(PSD) strategy as experience has demonstrated the difficulties in implementing reforms without
ownership by the public and private sector. The project design draws on this lesson and makes
the public-private interface a feature of the project implementation arrangements. To ensure that
there is buy-in to the project by the Government and private sector, the project team has carried
out extensive consultations during project preparation. To continue this partnership, the project
provides for a significant role for the private sector during implementation. Also, the team
coordinated with other development partners during project preparation to minimize the
possibility of overlapping or duplication, and to benefit from synergies where possible. The team
will continue these close relationships during project implementation.

F. Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection

80.    Several alternatives were considered during Project design. Considerable time was
dedicated to exploring the possibility of setting up a Risk Sharing Partial Credit Guarantee
(PCG) Program to provide partial credit guarantee coverage to commercial bank lenders to
promote their lending to the SME sector. However, the limited success of an existing guarantee
scheme for Mauritius SMEs was a deterrent. Based on the technical discussions with the
stakeholders, and subsequent guidance from the MoFEE, the Bank agreed to the dropping of the
RSF program and modified the contents of the access to finance component.31

81.      Many investment climate challenges influence competitiveness in Mauritius. However,
many of these challenges are being addressed in the Bank's recently approved METAP
(Economic Transition and TA) project. It concentrates on simplifying business licensing
procedures, improving access to commercial justice, land titling registration services, improving
the scope of the credit reference bureau and streamlining the legal framework for business.
Similarly. the challenge of an inadequately educated workforce is being addressed through
initiatives such as strengthening vocational training that have been undertaken by a variety of
Mauritius Government agencies.


31
  This was later re-confirmed in Washington on 21 April with the Mauritian Delegation during the Spring Meetings with IBRD
and IFC management.


                                                           23
82.     Focusing on one specific area of intervention, and making interventions more sequential,
was also considered. However, this approach was rejected, and it was decided that a combined
and integrated set of interventions would generate greater impact, since a broader focus gives
greater flexibility in responding to market opportunities as they arise over the implementation
period.


III.     IMPLEMENTATION

A.       Partnership arrangements32

83.      N/A

B. Institutional and implementation arrangements

84.    The GoM will borrow US$20 million from International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD) for the project's implementation. The project's duration is expected to be
for six years from 2010-2015. The diagram below captures the overall project institutional
arrangements that include a Program Coordination Unit (PCU), Program Steering Committee
(PSC), and the two line ministries, henceforth referred as the implementing agencies (IAs).

85.    Project Coordination Unit (PCU): The PCU that has been set up under MoBEC will
carry out the project management functions in accordance with project objectives and agreed
GoM and World Bank guidelines, facilitate coordination among implementing agencies,
undertake day-to-day facilitation including provision of the needed financial management and
procurement support, facilitate necessary actions based on the implementation progress, and
prepare the quarterly progress reports for PSC monitoring and Bank's supervision.

86.    During project preparation and approval phase, the key functions of the PCU included
timely facilitation and implementation of agreed actions, assisting different components with
procurement and financial management processing matters, and maintaining liaison with the
Bank.

87.     Staffing: The PCU would comprise of full-time dedicated staff including a Program
Manager, a Procurement Officer, a Financial Management Officer, and a Monitoring and
Evaluation (M&E) Officer. A representative from MOFEE shall also form part of the PCU. It
may be noted that the Program Manager, the Financial Management and Procurement Officers
have already been identified.

                (Strategic direction; Monitoring and Evaluation, Quarterly progress review)




88.     A monitoring and evaluation system would be established for each of the three project
specific components to provide ongoing feedback on results and lessons and recommend
adjustments. M&E systems and indicators ­ including at the output, outcome, and Project
Development Objective (PDO) levels ­ have been developed and validated during appraisal.
Indicators include measurements for results at the enterprise level such as increased sales, results
at the intermediary level such as number of providers for business services to firms; and at the
national level related to agreed institutional policy reform goals. Furthermore, capacity building
indicators would be developed to measure and track the impact of institutional development
activities.

89.   MTSP Committee to function as the Program Steering Committee (PSC): The
Government is keen to use existing committees to support this project rather than create new


                                                    25
ones, given the already constrained capacity. In the above spirit, it has been agreed that the
existing MTSP would act as the PSC for the project, subject to some amendments in
membership. The functions of the MTSP would include: (i) strategic guidance to the program
coordination unit (PCU) to meet the overall project objectives; (ii) coordination among the
different stakeholders and to help capture synergies and minimize overlap in the programs being
supported by the MoBEC and Ministry of Industry, Science and Research (MoISR), given that
the mandate of both ministries includes the development of private sector ­ the focus of this
project; (iii) review of quarterly progress reports including M&E indicators; and (iv)
coordination of project level matters with the World Bank and other development partners. The
PSC would meet once every quarter, at a minimum.

90.     Membership and Co-Chairperson: MTSP is co-chaired by public and private
representatives. Given the private sector development objective of this project, the team supports
the public-private partnership. Membership includes: Permanent secretary, MoISR; chairman
State Investment Corporation (SIC); and a Representative from the Bank of Mauritius. It has
been agreed that Permanent secretary, MoBEC would be invited to be a Co-Chair of the
Committee. Other members that would be co-opted include a representative from MoFEE; and
Chairman of DBM.

91.     Program Implementation Committee (PIC): In addition to the MTSP Committee,
Government has established two committees to support SMEs and industry. These are: the
Support to Small and Medium Enterprises (SSME) Committee (targeting SMEs), that is chaired
by the PS, MoBEC; and the Support to Manufacturing and Services Sector (SMSS) Committee
(targeting Industry), that is chaired by the PS, MoISR. It was agreed that the implementation
work of each component shall be guided by these existing Committees, also called the Program
Implementation Committee (PIC).

92.   The function of the PIC shall include: (i) informing the substantive dialogue and guide
the PCU and PSC-MTSP, where needed; and (ii) acting as the fora for stakeholder consultation.

93.     For component One i.e. BDS: This matching grants scheme shall be administered by an
independent MBGS unit. The PCU at MoBEC shall be responsible for administrative functions
related to fiduciary aspects. The SSME Committee and the SMSS Committees shall jointly
provide guidance on day-to-day working level guidance, where needed.

94.     For Component two i.e. Policy and Institutional Support, the designated Implementation
Agency shall be the MoBEC. It was agreed that SSME Committee, along with the MTSP
Committee (the latter broadened to include representation from DBM), shall oversee and inform
the design of this component.

95.    For Component three i.e. Access to Finance ­ the designated Implementation agency
shall be the MoFEE. It was agreed that the MTSP Committee, broadened to include
representation from DBM, shall oversee and inform the design of this component.

C.     Monitoring and evaluation of outcomes/results

96.    The M&E system will be based on the agreed Results Framework and monitoring
arrangements (Annex 3). This framework focuses on the project development objective
outcomes (PDO) to be achieved and the intermediate outcomes expected. The PCU will be
responsible for conducting M&E activities.

97.     Baseline data and target values for all the agreed indicators has been verified and
confirmed by the PCU in partnership and collaboration with the designated technical staff in
each implementing agency. The PCU will remain responsible for the data collection, analysis,
and reporting of the agreed project development outcome indicators. The primary monitoring
mechanism will be quarterly reports and annual reports prepared by the Project Manager and
presented to the PSC and IBRD. These reports will assess achievements against the baseline
values defined in the matrix for arrangements on results monitoring and overall project progress
using the indicators defined in the results framework. All reports will be submitted to the World
Bank and shared with other development partners as required. A mid-term review will be carried
out at the half way point of the project. An Implementation Completion and Results Report
(ICR) will be undertaken after completion of the project.

D.     Sustainability

98.     Some of the constraints to PSD do not require large expenditures, merely the diagnosis of
policy, legal and administrative reforms, and technical support in implementing such changes.
Therefore, the cost of such actions is low, while the impact can be high. While many aspects of
reducing the cost of doing business can be tackled with low-cost solutions, others require
resources well beyond the scope of this project. Critical to the sustainability of growth is further
investment in infrastructure, not just in transportation but also in power, which were identified as
key constraints to private sector development in the 2009 investment climate enterprise survey
data. The restructuring of public enterprises and the facilitation of public-private partnerships
envisaged under this Project will play an important role in addressing these constraints, but
additional public and private investment will be required to achieve real change.

99.     Another factor critical to sustainability is achieving a change in the mind-set of key
public service agencies and their staff, which are now being increasingly viewed as service
providers rather than civil service gatekeepers. While the project can support Government in the
diagnosis and implementation of economic and policy reforms, it is the on-the-ground
implementation of such policies that has the greatest impact on the private sector. Equally, while
the Project can channel supplemental resources to key institutions that serve the private sector,
re-training and change in mind-set will remain important in determining how effectively such
additional resources are deployed. In light of the above, an important cross-cutting emphasis of
the Project will be on changing the mindset of the public sector through training, and workshops
on appropriate themes.

100. At the same time, the sustainability of the BDS component ­ implemented through
setting-up of the Mauritius Business Growth Scheme (MBGS) can potentially pose an issue.
However, it should be understood that this scheme is by its nature intended to be a temporary



                                                27
  subsidy. Once firms have become convinced of the benefits of using outside expertise and
  mentoring, compared to market costs, then the scheme should be phased out. The intention is
  that firms would have had such positive experiences of using external advisory services that they
  would then be willing to pay full commercial prices for such services. The sustainability that
  would be achieved would be within the assisted firms themselves, in the form of an enhanced
  ability to compete and to grow, and also within the market for business support services, which
  would hopefully become more firmly established, and also deeper and broader in scope. In other
  words, it is within the institutions of the private sector that sustainability would be achieved, not
  within the institutions of the public sector.

 IV.       APPRAISAL SUMMARY

  A.       Economic and financial analyses

  102. The proposed Manufacturing and Services Development Project has the goal of
  supporting enterprise growth, competitiveness and employment creation in the manufacturing
  and services sectors. This project uses public funds with the aim of correcting market failures
  and promoting activities with positive externalities. The economic and financial rationale for
  each project component is outlined in Annex 9. The analysis is supported by a model that has
  been constructed to calculate the Net Present Value (NPV) and the Economic Rate of Return
  (ERR) of the matching grant scheme proposed in Component 1, which makes up the majority of
  project funding.

  103. Component One: Improving access to quality Business Development Services (BDS): The
  proposed matching grants provide support for skills and technology upgrading, with the goal of
  supporting enterprise productivity and competitiveness. Using public funds for these activities is
  justified on the basis of market failures for technology and skills upgrading and knowledge
  generation. Namely, the benefits of investments in technology and skills upgrading are not
  privately absorbed by firms, leading to underinvestment in these areas. Hausmann and Rodrik
  (2003) noted that while in the case of new products, patents may allow for the realization of
  private benefits, such protection mechanisms do not exist for the case when an existing product


                                                        31
is first produced in a country. Thus, the full cost of failure is assumed by the innovative firm, but
if successful, the company is forced to share the benefits with imitators. This reduces the
incentive to invest both in the development of new products and processes, as well as in the
search for technologies in which a country might have an untested comparative advantage. Thus,
firms tend to invest less in these areas than is optimal. A similar argument applies to worker
training and skills upgrading. With sufficient labor market flexibility in Mauritius, firms have
minimal incentive to invest in the capabilities of their workers. Given that education enrollment
rates remain somewhat low in Mauritius, particularly at the university level, (according to the
World Economic Forum's 2009-2010 Global Competitiveness Report); incentives to upgrade
worker skills could yield significant benefits.

104. A matching grant can create positive incentives to foster upgrading from firms that find it
too risky to invest given the perceived benefits while providing a partial subsidy to ensure
commitment from the firm and avoid distorting the market. Similarly, the "handholding
scheme" of this project, which provides mentoring to firms who have recently developed a
business plan, uses a partial subsidy to help create a market for services that are currently
underdeveloped in Mauritius.

105. Economic Analysis Methodology: The cost-benefit analysis of this matching grant
scheme faces the same limitations as in all economic analyses of projects in developing
countries, namely difficulties in: (i) identifying the economic benefits and welfare gains or losses
attributable to the project activities; (ii) assigning appropriate monetary values to the benefit
streams; and (iii) acquiring appropriate time series data for appropriate calibration of the model.
These difficulties are inherent to cost benefit analyses, especially for projects aimed at
institutional development and investment climate reforms which cannot easily be linked to firm
performance.

106. Nevertheless, a simple model has been built to calculate the Net Present Value (NPV)
and the Economic Rate of Return (ERR) based on a 12-year forecast timeframe. The project
impact is expected to begin accruing during project implementation. The maximum impact will
be reached after project completion once the relevant capacity, institutions and the investment
climate are strengthened. To test the robustness of the project, the sensitivities of the NPV and
the ERR to assumptions and uncertain future values are diagnosed under worst-case, best-case,
and intermediate-case scenarios. A counterfactual case was used to derive the net effect of the
project.

107. The cost-benefit analysis was carried out for the matching grant scheme. As summarized
in Annex 9 above, the NPV of the matching grant component is estimated at about US$14.5
million for a 12 percent discount rate and over a projection horizon of 12 years. The
corresponding internal economic rate of return is estimated at 42 percent. The fiscal impact is
positive and estimated at US$6.7 million as a result of increased corporate and personal income
taxes. The positive NPV in all five scenarios indicates that the results of the analysis are robust
(see Annex 9).

B. Technical

108. Overall the project design is considered technically sound. There is, nonetheless, a risk
that the approach taken by the project of having private partners manage a number of sub-
components may meet resistance from the public sector. The project responds to market needs
as identified by the Investment Climate Assessment, Doing Business (DB) and the Country
Economic Memorandum (CEM). Using an integrated approach, the components have been
designed to catalyze market-led growth and deal with obstacles that may impede such growth.
The project team's technical specialists have collaborated closely with government, private
sector, and other donors to ensure that the final design meets their needs. Moreover, a phased
approach has been adopted, while the BDS component shall be private-sector led, at the same
time the institutional and policy component shall provide support, in the interim, to make
existing public sector BDS providers more efficient and adopt a more-market driven approach.

109. The BDS component that further strengthens the already functioning business growth
scheme (MBGS) may be potentially subject to capture by well-connected business and political
groups. Stringent, established and verifiable eligibility criteria and strong governance structures,
including setting up an independent MBGS unit, have been devised for the business growth
scheme, to avoid any risk (or perception) of bias or capricious decision making.

C. Fiduciary

110. Financial management. Overall, the Financial Management (FM) arrangements, in PCU
and the Treasury department, that is to be applied in the project meet the World Bank's
minimum requirements as set out in OP/BP 10.02. The financial management risk was
considered to be low. The effective system is supported by the findings in 2007 Public
Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) and assessment of previous Bank funded
projects. However, some aspects needed to be addressed to strengthen FM systems of
administering the project. The action plan that was agreed on with the government included: (i)
development of job descriptions of FM officials to be used in the project; (ii) confirmation of FM
officials; (iii) familiarization of FM officials with Bank procedures; (iv) development of Project
Implementation Manual; (v) provision to the Treasury department of the information that should
be included in the Chart of Accounts and Interim Financial Report (IFR) template to ensure
timely and complete reporting in line with the Bank's requirements; and (vi) Preparation and
agreement of the external audit Terms of Reference (TORs) with the Director of Audit.
Subsequent to pre-appraisal mission, PCU has finalized to the satisfaction of the Bank
development of job description of FM officials, project implementation manual, IFRs templates
and terms of reference for external audit. It was confirmed during negotiation that the following
actions had been taken to the satisfaction of the Bank: (a) confirmation of the project FM
officials; (b) completion of the Chart of Accounts; and (c) preparation of the audit TORs. A
training session for FM officials in the PCU and implementing agencies will be facilitated by the
Bank during project launch.

111. PCU will be responsible for the FM responsibilities that will include processing
transactions and issuance of reports relating to the project. Treasury department will be
responsible for making payments. The internal controls in the government financial management



                                                33
manual shall be used. The transactions including the payments shall be processed through the
government's Treasury Accounting System. The internal audit unit will perform regular reviews
of internal controls.

112. PCU will be required to submit quarterly IFRs to the World Bank, 45 days after the end
of the quarter. The report shall include (i) a statement showing for the period and cumulatively
actual and planned cash receipts and payments by sources and expenditure classification; (ii)
beginning and ending cash balances of the project; and (iii) where interim reports are used as
basis of disbursement, cash forecast for the ensuing two periods. The IFR should be
accompanied by physical progress report and procurement reports for all components.

113. The project financial statements will be audited annually by the Director of Audit. The
auditor will be required to (i) express an audit opinion on project financial statements in
accordance with International Standards of Auditing; and (ii) carry out a comprehensive review
of the internal control procedures, accounting system and compliance with loan covenants and
provide a management report outlining any recommendations for improvement. The audit report
and management letter shall be submitted to the World Bank within six months after the end of
the financial year. The external audit terms of reference have been developed to the satisfaction
of the Bank.

114. Financial management supervision will be carried out regularly by the World Bank
Financial Management Specialist. It will include one supervision mission per year, review of
quarterly IFRs, internal audit reports and annual audit reports and management letters. FMS will
regularly liaise with Task Team Leader for any issues relating the project besides following up
on management letter issues.

115. Procurement: The overall project risk for procurement is considered Moderate, based on
the assessment of the capacity of the Implementing Agency, carried out by the World Bank team
on September 18, 2009. We can consider that GOM staff has procurement expertise in country
system for procurement and in managing contracts. However and due to the lack of experience in
World Bank's procurement procedures, the overall project risk for procurement is rated
Moderate. To take this risk into account, Bank's standard level for prior thresholds will be
lowered or by conducting Prior review for the first one contract. Procurement would be carried
out in accordance with the World Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA
Credits" dated May 2004, revised October 2006; and "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May 2004, revised October 2006.

116. Procurement activities will be carried out by the PCU. The agency is staffed by Project
Unit Coordinator, a Financial Management Officer, a representative from MoFEE, a Monitoring
and Evaluation Officer and a Procurement Officer. The procurement function is staffed by a
Procurement Officer under the coaching of a senior Procurement Officer from Ministry of
Finance and Economic Empowerment (MoFEE).

117. The key issues and risks concerning procurement for implementation of the project have
been identified and include the lack of experience in using World Bank's procedures. The
corrective measures which have been agreed are to provide appropriate procurement training



                                               34
tailored according to his current skills in this area on World Bank procedures to PCU's
Procurement Officer and the appointment of a Senior Procurement Officer from MoFEE to
provide support to the unit (See Annex 8).

D.       Social

118. Small and medium enterprises comprise 58 percent of the industrial base. Given the
"triple trade shock" of trade preference erosion in sugar and textiles, and reflecting Mauritius'
transition from a low wage, low skill sugar and apparel exporter to an innovative, knowledge and
skill based services economy, the percentage of the workforce employed in SMEs is likely to
grow. This project's focus is on enterprise competitiveness ­ particularly that of SMEs ­ through
the provision of quality business development services (BDS); strengthening of policy and
institutional support for existing public sector institutions which support SMEs; and enhancing
access to finance.

E.       Environment

119. Since there are no investment components in the project, and since the overall objective
of the project is to support the manufacturing and services sectors in general (i.e., there is no
focus on any specific industry or industry segment) the project as such shall not have adverse
environmental impacts on human populations or environmentally important areas. The project is
thus deemed category C.

120. Mauritius' environmental agencies have more than adequate capacity and experience in
commissioning and following through on environmental impact assessments and for monitoring
compliance with the country's environmental and social protection laws. The government is
responsive to the desires of the public, and has many times in the past cancelled or postponed
(while undergoing further review) public projects that faced strong opposition from stakeholders
(recent examples include the Gamma Covanta waste incineration project, and the Southeastern
Highways project).

121. The Government of Mauritius' approach to Environmental Assessment is delineated in
the National Environmental Policy issued in 2007 (NEP). One of the objectives of the NEP is to
"develop guidelines and set standards for Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs)"33 while
ensuring that "this environmental policy aims at taking into account social and cultural factors
which encourage or discourage environmental protection..."34 Among the objectives of the NEP
are " Integration of Environmental Concerns in Economic and Social Development."35 These
objectives are reinforced by provisions of the Environmental Protection Act of 2002 (EPA) as
amended in 200836 which prohibit the implementation of any undertaking listed in the First
Schedule (Parts A, B and C respectively) of the Act without first obtaining an approval for either

   On July 15, 2008 the EPA was been amended 2002 (per Act No. 6 of 2008) so as to meet certain policy objectives and make it
more responsive and adaptable to the emerging challenges of the new economic order and also to address a number of issues and
shortcomings in the 2002 Act. http://www.gov.mu/portal/sites/legaldb/legislation/epact08.htm

a Preliminary Environmental Report (PER) or as the case may be, an EIA license,37 subject to the
exemption provisions for public undertakings deemed by the Minister of Environment to be
"urgently needed in the national interest for the economic development of Mauritius."38

122. Ministry of Environment has a strong commitment to environmental protection. It is well
on the way to bringing the EIA process in line with international standards, as witnessed through
the issuance of the Proponent's Guide to Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA Guidelines)
and sectoral guidelines in areas such as Integrated Resort Schemes (and recent EIRs produced
under the guidelines).

    1.      Development Context: Mauritius, a small island country situated east of Madagascar, has
    achieved remarkable economic and social success. Major structural transformation of the
    economy over the last two decades has moved the country from a mono-crop economy with a
    low per capita income to a more diversified middle income country (MIC). In 2008, the
    population of 1.3 million had a GNI per capita of US$6,700, up from US$230 in 1970.
    Underpinned by good governance, exceptional use of preferential trade agreements for its sugar
    and textile exports, a wide-ranging reform program, and the development of significant tourism
    and financial services industries, economic performance in Mauritius has been robust by regional
    and international standards.

    2.      With its small domestic market size, historical development path, and remote geography
    in the Indian Ocean, Mauritius faces significant development challenges. The country is
    undergoing transition from dependence on trade preferences to global competition. As an open
    and small economy, Mauritius remains vulnerable to external shocks. To boost economic growth
    through higher productivity, to increase reliance on value-added and innovative skill-intensive
    activities, and to develop human capital while preserving its long standing commitment to social
    welfare in a multi-ethnic milieu, is a key challenge for the Government of Mauritius (GoM).39

    3.     Macroeconomic risks: More recently, the deterioration in the global economic outlook
    has confronted Mauritius with macroeconomic risks. The official 2009 growth forecast has been
    reduced to 2.5 percent from 4 percent, a significant drop from the average growth rate of 5.2

percent in 2009 from 7.2 percent in 2008.40 Deterioration in performance of the tourism and
textiles industries, the key growth sectors ­ has consequent negative implications on foreign
exchange earnings and balance of payments. At the same time, lower tax revenues, counter-
cyclical spending, and high public debt poses concerns on the fiscal sustainability front.

4.       There are initial signs of some domestic resilience, coinciding with a global financial
markets rally that has renewed hopes for a world economic recovery by end of 2009. Firms in
tourism and textile, while still expecting negative growth during this year, no longer espouse the
earlier `worst-case' scenario of a freefall of more than 10 percent decline. Both sectors were able
to alleviate some of the unfavorable impact from weak global demand by exploring new markets
and discounted travelling in the case of tourism. FDI inflows have displayed similar resilience.41
Financial intermediation has kept momentum albeit profitability is expected to deteriorate,
particularly if the real economy in regional markets continues to slow down and overseas profit
decline. The ICT-BPO sector has had positive performance and continues to benefit from cost-
saving measures around the globe. Outlook for inflation remains favorable and 12-month
inflation in August, 2009 amounted to 1.0 percent.

5.      The real economy around the world, nonetheless, continues to be frail and uncertain.
While the unemployment rate for 2009 represents only a mild deterioration in labor market
conditions, there are significant upside risks to this forecast. Jobless economic growth in 2009
for Mauritius is a real possibility. As part of its fiscal stimulus package, GoM has been pursuing
a series of short-run interventions to save jobs based on direct support to firms and workers, and
targeted sectoral incentives. Jobs have been saved, but there is cognizance that such interventions
are not sustainable beyond the short-term horizon and in a more protracted downturn. The
Government's emphasis astutely remains on continuing to support the competitiveness agenda
for development of the manufacturing and services sector.
Role and Contribution of Manufacturing and Services in Mauritian Economy

6.      There is widespread agreement in the public and private sector that given the size of the
domestic market, the distance from export markets, and the lack of natural resources, Mauritius'
strategy for private sector-led industrial development must lean toward high-value, knowledge
intensive, and niche markets in manufacturing and services sector. Within this long term vision
Mauritius must, first, diversify and expand its export base and, second, improve its
competitiveness. This becomes all the more critical in the midst of a global crisis where many
export-oriented companies would need to undertake restructuring to remain competitive.

7.      Table 2 indicates the varying contribution of the economic sectors to GDP growth over
the last few decades. The steep decline in agriculture has been matched by the impressive rise in
the contribution of the services, particularly, tourism and financial sector. The manufacturing


40
   Total employment has declined by approximately 14,000 between the last quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009 in a total
labor force of 560,000. Seasonal effects in employment and labor market participation flows complicate a clear assessment of
quarter on quarter labor market statistics (see Central Statistics Office; and Bastos, F. July, 2009).
41
   Earlier in the year, the government was expecting a fall of at least 50 percent between 2008 and 2009. However, provisional
figures for the first 5 months of 2009 indicate that FDI inflows are at almost 40 percent of its 2008 value already. See Bastos, F.

The range of manufactured exports is small and concentrated. Mauritius exports textile and
apparel, fish, jewelry and precious stones. Textile and garments represent 70 percent of the
value of exports.

8.     Large vs. SME Distribution: 42 Within the overall economy, the contribution of large-
scale enterprises (LSE) and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) varies. The overview of
employment in industries reveals a comparatively large manufacturing sector, employing 38
percent of the workforce. It is estimated that 40 percent of employment is in large firms (more
than 500 employees), while medium sized firms (between 50-499 employees) employ about 44
percent and smaller firms (employing up to 49) about 15 percent, assuming a proportional share
of manufacturing establishments among those small firms employing less than 10. The high
share of employment in large- and medium-size firms highlight their importance in engendering
growth and employment creation in Mauritius.

9.      The contribution of SMEs in Mauritius can only be estimated because of data
classification issues. While there is currently no legal definition of SMEs,43 a provision has been
made in the draft SME Bill, expected to be presented to the Parliament by end of the year.
According to this provision, enterprises with turnover up to MUR 10 million would be
considered as "small" where as enterprises with turnover between MUR 10 million to MUR 50
million would be categorized as "medium."

10.     According to the recent Census of Economic Activities for Small Establishments and
Iterant Units (CSO 2007), there are nearly 92,000 small establishments employing less than 10
persons. Small enterprises are estimated to contribute around 20 percent to GDP (CSO 2007).
Seventy percent of the small units have one or two employees, and wholesale and retail trade
continues to be the most important activity.44 The small units predominantly operate with the
objective to sustain livelihood and may not have the potential to grow into dynamic domestic or
export-oriented firms. Not surprisingly, the Small Enterprise & Handicrafts Development
Authority (SEHDA) ­ with the mandate to support enterprises with less than 10 employees - has
only 7,303 registered firms, of which 2,344 are operational.45 The thrust of GoM's policy
towards supporting dynamic private-sector development thus needs to be geared more towards
medium-size firms in the manufacturing sector and services sector. The linkages between large
firms and SMEs are also critical as the former helps spawn SME growth through sub-contracting
and cluster-based linkages.

11.     Mauritius' long tradition of private entrepreneurship has led to a strong and dynamic
private sector. Since 2005, public sector investment was, on average, one quarter of the total
gross domestic fixed capital formation and its importance has been decreasing over time, falling
to 17 percent in 2008.

43
   Central Statistics Office (CSO) defines small establishments as those employing less than 10 and all others are considered
large. CSO conducts CEA every five years covering all economic activities except agriculture. The recent 2007 Census of
Economic Activities (CEA) has two phases: phase I covers a sample of small production units (less than 10 employees) and
phase II covers large units. As consequence of the unclear definition of what constitutes an `SME', some segments of the market
appear not to be covered by any organization (for example, `medium' firms or promotion of domestic investors.
44
   CSO separates SMEs into 10 groups including manufacturing; construction; wholesale and retail trade; hotel and restaurants;
transport, communications; financial intermediation; real estate, education; health and social work; and other services.
45
   The remainder firms are newly registered, set-up between 2005 and 2008. According to Jensen (2008), "[s]tart-up grants may
have motivated many to register. It is not known what share of SMEs operate in manufacture, service or trade, nor is it known
how many small firms are operating without being registered with SEHDA.

 Investment Climate Reforms and PSD Support Initiatives

12.     Economic diversification and competitiveness requires both the enhancement of existing
products as well as the discovery of new sectors, finding niche markets, establishing links among
sectors, and increasing the knowledge component of products. To achieve this objective, the
policy and institutional set up of an economy - which in turns determines the quality of the
business environment - must be globally competitive. Competitiveness of the institutional
framework implies flexibility in reacting to changes in the investment climate and opportunities
at the national and international level.

13.    GoM has embarked on aggressive, multi-year structural reforms aimed at restoring
macroeconomic balance and diversifying the economy into new growth sectors such as business
processing operations (BPO), a seafood export-hub, manufacturing activities and light
engineering knowledge hub and specialty tourism.46

14.     Prior to 2006, Mauritius' competitiveness had begun to erode. This was correlated with
deterioration in business environment. Some important areas of business environment needing
reform included business registration procedures, labor regulations, land-titling, and trade
incentives and tariff barriers. A key element, largely addressed in the 2006/07 Budget, was
eliminating bureaucratic obstacles to starting a business. The Registrar of Companies was
designated as a one-stop focal agency for business registration and the Board of Investment
converted from an administrator of programs to facilitator and promoter. A recurrent obstacle to
operating a business in Mauritius had been the shortage of human capital. Entry of foreign

workers was eased to overcome skill shortages by combining residence and work permits into a
single occupation permit to be issued within no more than three days for workers earning above
pre-set thresholds. At the same time, measures were taken to encourage the return of the
Mauritian Diaspora to work in Mauritius. Implementation of labor markets reforms aimed at
increasing flexibility, tying wages more closely to productivity by replacing tripartite wage
setting mechanism with a National Pay Council, and relaxing the need to seek approval for lay-
offs, was successfully undertaken.

15.   Access to Finance: By almost all measures of access to finance, Mauritius ranks high in
comparison to African and international comparators.

16.    Although a higher percentage of Mauritius firms use banks to finance investments than in
other countries, one-third of firms identify access to finance as a major constraint, and this
constraint appears to be particularly challenging for small firms.

17.     Doing Business: Substantial progress has been made in the business environment.
Mauritius has received high ratings as an investment and business location, was ranked 24th out
of 181 countries in the ease of doing business (Doing Business Report, 2009). It continues to be
the top ranked African country and its rank has improved from 24th place to 17th in the 2010
World Bank Doing Business report making it among the top 20 countries for doing business
globally. The World Bank ranks Mauritius as the best country in Africa in which to do business,
rating it even above South Korea, France and Chile. In the 2009 Doing Business ranking,
Mauritius's overall ranking improved by 5 from 29 to 24. The following table presents the
results of the just released Doing Business Report for Mauritius and compares that with its South
Africa Development Community (SADC)47 peers and the best performing countries worldwide.
The government's goal is to reach to top 10 Doing Business rank in the world by 2011.

  18.      The performance of Mauritius remained steady between 2008 and 2009, with
  improvements in a few categories. Mauritius remained the best overall performer in the SADC
  region, although gains could be made in a number of categories of the ranking, such as reducing
  rigidities in the labor market (ex: lowering firing costs) and the amount of time it takes to register
  property.

  19.      Over time Mauritius has moved from a first-generation of reforms to a second generation
  reform environment where coordination among multiple ministries/agencies as well as broader
  institutional capacity in the public sector is needed. At the same time, the Government has
  undertaken several "market completing" interventions,48 focusing on skills and training,
  technology development, and information services gaps. For instance, in line with GoM's
  emphasis on SME development,49 a number of public institutions are providing direct and
  subsidized non-financial services - also known as Business Development Services (BDS) to
  SMEs.50 The objective is to provide targeted subsides for market development to specific market
  failures. Key agencies include: the Small Handicraft Development Agency (SEHDA) that targets

  Agence Francaise de Developpement (AFD). As part of this work, a qualitative and interview-based survey of SMEs has been
  undertaken from June-August 2008.

     This includes a wide variety of services such as marketing and information services; mechanisms to improve business linkages
  through subcontracting, franchising, and business clusters, technology development and diffusion; and human resource
  management.

firms with less than 10 employees;51 the Enterprise Mauritius that caters to manufacturing firms
­ and more recently service industries - directly or indirectly linked to the export market; and the
National Women Entrepreneur Council which is similar to SEHDA, but with a special focus on
firms led by women. The Development Bank of Mauritius (DBM), established to respond to the
financing needs of SMEs, provided different loan schemes. GoM also set up an abundance of
Development Funds catering for the needs of several sub-segments.52 The performance and
results of these public sector institutions, however, have been less than satisfactory.

20.     The Government, nonetheless, remains committed towards private sector and, in
particular, SME growth. In consecutive budgets, including the recent May 2009 Budget, several
measures and incentives have been articulated aimed at sharpening the competitive edge of the
Mauritius firms by improving the business environment, facilitating the flow of business
services, improving access to finance to SMEs, and opening up of opportunities for
businesswomen. An Industrial and SME Strategy outlining GoM's emphasis on SME
development was drafted last year.53

21.    Unfinished agenda: The GoM's agenda for fostering industry productivity and
competitiveness, nonetheless, is work-in-progress. The 2009 World Competitiveness Report, that
covers a more comprehensive set of competitiveness indicators ranks Mauritius 57th out of 134
countries. Some of the key constraints for private sector growth identified by the latest 2009
Mauritius Enterprise Survey include:54 skills and technology deficiencies; infrastructure issues;
and access to finance (see Figure 1 and table 3). When viewed through the lens of enterprise size,
these perceived constraints are greater for SMEs than large firms

   SEHDA provides services related management training, export assistance, technology and export awards, management guides,
in-house consultancy services, business counseling; and a number of grant schemes.
52
   The coverage of these programmes is understood to be wide. The financial assistance landscape includes some 12
funds/schemes, from the Enterprise Development Fund, SME Partnership Ltd., Empowerment Fund to the Tourism Development
Fund, Manufacturing Adjustment & SME Development Fund, to agro-industry schemes and schemes under the Empowerment
Programme.

Current Supply of BDS Services

22.     In spite of the multiple SME initiatives and substantial resources dedicated by the
Government for BDS, results have been less than satisfactory. Part of the reason behind this less
than satisfactory performance is that publicly provided BDS in Mauritius tend to be generic,
supply-driven, and of poor quality. While firms are well-informed about available support
programs, the recent work by AFD (2008) indicates that existing support is regarded largely
ineffective and not well-aligned with the needs of firms.55 BDS providers often lack information
on international markets for inputs and sales, on domestic suppliers, purchasers and market
trends as well as lack manpower with appropriate skills to encourage technology absorption and
diffusion among the manufacturing and services industry. There is widespread agreement - both
within the private and public sector - that a multiplicity of service providers with overlapping
roles and responsibilities hinders the ability of firms to identify and obtain the required support.56

55
   Different organizations use different `operational' definitions of SMEs based generally on number of employees and/or on
turnover. This not only obfuscates operational and monitoring matters, but makes it more difficult to tailor and target
interventions. Cognizant of this, the Government is currently revising the SEDHA Act, where the definition of SMEs, among
other things, shall be revisited in the context of a new SME policy. SEHDA is leading the drafting of the SME policy.
56
   For details pl. refer to Jenders (Nov. 2008), Mauritius: Industrial and SME Strategy, Final Report. For an overview of services
offered and functions performed by existing institutions, see Table 11 (p. 39 of main text; for detailed review Annex 9.


                                                               45
23.      The results have been no different with regard to subsidized financial services. Directed
and subsidized credit programs by public sector institutions have done little to achieve the
fundamental objective of increasing the access of small enterprises to financial services. This
apparent dichotomy can partly be explained by lending instruments and schemes that do not fully
align with the needs of SMEs. The government schemes and programs have not done well as
indicated by the low utilization rate of the existing financial support schemes and to the
significant volume of non-performing loans made by public sector outlets to the SME sector.
They may have often fostered a `non-payment culture' among enterprises. The poor performance
of the Development Bank of Mauritius (DBM) is a case in point.57 Restructuring of the DBM is
underway, that may involve implementing a "soft liquidation" of DBM's banking assets and
liabilities, as well as the sale of its industrial real estate and subsidiaries, and converting DBM
into a development agency.58

24.     Cognizant of the urgent need to improve quality and sustainability of BDS,
rationalization and consolidation of existing public sector SME institutions is in the works. This
involves, among other things, strengthening capacity building and setting up systems of greater
accountability. At the same time, GoM is keen to incorporate lessons learnt from global best
practices that indicate that facilitating the provision of BDS by private providers and stimulating
the demand for them by small enterprise clients is an effective way to raise the coverage, quality
and sustainability of services.

25.     Demand for BDS Services: Table 4 shows that a smaller percentage of Mauritius firms
offer formal training to their employees than is average in Sub-Saharan Africa, despite the status
of Mauritius as a middle income country. Similarly a lower percentage of firm employees
receive this training in Mauritius relative to other Sub-Saharan Africa countries.

26.    SMEs continue to identify major gaps in the areas of product and market development
support, up-grading skills and training, standards and quality certification, and finance (AFD,
2008). Most enterprises anticipate skills shortages primarily in middle management, technical
and professional positions for 2008. This pattern is expected to continue in the short and medium
term.

27.     Technology absorption is another area where gaps exist. For employers in the ICT
sector, skills shortages in lower end operations like call centre operatives are being addressed
through training, but recruitment is more difficult for occupations at higher levels such as
knowledge process outsourcing. According to 2009 enterprise survey data, a majority of
57
   The GoM recently commissioned a restructuring study on DBM, undertaken by the International Financial Consulting Group
of Canada (IFCC). The IFCC Report (2009) provides a detailed diagnostic of the institution, and the development of a road map
to restructure the operations of the Bank. Key weaknesses identified include (i) a lack of clear objectives, mission and strategic
direction; (ii) weak corporate governance; (iii) structural losses in all business lines except industrial real estate; (iv) negative net
worth and reliance on funding from public sector entities; (v) poor asset quality; (vi) weak risk management and internal controls;
(vii) serious liquidity, interest rate and forex exposures; (viii) a high operational risk profile; (ix) no visible role as a catalyst or
facilitator with other public or private institutions serving the SME sector; and (x) a tainted reputation and brand name, with a
perceived high level of political interference IFCC Report (2009 . The report makes clear that maintaining the status quo is not a
viable option. DBM is already insolvent, and continued operating losses could lead to a liquidity crisis where the Bank would
not be in a position to meet its obligations.
58
   At the same time, the GOM is planning to rationalize existing government programs which support SMEs by merging a
number of existing entities, notably the restructured DBM, SEHDA, the National Women's Council, and possibly other
government programs.

28.    Access to finance continues to be perceived as a constraint for SME growth. Yet,
Mauritius is well-served by a vibrant commercial banking sector, 59 with many individuals
having more than one bank account. The latest Mauritius Enterprise Survey (2009) indicates that
nearly all enterprises hold checking or saving accounts, and one of two firms has a loan from a
bank (Table 5). Each commercial bank aggressively pursues depositors and SME borrowers.
Not surprisingly, private sector credit to GDP has increased from 54 percent in 2000 to 72
percent in 2007.




59
  The banking sector comprises a total of eight banks (excluding off-shore banks). The three largest commercial banks (CB) are
the Mauritius Commercial Bank (MCB) with market share of roughly 45 percent, the State Bank of Mauritius (SBM) with 25
percent market share, followed by Barclays Bank with around 12 percent market share). CBs also offer leasing products. MCB
offers import factoring via MCB Factors and plans to offer export factoring in 2009.

29.     The overall financial intermediation picture yields a relatively well-banked view;60 there
is some, albeit small difference amongst the various segments. Large corporate sector have little
or no problem in sourcing funding. CBs are already lending substantially to SMEs using up-to-
date techniques, and forecast 15-20 percent growth in this business. SME can typically access
short-term and longer-term financing although may be relatively more constrained than large
firms (see Table 5).

30.     Further analysis indicates that the issue may be linked outside the credit market,
underlining demand side constraints.61 Although Mauritius is relatively well banked, nearly 50
percent of small and medium sized firms lack annual financial statements reviewed by external
auditors, which limits their capacity to solicit credit (see Table 4). The findings from 2009
Enterprise Survey also reveal that objective indicators do not match the perception indicators,
reinforcing that access to finance may not stem from supply-side issues (Table 5).

31.    Commercial banks highlight two major impediments for SMEs access to finance: (i)
under-capitalization where local SMEs lack equity capital and depend on borrowed capital,
which constrain further borrowing and growth of these firms (see Table 5); and (ii) lack of
capacity to prepare bankable projects without technical support. The problem of access to
finance for SMEs in Mauritius most likely stems from the demand side of the financial sector
market.

  According to the Banking the Poor Report (World Bank), Mauritius is rated 3rd in the world and 1st in Africa.

  The factors behind Doing Business ranking ­ with Mauritius standing 84th out of 181 economies ­ also highlight issues outside
the financial sector (Doing Business, Mauritius 2009).

1.       The active lending program in Mauritius consists of the Development Policy Loan series
and the Mauritius Economic Transition Project. The Mauritius Economic Transition Project,
which is its implementation phase, addresses investment climate issues such as business
facilitation and streamlining the legal and regulatory framework. The DPL Series provides
budget support to ongoing government initiatives with a view to improve investment climate,
trade competitiveness, consolidate fiscal performance and improve public sector efficiency and
sustainability. Mauritius has benefitted from two grants from the PPIAF, one to support the
Public Private Partnership Unit at the MoFEE and the second to the establishment of a Utility
Regulatory Authority. Other than that, PPFs have been requested and approved for the
Infrastructure Project, which was approved by the Board on September 24, 2009.

2.       There are other similar projects in the region such as those in Kenya, Ghana and Tanzania
all in their implementation phases. The Kenya MSME Competitiveness Project is an investment
lending project that aims to increase productivity and employment in participating MSMEs by
access to finance, improved regulatory environment and skills base through redesigning the
Industrial Training Levy Scheme. The Ghana - Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise Project and
the Tanzania - Private sector/MSME Competitiveness Projects are also investment lending
projects that aim at improving employment levels and competitiveness in MSMEs by improved
market access and trade facilitations in infrastructure, proactively supporting entrepreneurship
development and capacity building of local intermediaries to deliver financial and non financial
services to MSMEs as well as strengthening MSME capacity to access these services.

European Union
3.      The EU is providing budget support as well as support for the restructuring of the sugar
sector. The EU also provides grant through the European Development Fund, the FLEX
(fluctuations in export earnings) and the Decentralized Cooperation Program.

Agence Francaise de Development
4.     The AFD is providing global budget support (GBS) and targeted sectoral to encourage
investment in new economic pillars (tourism, ICT, fishing, etc) and in infrastructure (public
transport, ports, airports, etc.

5.      The AFD recently launched the Ariz Fund, which provides investment risk insurance by
offering a 50 percent guarantee to banks supporting SMEs

provides for a grant to the Regional Multidisciplinary Center of Excellence as well as technical
assistance for the mid-term review of the information and telecommunication sector master plan.
The second pillar comprises four operations including a multi-sector budget support program,
two grants to prepare sectoral strategies on gender and sanitation as well as the extension of an
ongoing sanitation project.

                            Annex 4: Detailed Project Description
       Mauritius: Manufacturing and Services Development and Competitiveness Project

1.      The overall objective of the proposed project is to support enterprise growth,
competitiveness and employment creation in manufacturing and services sectors. This will be
achieved by: (i) improving access to quality Business Development Services (BDS); (ii)
strengthening institutional and policy support; and (iii) increasing access to finance to credit
constrained businesses. A fourth component shall support project coordination and management.

2.      The challenge for the GoM is how best to align content and delivery mechanism of
business development services, particularly SME, to good practice models around the globe that
fit the needs of enterprises in Mauritius. The GoM will benefit from the wealth of knowledge
that the Bank has garnered from supporting similar projects in private sector development the
world over. Table below captures some `best practice' principles learned from Bank's experience
globally in the development of SMEs.

3.     Monitoring and evaluation indicators would include results at the enterprise level such as
increased sales; results at the intermediary level such as number of new business services to
SMEs; and efforts at the policy level to improve the enabling environment for business growth.

4.     The key performance indicators which will measure the Project outcomes and the
intermediate outcome indicators are in Annex 3. These indicators have been developed jointly
with the beneficiary/implementing agencies and have been integrated into the Project's
monitoring and evaluation system. They will be reviewed at mid-term, and revised if necessary.

   Project components

   5.       The overall objective of the proposed project is to support enterprise growth,
   competitiveness and employment creation in manufacturing and services sectors. This will be
   achieved by: improving access to quality Business Development Services (BDS); strengthening
   institutional and policy support for existing public-sector SME related institutions; and
   increasing access to finance to credit constrained businesses. To help meet the above objective,
   support shall be provided for project coordination and management.

   6.       The Project will be structured around the following components:
            Component One: Improving access to quality Business Development Services (BDS);
            Component Two: Strengthening Institutional and Policy Support for existing public-
                                sector SME related institutions; and
            Component Three: Increasing access to finance to credit constrained businesses.
            Component Four: Project Coordination and Management

   62
     This section is based on Hallberg, K. (2000), A Market-Oriented Strategy For Small and Medium-Scale Enterprise, IFC,
   Discussion Paper No. 40.


                                                               54
Component One: Improving access to quality Business Development Services (BDS)
(Project funds allocated - US$ 12 million from IBRD loan; in addition US$8 million contributed
from private sector to cost-sharing grants)

7.     This component supports enterprise productivity and competitiveness, specifically in
areas of skills and training, technology upgrading, standards and marketing constraints facing
SMEs. BDS services provided by public agencies are often not well-aligned with the needs of
private firms. Facilitating the provision of services by private providers and stimulating the
demand for them by private firms raises service coverage, quality and sustainability.

8.      However, the reality for a small and isolated economy such as Mauritius is that it will
probably never be able to support a wide range of private specialized services. It will inevitably
have to rely, to a large extent, on specialized services located elsewhere, particularly in southern
Africa; in Western Europe and in South and East Asia. If firms in Mauritius are to be globally
competitive, then they must source the best know-how and skill development services available
globally.

9.      Under this component, the Mauritius Business Growth Scheme (MBGS) unit, which is
already functioning,63 shall be further built up and human resources strengthened once the
project becomes effective. The Scheme will deliver two "products" to individual firms, intended
to complement each other:

        ·    Cost-sharing grants, to buy specialized outside expertise;
        ·    Hand-holding, or "mentoring" services, to support beneficiary private sector firms
             with the planning and implementation of a plan for business growth, provided by the
             MBGS Unit, free of charge;

10.     These two "products" will be available to any privately-controlled commercial entity,
operating legally within Mauritius. These two products can be used to support any commercial
activity contributing to the economy of Mauritius, and operating for profit, including commercial
agriculture and commercial fishing.64

11.     Criteria: For an individual firm to receive Scheme assistance, the key requirement is that
the applicant firm must have written down a simple "Plan for Business Growth," showing that
management understands the firm's current situation, and plans a significant set of measures, that
are likely to lead to strong sales growth. Once this growth plan is set down, then, in principle,
any usage made of outside advisory services, that can reasonably be expected to contribute to the
planned growth, can be supported.


12.     The MBGS Unit Manager can utilize his or her available resources of grant funds, plus
hand-holding by the MBGS staff, in any combination at all. The objective is to maximize the
sales growth in assisted firms. Most firms will probably require a combination of grant funding

63
   The MBGS was announced as part of the May 2009 Budget. Currently the scheme is being managed by the
MoBEC. Once the project becomes effective, it shall be managed independently.
64
   Financial services and trading oriented to the domestic market are the only activities expressly excluded.


                                                        55
plus hand-holding. However, there may well be a minority who only require hand-holding. The
scheme is deliberately intended to be flexible in this regard. Each firm benefitting from MBGS
assistance, of any type, has to fill in a standard Letter of Agreement - to be generated by the
manager, when in place. This ensures, inter alia, that the firm agrees to provide continuing sales
data, and agree to collaborate with any firm surveys, etc.

13.     Every firm applying to the Unit would be paid an initial diagnostic visit on a strictly
"first-come, first-serve" basis. After that, however, the Scheme Manager would be free to
allocate Unit staff time resources as he or she sees fit, in order to achieve the primary objective,
namely to maximize the rate of growth within assisted firms. Thus, those firms considered, on
the basis of the initial growth diagnostic, likely to move quickly towards undertaking supported
activities, and likely to convert these equally quickly into increased sales, would be extended free
hand-holding assistance ahead of firms considered less promising. The MBGS manager would
commit to quarterly and annual activity plans, establishing detailed verifiable indicators of
activity. These would be monitored closely, first by the MBGS Manager; then by the MTSP
Committee acting as the Program Steering Committee; and also by regular World Bank
implementation support missions. In the early months of the Scheme, there would be intensive
promotion of the Scheme, reaching all geographical areas of Mauritius, and reaching all the
different business communities, and different segments of the private sector. The intention is to
use the various representative organizations of the private sector to facilitate this promotion.

14.    Applications from firms for grant support would be reviewed initially by the Scheme
Manager, to verify that they are in full compliance with the detailed terms of the MBGS Manual.
He/she would then forward these applications to a small Grant Approvals Committee, internal to
the PCU and MBGS Unit, and which would be headed by the MBGS Manager. It would include
the PCU Manager, and would also bring in the expertise of other PCU specialist staff, such as the
Procurement Officer and/or the Financial Management Officer. It is this committee that would
have the power to approve applications. Since the terms of the MBGS Manual, particularly
concerning eligibility criteria, are clear and specific, it is expected that there would be very few
outright rejections of applications. It is more likely that applicants could be requested to supply
more information, or to include more preparatory activities.

15.     Purchases of any specialized service, intended primarily to make a significant
contribution to addressing identified key weaknesses or gaps, and thus contributing directly to
the implementation of the agreed Plan for Business Growth, will be eligible for grant support.
Payments for services may be for service fees and, where appropriate, for associated travel and
subsistence costs, incurred directly and exclusively in connection with the delivery of eligible
services. The MBGS grant will cover the applicable percentage65 of the pre-approved total cost
to the firm of purchasing services. Where the Unit considers that returns from further follow-on
injections of grant support will yield attractive returns, a firm may receive follow-on grants.

16.     Double subsidies would be avoided. Any firm receiving subsidies from other sources for
an activity may receive a grant, but only so as to top up the total subsidy received by the firm, to
the level the firm would have anyhow received from MBGS without the other subsidy. All grants
65
  The "applicable percentages," and the different conditions applying to each, are elaborated in a separate
document, "Rules on MBGS Levels of Support and Grant Conditions."


                                                    56
would be paid strictly on a re-imbursement basis, conditional on the terms initially agreed being
met. In particular, for each grant, a "deliverable" would be defined and agreed, the sight of
which would help to verify that the agreed activity had indeed been completed. Also, receipted
invoices plus supporting expenses documentation would be specified within the initial approval
and would be required as a condition of re-imbursement.

17.     Support to business start-up's with no previous track record involves particular additional
risks of failure. Two additional requirements will have to be met, for the MBGS to extend
support to a start-up. First, the owner/promoter must be able to demonstrate that he/she will
bring to the proposed new business relevant specialist or technical experience.66 Second, the
owner/promoter must be able to demonstrate that, subject to the preparatory activities being
supported confirming the viability of the start-up; he/she will be able to raise the required
finance.67 Some firms may prefer to pool resources, so as to save costs, by undertaking activities
as a group, for instance when bringing in expensive foreign trainers from a distance, to deliver
specialized technical training. This is expected to be of particular value to smaller firms.68
Group applications will be encouraged, but each individual member firm will be evaluated
individually. In particular, each will be expected to present a Plan for Business Growth; and
each will be expected to contribute its pro-rata contribution to the total costs of the activity, with
these costs fairly distributed between group member firms.

18.      It should be noted that MBGS support will be available, under this definition, to local
BDS suppliers. It is hoped that those BDS suppliers that see opportunities for developing local
private BDS supply for certain specialized services will take advantage of MBGS support, in
order to send staff for training abroad, or for building alliances with specialists abroad, or the
like. If requested by the firm, the MBGS Unit will use its best efforts to locate suitably qualified
specialist service suppliers. The Unit will be expected to develop contacts beyond Mauritius,
particularly in Southern Africa to locate specialist service providers if needed. Client firms will
be encouraged to seek the most suitable specialized expertise for their specific requirements,
wherever they wish, either inside Mauritius or beyond.

19.     It is expected that a new official definition for SME's will be gazetted soon. This is
likely to define "Small" as having sales below MUR 10 million and "Medium" as having sales
from MUR 10-50 million. It is likely that most of the firms that access the MBGS will be
"SME's," under these new definitions. Only a very small proportion of the total population of
firms has sales above MUR 50m. However, it is important to note that MBGS support will be
open to all private firms, in all size categories, since the overall objective is to facilitate private-
sector growth.



66
   So, for instance, for a proposed start-up car repair workshop, the promoter must demonstrate previous work
experience as a car mechanic or similar, and preferably in a supervisory role in a car repair workshop.
67
   For more on this, see the later section covering Due Diligence.
68
   Even in fully industrialized economies, firms below 30-50 employees rarely purchase made-to-measure services
such as management consultancy. Instead, they build skills and know-how primarily using outside "open" training
courses, covering either general business management topics [e.g. how to get a loan; how to keep books of account];
or covering sub-sector specific technical skills [e.g. new welding techniques for car repair; automating small-scale
furniture-making operations; preparing for organic certification].


                                                        57
20.      Funding: The total MBGS funding to be made available over the project period would be
US$12.0 million. Of this total allocation, US$8 million shall be allocated towards the cost-
sharing matching grants to buy specialized outside expertise; US$1.6 million towards Hand-
holding and mentoring services to SMEs; and US$2.4 million towards operating costs of the
MBGS Unit. The Hand-holding and mentoring services for SMEs has been set up to address
demand side issues related to access to finance constraint. These Hand-holding services, that are
free of charge, may include the preparation of business plans and loan applications, in order to
secure bank borrowings. This could involve processing a further 500 standard business-plans.
Since this allocation could add considerably to the workload for the MBGS Unit, with lots of
little applications from unsophisticated, hand-holding intensive firms, one additional MBGS staff
Advisor would be dedicated solely to managing this allocation and workload.

21.     Implementation & Management of MBGS: World Bank experience with such schemes
highlights the importance of operational independence. The MBGS Unit must be able to
withstand the inevitable attempts that will arise, to influence its decisions on specific grant
applications. The MBGS Unit would therefore be set up as a fully independent operational unit
but accountable to a joint private-public (MTSP) Committee, with the MBGS Manager reporting
to the Committee. PCU at MoBEC shall be responsible for administrative functions related to
fiduciary aspects.

22.     Staffing: The MBGS unit would be staffed by the MBGS Manager, internationally
recruited with direct previous grant scheme experience, plus a small team of MBGS Advisors,
locally recruited with consulting or business mentoring experience. This unit would deliberately
not be linked to any of the existing public agencies providing or channeling services to private
firms. Based on experience with the original TDS scheme, which ran from 1994 to 1998, where
the average grant size was around US$9,000, the mission proposes, as a basis for more detailed
planning, that we assume an average grant size for the MBGS of US$12,000. Allowing for six
months recruiting staff, setting up systems, and launching the scheme, plus a final six months
from the final approval till the final re-imbursement, this would mean an approval period of four
years. Thus, the plan is to extend around 670 grants over four years, or around 170 per year.

23.    MBGS Manual: The Scheme would be directed by an MBGS Manual, agreed between
the World Bank and the Government. Systems would be developed to ensure compliance with
the terms of this manual, but with the minimum possible paperwork and complexity. The
Scheme should be so simple to access that it would appeal to even the smallest firm. Applicants
would be encouraged to apply on-line, and to communicate with the Unit by email, wherever
possible. (Note: The MBGS Manual has already been provided to the PCU as part of the overall
Project Implementation Manual).

24.    The grants within the Scheme are intended to incentivize firms to spend money in ways
they would not otherwise have done. This would only work if grants are paid quickly and
without undo hassle. The objective should be to pay out within five working days of a valid
claim being received.




                                               58
25.     M&E Framework: The key performance indicator to help judge the success of the MBGS
would be the growth rate achieved in sales revenue, for the beneficiary firms following MBGS
assistance, compared to the growth rate achieved in firms not assisted by MBGS.

26.     A second MBGS "Window," outside of the Project. The Government wishes to give
firms applying for MBGS assistance a choice of two alternative forms of support. The first is a
straightforward 50 percent outright grant, with no obligation to repay. The second option is a
much more generous 90 percent grant, but this is a conditional "payback grant." If the activities
supported by an MBGS grant succeed in increasing sales, then the recipient firm will be obliged
to pay back the 90 percent grant received, in the form of a royalty on sales, spread over several
years. However, this second 90 percent conditional payback grant will not be financed by the
World Bank-supported project itself and will be entirely financed by the Government. Of the
three Advisors who shall be recruited to manage the MBGS Unit, one shall be dedicated to the
management of the 90 percent conditional payback grant scheme. This Advisor shall be hired
through Government financing.

27.     Within the World Bank-supported project itself, when the project becomes effective,
there will be one single level of support applying to those grants utilizing project funds. The
project will support 50 percent cost-sharing grants, on a re-imbursement basis to firms, as per the
Manual. These are outright grants, with no attached obligation to repay.

28.     The "payback grants" option could potentially be supported within the World Bank-
supported project, once full due diligence is carried out, to ensure that all details complied with
the terms of OP 8.30, the operational guidelines that cover any form of repayment arrangement.
It has therefore been agreed that all direct costs associated with these "payback grants" will, for
the time being, be covered by the Government's own funds, and will not be funded under the
World Bank-assisted project.

29.     Within the project, funding will be provided for technical assistance to the Government,
in order to assist it in working out the detailed operational, legal and repayment arrangements
required, in order to introduce these 90 percent payback grants and help ensure the scheme pays
special attention to quality hand-holding by providing the right incentives for the fund manager.
Once these details have been worked out, then it is anticipated that a request will be made by the
Government to the Bank, to extend project funding to cover these separate "payback grants."
The World Bank will then undertake a comprehensive due diligence to evaluate whether the
detailed arrangements in place comply with OP 8.30. Only if and when it is found that the
arrangements for the payback grants are in full compliance with OP 8.30, would project funds be
extended, to fund this second separate category of grants.

30.      Starting MBGS As Quickly as Possible: The May Budget (2009) announced the
establishment of the MBGS, underlining GoM's commitment to this scheme. Keen to start
operations as quickly as possible, a small MBGS unit has been set-up within the MoBEC. Once
the project becomes effective, MBGS shall be managed independently, with strengthened human
resources. The Bank team has therefore worked closely with the senior team within MoBEC, to
assist them in this task to ensure that the scheme is aligned to the agreed project design and Bank
guidelines.



                                                59
31.    The Government has requested Retro-active Financing for costs incurred in either setting
up the Unit, or in funding 50 percent cost-sharing grants, ahead of project effectiveness. It has
been agreed with the Government that a provision of US$300,000 will be made as of October 1,
2009 as Retro-active Financing. It was agreed that MoBEC would seek sourcing of a grant
scheme specialist, to provide further detailed technical assistance on setting up the MBGS.

Component Two: Strengthening Institutional and Policy Support for existing public-sector
SME related institutions
(Project funds allocated - US$3.9 million)

32.    This component focuses on: (a) rationalization and consolidation of existing public
sector SME institutions and programs; and (b) establishment of a Monitoring & Evaluation
(M&E) unit to evaluate SME programs to strengthen performance and accountability.

33.      Detailed discussions were held with MOFEE and the DBM committee charged with
overseeing the restructuring of DBM and other entities (notably, at this stage, SEHDA) on the
first sub-component, which supports the Government's initiatives to restructure and convert the
Development Bank of Mauritius (DBM) into a Development Agency (DA),69 along with the
consolidation of the Small Enterprises & Handicraft Development Authority (SEHDA), and the
National Women Entrepreneur Council (NWEC). A certain number of key activities were
agreed, including: (a) to identify and rationalize key services based on a thorough analysis of
market gaps and needs; (b) to minimize duplication and overlap of functions; (c) to assist in
drafting requisite legislation and regulations for the new agency; (d) to provide technical
assistance in establishing appropriate corporate governance arrangements, risk management
systems, and internal controls; (e) to prepare a human resources plan and develop and conduct
staff training programs; (f) to acquire the appropriate software and/or equipment; (g) to develop
new products aimed at improving the creditworthiness of SMEs and catalyzing private financing,
including partial risk guarantees; (h) to assist DBM in winding down or disposing of
discontinued lines of business; (i) to develop and implement a communications strategy to
explain the transition and rationale for the conversion to stakeholders, staff, and the general
public; and (j) to establish a budget and financial plan for the new agency.

34.     There remain outstanding questions regarding the mandate and activities of the proposed
new entity. While all parties agree that DBM should not engage in direct lending in market
segments where commercial lenders are willing and able to provide credit, there is some
uncertainty as to where there are genuine market failures in Mauritius. Two options that are
being explored include: (i) supporting start-ups and, (ii) providing loans to firms with turnover
under MUR 5 million. In the absence of hard data, the project proposes to finance a more
detailed analysis to determine where genuine market failures exist, the reason for these failures,
and to propose solutions for addressing them in a sustainable fashion.


69
  While an action plan is being prepared by the DBM committee, charged with overseeing the restructuring of DBM
and other entities (notably SEHDA), the proposal for the restructuring of DBM and the proposed merger has not yet
been submitted to cabinet for approval. The government of Mauritius does not plan to retrench staff in the
restructuring.



                                                       60
35.     There is also broad agreement within the Sub-Committee on DBM Restructuring which is
responsible for overseeing the restructuring of DBM and other entities - on the need to avoid
interference in DBM's operations going forward, to ensure proper checks and balances, and to
strengthen corporate governance of the institution. It is therefore proposed that the project
finance technical assistance to establish appropriate corporate governance arrangements, risk
management systems and internal controls. A requirement to work with private lenders on a risk-
sharing basis as recommended above would considerably reduce the scope for interference in the
agency's operations, and would also minimize problems associated with the perception among
borrowers that they do not have to repay DBM /government loans.

36.    The absence of microfinance institutions in Mauritius is notable; however, the Bank is of
the view that DBM is not a suitable retail micro-lender, and that its history of providing highly
subsidized (and, in practice, non-repayable) small loans may in fact be a contributing factor to
the absence of sustainable private microfinance providers in Mauritius. If the new DA opts to
engage in this business, it should do so at market interest rates which reflect true costs, and
engage experienced microfinance professionals to run the business.

37.     There is increasing consensus that DBM should avoid direct retail lending, and focus
rather on providing partial risk guarantees to banks, thereby reducing the banks' need for
collateral, which is a noted obstacle to SME lending. This guaranteed portion could be relatively
high for certain types of borrowers, but commercial lenders would in all cases assume some
credit risk. The banks would assess credit risk, and would be responsible for funding and
collecting the loan. As loans are repaid, the borrowers would be able to establish a positive
credit history with commercial lenders, thereby reducing the need for collateral or government
guarantees over time. Consultations will be done on the possibility of transferring DBM's
industrial estates and disposing of DBM's portfolio of non-performing loans. In this regard, the
following options will be considered: (i) transferring non-performing loans (NPLs) to DBM
Financial Services or another legal entity; (ii) selling some or all NPLs outright; or (iii)
outsourcing collection to an existing bank or credit institution (or some combination of the
above). It is difficult at this stage to know which would be the least cost solution. It would be
important to get an independent valuation of the likely recovery value of the portfolio as soon as
possible in order to properly assess the various options. It is also important that DBM work with
its auditors to re-state its accounts in accordance with IFRS in order to get a true and fair value of
the business. This will involve, inter-alia, reversing accrued interest on non-performing loans,
and taking provisions against bad debts based on the usual prudential requirements for banks.
The Sub-Committee on DBM Restructuring plans to submit its final recommendations to the
MoBEC by 30th June 2010, which, thereafter, shall be submitted to the Cabinet for consideration.

38.      Finally, it is recommended that DBM join the Bank of Mauritius' credit information
system as soon as practicable. This would give DBM's borrowers an incentive to repay loans, as
other existing and future participants in the bureau, including banks, consumer credit companies,
utilities, etc. would have access to their credit histories, and they would not be able to obtain
credit elsewhere if they were in arrears at DBM. It would also give DBM access to the credit
histories of potential borrowers and avoid borrowers with a poor credit history.




                                                 61
39.     As part of the potential restructuring and rationalization efforts, the second sub-
component would support the establishment of a Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) unit. A lack
of systematic monitoring and evaluation has been a notable weakness of past government efforts
to support SMEs. This new M&E system will help Mauritius to better design future SMEs
support programs by providing a meaningful evaluation of the impact of programs. A good M&E
system requires the creation of a dedicated and independent unit in charge of: (a) recruiting and
training its staff to conduct, manage, and supervise M&E activities, (b) selecting the support
schemes to be evaluated; (c) identifying specific aspects to be evaluated; (d) creating data
systems and procedures; and (e) disseminating the findings to the appropriate stakeholders. This
sub-component will fund an assessment of existing M&E functions and their strengths and
weaknesses. The project will then support the setting up of the unit, the creation of a database of
schemes for SMEs, the conduct of evaluations, and dissemination of findings.

40.     Governance of M&E unit: While the M&E unit would be located in the new agency, it
would be provided autonomy and involve private sector associations ­ including MCCI and
SME Federation - as oversight bodies and key stakeholders. For this effort to be valuable and
effective, it is important that the M&E unit be independent from any particular agency in charge
of service provision. All surveys should be out-sources to ensure independence. Finally, it is
equally important the findings of the evaluation be publicly available in order to mobilize civil
society as user of the government services.

41.     Implementation Arrangements: It was agreed that the Mechanism for Transitional
Support for Private Sector (MTSP) Committee, broadened to include representation from DBM,
shall oversee and inform the design of this component. The designated Implementation agency
shall be the MoBEC.

42.    M& E Framework: The suggested indicators for monitoring progress include: (i) arrears
of over 90 days on all new credit extended be kept below 20 percent; (ii) Client satisfaction with
DBM/SEHDA services to SMEs.

Component Three: Increasing access to finance to credit constrained businesses
(Project funds allocated - US$1.5 million)

43.     Informed by technical work and discussions, this project will address the following
impediments to access to finance for SMEs: (i) lack of capacity to develop and present bankable
proposals; (ii) a lack of collateral required by banks in support of lending, and (iii) a temporary
constraint linked to the global crisis, which has resulted in a tightening of credit to riskier
segments of the market. These impediments to access to finance will be addressed through TA
that will also finance further analysis of market failures, the reasons for these gaps, and propose
solutions to address them.

44.     As the binding constraints for access to finance for SMEs appear to stem primarily from
the demand side of financial markets, they would be best addressed by focusing on technical
assistance to SMEs to develop and present bankable proposals to lending banks. This technical
assistance will be provided under the BDS component.




                                                62
45.     Component 3 will provide technical assistance in the following areas: (i) to assist in the
design of partial risk guarantees and other financial products aimed at catalyzing market finance;
(ii) to provide technical assistance and strengthen implementation of the new MTSP/SME
program; (iii) to undertake a thorough analysis of supply and demand for finance among MSMEs
to identify possible market failures, and reasons for the gaps; and (iv) to propose appropriate
solutions for market segments where private lenders may not be willing to assume credit risk
(e.g. microenterprises and start-ups).

46.     The new support mechanisms for access to finance will build on the MTSP/SME
approach that was recently developed. This program represents a promising departure from
earlier SME support programs. Under prior schemes, credit has generally been provided directly
by state-owned entities such as DBM with little regard for clients' ability or willingness to repay,
resulting in extremely high default levels. Financing under the MTSP/SME is provided by
private lenders, backed by partial government guarantees, and beneficiaries must submit credible
restructuring plans vetted by external consultants and lenders. Under the project, the government
will draw on lessons learned during implementation of the MTSP/SME and feedback from
lenders and SMEs to design longer-term support mechanisms for SMEs. It is envisaged that the
program would be implemented by the new Development Agency.

47.     As is the case with the MTSP/SME program, the objective will be to leverage
government support to catalyze financing from private intermediaries, who would be involved in
project selection, credit appraisal, monitoring, risk-sharing, and collection. However, unlike the
MSTP/SME, it is expected that financing will be done at market interest rates. While a
concessional rate (the repo rate under the MTSP/SME) may be appropriate for a program
designed to support firms affected by the crisis, it does not represent a sustainable business
model for commercial lenders.

48.     Implementation arrangements: It was agreed that the Mechanism for Transitional
Support for Private Sector (MTSP) Committee, broadened to include representation from DBM,
shall oversee and inform the design of this component. The designated Implementation agency
shall be the MoFEE.

49.    MOFEE has been designated as the responsible line ministry for this component.

Component Four: Project Coordination and Management
(Project funds allocated - US$0.6 million)

50.     Project Coordination and Management: To support overall project coordination,
management and facilitation among MBGS Unit MoFEE and MoBEC, a PCU has been
established under the Ministry of Business Enterprises and Cooperatives (MoBEC). The PCU
would carry out the project management functions in accordance with project objectives and
agreed GoM and World Bank guidelines, facilitate coordination among implementing agencies,
undertake day-to-day facilitation including provision of the needed financial management and
procurement support, facilitate necessary actions based on the implementation progress, and
prepare the quarterly progress reports for PSC monitoring and Bank's supervision. The project
shall provide part of the operating costs to support operations of the PCU.

US$2 million has been included towards contingency costs (US$1.95 million) and front-end fees
(US$0.05million).

1.      The GoM will borrow US$20 million from IBRD for the project's implementation. The
project's duration is expected to be for six years from 2010-2015. The diagram below captures
the overall project institutional arrangements that include a Program Coordination Unit (PCU),
Program Steering Committee (PSC), and the two line ministries, henceforth referred as the
implementing agencies (IAs).

2.      Project Coordination Unit (PCU): To support overall project coordination,
management and facilitation among the two implementing agencies (IAs), a PCU has been
established under the Ministry of Business Enterprises and Cooperatives (MoBEC). The PCU
would carry out the project management functions in accordance with project objectives and
agreed GoM and Bank guidelines, facilitate coordination among implementing agencies,
undertake day-to-day facilitation including provide the needed financial management and
procurement support, facilitate necessary actions based on the implementation progress, and
prepare the quarterly progress reports for PSC monitoring and Bank's supervision.

3.     During project preparation and approval phase, the key functions of the PCU included
timely facilitation and implementation of agreed actions, assisting different components with
procurement and financial management processing matters, and maintaining liaison with the
Bank.

4.     During implementation phase, the PCU will facilitate coordination among implementing
agencies, undertake day-to-day facilitation including providing the needed financial management
and procurement support, prepare the quarterly reports for PSC monitoring and Bank's
supervision, and facilitating necessary actions based on the implementation progress.

5.      Staffing: The PCU would comprise of full-time dedicated staff including a Program
Manager, a Procurement Specialist, a Financial Management Specialist, a representative from
MoFEE and a Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) specialist. The Program Manager, the
Financial Management and Procurement Officers have already been identified.

6.       A monitoring and evaluation system would be established for each of the three project
specific components to provide ongoing feedback on results and lessons and recommend
adjustments. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) systems and indicators ­ including at the output,
outcome, and Project Development Objective (PDO) levels ­ have been developed and validated
during appraisal. Indicators include measurements for results at the enterprise level such as
increased sales, results at the intermediary level such as number of providers for business
services to firms; and at the national level related to agreed institutional policy reform goals.
Furthermore, capacity building indicators would be developed to measure and track the impact of
institutional development activities.

7.       MTSP Committee to function as the Program Steering Committee (PSC): The
Government is keen to use existing committees to support this project rather than create new
ones, given the already constrained capacity. In the above spirit, it has been agreed that the
existing Mechanism for Transitional Support to Private Sector (MTSP) would act as the PSC for
the project, subject to some amendments in membership. The functions of the MTSP would
include: (i) strategic guidance to the program coordination unit (PCU) to meet the overall project
objectives; (ii) coordination among the different stakeholders and to help capture synergies and
minimize overlap in the programs being supported by the MoBEC and MoISR, given that the
mandate of both ministries includes the development of private sector ­ the focus of this project;
(iii) review of quarterly progress reports including M&E indicators; and (iv) coordination of
project level matters with the World Bank and other development partners. The PSC would meet
once every quarter, at a minimum.



                                               67
8.      Membership and Co- Chairperson: MTSP is co-chaired by public and private
representatives. Given the private sector development objective of this project, the team supports
the public-private partnership. Membership includes: Permanent secretary, MoISR; chairman
SIC; and a representative from the Bank of Mauritius. It has been agreed that Permanent
secretary, MoBEC would be invited to be a Co-Chair of the Committee. Other members that
would be co-opted include a representative from MoFEE; and Chairman of DBM.

9.      Program Implementation Committee (PIC): In addition to the MTSP Committee,
Government has established two committees to support SMEs and industry. These are: the
Support to Small and Medium Enterprises (SSME) Committee (targeting SMEs), that is chaired
by the PS, MoBEC; and the Support to Manufacturing and Services Sector (SMSS) Committee
(targeting Industry), that is chaired by the PS, MoISR. It was agreed that the implementation
work of each component shall be guided by these existing Committees, also called the Program
Implementation Committee (PIC).

10.   The function of the PIC shall include: (i) informing the substantive dialogue and guide
the PCU and PSC-MTSP, where needed; and (ii) acting as the fora for stakeholder consultation.

11.     For component One i.e. BDS: This matching grants scheme shall be administered by an
independent MBGS unit. The PCU at MoBEC shall be responsible for administrative functions
related to fiduciary aspects. The SSME Committee and the SMSS Committees shall jointly
provide guidance on day-to-day working level guidance, where needed.

12.     For Component Two i.e. Policy and Institutional Support, the designated Implementation
agency shall be the MoBEC. It was agreed that SSME Committee, along with the MTSP
Committee (the latter broadened to include representation from DBM), shall oversee and inform
the design of this component.

13.    For Component Three i.e. Access to Finance ­ the designated Implementation agency
shall MoFEE. It was agreed that the MTSP Committee, broadened to include representation from
DBM, shall oversee and inform the design of this component.

       Mauritius: Manufacturing and Services Development and Competitiveness Project


Introduction

1.      To determine whether the fiduciary aspects of the project meet the Bank requirements,
the financial management arrangements of the Program Coordinating Unit, MoBEC and MoFEE
were reviewed. The conclusion was that the overall risk rating for the project is low and that the
financial aspects of the project meet the Banks requirements as stated in OP/BP 10.02.
Summary project description

2.      The overall objective of the project is to support enterprise growth, competitiveness and
employment creation in manufacturing and services sectors. The proposed project, supported by
Specific Investment Loan of US$20 million, will be implemented over six years. The
components to be supported by the project include: (i) improving access to quality Business
Development Services (BDS); (ii) strengthening institutional and policy support; and (iii)
increasing access to finance to credit constrained businesses.
Implementing entity

3.      The project shall be overseen by a Project Steering Committee (PSC) which shall offer
strategic guidance and monitoring/oversight over the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU). A
project coordinating unit (PCU) will be established under the MoBEC to provide financial
management, procurement and perform monitoring and evaluation. MoBEC and MoFEE will be
the implementing agencies. The Financial Management Specialist (FMS) at PCU will be
responsible for the overall financial management of the project. He/she will be supported by
FMSs in the implementing agencies. The specific procedures to administer the project shall be
contained in the Project Implementation Manual.
Country issues

4.      A Mauritius PEFA Public Financial Management Performance Assessment was done in
2007. The overall results of assessments of the performance of the PFM system was that it is
strong and able to contain and control fiduciary risks and produces reliable financial information.
In addition, a Bank review of the financial management aspects for METAP which is currently
using the country financial management system components also concluded that there was no
significant financial management risk. Therefore, we support the project to use components of
the country financial management specifically budgeting, accounting, financial reporting,
internal controls, auditing and funds flow. The low residual financial management risk rating,
per the Table 1 below, further supports use of the components.

Strengths and weaknesses
5.      The strong government public financial management systems is evidenced by: effective
program based budgeting that include development partners funded projects; effective Treasury
Accounting System (TAS) with a chart of accounts (GFS 2001 classification based) that is
capable of accurately recording all project transactions and processing flow of funds; existence
of a government Financial Management Manual that incorporate adequate financial control
policies and procedures for application by government; efficient Internal Control Unit and
Director of Audit.
6.     The specific project weakness that requires action is described in Table 2 below:

Staffing

7.      The project FMSs at the PCU and in the implementing agencies have been engaged in
processing government transactions. They are well vast with the TAS used to process
transactions and financial control procedures. Treasury officials that will be involved with
disbursement are familiar with Bank procedures. Job profiles for the FMs have been developed
and the officials have been identified. Training will be conducted during the project launch for
all the FMSs in PCU and the implementing agencies on Bank procedures, in particular, on
financial reporting and disbursements. Regular training updates will be conducted.
Budgeting

8.      The project will be included in the government budget which is currently program based
budget (PBB) and linked to the TAS. The government budgeting process is well set out and
budgets are always approved by legislature before the start of the financial year. The budget
process is considered to be effective as evidenced by 2007 PEFA rating: B+ on legislative
scrutiny of the annual budget law and B for orderliness and participation in the budget process.
PCU shall ensure that MOBEC include project in the budget as per the timelines set out in the
annual budget circular.
Accounting systems
9.      The project transactions will be processed in government Treasury Accounting System
(TAS). Project codes for inclusion in TAS chart of accounts that are necessary to record all
project transactions, have been developed to the satisfaction of the Bank. The system is effective
and is regularly enhanced to improve on government reporting: quality and timeliness. It has
adequate security controls. The TAS is capable of recording and reporting on project
transactions: sources and use of funds and production of the required financial reports on timely
basis in appropriate format. The FMS in PCU and implementing unit will be responsible for
processing the project transactions, preparation and issuance of quarterly interim financial
reports, annual financial statements. TAS will also be used to prepare the regular reports. The
disbursement will be handled and processed by Treasury.
Financial reporting
10.    The financial reports shall be prepared based on information in TAS. The Cash basis of
accounting reporting format, based on International Public Sector Accounting Standard (IPSAS),
shall be used to present financial statements. To monitor project implementation, PCU in
collaboration with the Treasury Department will produce two reports as follows:

       ·    Interim Financial Reports (IFRs): (i) Financial report narrative summary (ii) a
            statement of sources and uses of funds by disbursement category, showing for the
            period and cumulatively, actual and planned cash receipts and payments; (iii) Sources
            and uses of funds by component/activity; and when the project converts to the use of
            interim reports for disbursement, these additional reports will be required, (a)
            designated account activity statement with cash forecast for the ensuing two reporting
            periods, (b) summary of payments against contracts subject to Bank's prior review
            and (c) summary of payments for contracts not subject to Bank's prior review cash


                                                72
           forecast for the ensuing two periods. The IFRs should be prepared on a quarterly
           basis and submitted to the Bank within 45 days of the end of the reporting period.

       ·   The Project Annual Financial statements (audited): to be submitted within six
           months after year end. The financial statements will consist of a statement of sources
           and uses of funds, designated account reconciliation and the accounting policies
           adopted and explanatory notes. Details of the audit scope and requirements are
           provided in the agreed audit TORs.
Internal control and internal auditing
11.     The project shall apply the control procedures in the government Financial Management
Manual. The manual, applied by all government entities, sets out internal control procedures:
segregation of duties, approval procedures and limits, assets management and safeguard etc. The
manual is revised regularly mainly through issuance of circulars. The Internal Audit Unit will
perform regular internal audit review during the project implementation period to provide
assurance on functioning of internal controls. Mauritius has effective and well capacitated
internal audit unit.
External Audit

12.     The project annual audit shall be carried out by the Director of Audit that performs
external audit for ministries, departments, local government and parastatals. The Director's
office is well capacitated with qualified auditors. The scope shall involve issuance of audit report
on financial statements, in compliance with International Standards of Auditing, and
performance of comprehensive review of internal control. The audit report, the auditor's
management letter and management response thereto, shall be issued to the Bank no later than 6
months after the end of the fiscal year, that is, by December 31 each year. The ToRs have been
reviewed and agreed on by the Bank.
Supervision plan
13.     Since the risk assessment of the project is considered to be low, only one supervision
mission will be carried out per year during the implementation period of the project. The mission
objective will be to ensure that strong financial management systems are maintained for the
project throughout its life.
14.     In addition, the Bank FMS will review quarterly IFRs as soon as they are submitted,
internal audit reports, the annual audit reports and follow up on issues and recommendations
raised by external auditors and the task team leader.




                                                73
Flow of Funds and Disbursement Arrangements
­ Designated Account (DA)

15.    The flow of funds from the loan is presented as follows:


                 World Bank
                    (Loan)



                   MoFEE                                          GoM/Treasury
              Designated Foreign                              Local Currency Account
            Currency Account (USD)




          Suppliers of goods and           Suppliers of goods and                  MBGS
        Services (Foreign currency)           Services (local                    Beneficiaries
                                                 currency)


16.     A DA denominated in US$ and to be managed by the Treasury will be opened in a local
commercial bank under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank. Disbursements from the
Bank will be deposited into the DA. The proceeds, based on the project approved work plan,
will then be transferred to the local Government consolidated account, and in such a manner that
funds are transferred into the local currency account as and when needed to finance goods
/services eligible under the loan as indicated in the Loan Agreement and for the payment of the
grants under the MBGS. Foreign currency suppliers will be paid directly from the USD DA.


Disbursement procedures

17.     The project will use the advance disbursement method whereby withdrawals from the
loan account will be deposited in the DA. In addition, government may use any of the following
methods to disburse the loan proceeds (i) direct payment to a third party; (ii) special commitment
to pay amounts to a third party in respect of expenditure to be financed out of the loan proceeds,
upon the government request and under terms and conditions agreed between the Bank and the
government; and (iii) reimbursement procedure where the Bank would reimburse the
government for expenditures eligible for financing that the government has pre-financed from its
own resources. The Project Implementation Manual sets out the specific steps and requirements
for these disbursement methods.
18.    Deposits by the Bank relating to the project into the DA will be made against withdrawal
applications, supported by appropriate documents which will include Statements of Expenditure
(SOEs). The withdrawal applications prepared by PCU and signed by designated officials from
MOBEC will be reviewed, countersigned and submitted to the Bank by MOFEE. Government


                                               74
will designate appropriate officials from MOFEE and MoBEC to sign withdrawal applications.
Additional instructions on withdrawal of funds from the loan account and periodicity of
submission of withdrawal applications are provided in the Bank disbursement letter discussed at
the negotiation of the loan agreement, and which will be signed at the same time as the loan
agreement.
19.      The Treasury Department will be responsible for making payments on behalf of PCU
and implementing agencies. Transaction disbursement documentation shall be followed during
the first year of the project implementation to enable the PCU officials to gain experience on
Bank procedures and ensure preparation and submission of acceptable IFRs to the Bank.
Thereafter, the Report-based documentation shall be adopted. Under the transaction-based
procedure, the required supporting documentation will be summary reports, records and the
SOE. Disbursement will be made by the Treasury against SOEs prepared and certified by PCU
for all payments. All SOEs supporting documentation will be kept by PCU and made available
for review by Bank supervision missions and internal and external auditors.
20.     The loan proceeds will be disbursed over a six year period. The proposed allocation of
the loan proceeds is shown in Table 3 below.

                            Annex 8: Procurement Arrangements
       Mauritius: Manufacturing and Services Development and Competitiveness Project

A.     General

1.       Procurement for the proposed project would be carried out in accordance with the World
Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004, revised
October 2006; and "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank
Borrowers" dated May 2004, revised October 2006, and the provisions stipulated in the Legal
Agreement. The various items under different expenditure categories are described in general
below. For each contract to be financed by the Loan, the different procurement methods or
consultant selection methods, the need for pre-qualification, estimated costs, prior review
requirements, and time frame are agreed between the Borrower and the Bank in the Procurement
Plan. The Procurement Plan will be updated at least annually or as required to reflect the actual
project implementation needs and improvements in institutional capacity.

2.      No special exceptions, permits, or licenses need to be specified in the Loan Documents
for International Competitive Bidding (ICB), since Mauritius procurement practices allow IBRD
procedures to take precedence over any contrary provisions in local regulations.

3.     Procurement of Works: No procurement of works is foreseen under this Project.

4.     Procurement of Goods: Goods procured under this project would include computer
hardware and software as well as office equipment and furniture. The procurement will be done
using (a) the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents (SBD) for all International Competitive
Bidding (ICB) for contracts estimated to cost more than the equivalent of US$500,000 and (b)
National SBD agreed with or satisfactory to the Bank for contracts estimated to cost less than
US$500,000. Procurement of goods may be carried out through NCB procedures and purchase of
small furniture to cost less than US$50,000 will be conducted through prudent shopping
procedures.

5.     Procurement of non-consulting services: Non consulting services under this Project are
limited to office and equipment maintenance, rental expenses, facilities that can necessary to
deliver training activities. Non consulting services will be procured following shopping
procedures as described in the project implementation manual.

6.      Selection of Consultants: The consultant services under this Project will include technical
assistance to set up and run the Mauritius Business Growth Scheme, to establish the new
Development Agency, to set up and run the Monitoring and Evaluation Unit, and to develop to
develop appropriate products and programs to increase access to finance to credit constrained
SMEs. Contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of US$200,000 or more, will be procured through
Quality-and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS). The contracts for services estimated to cost less than the
equivalent of US$200,000 per contract may be procured under contracts based on Consultants'
Qualifications (CQ) in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 3.1 and 3.7 of the Consultant
Guidelines. Consultant for services meeting the requirements of section V of the consultant


                                               77
guidelines may be selected under the provisions for the Selection of Individual Consultants, i.e. in
essence through the comparison of the curriculum vitae of at least three qualified individuals. No
civil servant can be hired as consultant. Single source selection may be used exceptionally in
accordance with paragraph 3.9 to 3.12 of the Consultant Guidelines.

7.      Most of these services will require international expertise and experience. However, to
ensure that priority is given to the identification of suitable and qualified national consultants,
short-lists for contracts estimated under US$100,000 equivalent may be comprised entirely of
national consultants (in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.7 of the Consultant
Guidelines), provided that a sufficient number of qualified individuals or firms (at least three) are
available at competitive costs.

8.      Training, workshops, conference attendance and study tours will be carried out on the
basis of approved annual work programs that would identify the general framework of training or
similar activities for the year, including the nature of training/study tours/workshops, number of
participants, and cost estimated.

9.      Operational Costs: Operating costs to be financed under the Project include the non
consulting services above mentioned plus per diem, supervision costs and salaries of locally
recruited staff. These expenses will be procured using procedures acceptable to IBRD and that will
be described in the Project Implementation Manual (PIM) and in the project financial and
administrative manual.

B.     Advertising

10.     A General Procurement Notice (GPN) would be prepared and published in Development
Gateway Market (DgMarket) in the United Nations Development Business (UNDB) to advertise
for major consulting assignments (above US$200,000 equivalents) and any ICB. Specific
procurement notices for goods and Expression of Interests (EOI) would be advertised in the
national press of wide distribution and DgMarket/UNDB for contracts interesting international
bidders/candidates. Answers to these expressions would be used to establish short-lists.
Sufficient time would be allowed (minimum of 15 days) before preparing the short list.

C.     Assessment of the agency's capacity to implement procurement

11.    Procurement activities will be carried out by Ministry of Business Enterprises and
Cooperatives (MoBEC) Procurement Unit. The agency is staffed by Project Unit Coordinator, a
financial management officer, a monitoring and evaluation officer and a procurement officer.
The procurement function is staffed by a procurement officer under the coaching of a senior
procurement officer from Ministry of Finance and Economic Empowerment (MoFEE).

12.    An assessment of the capacity of the Implementing Agency to implement procurement
actions for the project has been carried out by Sylvain Rambeloson, Sr. Procurement specialist
and Lova Ravaoarimino, Procurement Analyst on September 18, 2009. The assessment reviewed
the organizational structure for implementing the project and the interaction between the




                                               78
project's staff responsible for procurement Officer and the Ministry's relevant central unit for
administration and finance.

13.    The key issues and risks concerning procurement for implementation of the project have
been identified and include the lack of experience in using Bank's procedures. The corrective
measures, which have been agreed, are to provide appropriate procurement training tailored
according to his current skills in this area on WB procedures to PCU's Procurement Officer and
the appointment of a senior Procurement officer from MoFEE to provide support to the unit.

14.    The overall project risk for procurement is Moderate.

15.     The key issues and risks concerning procurement for implementation of the project have
been identified and include the limited experience of staff in managing Bank-funded Projects.
The corrective measures which has been agreed is to provide appropriate training to designated
staff before the project becomes effective and as described in the table below.

                               support to the Procurement
                               officer


16.     The overall project risk for procurement is MODERATE. We can consider that GOM
staff has procurement expertise in country system for procurement and in managing contracts.
However and due to the lack of experience in Bank's procurement procedures, the overall project
risk for procurement is rated Moderate. To take this risk into account, Bank's standard level for
prior thresholds will be lowered or by conducting Prior review for the first one contract.

  C.     Procurement Plan

  17.      The Borrower, at appraisal, developed a procurement plan for project implementation
  which provides the basis for the procurement methods. This plan has been agreed between the
  Borrower and the Project Team on September 30, 2009 and is available at PCU ­ MoBEC. It
  will also be available in the project's database and in the Bank's external website. The
  Procurement Plan will be updated in agreement with the Project Team annually or as required to
  reflect the actual project implementation needs and improvements in institutional capacity.

  D.     Frequency of Procurement Supervision

  18.      In addition to the prior review supervision to be carried out from Bank offices, the
  capacity assessment of the Implementing Agency has recommended annual supervision missions
  to visit the field to carry out post review of procurement actions.

                          Annex 9: Economic and Financial Analysis
          Mauritius: Manufacturing and Services Development and Competitiveness Project


1.     The proposed Manufacturing and Services Development Project has the goal of
supporting enterprise growth, competitiveness and employment creation in the manufacturing
and services sectors. This project uses public funds with the aim of correcting market failures
and promoting activities with positive externalities. The economic and financial rationale for
each project component is outlined below. The analysis is supported by a model that has been
constructed to calculate the Net Present Value (NPV) and the Economic Rate of Return (ERR) of
the matching grant scheme proposed in Component 1, which makes up the majority of project
funding.

Component 1: Improving access to quality Business Development Services (BDS)

2.      The proposed matching grants provide support for skills and technology upgrading, with
the goal of supporting enterprise productivity and competitiveness. Using public funds for these
activities is justified on the basis of market failures for technology and skills upgrading and
knowledge generation.

3.      Namely, the benefits of investments in technology and skills upgrading are not privately
absorbed by firms, leading to underinvestment in these areas. Hausmann and Rodrik (2003) note
that while in the case of new products, patents may allow for the realization of private benefits,
such protection mechanisms do not exist for the case when an existing product is first produced
in a country. Thus, the full cost of failure is assumed by the innovative firm but if successful the
company is forced to share the benefits with imitators. This reduces the incentive to invest both
in the development of new products and processes, as well as in the search for technologies in
which a country might have an untested comparative advantage. Thus, firms tend to invest less
in these areas than is optimal.

4.     A similar argument applies to worker training and skills upgrading. With sufficient labor
market flexibility in Mauritius, firms have minimal incentive to invest in the capabilities of their
workers. Given that education enrollment rates remain somewhat low in Mauritius, particularly
at the university level, (according to the World Economic Forum's 2009-2010 Global
Competitiveness Report); incentives to upgrade worker skills could yield significant benefits.

5.     A matching grant can create positive incentives to foster upgrading from firms that find it
too risky to invest given the perceived benefits while providing a partial subsidy to ensure
commitment from the firm and avoid distorting the market. Similarly, the "handholding
scheme" of this project, which provides mentoring to firms who have recently developed a
business plan, uses a partial subsidy to help create a market for services that are currently
underdeveloped in Mauritius.

Economic Analysis Methodology

6.      The cost-benefit analysis of this matching grant scheme faces the same limitations as in
all economic analyses of projects in developing countries, namely difficulties in: (i) identifying


                                                83
the economic benefits and welfare gains or losses attributable to the project activities, (ii)
assigning appropriate monetary values to the benefit streams, and (iii) acquiring appropriate time
series data for appropriate calibration of the model. These difficulties are inherent to cost benefit
analyses, especially for projects aimed at institutional development and investment climate
reforms which cannot easily be linked to firm performance.

7.      Nevertheless, a simple model has been built to calculate the Net Present Value (NPV)
and the Economic Rate of Return (ERR) based on a 12-year forecast timeframe. The project
impact is expected to begin accruing during project implementation. The maximum impact will
be reached after project completion once the relevant capacity, institutions and the investment
climate are strengthened. To test the robustness of the project, the sensitivities of the NPV and
the ERR to assumptions and uncertain future values are diagnosed under worst-case, best-case,
and intermediate-case scenarios. A counterfactual case was used to derive the net effect of the
project.

8.    The key indicator used in the objective function is output of SMEs, which is expected to
grow mainly as the result of higher capacity utilization and efficiency of the supported SMEs and
improved investment climate.

Base Case Results for Matching Grant Scheme

9.      The cost-benefit analysis was carried out for the matching grant scheme. As summarized
in the table above, the NPV of the matching grant component is estimated at about US$14.5
million for a 12 percent discount rate and over a projection horizon of 12 years. The
corresponding internal economic rate of return is estimated at 42 percent. The fiscal impact is
positive and estimated at US$6.7 million as a result of increased corporate and personal income
taxes.

Assumptions (in the base case scenario)

10.    Several assumptions were made to adjust the model and forecast the potential returns:

       (i)     The discount rate used to calculate the economic rate of return and net present
               value (NPV) is 12 percent;
       (ii)    Given the difficulty to reasonably estimate ex-ante the quantitative impact of
               institutional development, it is assumed that the financial costs and benefits can




                                                 84
              be equated with the economic costs and benefits of the operations of assisted
              firms;
       (iii) The corporate and income tax rate of 30 percent of the project benefits is assumed
              to estimate the fiscal impact.
       (iv)   A stable macroeconomic environment with price and exchange rate stability is
              also assumed.
       (v)     For the matching grant sub-component it is assumed that 500 SMEs would be
              supported by the project based on an average grant funding of US$20,000 per
              firm.
       (vi)   It is assumed that grant support provided would increase efficiency of the
              supported recipients and would yield an increase in economic outputs at a
              multiple of two times the amount of support provided with a lag of one year. This
              is a fairly conservative estimate based on experience in other countries such as
              Burkina Faso and Uganda in which a multiple of 10 and 5 times the grant were
              used respectively.
       (vii) Support to SMEs would also result in direct and indirect job creation. Value
              added per worker in Mauritius was estimated at US$12,476 according to 2009
              enterprise survey data. However due to difficulty in accurately estimating the link
              between grants to SMEs and job creation, the secondary impacts in terms of
              increased employment have not been included in the calculation of NPV and
              ERR.
       (viii) The additional output created by assisted firms is defined as the difference
              between the level of output achieved by firms assisted by the project and the level
              of output these same firms would have achieved in the absence of the project.
       (iv)   The increase in firms' output is discounted by 60 percent to take into account the
              economic costs of other crucial resources in the economy that are diverted into the
              project from other activities not directly supported by the project.

Sensitivity Analysis

11.     Five sensitivity tests were carried out by switching values of critical parameters. The
results are presented in the table below:

       (i)     The first test decreases the shadow discount rate from 12 to 10 percent: the NPV
               increased to US$16.0 million with a corresponding ERR of 40 percent.
       (ii)    The second test increases the shadow discount rate from 12 to 20 percent: the
               NPV decreases to US$10.2 million and ERR increases to 51percent.
       (iii)   The third test assumes a lower increase in output for firms benefiting from the
               matching grant scheme of 1 compared to two in the base case; the results showed
               a significantly reduced NPV of US$3.4 million and ERR of 21percnet.
       (iv)    The fourth test assumes a higher increase in output for each firm benefiting from
               the matching grant scheme from two to three the results showed a far higher NPV
               of US$25.7 million and ERR of 57 percent
       (v)     The fifth case elongates the disbursement period by two years against a baseline
               of six years. This is done to take into account the risks associated with weak
               implementation capacity. The NPV is reduced to US$14.1 million while the ERR
               declines slightly to 40 percent.

Conclusion

12.      The positive NPV in all five scenarios indicates that the results of analysis are robust.

Component 2: Strengthening Institutional and Policy Support for existing public-sector
SME related institutions.

13.    The proposed component focuses on strengthening and consolidating existing public
sector SME institutions and programs; and improving monitoring and evaluation of SME
programs. More efficient and streamlined institutions will help to build the foundation for
improved services to SMEs. This should lead to greater competitiveness and productivity among
those firms and improve their ability to contribute to the Mauritian economy. Strengthening
monitoring and evaluation would lay the foundation for evidence-based management of SME
support schemes and improve the likelihood that most effective schemes are supported.

Component 3: Increasing access to finance to credit constrained businesses

14.     A 2004 survey of firm respondents found that those who identify finance as a constraint
are more likely to experience slow output growth. SMEs face greater growth obstacles than
larger firms, and limited access to finance is an important obstacle for smaller firms. Beck and
Demirgüç-Kunt (2006) suggest that inability to access finance may be one of the reasons why we
do not see a robust correlation between SME prevalence and economic growth.

15.      The proposed component includes measures to improve access to finance among SMEs.
The component will provide technical assistance in the following areas: (i) to assist in the design
of partial risk guarantees and other financial products aimed at catalyzing market finance; (ii) to
provide technical assistance and strengthen implementation of the new MTSP/SME program;
(iii) to undertake a thorough analysis of supply and demand for finance among MSMEs to
identify possible market failures, and reasons for the gaps; and (iv) to propose appropriate
solutions for market segments where private lenders may not be willing to assume credit risk
(e.g. microenterprises and start-ups).

2.       No safeguard policy is triggered as a consequence of this project.

3.     Borrower's capacity to implement safeguards. The GoM's institutional capacity for
implementation of safeguard policies is high. Tourism and fishing are key sectors of the
Mauritian economy and both depend on sound environmental management for long-run

4.      Mauritius' environmental agencies have more than adequate capacity and experience in
commissioning and following through on environmental impact assessments and for monitoring
compliance with the country's environmental and social protection laws. The government is
responsive to the desires of the public, and has many times in the past cancelled or postponed
(while undergoing further review) public projects that faced strong opposition from stakeholders
(recent examples include the Gamma Covanta waste incineration project, and the Southeastern
Highways project).

5.      The Government of Mauritius' approach to Environmental Assessment is delineated in
the National Environmental Policy issued in the 2007 (NEP). One of the objectives of the NEP
is to "develop guidelines and set standards for EIAs [Environmental Impact Assessments]"70
while ensuring that "this environmental policy aims at taking into account social and cultural
factors which encourage or discourage environmental protection...."71 Among the objectives of
the NEP are " Integration of Environmental Concerns in Economic and Social Development."72
These objectives are reinforced by provisions of the Environmental Protection Act of 2002

(EPA) as amended in 200873 which prohibit the implementation of any undertaking listed in the
First Schedule (Parts A, B and C respectively) of the Act without first obtaining an approval for
either a Preliminary Environmental Report (PER) or as the case may be, an EIA license,74
subject to the exemption provisions for public undertakings deemed by the Minister of
Environment to be "urgently needed in the national interest for the economic development of
Mauritius."75

6.      In 2008, the Government of Mauritius requested that the World Bank consider the use of
country systems for environmental and social safeguard issues for Bank-supported projects, and
also that the Bank work with other donors to harmonize safeguard policies. Under the Bank
process, (OP 4.00), an equivalence assessment is undertaken to review Mauritius' environmental
and social safeguard system to determine if it is equivalent to the Bank's. An acceptability
assessment is also undertaken to determine acceptability of Mauritius' implementation practices,
track record, and capacity.

7.      The Safeguards Diagnostic Review (SDR) team undertook a comprehensive analysis of
Mauritius' laws, regulations, and environmental codes of practice for environmental and social
safeguard policies (with regard to environmental assessment, involuntary resettlement, natural
habitat and biodiversity protection, pest management practices, protection of forests, protection
of cultural property, and the safety of dams).

8.      The SDR team is awaiting some input on EIAs to be provided by the Government of
Mauritius, and expects to submit the final SDR, including a proposed Action Plan for Gap-
Filling Measures, to the GoM by mid-November for its review After agreement is reached with
the GoM on gap-filling measures, the final SDR will be disclosed on the World Bank and GoM
websites. The Use of Country Systems will be adopted for the Bank's first investment project
that reaches appraisal stage subsequent to the approval of the SDR and implementation of the
agreed Action Plan for gap-filling measures. (It may be the case that Country Systems will only
be adopted for selected environmental and social safeguard policies, with Bank environmental
and social safeguard policies used for the remaining safeguards that are triggered).

9.      Findings of the SDR team indicate that the Ministry of Environment has a strong
commitment to environmental protection. It is well on the way to bringing the EIA process in
line with international standards, as witnessed through the issuance of the Proponent's Guide to
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA Guidelines) and sectoral guidelines in areas such as
Integrated Resort Schemes (and recent EIRs produced under the guidelines).

10.    The Environmental Protection Act spells out the following as requirements for all
undertakings:




73
   On July 15, 2008 the EPA was been amended 2002 (per Act No. 6 of 2008) so as to meet certain policy objectives and make it
more responsive and adaptable to the emerging challenges of the new economic order and also to address a number of issues and
shortcomings in the 2002 Act. http://www.gov.mu/portal/sites/legaldb/legislation/epact08.htm

                                                             88
       ·    An undertaking specified in Part A of the First Schedule requires preparation and
            approval of a Preliminary Environmental Report (PER). This PER applies to less
            polluting projects and does not require an outline. There are general guidelines for
            preparing PER projects on the Ministry of Environment website. (Most of the sub-
            projects under the Project will fall in this category.)

       ·    An undertaking specified in Part B of the First Schedule requires an EIA license. To
            apply for a license, a proponent must submit to the Director an EIA report. A
            proponent, unless applying through the Board of Investment, must provide the
            Director with an outline of his/her proposed undertaking, including its location,
            nature and scope, at least three months before submitting his application for an EIA
            license. Failure to do so may result in a rejection of an application for a license.

11.     The EIA Guidelines go even further than the Environmental Protection Act, calling for
attention to cumulative environmental impacts; consideration of strategic/local/regional/ national
impacts; socio-economic and socio-cultural impacts; and the need to comply with zoning
requirements.

12.    The EIA Guidelines require that EIA Reports include a section for Monitoring and
Maintenance including future maintenance requirements; and provides for consideration of a
"do nothing option", e.g. through measuring the impact on future land use.
