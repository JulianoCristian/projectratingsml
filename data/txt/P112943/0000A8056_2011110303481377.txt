                         The overall objective of the proposed project is to support enterprise growth, competitiveness and employment creation in manufacturing and services sectors.
                         This will be achieved by: (i) improving access to quality Business Development Services (BDS); (ii) strengthening institutional and policy support; and (iii)
                         increasing access to finance to credit constrained businesses.

                         As reported in the last ISR in March 2011, the Government of Mauritius formally requested the Bank (via letter dated February 11, 2011 and 30 March 2011) to cancel this operation,
                         and in its place prepare a sector-DPL. Pursuant to Section 7.01 of the General Conditions, the Bank confirmed - via its letter dated April 26, 2011 - cancellation of the project as of

                         April 1, 2011. For the above reason, there are no new implementation developments to report or key issues or actions for Management attention. All "ratings" remain the same.
                         The loan, however, is not considered officially cancelled in the system as there is still a small outstanding balance from the Designated Account.
                         Following up on the letter sent to the client on May 12, 2011 requesting refund of undocumented designated account advances, the two teams have been working closely to help
                         expedite the reimbursement of the outstanding balance. Per the latest communication with the Loans department, the processing of the final Designated Account application under

                         this loan has been finalized. A communication will be sent in the next few days regarding the recovery and closure of the loan.

                         To fulfill the Finance Agreement requirements, the project management is expected to submit to the Bank audited financial statement, audit report and management letter of the
                         project covering the period from effectiveness to cancellation date by October 31, 2011.
