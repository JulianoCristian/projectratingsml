Several\n            lessons have been learned, of which the most important are\n            the following: Commitment at the highest levels of\n            government must be very carefully assessed prior to and\n            during implementation with projects involving an ambitious\n            reform agenda, particularly where issues involving the\n            possible devolution of power are involved. Success\n            critically depends on strong national (and local) commitment\n            and leadership both before and throughout implementation. It\n            also depends on the timely provision of competent technical\n            assistance. Further, it critically depends on the alignment\n            of incentives and accountabilities within the political and\n            administrative system, as well as in project design.\n            Comprehensive sector reform is a complex and difficult task\n            in the best of circumstances, and is perhaps impossible when\n            survival issues are simultaneously on the national agenda.\n            Because the reform process is complex, programs must be\n            carefully and flexibly paced, particularly with a\n            newly-emerging state apparatus where sector regulatory\n            experience is only in its nascent stages. Furthermore,\n            interventions must be continuously and intelligently\n            modified during implementation, as the situation develops.\n            Finally, the team should be open to the considerable\n            \"learning\" that is involved in the reform process\n            (on the part of the government, the municipalities, the\n            donors and the Bank team itself), and seek to use this\n            learning to inform and focus current and future project\n            design. Supervision of reform is highly demanding,\n            especially in a conflict-affected context. The team needs to\n            be determined, sensitive to the situation as it develops,\n            and flexible and proactive when necessary to keep the\n            program on track. They also need to act quickly and\n            decisively when derailment threatens. Also, a country-based\n            supervision team is essential to ensure continuity in\n            dialogue and constant monitoring of progress on the reform\n            agenda. Significant implementation capacity exists even at\n            the lower levels of the local government system. The project\n            design included assumptions about a shifting of\n            responsibility away from emergency implementation procedures\n            through central agencies to the piloting of implementation\n            locally through Selected Municipalities (SMs), which proved\n            to be a very rewarding approach. Provided adequate technical\n            support, SMs demonstrated that they are quite capable of\n            undertaking medium-sized subprojects on their own. The\n            smaller municipalities are quite capable of undertaking\n            projects in the $0.1-0.5m range. Local institutions also\n            possess considerable initiative and resiliency. This was\n            amply demonstrated during the later stages of the project,\n            particularly after September 2000 when movement of\n            Palestinian personnel became severely restricted. During\n            this period, the second and third batches of small works\n            were successfully completed."}, "docdt": "2003-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
