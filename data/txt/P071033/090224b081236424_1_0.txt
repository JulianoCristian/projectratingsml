The project aims to demonstrate the viability of a community-based approach to tank improvement and management by returning the main responsibility of tank rehabilitation and
a   modernization and the subsequent operation and maintenance (O&M) to village-level tank user groups (TUG). The project targeted to rehabilitate around 2,000 tanks under original
financing and 1,225 tanks under additional financing. Further, 700 tanks were added to use savings of original project in 2010 which led to a revision of total project target from 3,225
tanks to 3,925 tanks. Out of these, 3,710 tanks have been taken up for implementation. The project has formed 3,126 TUGs to implement and manage these 3,710 tanks. A total of
1,742 tanks have or are about to be completed with handing over to TUGs and remaining 1,761 tanks are under implementation with overall progress of around 50% (10-90%). In 207

tanks, even though contracts have been awarded, the progress has been nil, therefore they have or will be dropped. For the tanks with the civil works at various stages of completion,
the non-civil works such as agricultural practices, fisheries, income generation activities, and training for operation and maintenance have been completed. In order to implement
ambitious target of more than 1700 tanks during additional financing period, the project was expecting to have two working seasons for civil works. However, the preparation took
longer than expected, with for instance setting up district project units in nine additional districts, the procurement of supporting key consultancies such as almost 60 NGOs and
Stopographical survey consultancies. Due to time taken in preparation for implementation and procurement of contracts, the project was left with one working season during 2011 only

works in these ongoing tanks as well as the proper handover process.

Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
The World Bank funding for the project is closing on January 31, 2012. The State of Karnataka made a request, supported by DEA, for a one year extension of the project in order to
complete the rehabilitation/modernization of the remaining tanks. However, considering that the project has demonstrated the viability of a community-based approach to tank
improvement and O&M through TUGs, it was decided to close the project. The state of Karnataka has committed to complete the project successfully and the project's Executive
Committee has recommended the allocation of budget for next year.
