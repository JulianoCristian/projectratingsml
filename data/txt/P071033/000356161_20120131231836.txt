A. SUMMARY

1. The proposed changes will support a requested cancellation of an amount of 23.3 SDR
million (US$ 35 million equivalent) from the Karnataka Community Based Tanks
Management Project (CR. IDA 36350, CR. IDA 36351-IN). The project will close on
January 31, 2012.

B. PROJECT STATUS

2. The project is scheduled to close on January 31, 2012. As of January 25, 2012, of the
IDA Credit (CR. IDA 36350, CR. IDA 36351-IN) of SDR 84.42 million combined,
approximately SDR 50.76 million (60.1%) has been disbursed (as of January 25, 2012).
The key project data are:

3. The Project Development Objective is to improve rural livelihoods and reduce poverty
by developing and strengthening community-based approaches to improving and
managing selected tank systems.

4. Of the remaining project resources, several withdrawal applications are in the claims
pipeline. After these claims are resolved, it is estimated that SDR 29.2 million will
remain (about SDR 17.52 million in IDA 36350, and SDR 11.68 million in IDA 36351-
IN). The proposed cancellation before the project closure is necessary to relinquish these
funds to the India program.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

3. Due to project closure scheduled for January 31, 2012, a portion of the credit will be
cancelled. The remainder un-cancelled amounts are preserved to allow for the
outstanding payments. IDA has received a request from the Government of Karnataka
through the Government of India, Ministry of Finance, Department of Economic Affairs
(DEA) requesting cancellation of SDR 23.34 million (US$35 million). Accordingly, the
revised category-wise allocation is given below for the SDR 13.34 cancellation of funds
from IDA 36350 (see Table 2). The remaining SDR 10 million will be cancelled from
IDA 36351-IN (see Table 3).
