for the Karnataka\n            Community-Based Tank Management Project for India were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory; risk to development\n            outcome was moderate; Bank performance was satisfactory and\n            borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned includes: community based tank engagement in\n            rehabilitation and management can work. The project\n            demonstrated the simplified procurement process through\n            communities for civil works that may be useful in other\n            tanks and other programs. Leadership is required at all\n            levels and produces dividends when in place. New models and\n            institutional mechanisms need considerable attention to\n            start up and scaling up issues and related capacity\n            development-with commitment to a longer development process,\n            and not rapid scaling up. A commitment to a longer process\n            should also limit the pressures for scaling-up too rapidly\n            until models are well tested. Managing common property\n            resources is highly challenging. Start simple and with tanks\n            systems which are likely to be successful. There needs to be\n            an institutional support system to continue testing and\n            refinements in the model. Monitoring, learning and\n            evaluation systems need to be integrated and evolve in a\n            concerted manner.
