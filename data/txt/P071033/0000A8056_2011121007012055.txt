                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project targets to rehabilitate about 3,800 tanks with a total command area of 164,000 ha. The tanks may be categorized into three groups with respect to source of funding:
                         Group 1: 1,829 tanks financed under original credit, Group 2: 841 tanks financed from the remaining funds under the original credit after substantial completion of Group 1 tanks, and
                         Group 3: 1,049 tanks financed from the Additional Financing (AF). A total of 1,525 Group 1 tanks have been handed over to Tank User Groups (TUG), with almost all remaining
                         tanks expected to be handed over by December 2011. In Group 2 tanks, the works are nearing completion in almost 200 tanks. A total of 900 Group 2 and 3 tanks are expected to

                         be completed by January 2012 with civil works. This means that the civil works will have to continue in 50% of the tanks after the current closing date of the project on January 31,
                         2012, and handover process will take place in all the 1800 tanks beyond the project period. Therefore, to complete the remaining works and handover process, followed by training on
                         operation and maintenance, one more year is needed. The next main working season will begin after February 2012.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         GGovernment and the Bank task team will continue to monitor on a regular basis the implementation of the integrated tank development plans to determine the number of tanks that
