MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF TOE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO INDIA
FOR A GAS FLARING REDUCTION PROJECT
1.        I submit, for your approval, the following  memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the Oil and Natural Gas Commission
(ONGC) (with the guarantee of the Government of India) for the equivalent of
US$450 million to help finance a project to eliminate gas flaring in the
Bombay High oil field. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable
interest rate with a maturity of 20 years including five years of grace. The
Government of India (GOI) would charge ONGC a guarantee fee of 1? per annum on
the outstanding amount of the Bank Loan.
Sector Background
2.        Energy remains critical for the success of the Government's efforts
to accelerate economic growth. The faster growth of the Indian economy during
the 1980s has strained the capacities of India's oil and gas industry, the
coal industry and the power sector to meet the country's energy needs. In
spite of massive investments in the development of indigenous energy
resources, energy demand continues to outstrip supply. In the years ahead the
Government will again face the difficult choice between a growing dependence
on oil imports and slower economic growth.
3.        Output from India's largest oil field, the Bombay High, has now
reached a plateau. Its output, which accounts for 70Z of indigenous oil
production, is likely to decline sharply in the coming years, unless oil
production targets are brought in line with sound oil field management
practices. In recent years ONGC has been under pressure from the Government
to maximize oil output in order to keep oil imports at manageable levels.
Delays in the implementation of programs that would have maintained reservoir
pressure have led to a sharp increase in the production of associated gas and
a reduction of the amount of oil that will be ultimately recovered from the
field. Lack of infrastructure facilities (compressor stations, pipelines,
etc.) have left ONGC with no choice but to flare an increasing share of
associated gas production; at present, about 12 million cubic meters of gas
are flared each day. To eliminate the flaring of gas and slow the decline in
oil production, ONGC needs to install facilities for pressure maintenance and
gas recovery and increase the capacity of the existing gas evacuation system.
The primary objective of the proposed project is to assist ONGC in these
efforts.
Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Operations
4.        Over the past decade the Government has increasingly recognized the
importance of natural gas as an energy source. It has given priority to the
development of gas fields and adopted a gas use policy expanding the use of
gas beyond the production of fertilizer, petrochemicals and liquified
petroleum gas (LPG) to power generation and industrial uses. The Bank has
supported these initiatives with a series of projects including the
development of the South Bassein and Gandhar gas fields, the review of the
Hazira-Bijaipur-Jagdishpur gas pipeline, and the construction of fertilizer
and combined-cycle power plants along this pipeline. Experience with these



projects has shown a critical need to co-ordinate the development of gas
fields and gas markets. The excessive flaring of gas in the Bombay High oil
field is largely the result of delays in the development of gas markets and
lack of investment in pipelines and other infrastructure facilities. To
ensure that gas will be used efficiently under the proposed project, the
marketing plans for gas have been reviewed with the Gas Authority of India
Ltd. (GAIL), fallback plans for the allocations of gas have been drawn up in
case some users are unable to utilize their gas allocations and a body will
be set up in the Department of Petroleum and Natural Gas that will monitor
progress in the implementation of projects to increase gas supplies as well as
projects to utilize gas.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
5.        The main objective of the Bank's strategy in the Indian oil and gas
sector remains to support the Government's efforts to reduce India's oil gap
and encourage the development and efficient use of gas resources. We intend
to achieve this through support for (i) improvements in the efficiency of oil
and gas exploration and development, in particular the elimination of gas
flaring; (ii) the development of gas markets; (iii) more extensive involvement
of international oil companies in these activities; and (iv) efforts to secure
external financing. The proposed project fits into this strategy. The Bank's
support for this project will greatly facilitate ONGC's efforts to mobilize
export and suppliers' credits. In addition, the project provides the Bank
with an opportunity to work closely with ONGC in reducing the risks of
offshore operations to the environment and in enhancing the safety of these
operations for ONGC'8 staff.
Project Objectives
6.        The project has four objectivess (a) to eliminate the flaring of
associated gas in the Bombay High oil field and improve the management of the
Bombay High reservoir in order to arrest the decline of oil production and
optimize the ultimate recovery of hydrocarbons; (b) to reduce energy shortages
and improve the efficiency of energy use in India's Western Region; (c) to
promote a greater involvement of the private sector in the oil and gas
industry in India, and (d) to support ONGC's efforts to improve the safety of
its offshore operations and reduce the risks to the environment from these
operations.
Proiect Description
7.        The proposed project comprises: (a) construction of two process
platforms as well as modifications on existing platforms; (b) construction of
three submarine gas pipelines; (c) expansion of the existing Hazira gas
terminal; (d) engineering, project management and other implementation
services; (e) reservoir performance and management studies; (f) package of
measures required to bring the managemevt of the reservoirs of the Bombay High
oil field in line with industry standards and practices and (g) measures to
mitigate environmental risks and enhance the safety of ONGC's offshore
operations.
8.        The proposed project would be carried out by ONGC, over a five year
period. The project cost is estimated at US$2,878 million equivalent, with a
foreign exchange component of US$1,982 million equivalent (691) and taxes and



- 3 -
duties estimated at about US$374 million equivalent. The total financing
required, including interest during construction, is US$3,184 million, of
which the Bank would finance US$450 million equivalent (20.6Z of the foreign
exchange and 14.2S of the total). Retroactive financing of up to US$45
million will be provided for eligible expenditures after October 31, 1990. A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule
are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and the status
of Bank Group operations in India are given in Schedule C and D, respectively.
The Staff Appraisal Report, No.9305-IN dated, May 31, 1991, is being
distributed separately. A map (No. IBRD 22892) is also attached.
Agreed Actions
9.        Agreement has been reached with the Government and ONGC on the
following major actionss
(a) GOI will implement a gas pricing policy which links domestic gas
prices to the import parity of fuel oil and discuss revisions of
this pricing policy by December 31, 1993, with the Bank;
(b) GOI will establish a body in the Department of Petroleum and
Natural Gas to monitor the implementation of oil and gas projects
on a quarterly basis and revise gas production plans accordingly;
(c) GOI will ensure that the allocation of gas to specific end-users is
guided by economic efficiency considerations;
Id) ONGC will annually review its investment program with the Bank as
well as the implications of this program on ONGC's financial
position;
(e) ONGC will maintain its current ratio at 1.2 times or higher, its
debt-service coverage ratio at 1.5 times or higher, and its
debt-to-equity ratio at no more than 1t5;
(f) ONGC will retain the services of a financial advisor for mobilising
foreign exchange resources;
(g) ONGC will carry out a safety audit for its entire offshore
operations, discuss the results with the Bank and implement the
recommendations of the audit;
(h) ONGC will carry out a safety engineering study of existing
platforms linked to facilities that will be constructed under the
project, discuss the results with the Bank and implement the
recommendations of the study; and
Ci) ONGC will carry out a review of its procurement and project
implementation organization, discuss the results of this review
with the Bank and implement its recommendations.
10.       The agreed conditions of effectiveness are:
(a) announcement inviting domestic and foreign oil companies to



participate in a fourth round of bidding for offshore and onshore
parcels selected by GOX for exploration;
(b)  obtaining of the environmental clear.nce for all components of the
proposed project; and
(c) establishing of a body in the Department of Petroleum and Natural
Gas which would monitor the implementation of gas supply and
utilization plans.
Environmental and Safety Issues
11.       Offshore oil and gas operations are hazardous to the environment
and the personnel involved. While the risks cannot be completely eliminated,
they can be minimized. The Environmental Impact Assessments for this project,
which have been reviewed by the Bank, indicate that the environmental impact
of the project will be within acceptable levels. While the construction of
platforms and the laying of pipelines will initially disrupt the seabed
conditions in their vicinity, the project would result in a net improvement in
the quality of the environment due to the substantial reduction of gas
flaring. Since the gas that will be transported in the pipelines does not
contain a significant concentration of hydrogen sulfide, even a large release
of gas into the atmosphere would not have a significant impact on the
environment. While the project does not pose any major environmental or
safety risks, ONGC's safety record of offshore operations is somewhat below
that of similar operations in industrial countries and should be Improved.
Recommendations for a safety audit and safety engineering studies are included
as part of the project.
Special Operational Emphases
12.       The project is in line with the Bank's emphasis on Improving the
efficiency of public sector enterprises and our assistance strategy for the
oil and gas sector. While ONGC has emerged as one of India's premier public
sector enterprises, which has been able to borrow in international financial
markets and has achieved a high level of technical competence, the company
would benefit from a continued association with the Bank. The fact that the
excessive flaring of natural gas in the Bombay High oil field is essentially
due to improper management of the Bombay High oil field, highlights the need
for a strengthening of ONGC's decision-making structure, particularly in the
area of project implementation. The project would provide the Bank with an
opportunity to assist ONGC in its efforts to improve its project
implementation capabilities and advise the Government on sectoral policy
issues, such as the pricing of gas and the involvement of international oil
companies in oil and gas exploration. Finally, our involvement in this
project would be critical for the success of ONGC's efforts to mobilize
cofinancing for the large foreign exchange requirements of this project.
Proiect Benefits
13.       The investments under the proposed project will eliminate the
flaring of about 12 MMCMD of gas and increase indigenous oil production by
about 4 million tons a year. The resulting increase in gas supplies will
reduce imports of naphtha, which would be otherwise required for the
manufacture of fertilizer, and of middle distillates for peak load lower



- 5 -
generation. This will save India about US$350 million of foreign exchange
annually (from 1995/96 onwards) that would otherwise be required for the
import of these fuels. The total net present value of the investments is
approximately US$1.3 billion. The economic rate of return is estimated at
302.
Risks
14.       The project faces three major risks: (i) delays in the
implementation of the project which would sharply reduce its viability, (ii)
delays in the offtake of the additional gas that will be made available
through the project, and (iii) the possibility that ONGC will not be able to
raise the foreign exchange required for the project. To minimize the risk of
implementation delays, ONOC has agreed to award the construction of major
items, such as platforms and submarine pipelines, on the basis of a series of
contracts under single responsibility. In addition, ONGC has worked closely
with the 3ank to streamline its organization and management for the
implementation of projects. The bidding documents for all but two of the
major components of the project will have been reviewed by the Bank before the
loan becomes effective. The risk of delays in the offtake of the gas will be
significantly reduced through the Government's decision to set up a special
monitoring body in the Department of Petroleum and Natural Gas that will
review, on a quarterly basis, the progress in implementing the proposed
project as well as the projects that will utilize the additional gas supplies.
The quarterly reports of the monitoring body will be submitted to the Bank for
review together with recommendations in the event of any slippage in project
implementation. The - mk will have an opportunity to review the
implementation of these recommendations. To minimize the risk that
difficulties in the financing of the foreign exchange components delays the
project, the Bank has worked closely with ONGC and the Government to ascertain
the availability of finance from official sources as well as export credit
agencies and suppliers credits.
Recommendation
15.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed loan.
