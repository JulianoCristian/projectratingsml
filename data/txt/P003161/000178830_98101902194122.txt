INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPEINT
REPORT AND RECOMMNDATICN OF THE PRESIDEN'T TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF ZAMBIA FOR AN
INTEGRATED FAMILY FARMING PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Zambia for the equivalent of US $11.5 million to
help finance a project for integrated family farming. The loan would
have a term of 20 years, including 5 years of grace, with interest at
7¼ percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Economic Position and Prospect of Zambia",
will be distributed to the Executive Directors shortly. The following is
a siumary of the mission's findings.
3.        Economic developments in 1970 and 1971 are in sharp contrast
with those up to 1969. Between 1964 and 1969 gross national income at
constant prices grew at an average rate of almost 17 percent a year. More
than half of this increase, however, resulted from an improvement in the
terms of trade (rising copper price), 1.5 percentage points from a
relative decline of factor payments abroad and 5.5-6 percentage points from
increase in production (GDP). The sliarp increase in world copper price
had placed Zambia in a strong financial position. The government's budget
and the balance of payments produced growing surpluses. In the course of
1970, however, the economic tide turned as a result of a combination of
unfavorable factors.
4.        The two most important factors were the sharp decline in copper
prices in the second half of 1970 from K1200 to K780 a ton and, in
September, 1970, the partial flooding of the Mufulira mine which accounted
for 25 percent of Zambia's copper output. As a result of lower copper
price and production losses, the value of copper output in 1971 was 40
percent lower than in 1969. GNP per capita is estimated to have fallen from
$425 in 1969 to about $355 in 1971.
5.        The decline in price and output of copper had a strong adverse
effect on government revenue and -the balance of payments. The deterioration
in the budgetary situation, however, was compounded by two additional
factors: First, recurrent expenditures had been allowed to increase sharply
due to higher outlays on defense and subsidies to cover losses of agri-
cultural parastatals. Second, government revenue from the mining sector
declined because of higher capital allowances granted under the 1969 Master
Agreement governing state participation in the mining industry. Previously,



capital depreciation allowances were based on estimated asset life but, in order to
provide incentive for an increase in productive capacity from sorne 720,000 tons p.a.
in 1970/1 to some 900,000 tons by 1976, all capital expenditure was made
tax deductible in the year it occured. As a result, the recurrent budget,
which had a surplus of K176 million in 1970 - more than enough to finance
all development expenditures - showed a deficit of K18 million in 1971.
Foreign reserves declined from a peak of Kh432 million in August 1970 to
K1OO million in Junie 1972, equivalent to 3 months' imports.  However, this
sharp decline cannot be explained by the unfavorable development of prices
and output of copper alone.  A contributory factor may have been an increase
in capital flight.
6.          The government is very much concerned with restoring financial
balance. To improve the balance of payments, it has banned certain
categories of imports, increased customs duties, levied a temporary surtax
on imports, and introduced a number of measures to curb capital flight,
such as stricter control of import licenses and remittances abroad.  To
improve the budgetary situation, the recurrent budget for 1972 i,as cut by
20 percent as compared to the actual level in 197:1. On the revenue side,
income tax was increased and some excise taxes were raised.  In spite of
these measures, the overall budget is again likely to show a large deficit
in 1972. In order to keep deficit financing within manageable limits,
government development expenditure, which had already been cut in the begin-
ning of the year, underwent a further cut in July, and may in 1972 be no
more than 60 percent (in real terms) of the level attained in recent years.
7.          The government has prepared its Second IHational Development Plan
(siNDP) covering 1972-76. The program of government development expenditure
in the SIPT contains, apart from a large component of continuing infra-
structure investments following Southern Rhodesia's unilateral declaration
of independence in 1965, high priority projects for education, urbanization
and the hitherto negfllected traditional rural sector.  Public investment in
the plan is estimated at about Kn,100 m. which, in real terms, amounts to a
moderate increase of some 3 percent a year over the level attained in 1969-1971.
8.          The government expected 35 percent of this program to be financed
by disbuirsements from external and internal borrowing, and another 35 percent
by budget surpluses (assuming no changes in taxation), leaving a gap of some
30 percent, which it expected to cover by new tax measures.  This financial
plan, however, was drawn up before the effect on government savings of
lower Drice and output of copper as well as increased recurrent expenditure
had become fully apparent. Recurrent revenue, which is highly sensitive to
the copper price, uould show a substantial increase if copper price were to
rise again. However, the Bank's best estimate is that copper prices will
fluctuate around 50 to 53 US cents/lb. over the next five years, which is not
mruich higher thanat present. At that price level, and with the present tax
7''   budget surpluses are estimated to finance not much more than 5 percent
of government development expenditure over the SUJDP period.
/I Including the full capacity of Mufulira



9.        The government savings constraint is likely to be severest in
the first half of the SNDP period.  In the latter half, some ilmiprovement
may be expected from the expected increase in copper production from
633,000 tons in 1971 to some 900,000 tons by 1976. This expansion will come
from mining investments already started, stimulated by the new system of
capital allowances, and the rehabilitation of the Mufu Hra mine. P'uxthermore,
the capital expenditure program in the mining industry is concentrated in
the first half of the SNDP and government revenue is more affected in that
period than in the latter half.
10.       Because of the government's decision in 1969 and 1970 to limit
foreign borrowing at a time of abundant resources, the anmount of disburse-
ments from foreign loans during thte next two years will be relatively small.
In the future some relief may be expected from an accelerated preparation
of projects for foreign financing and from local coss financing provided by
foreign lenders. Domestically the greatest potential for increasing revenue
is in indirect taxes. Zambia does not have a sales tax and, in spite of
recent increases, import duties are still very loW. An added advantage of
a higher level of indirect taxation is that it would make government revenaue
somewhat less dependent on the vicissitudes of the copper industry.
11.       It is certain, however, tha G in spite of all efforts the plan will
have to be cut in size, in particular in the early years. This was, iIl fact,
already done in 1972. Although the Plan recognizes the unstable nature of
the economy and mentions the possibility of inevitable readjustments, it
offers no guidance as to what programs to cut in the event that available
resources fall short of expectations.  In view of the present financial diffi-
culties, it is necessary for the government to reconsider the relative priority
of the programs in the plan in order to ensure that whatever resources are
available are put to the best use.
12.       Zambia's external public debt (including undisbursed) amounted to
,T795 million (K568 million) at the end of 1971.  This amount includes -the
two government guaranteed 6 percent bond issues (total $261i million still
outstanding) to compensate the copper companies for the gove-nment's equit-
participation (ZTICO bonds), and the Chinese loan for the Tan-Zam railway
($200 million). Indebtedness to IBRD, including government guaranteed debt,
amounted to $133 million, of which $34 million was guaranteed by the U.K.
13.       Service payments on the ZIM4CO bonds will amount to $40 million a
year through 1977/78 and $21 million a year from 1978/79 through 1981/82.
These payments do not burden the budget as long as the copper price does
not fall below 48 US cents/lb., since the government then will receive
sufficient dividends on its participations to meet them.  Also, the net
effect on the balance of payments is smaller than the absolute amounts suggest
since the service payments replace dividends wrhich in the absence of govern-
ment participation would have been remitted abroad. The Chinese railway loan
is interest free. Amortization of this loan will amount to $6.7 million a
year from 1983 through 2012. Service on the total existing external public



debt, including the ZIMCO bonds will amount to 10 percent of export earnings
in 1972; excluding the ZIMCO bonds it represents 5 percent. The debt service
ratio for existing debt is expected to decline to less than 1.5 percent by
1985.
1L.       Thus, there is scope for further borrowing abroad on conventional
terms. Even if, as is probable, the investment program of the SNDP is cut
substantially, Zambia's need to borrow would be greater than it has been.
15.       Given the current and prospective public savings constraint,
foreign lending limited to the foreign exchange component of eligible
priority projects will not provide capital in the amounts needed to
sustain an adequate level of investment. Some local expenditure financ-
ing is required, as proposed in the present case.
16.       A country data sheet is attached as Annex II.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
17.       The Bank has made twelve loans to Zambia and IFC one investment.
Four loans were made for railways and electric power before Zambia became
independent and are guaranteed by the UK as well as Zambia. After inde-
pendence, three loans were made for agricultural development, two for
education, two for highways and the last one was for the Kariba North
hydro-electric station. Total lending to date has been $167.1 million
(after cancellations), of which $83.9 million is for electric power,
$L47.2 million for transportation, $22.7 million for education and
$13.3 million for agriculture. Six loans are fully disbursed and
the first loan made in 1953 (No. 74-RN), was repaid in full in February
1972. The IFC made its first investment in Zambiia in February 1972,
providing $1.1 million for expansion of a shoe manufacturing company.
Annex I contains a summary statement of Bank and IFC operations as of
Noveniber 30, 1972.
18.       The cost of the Kariba North hydro-electric project, for which
the Bank made a loan of $40 million in July 1970 to cover the foreign
exchange expenditure, has proved to be substantially higher than estimated
at the time of appraisal. Already when bids were opened, it became clear
that the foreign exchange expenditure alone would be more than $10 million
higher. That increase was attributable to world wide price increases on
heavy electrical equipment over and above appraisal estimates and high
contingency allowances included by contractors in their bids for unexpected



expenditures arising from Zambia's position as a land-locked country depend-
ing on supply routes through the territories of unfriendly neighbors.
Subsequently, the international currency realignment in December, 1971,
delayed provision of access roads to the site and staff housing on the site,
une,xpected application of strict safety regulations oC the Mining Act, and
adverse rock conditions, have caused further significant increases in cost.
The main civil works contractor has requested a revision of his contract
to take developments into account; negotiations between the contractor and
the Zambians have been held during the past several months but no revision
of the contract has been agreed. The cost estimates and work schedules
for the project will depend on the arrangements finally made. When these
matters are clarified, I shall consider whether to recommend that the
Bank's commitment be increased to cover the full foreign exchange component
of the cost as revised.
19.       In line with Zambia's development objectives, the Bank group expects
to continue assisting Zambia in diversifying and strengthening its economic
base. To maintain its development effort in the face of the current
financial problems, and in view of the near impossibility of providing for
the investment financing gap in the immediate future through project assist-
ance, Zambia has requested the Bank for a program loan. We are reviewing
this request and a special economic mission will be in Zambia in January
to appraise the government's investment program and fiscal efforts.   Zambia
has also requested the IMF for a stand-by credit and the Bank and the Fund
are closely coordinating their review of the financial situation and the
financing needs for the calendar years 1973 and 1974. For future project
lending, the Bank places the priority on assistance for agriculture and
education as well as on infrastructure such as power, communications and
transport, essential for development. To meet growing mining and ocher
industrial demands for energy, the government has sought Bank assistance for
the second stage of the Kafue II hydro-electric project. A mixed farming
project to increase livestock and maize production is expected to be
appraised shortly, and an integrated rural development project forming part
of the government's new policy of intensive economic and social development
in designated zones is at the planning stage. A third education project,
comprising agricultural, technical and health training facilities, has been
appraised. Bank assistance for telecommunications and urbanization is
anticipated. A DFC loan, and one for tourism are among other possibilities
being discussed with the government.



6-
PART III - AGRICULTURE IN ZAMBEIA
20.        Zambian society is characterized by a marked difference in standards
of living between the urban and the rural population. Almost half of the popu-
lation is involved in the modern economy, which consists of the copper industry,
a relatively important manufacturing sector and a small large-scale commercial
agricultural sector. Most of the modern sector is concentrated in the central
part of the country. For the remainder of the population, small-scale, traditional
agriculture offers the only mode of livelihood. The vast difference in productivity
in different sectors, and hence in standards of living is illustrated by the fact
that in 1971 the average value added per worker in the industrial sector (includ-
ing mining) was K2,920; in commercial agriculture it was K870, and in the tradi-
tional agricultural sector only K190.
21.       Although narrowing the gap between urban and rural incomes has been
the government's main social and economic objective ever since independence in
196h, very little progress has been achieved so far.   In fact, the urban-rural
income gap has widened. For reasons of equity, expenditures for traditional
agriculture were thinly spread over the country and did not have any significant
impact anywhere. Also, as producer prices of the main agricultural commodities
were not allowed to increase as fast as non-agricultural consumer prices, the
purchasing power of farmers' income has declined. On the other hand, urban
incomes have increased by an annual average of about six percent in real terms
since independence. The vast difference in urban and rural standards of living
caused a substantial drift from the land. On the basis of the increase in
urban population and employment it can be estimated that the number of people
who are solely dependent for their livelihood on small-scale agriculture has
decreased from almost 60 percent of the total population in 196L to about
50 percent now.
22.       The statistics in Zambia are not sufficient to give a clear picture
of the development of agriculture. The agricultural sector as a whole con-
tributes about 15 percent of GDP. The subsistence sector, with a labor force
of about 610,000 persons contributes about 4 percent; the commercial sector,
with a labor force of 50,000 persons, contributes 11 percent. Little is known
about the performance of the subsistence sector. Production for own use is
assumed to have grown at the same rate as the rural population, which is less
than 1 percent a year. The output of the commercial sector as a whole has
remained stagnant, but within the sector there are interesting trends. At
ind^pen^.encc, commercial farming was dominated by some 1,200 European farmers.
Since independence, many of them have left the country and production
in particular of maize, tobacco, beef and dairy products, has fallen. At the
same time, however, production by emerging Zambiarn commercial farmers has
increased, but not yet enough to make up for the losses in the European
sectors. Most notable were increases in production of cotton and poultry
3 Zaimibian commercial farmers are growing an increasing proportion of maize.



-7-
With a rapidly increasing, relatively well-off urban population and a stagrnat-
ing agricultural output, the need for food imports has increased. In 1967,
food imports amounted to K21 million, or 7 percent of the import bill. In
1971, food imports had increased to K39 million -- 10 percent of total imports.
23.       In the recently published Second National Development Plan 1972-1976,
the government's main objective of narrowing the urban-rural income gap is
restated. But recognizing the failure of agricultural policies up to now,
the government has chosen a different approach. For the agricultural sector
the main objectives are to improve the productivity of traditional agriculture
and to induce progressive Zambian farmers to take the place of the European
farmers who left the country, all this to make Zambia self-sufficient in most
food products and to restore agricultural exports, mainly of tobacco, to pre-
independence levels.
2I.       The Bank is assisting in all these aspects.    The present project As
meant to help emerging small commercial farmers to enter the cash economy.
Another project to establish larger-scale Zambian commercial farmers mostly
on land abandoned by European farmers is about to be appraised. The most
difficult challenge, however, is to raise *the productivity of the large
traditional sector. Recognizing the failure of spreading efforts too thinly
over the country, the government has now chosen the concept of "Intensive
Development Zones" (IDZ's). The IDZ concept corresponds to the concept of
integrated rural development, which has been successfully introduced in
Ethiopia and Malawi.   The government plans to start IDZ's in two or three
areas with sufficient potential, and if successful, increase the number of
IDZ's over the years. Attempts to increase agricultural productivity by
making available packages of inputs will be accompanied by investments to
improve the quality of life in rural areas, such as in community centers,
rural electrification and water supply, health facilities and village
industries. The Bank is assisting in formulating plans for IDZ's, but
concrete projects are still at an early planning stage.
25.       The capability to plan and implement programs and projects for rural
development has improved considerably over the last two years. The most
serious constraints lie in the supporting services, and these constraints are
closely related to the lack of skilled manpower at all levels. Important
services such as marketing and credit provision are performed by rural para-
statals which have been established in recent years to take over functions
previously performed by the private sector. The effects of poor management
were compounded by the fact that the rural parastatals took on more functions
than they could handle. The government recognizes the sorry state of the
rural parastatals and is trying to improve the situation with the help of
valuable advice provided by the Ford Foundation. The Bank, in all its projects,
is paying great attention to the institutional aspects and to the training of
Zambian managers.



-8-
26.       The shortage of extension workers is also a serious constraint.
In all branches of the Zambian economy the lack of skilled manpower is a
major bottleneck, but in agriculture the situation is aggravated by a
general lack of interest in agricultural work. Zambia offers a comparatively
prosperous high wrage alternative to life in rural areas. The preference for
a more pleasant urban living affects the students' choice. In order to change
these attitudes, the government is changing the educational system, which was
traditionally geared to preparing students for clerical jobs. It has taken
steps to introduce agricultural education in both primary and secondary schools,
but effective teaching is hampered by a shortage of qualified staff. The
government has also established a number of institutions for post-secondary
agricultural education. The Bank has recently appraised a third education
project which will include, among other things, establishing a faculty of
agriculture at the university and expansion and upgrading of facilities for
training both farmers and extension workers.
27.       To keep school leavers interested in agriculture, however, it is
necessary to provide prospects of rural living not significantly inferior to
life in towns. This underscores the importance of the government's agricul-
tural price and subsidy policies. Real urban wages have increased much faster
than rural incomes since independence by the policy of increasing agricultural
producer prices relatively slowly, and at the same time subsidizing the con-
sumer prices of basic agricultural products. The government recognizes that
this has caused a widening of the urban-rural income gap and also an increasing
burden on the budget but has found it politically difficult to change the
situation. The present financial difficulties, however, have made the govern-
ment more aware than ever of the need for changes. A wages policy is being
developed to keep urban wages in line with trends in productivity and govermn-
ment action is expected to bring consumer prices for basic agricultural
products in line with actual costs, and to establish producer prices that
provide sufficient incentives.



- 9-
PART IV - THE PROJECT
28.         The present project would promote development of small holder
farms for traditional subsistence and cash farming. It has been developed
from a component included in the proposal for the Commercial Crops farming
Development Project (Loan No. 685-ZA) which was dropped at appraisal because
more careful preparation was needed. The Tobacco Board of Zambia
(TBZ) has been responsible for preparation, with help from the Permanent
Mission in Eastern Africa (PMEA). Field appraisal took place in February/March
1972. Negotiations followed in November with a delegation of representatives
of the government and TBZ, led by Mr. E. Willima, Permanent Secretary, Minis-
try of Rural Developmrent.
29.         The project would provide assistance for 900 existing and 5,400
new farmers to grow some 6,300 hectares of hybrid maize and 5,000 hectares of
Virginia flue cured tobacco at the end of the first five years of a nine
year program, ultimately designed for 8,800 farmers.  Most farms would be
in the Eastern and Southern Provinces and a few located in the Western
Province. The project would include:
a) development by the farmers and their families of 11.5 ha.
faIms;
b)  development of crop extraction roads, anti-erosion struc-
tures, wfater supplies, baling centers, schools and dispen-
saries;
c) establishment of tree nurseries for the purposes of conser-
vation and fuel provision;
d)  seasonal credit for fertilizer, seed, etc. and medium-term
loans for curing barns and grading sheds; and
e)  provision for project management and expansion of extension
and credit services to farmers.
A Loan and Project Summary is given at Annex III. The Appraisal Report
(Appraisal of Integrated Family Farming Project, Zambia, Report No. PA--lla)
is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors.
30.         The project areas consist of open woodland with tree species provi-
ding ideal fuel for tobacco curing. Soil and climate are well suibed for
flue-cured tobacco and maize production. Both crops are grown, although
tobacco has not been grown by traditional farmers. Maize is generally gro-wn
for subsistence only and yields are low. Population density ranges from 10
to 37 families per square kilometer, with some 8 persons in each family on
the average. In some project areas farmers are established on their own farms.
Other areas are vacant and would be settled.



_ 10 -
31.       Most of the areas selected for development consist of Reserve or
Trust Land where customary tribal rights of use prevail. To participate
in the project, farmers in such areas would need to have sufficient land
to maintain a satisfactory farming rotation and enough natural timber for
at least four years of tobacco curing. Since on-farm investment would be
limited, requiring no mortgaging of assets, the lack of title would not
impair execution. On State Land, i.e. former commercial estates where
individual titles can be issued, holdings of 11-5 ha or more of arable
land and required additional woodland would be developed and leased to
participants. There is no shortage of eligible farmers.
Execution of Project
32.       The Tobacco Board of Zambia (TBZ), which is responsible for
implementing the Commercial Crops Farming Development project, would
also be charged with execution of the proposed project. TBZ is a statu-
tory body entrusted with development and marketing of tobacco in Zambia.
The present Manager, Family Farming Schemes, w,uld be the Project Manager,
reporting to the Head of the Tobacco Production Department of the TBZ.
He would be assisted by a deputy and managers in each of the three provinces
served by the project. Project and credit accounting would be provided by
the TBZ accounting division.
33.       Employment by TBZ of a qualified Project Manager and managers in
the three provinces where the project is to be developed would be a condition
for effectiveness of the proposed loan. The Bank would be given the opportunity
to comment on these appointments before the expiration of their probationary
periods.
34.       The proposed project is expected to be completed by December 31,
1978 at a cost of about $15.3 million, excluding import duties and taxes.
Of this total, $2.4 million would be for credit to farmers, $4s.6 million
for construction and equipment, $5.8 million for project management and
administration and $2.5 million for physical and price contingencies.
These estimates are based on pilot project experience during the last
three years, with adjustments for recent price developments. Experience
in Zambia and elsewhere indicates that it takes at least five years of
concentrated extension and administrative effort to ensure the success
of settlement schemes and for farmers to become fully familiar with the
crorrnnr Prn handling of a non-traditional crop such as tobacco.  The
costs of administration and extension have therefore been considered
as investment costs for the five-year development period. Staffing
requirements at the initial phase of development (l extension worker
to 20 growers) reflect the fact that the project would be the first
of its kind in Zambia and that growers would have no experience in
tob&cco production.  When full production is reached, there would be
one extension worker to 50 growers, the same ra-tio as for correspond-
ing projects in other African countries.



- li -
35.       The proposed loan would cover 75 percent of the project cost, includint
the entire foreign exchange component, estimated at $7.0 million, and one half
of the local currency cost. The government has agreed to meet the balance of
the cost.  About $9.6 million from the proposed loan would be passed on to the
TBZ as a grant together with the government's budgetary allocations to finance
the cost of infrastructure and agricultural services. About $1.9 million of the
loan would be relent at 71¼ percent to the TBZ to provide medium-term and
seasonal credit to farmers participating in the project. The portion required
for medium-term, $0.7 million, would be repaid by the TBZ to the government
over 14 years including 7 years of grace; the portion required for seasonal
credit, $1.2 million, would remain at the disposal of the TBZ for 20 years or
such longer period as the goverment may agree. A Project Financing Agreement
between the government and TBZ would lay down the terms and conditions of
transferring the proceeds of the proposed Bank loan to TBZ; its signature
would be a condition of effectiveness for the Bank loan.
36.         Each farmer under the project would receive a medium-terni lo1,n of
K166 ($231) against delivery by the TBZ of materials needed in construction
of curing barns and a grading shed. TBZ would also provide assistance in
construction, but; the farmer and his family would carry out the bulk of the
work. MIedium-term loans would be repayable over five years and carry interest
at 91:-% p.a. Seasonal credits of approximately K1OJ3 ($200) per family would
be available to finance farmers' inputs of tobacco seedlings and maize seeds,
fertilizer, insecticides, polythene sheeting and, in the first three years,
tractor hiring for basic tillage. Interest on seasonal loans would be payable
at 12% p.a.  Interest on both types of loan would provide TBZ with a margin
-to cover administration and bad debts.
Project Evaluation
37.         An interesting feature of the proposed project is the provision for
project evaluation.  Under the Project Agreement TBZ will undertake to prepare
annual project evaluation and progress reports and to submit by January 31 each
year such reports to the Borrower and the Bank for the previous crop year.   The
evaluation would offer an opportunity to analyse all project data in an inte-
grated manner and to make better use of experience gained in planning for the
future. It would be a condition for effectiveness of the Loan Agreement that
TBZ agree with the Bpnk on a detailed proposal for carrying out project
evaluation.
TBZ Financial Condition
38.         TBZ's financial condition is marked by a heavy service burden on
government loans which constitute 80% of its capital. The loans were granted
to TBZ's predecessor to finance construction of an auction floor and a
packing plant which were designed for a sizeable increase in tobacco produc-
tion not yet realized and, therefore, do not produce the expected revenue, As
a result, TBZ depends on subvention from government to meet payments on the
loans from government.  A few months ago, government decided as a matter of
policy to place parastatal organizations on a sound financial basis. Accor-
dingly, it has undertaken under the draft Loan Agreement to submit detailed
proposals for the recapitalization of TBZ by mid-1973 and to implement such
proposals according to a schedule to be agreed with the Bank.

Marketing of Tobacco
39.       Existing Zambian growers are likely to face more severe competition
for export markets in the future whether or not the present embargo on tobacco
from Southern Rhodesia remains in effect. Virtually all exports go to the UK
where Zambian tobacco, representing less than 1.5% of UK's tobacco imports,
receives a premium price due to high quality; it also enjoys a Commonwealth
preference of KO.29 per kg. With the UK joining the EEC, Zambia may accept
an offer to become an Associated Overseas Territory of the EEC which would
enable her to enjoy the existing preference in the UK until August 1973 when
a new arrangement to be negotiated would take effect. As an Associated Over-
seas Territory, Zambia would enjoy a preference in the EEC of KO.200-0.236
per kg tobacco against third countries. Even with these lower preferences,
Zambian tobacco should fetch remunerative prices. The eventual legal re-
entry of Southern Rhodesian tobacco on the world market, and the possible
future association of Southern Rhodesia with the EEC, add uncertainty to
any appraisal of the marketing situation for Zambian tobacco. As a major
producer of qualities similar to Zambian tobacco, Southern Rhodesia could
have a significant impact on export prices. But even if some of the existing
Zambian production should prove unremunerative, the particularly low costs of
production under the proposed project should permit its output to compete
successfully.
Tobacco Prices
ho.       Since 1969/70 crop, tobacco growers have enjoyed a government
guaranteed minimum price at auctions. The guaranteed price was originally
the equivalent of KO.836 per kg but was raised to KO.90 per kg for the
1971/72 crop. Prices obtained at auctions have generally been lower than
these guaranteed levels, with the result that subsidies have had to be
paid. In 1969/70 the subsidy averaged K(.176 per kg, in 1970/71 KO.150
per kg and in 1971/72 KO.l1O per kg. The subsidy, which has cost the
government about K80,000 a year, is said to be compensating growers for
increased labor costs, reflecting, in particular, higher statutory minimum
wages.
41.       The subsidy arrangement applies to al]. tobacco growers and would
also benefit farmers under the project. However, project farmers would not
need the subsidy since low on-farm capital cost and sole reliance on family
>b.or wol-d ensure viability of their operation. During negotiations the
government representatives stated that, as a result of a recent change in
government policy, the tobacco price subsidy was likely to be abolished
before tobacco from the project would reach the auction floor.   If that
should not be the case, the Loan Agreement provides that the Borrower
"take all necessary steps" to ensure that project farmers "shall not
benefit on account of any tobacco price subsidy accorded by the Borrower
to tobacco growers generally".

Economic j ustification
42.       Annual production in the project area would increase from 400,000
to about 8.8 million kg of tobacco, and of maize from 2.7 million kg to 39.4
million kg. This would enhance family cash incomes of the farmers from
K25 ($35) to K400 ($560) per year without reducing subsistence production.
The 9-year program, of which the project forms part, would eventually
provide full-time employment for some 30,000 adults. Estimated annual
foreign exchange earnings would be $8.5 million.
43.       The government would, after seven years of outlays, benefit fron a
net inflow of revenue From the project and, after 20 years, this would have
accumulated to K4.5 million ($6.3 million). Revenues would flow back from
three sources: first, interest payments by TBZ on that part of the Bank loan
which would be onlent to provide credit to farmers; second, a development
levy collected by TBZ for the government, currently amounting to KO.103 per
kg of tobacco sold which, over twenty years, would cover 85 percent of the
present value of all development expenditure directly related to the tobacco
crop, discounted at 10 percent; third, incremental proceeds from indirect
taxes as a result of increased spending by the project farmers.
44.       The TBZ would benefit from increased usage of its presently under-
utilized packing plant and auction floor, with consequential financial
benefits.
45.       Internal rate of return of the project is estimated at about 20 per-
sent assuming a gradual decline in auction prices from the 1968-71 average of
KO.69 per kg to KO.64 per kg in year 5 and onwards.   If tobacco price should
drop by 20 percent, the return would be 14 percent. Even if both Southern
Rhodesia and Zambia should become associated territories to -the EEC, and
world tobacco prices should drop by 30 percent, the return would still be
at least 10 percent.
Procurement and Disbursement
46.       Procurement would be in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines.
Orders for annual requirements would, when possible, be bulked to facilitate
international procurement, which would be required when the estimated cost
of an order exceeds $30,000. Such orders would include tractors, vehicles,
road construction and irrigation equipment, fertilizer, corrugated iron
roofing and polythene sheeting. Total procurement subject to international
competitive bidding would be about $3 million. A preference margin of
15 percent of the c.i.f. price or the applicable customs duty, whichever is
lower, would be accorded domestic suppliers of fertilizer. Small items, such
as office equipment, to a total of about $100,000, would be bought locally.
Because of the remoteness and dispersion of the sites, project buildings,
roads, conservation works and water supplies to the value of about $3.3
million would be undertaken by TBZ force account.
47.       The credit would be disbursed against the c.i.f. cost of imported
equipment and 73 percent of other expenditures on the project.

Ecology
48.       The greater part of the indigenous forest in the project area would
be consumed as firewood for tobacco curing, but would be replaced by new
plantings. Planning and layout of project areas would take conservation
needs into account. No persistent insecticides and weedicides would be
applied.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
49.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Zambia and the
Bank, the draft Project Agreement between the Bank and the Tobacco Board
of Zambia, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a resolution
approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. The loan documents conform to the normal pattern for agricultural
projects.
50.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
51.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C. COMMENTS ON CnURRENTLY ACTIVE PROJECTS
$5.3 million loan (No. 562-ZA) of October 5, 1968 for Industrial Forestry
Proiect:
Execution of the project is making more rapid progress than expected
at the time of appraisal. There is a lack of accountants and the project
management still relies on the services of a member of our Agriculture Develop-
ment Service. We have suggested that government seek technical assistance from
bilateral sources un-til qualified Zambian accountants become available. Project
costs have proved to be higher than expected so that the disbursement percentage
applicable to expenditures other than direct imports will have to be reduced
from L4 to 25.
$2.5 million loan (No. 627-ZA) of June 30, 1969 for Livestock Development:
The project was expected to be completed by mid 1974 and developmenL
has begun on all bu-t one of the beef ranches. However, progress is now at a
standstill and serious financial problems have emerged. Financial viability
of the Zambia Cattle Development Limited (ZCDL), which is responsible for
execution, and also of some of the ranches to be developed under the project,
is uncertain. Management problems and government policy which held down prices
on beef and milk while costs rose rapidly are the principal causes. At the
government's request the Bank and Barclays Bank, a co-lender, assisted govern-
ment. officials in reappraising the project. W4e concluded that the project be
reduced to include on'ly those components which offer promise of becoming
viable, that management be given authority to operate fully on a commercial
basis, that organizational changes be introduced to that end, and that prices
on beef and milk be raised. The government has subsequently raised these
prices and is considering the other recommendations.
$5.5 million loan (No. 685-7Z) of June 5, 1970 for Commercial Crops
Farming Development:
The project is scheduld for completion in mid-1979. After a slow
start, the project now is making satisfactory progress. So far, 66 assisted
tenants have been settled, twenty-three of them since the end of the last
growing season.  During that season, assisted tenants produced 400,650 kg
tobacco, representing 7% of the national crop; yields were slightly above
the national average of 901 kg/ha.
$17.4 million loan (No. 592-ZA) of April 11, 1969 for Secondary Education
After considerable initial delays, the project was making satis-
factory progress until the beginning of   1972   when the government, as
part of its effort to reduce expenditures, decided that implementation
should be stretched over two additional years. As a result, the present
Closing Date of September 30, 1974 will have to be postponed until March
1977. We are discussing the matter with the government.



ANNEX I
Page 4
A difference of view between the government and the Bank over the
type of courses to be offered by the Northern Technical College (NORTEC)
has delayed implementation of this component of the project. While the
Bank would prefer to continue with part-time courses in conjunction with
on-the-job training, the government's Commission for Technical Education
and Training has insisted on introducing full-time courses. There is now
agreement on a combination of the two systems and NORTEC will be redesigned
and proceeded with.
$5.3 million loan (No. 645-ZA) of November 20, 1969 for University Education:
The project has progressed satisfactorily and reached an advanced
stage of implementation. The project manager has recently departed as his
contract expired and the project accountant is deputizing until a new manager
is appointed.
$40.0 million loan (No. 701-ZA) of July 29, 1970 for the Kariba North Bank
Hyro-electric Power Project:
This project is dealt with in paragraph 18 of the report.
