       will increase Tanzania's annual processing capacity\n            from 73,000 tons to 103,000 tons of raw cashewnuts all\n            produced by smallholders, thereby increasing the local value\n            added and creating employment for about 3,000 persons. It\n            will increase Tanzania's foreign exchange earnings and\n            contribute to raising producers income. The project will\n            finance the construction and equipping of three factories\n            with a total processing capacity of 30,000 tons of raw nuts,\n            the expansion of cashewnut shell liquid storage facilities,\n            the construction of staff accommodations and water and power\n            supply facilities. It will also finance a cashewnut research\n            program, an occupational health hazards study, and the\n            provision of technical assistance for CATA. The project\n            faces commercial risks, typical of undertakings of this\n            nature, given the uncertainty of future raw cashewnut and\n            cashewnut kernels export prices. However, it is considered\n            unlikely that cashewnut kernels prices will fall below a\n            level which will reduce the economic rate of return to an\n            unacceptable level."}, "docdt": "1978-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
