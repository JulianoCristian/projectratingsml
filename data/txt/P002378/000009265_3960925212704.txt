POECT COMPLEION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF SEYCHELLES
TRANSPORT PROJECT
(L,AN 2492-SEY)
PREFACE
Ihis is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Transport Project in Seychelles for
which Loan 2492-SEY in the amount of USS 6.2 million was approved on February 12, 1985. The
project was completed in December 31, 1990, two years beb!nd schedule. The credit was closed on
December 31, 1990, and was fully disbursed. The project was cofinanced (under
separate parallel financing arrangements) by the African Development Bank (AfDB),
and the Norweigian Export Council (NEC).
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division of the South Central and
Indian Ocean Department of the African Region (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III). On
January 23, 1992, the Bank sent the Borrower a draft of Parts I and m with the request to prepare
Part II. The Rorrower;s comments received on March 30, 1992 were incorported as Part II of the
PCR.
Ihe present document is based inter alia on the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR), the Loan
Agreement, internal Bank documents, correspondence between IDA and the Borrower, consultants
progress reports, and a final report issued by the Borrower on April 3, 1991.

TRANSPORT PROJECT
N 2492-SEY)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
1.    Ojcie
The Transport Project, first and only Bank-financed project in :he country, was conceived
with the objective to improve the capacity and quality of the transport system, within a sectoral
strategy which aimed at supporting the provision of cost effective services and limit foreign exchange
expenditures (paras. 2.01-03). It had two distinct components: the commercial port construction, and
the road rehabilitation/maintenance strengthening (paras. 3.01-03). 'he project design and
organization were simple and well adapted to a Borrower with !:ii:.ed experience in Bank projects
(paras. 4.01-02).
2.      Iementience
The two components of the Project were implemented more like two separate projects than a
single one. The port component was implemented as initially planned both in scope and with a
relatively smail delay (para. 5.01). The implementation of the road component was delayed by almost
three years because of lack of counterpart funding, other activities in the sector, and reluctance of
project staff to embark on rehrhilitation works of the scope initially envisaged (para. 5.02). The road
component was evenually implemented titisfactorily after being amended with Bank approval (para.
5.03). Overall project cost were lower than at appraisal by 3.6 % (para. 5.01 and table 5).
3.    Results
The project results were very satisfactory in general. The physical output of the road
component was larger than expected without cost increase, in spite of the negative cost impact of the
revaluation of the local currency (para.6.02 and table 6.4). The road traffic grew on average by 3%
p.a. on Mahe, the main island from 1984 to 90. The port traffic was actually higher than expected at
appraisal by 45 % in 1989 (para. 6.02 and table 6.1).
The overall project recalculated Economic Rate of Return (ERR) was 31 % to compare with
the appraisal ERR of 18%, wh!±h indicates a very good economic justification for both project
components (para. 6.03 and Tablt 6-Indicator 7).
Efficient stitutions were developed in the road sector, as well as good road maintenance
practices (para. 6.04). However, the departure of the two top level staff of Land Transport Division
(LTD) at project completion posed a serious problem which has been solved only partly (para. 6.04).
As for the port, the Borrower failed to make use of a study recommendation concerning the



fii. -
accounting and financial management of the new poit and turn its operation to a fully commercial
mode (para. 9. 04).
4.    Sustaina&it
Project sustainability has two principal components, namely the economic development impact
a.d the institutional development impact. In economic terms the project was very successful (paras.
6.03 and 7.01). It had also good rest-lts on the institutional side for the road component (para. 6.04).
5.    Findings and Lessons Lea
Flexibility in project design, allowing adaptations to project design during implementation as
needed was especially useful for road rehabilitation/maintenance vrojects (para. 8.03).

2.    )3ackgmnd
2.01   By the time of independence in 1976, the Seychelles economy had al,eady undergone a
striking transformation from one almost exclusively based on agriculture and fishing with very limited
external trade to a predominantly service economy oriented towards international tourism. The
economy grew by 10 percent p.a. over 1976-79 on average, essentially fueled by tourism, but
declined over 1980-82, due to a decrease in the number of tourists caused by both international and
domestic factors. By 1984, the government economic policy as expressed in the 1982-86 National
Development Plan was directed inter alia at: (i) promoting a revival in tourism, but also (ii)
diversifying the economy to limit its dependency on tourism for foreign exchange earnings. To
pursue these objectives, the Ministry of Planning and External Relations (MPER) developed sectoral
policies aimed at tmaking the best use of the cou'-try's resources, such as fish and tourism, so that
maximum and lasting benefits would accrue to Seychelles.
2.02   The transport sector strategy was aimed at supporting the overall economic goals by providing
more cost effective services and limit foreign exchange expenditures. Adequate port infrastructure was
needed in support of a fishery action plan which aimed at promoting pelagic fisheries. In the road
sector, the main focus was on maintaining, strengthening, upgrading and improving the badly
deteriorated existing roads in order to protect the assets, through cost effective road maintenance and
strengthening programs.
2.03  Tle main responsibility for implementing the transport policies of the Government of
Seychelles (GOS) was with the Department of Transport (DOT), which had (i) a Port and Marine
Services Division (PMSD) responsible for the management of port and navigation facilities, whereas a
parastatal: the Union Lighterage Company (ULC) provided operating services for the port, anc (ii) a
Land and Transport Division (LTD) responsible for management of roads, whereas most road work
was carried out by a parastatal: the Works Enterprises Ltd (WEL).

3.    Projctl Obeci      descition
Objegtives
3.01   A^s stated in para. 5.01 of the SAR, the primary objective of the project was to improve the
capacity and quality of key parts of the transport system, while also focusing on greater financial
autonomy and the institutional needs of the agencies involved. As part of the larger development,
with suppcort from several other donor agencies, of transport facilities, particularly on the East Coast
of the main island of Mahe. There were two separate project components financed by the Bank Loan.
These covered the commercial port of Victoria and the road network on the island of Mahe with the
fcllowing specific objectives:
Commercial Port:
(i) to provide adequate capacity for handling tie anticipated growth of containerized cargo,
and petroleum products for at least ten years; (ii) to ensure the establishment of an improved tariff
structure through evaluation of the actual costs of providing the services supplied;
Rgad Compgonent:
(iii) to strengthen the maintenance management system and road materials testing capability of
LTD; and (iv) to improve the existing road network through the strengthening/rehabilitation of
deteriorated sections of the roads, to provide adequate standards for road users and reduce vehicle
operating costs.
Dgscription
3.02   The commercial port component comprised:
a) the dredging of parts of the port enance channel and turning basin;
b) the resurfacing to provide modern access, handling and storage areas for both container
traffic and general cargo, and the construction of a new port workshop including some new
equipment and the provision of associated services;
c) the reconstruction of part of the existing berths;
d) it reconstruction of a petroleum/cement products discharge terminal; and
(e) consulting services for a feasibility study (financed under an advance under the Project
Preparation Facility-PPF), site supervision for the civil works, and a study for the
establishment of accounting and fiancial system for the commercial port.
3.03   The road rehabilitation and maintenance management system component comprised:
a) consulting services for the establishment of a maintenance management system and a road
materials testing unit through the appointment cf a suitable firm of consultants, and for work
supervisioig



-3-
b) road strengthening/rehabilitation including patching, leveling, hot mix overlay and civil
works, strengtiening/rehabilitation of culverts, bridges, seawalls on 13 short sections of
existing paved roads on the island of Mahe totalling 53 km to be carried out under contract in
a four year program; and
c) overseas training of four of LTD's road superintendents !nd one civil engineer in road
mair.tenance planning, programming, costing, and quality control.
4.    Project Design and  ranization
4.01 As this project was the Bank's first leading operation in the Seychelles since the country
joined the Bank in 1980, considerable efforts from the Bank and the Borrower had to be dedicated to
project preparation over a four-year period. The scope and design of the commercial port project
component were derived from a feasibility study carrind out by consultants and financed under a PPF
advance, followed by detailed engineering carried out by consultants financed by the NEC. The
scope of the original road component was derived from the work of the LTD staff, and the detailed
design was prepared by a consulting firm, based on a thorough investigaticn of the Mahe island road
network. Thus the project was well prepared and allegedly well understood in all its aspects by all
relevant parties.
4.02   MPER had overall responsibility for the implementation of the project. It relied on the
scii;ees of consultants for the supervision of the port component works and on LTD for the
implementation of the road component. MPER set up a small unit assisted by a consultant (project
coordinator) to be responsible for project management. This MPER task ended up being very light as
the project was eventually implemented as a succession of two sub-projects: first the port component
and then the road component. The project management unit remained a focal point for the
correspondence with the Bank, the submission of disbursement request and the management of the
Special Account.
5.    EMetJIM=o
5.01   Whereas the port component was implemented as initially planned both in scope and with
minimal delay in spite of the bankruptcy of the initial contractor and its takeover by a second one, the
road component was much delayed, and eventually it was substantially amended before its
implementation actually began late 1987. Subsequently, the road component was implemented
smoothly and without further delay nor major variation as compared to the revised plan. Overall
project cost (Table 5.A) was US$ 16.2 million compared with an appraised estimate of US$16.8
million (i.e., lower by 3.6 %.
5.02   The delay in the implementation of the road component was primarily caused by (i) the
limited availability of GOS' funds during the 1985-87 period to cover the 40 percent local share of its
cost, party as a result of other needs for local financing 3f the East Coast project, and (i) the
reluctance of LTD's management to embarlc on rehabilitation works. LTD staff attributed the poor
condition of these roads more to the previous lack of routine maintenance than to structural
deficiency, and decided to tacike the problem through periodic maintenance type operations rather
than complete rehabilitation. LTD had undertaken to design and carry out a periodic maintenance
(using thin overlay instead of traditional resealing) program for the Mahe roads, including but not
limited to some of the project roads, which was much less costly than the rehabilitation operation



- 4 -
initially envisaged under the project. Because of the specific nature of both traffic (there aue no heavy
vehicles; vehicle import and use are well controlled) and road environment (excellent drainage by
deep ditches along narrow paved roads) this periodic maintenance program was successful.
5.03   On the basis of the success of LTD's periodic maintenance operations, the Bank amended the
road component to provide financial support to (i) the continuation on a large scale basis of the
periodic maintenance program on both islands of Mahe (including the roads which were initially part
of the project but had not been tread yt) and Praslin, and (ii) selected road improvements on
PrRslin. 'I In addition to this, the amendment reduced the project provision for consulting services
for both work supervision, ana for training abroad for the following reasons: (i) LTD had benefitted
fromn the assistance of three Peace Corps volunteers, and had acquired the capacity to supervise
periodic mainwnance works, and no longer needed the services of consultants for that task; and (ii)
GOS had received training grants from other sources for its staff. The fuids thus freed were
reallocated to the program of road works, to compensate for the deterioration of the exchange rate $
vs SR which had dropped from 7.3 to 5.6 since appraisal.
Proeic Risks
5.04  The SAR did not envisage major risks for the project, and that assumption was confirmed
during implementation. 'The project was said in the SAR to have been designed to reduce risk
associated with implmmentation 2nd to provide considerable flexibility for adaptation to changed
circumstances. This ,roved very successful in the case of the road component.
6n    Pr-oiect Results
6.01   The overall results are very good:
(i) the Port ComVorent was completed in a timely fashion with no major cost overrun, and
was available to provide adequate support to the booming fisheries sector and the construction
industry supporting further tourism developr,ent; the port is a commercially viable entity; and
(ii) the Road Comnonent successfully reached its objective of providing the country with a
good road network in a cost effective way, even though it was completed with a two-year delay; the
road network of Seychelles (particularly on Mahe) is now in overall good condition in spite of a
steady traffic growth rate over recent years; a well conceived road maintenance policy which was
developed and applied over a-five-year period is expected to be pursued by the country in the future,
using essentially its own resources.
Phvsical Outou
6.02  Targets for output expected were far  ceded both for roads and the commercial port. Road
traffic increased by 8% instead of 3% per year. Port traffic in 1989 was 364,000 tons instead of
250,000 tons forecasted. These larger than expected road and port taffic reflect booming tourism
and construction sectors in the country over the last few years, beyond appraisal expectations.
I The justification for amending the project is presented in an internal
Bank memorandum dated November 20, 1987.



-5 -
Economic Rate of Return (ERR)
6.03   ERRs for the investment of the two project components have been recalculated on the basis of
data provided in GOS' final report (Part III, Section 6). For the port component, the appraisal ERR
was 15% vs a recalculated ERR of 18%. For the road component, the appraisal ERR was 23%, with
specific road sections' ERRs varying from 13% to 47% depending on traffic density; the recalculated
ERR was 72% for the Mahe roads (varying from 23% to more than 100% on specific road sections)
and 23% for the Praslin roads, assuming a road traffic growth rate of 4% p.a. The overall
recalculated return for the Bank project .s 31% compared with an appraisal ERR of 18 % . Assuming
that the benefits from port traffic would be lower than expected by 10%, and the road trafftic would
not inxrease, the overall ERR would still be 27%. This indicates a good economic justificaton for
the project.
Development Inmact
6.04  In addition to its 'xonomic impact as shown above, the project had the following impact:
(i) instiutions in the road sector (LTD, The Material Testing Unit Bureau of Standards, and
local contractors) were strengthened through gaining field experience in road maintenance and are
expected to meet the cowntry's needs in the future; similarly, a good human resource base was
developed; howe-er, the simultaneous departure abroad of the head of LTD at project completion,
and of his deputy who joined the Seychelles' Public Utility Company caused a temporary though
major disruption in LTD's ability to perform its tasks adequately; fortunately, the present Director
General is rapidly getting on top of the work; however, the replacement deputy has less experience
and qualifications than his predecessor, a deficiency that cannot easily be compensated for;
(ii) a well fitted road maintenance technology (very thin asphalt concrete overlay) was
developed by a local contractor, which will be very useful to address the country's future needs.
7.    Project Sustainability
7.01   The project is very likely to maintain a high level of net benefits throughout its economic life.
Only a rather unlikely significant and rapid drop in international trade and tourism in Seychelles
would reduce these benefits.
8.    Bank Perobmanr,
Through Loan Signature
8.01   The Bank was instrumental in assisting GOS set up an economically viable project whose port
component was particularly large by Seychelles standards and required co-financing from several
sources. In addition to the commercial port, the Bank also assisted GOS in developing a fisheries
sector policy and packaging a financing plan for the fishing port which was built in parallel with the
commercial port with the support of severa other donors.



-6-
During Implemntatgn
8.02   The Bank performance during implementation was in general satisfactory. The Bank
responded in a timely fashion to GOS' request to amend the project's road component. The overall
supervision input by the Bank was relatively low, both in terms of staff input and frequency of
supervision missions; however, one has to assume that this input level was a result of a largely
problem-free project; project financial supervision of the port component should have been more
intensive with regard to the study on port tariffs and accounting (para. 10.01), in order to get GOS to
move to a commercial port operation (para. 9.04).
Main Lessons of Exnerience
8.03   Flexibility in project design allowing adaptations if and as required during implementation was
extremely useful, especially in the road maintenancel rehabilitation project component, in a situation
where the condition of the roads and maintenance requirements are subject to substandal changes
between appraisal and actual implementation.
8.04  In a place like Seychelles, with Government units staffed by only a handful of people, the
benefits of staff taining can prove to be short-lived as one must expect that one or two staff changes
can radicaUy transform the character of a Government agency (para. 6.04-i).
9. 
Sunuary of CoM1ijance with Covenants
9.01  In general, the Borrower complied with the Loan covenats, though with some delays at
times for the audit requirements for LTD and PMSD, and the progress reports for the road
component. The government's Department of Audit which was expected to carry out the audits was
not able to do so, because of staffing insufficiencies. Eventually, for 1988 and the foUowing years,
GOS hired a private auditor to carry out the audits. However, no account statement nor audit report
was urnished to the Bank for LTD's 1990 accounts, which were due after project closing. As for the
road component progress reports, LTD ended up providing all information required with some delay,
but the final report was very detailed and most useful for the preparation of this PCR.
Borrower Perfobrance Prior tQ Loan Siau
9.02   Since one of the most important project element involved a relatively large commiment for
dredging both for the commercial port and fishing port, it was vital that the financing of both ports
would be completed at the same time. Ihis was achieved by GOS in the period after Bank appraisal
and prior to signing of the Loan Agreement.
Dunng Proect ImnlemenQn
9.03   The Borrower's performance during project execution was reasonably satsfactory, given its
lack of experience with implementation of Bank's financed projects. Progress repordng has been
overall excellent in terms of quantity and quality of information supplied, in spite of some delays at
times. For future projects, performance should be strengthened in the areas of timely auditing and
use of special accounts.



9.04 GOS could have made better use of the services of the consultant who carried out the study
on port tariffs and accounting. When the study was completed, GOS felt that its recommendations on
accounting could not be practically implemented within the current admiuistrative structure of PMSD.
This structure was not modified and, the recommendations were not implemented. GOS is not keen
in privatizing the port operations and management, as it is deriving substantial revenues from them.
9.05   The Bank made unsuccessful efforts to get LTD and MPER to produce an economic analysis
and ,ustification of three road deviations (one on Mahe and two on Praslin) that were not included in
the revised road component; after a long period of trying (in 1989-90) to get this simple economic
analysis of the deviations carried out, the Bank finally accepted that the two deviations on Praslin be
financed under the Project when the cost estimate was lowered to a level which limited the risk of
having a non viable investment. Eventually, the investment proved teconomically viable.
10.   Conslting Seices
10.01 Consulting services for the supervision of the port works were satisfactory, as (i) the work
supervision was carried out efficiently under adverse conditions at times, caused by the deficiency of
one contractor, (ii) overall costs remained well under control, and (iii) progress reports were timely
and detailed. The study on port tariffs and accounting was satisfactory, but its recommendations have
not been put into effect by PMSD (para. 9.4).
10.02 For the road component, most consulting services were eventually canceled as LTD had
proved it was able to supervise works with its own staff. Only a small training assignment abroad was
maintained, which proved useful and cost effective.
11.       Prolect Documentation and Data
11.01     Adacy of SAR and Legal Documents: Original documentation for the project was
adequate and appropriate for achieving project objectives.
11.02     Availability of Relevant Data to PCR Mission: All data required for the preparation of
the PCR were readily available in the project file.

1.    Geneal. In the main we are in agreement with the comments of the World Bank. On the
whole, the Port Component was well implemented resulting in returns well beyond
expectations.
2.    Descrintion of Project. The description of the project as per item 3.02 (page 8) of the PCR at
(c) and (d) would appear erroneous. The existing berth described at (c) was not reconstructed
as such. Repairs to the underdeck of the existing Mahe Quay was undertaken using a
specialist contractor and a specific method. Works included the removal of sprawled concrete
and spraying shotcrete to protect reinforcing rods which were exposed and bleeding rust.
The component was undertaken in two sections, namely: (i) the construction of a culvert to
house existing bulk fuel and cement lines on the north end of Mahe (old) Quay; and (ii) the
construction of a second culvert (on the new quay extension) to house a second and new
pipeline for discharge of bulk (white) petroleum products from deeper draught vessels.
3.    Study vs Remmendatons Concerning The Accntng and Financial Management.
In all fairness, Government had all the intentions and desire to privatize all aspects of
port operations and management to the extent it had appointed a senior and
experienced officer to work upon the proposal of setting up a 'port Authority of
Seychelles". Much work was undertacen in this regard with the particular
requirement of setting up this National Port Authority. Difficulties arose, including a
difference of opinion by other parties who would have been absorbed or who would
have formed part of this Authority. Government is still considering the matter and it
is hoped that in due course a National Port Authority may be established.
B.    Comments of the Land Transport Division (LTD) of the Ministay of Tourism and Transport.
1.    Intrduction
The following short review has been prepared by the Land Transport Division (LTD) of the
Ministry of Tourism and Transport for the road component of the project. Those comments will by
no means cover all aspects of the project and will be restricted to cover areas where LTD has had a
more active role, as for example, project implementation. Furthermore, as mentioned in para. 6.04
of Part I, the departure of the two most senior members of LTD at project completion has made it
most difficult to carry out the assessment; these two officers had been more closely involved with the
management of the project than any other staff of LTD. The comments which will follow here must
be viewed in this light.



9-
2.    Review
2.1    Objei. The objectives of the project have proven to be sound and the results of the
project have indicated that the objectives have been achieved; the primary roads of Mahe Island are in
very good condition and are presently manageable by GOS. Vehicle operating costs have been
substantially reduced to the benefit of the local economy.
2.2   Project Design and Organization. The preparation of the scope of works by LTD staff and
detailed design preparation by an international consulting firm has proven a worthwhile combination
of expertise for the preparation of a relevant project package. During this process, LTD staff have
had a certain degree of exposure to the requirements of a detailed project design procedure making it
possible to taclde the detailed design of similar projects in future.
2.3   Project Implementation. The two year delay in implementing the project caused by
unavailability of GOS local counterpart funds has had both negative and positive impacts:
(i) The delay has deprived GOS the benefits of the project for two years.
Although the life of the project will essentialy be the same. Losses over
the two years through high vehicle operating costs and high road
mintenance costs will never be recouped.
(ii) Major project revisions undertaken enabled the project to be modified to
maximize the benefits. These have been successful in so far as the ERR
results indicate. Without the delay to allow the revisions to be
contemplated and effected the results would possibly not have been as good
as those achieved.
In many respects, the revisions in (ii) above have reduced any risks which may have been
present during initial project planning, ensuring that maximum benefits have been derived.
2.4   Projec Results
The results can be qualified as follows:
(i) Although part of the project involved works on Praslin Island, the primary roads of
Mahe were by far the largest beneficiary. There is today a marked difference between
the primary roads of Mahe which are far superior to the secondary roads of Mahe as
well as superior to all the roads of Praslin and La Digue. It is important to qualify the
primary roads of Mahe when referring to the project roads rather than 'the road network
of Seychelles" as has been described in section 6.01 (ii) of Part I.
(ii) A road maintenance practice of utilizing a very thin premix asphalt overlay, which was
refined during the project implementation has proved so successful that it is still being
used in 1993 with the same degree of success as during the project. The project had
envisaged a target of 53 kmn of road to be resurfaced and a much larger total was
achieved. There is no immediate or medium term need to modify this approach.
(iii) Apart from direct results in road condition improvements and its associated benefits,
LTD has benefitted directly from the experience in implementing a relatively large and
successful project. Additional benefits have been recorded in the overseas as well as



-10-
local training for LTD. This improvement in the human resource base in the road sector
however, in the case of LTD, has been very fragile because of LTD'! small size and this
fragility has indeed manifested itself in the departure of the two most senior staff of the
Division. The lesson which may be learnt from this experience is the ueed to involve as
many senior staff as possible in all the aspects of project preparation, implementation
and management where the organization is small. Versatility of senior staff is of prime
importance in such cases.
(iv) One negaive aspect of the project which is worth mentioning but which cannot be
supported by as much factual information as we would have liked, is the fact that with
the much improved condition of the rolling surface of the primary roads of Mahe, a
resultant increase of traffic speeds have been observed. This has invariably resulted in
an increase in accidents with a marked increase in serious injury and fatal accidents. In
spite of the existence of most of the appropriate road transport regulations to ensure safe
use of the roads, the policing of these regulations have not been up to standard with the
resultant abuse of the road facilities. This situation could have been avoided if a road
safety component had been included within the transport project.
2.5  EPigsit Sustainability. Present indications are that the project will continue to provide benefits
to GOS throughout its economic life. It is however also of equal importance for GOS to view this
project in conjunction with present day and future road maintenance works. The project on its own
has given Seychelles a good network of primary roads. Left as it is with minimal periodic
maintenance, the project will gradually reach the end of its economic life. Another such project
would be required in the next seven or eight years if such practice was adopted. To prevent this,
GOS should provide a steady flow of funds to enable periodic maintenance works to be done on
selected sections of the project roads as a means of sustaining the project and ensuring that the
investment made into these roads are preserved. An estimated length of 8 km would need to be
resurfaced annually using a thin overlay. One should look at this project as not being an entity on its
own, but as part of a larger term programming process.
2.6   Bak Performance. The Bank must be commended on its ability to respond in amending the
project's road component. Ihis is not always possible so close to and during implementation of the
project. The ability and will to respond to the requested changes has most certainly contributed to the
success of the project. Such flexibility must be encouraged. One aspect of the Bank performance
which needs mention is the large amount of data, reports and write-ups to be prepared and compiled
continuously during the different stages of a project. We certainly see the impertance of stv .h
information, but it has become obvious to LTD that whenever a project mission is underway, a large
proportion of the LTD staff has to be assigned to information/data collection and report writing thus
paralysing numerous other equally important activities. This is because of the relatively small size of
LTD and we presume that these effects are reduced the larger the organization. It is felt that this
should be borne in mind by the Bank in its dealings with small organizations such as LTD.
2.7   Borrower Perfonmance. LTD, it is understood, has been able to comply with all the loan
covenants albeit with some delays with the progress reports. These delays have been due to reasons
discussed previourly, namely the small size of LTD which makes it difficult to comply with the
demands of the Bank, and the loss of the two key senior staff involved with the project.
With regard to the audit reports, these have not been under the full control of LTD, but it is
understood that the 1990 audited accounts will be forthcoming if that has not already been made
available to the Bank. The in-house work supervision undertaken by LTD proved successful in many



- 11 -
respects. An external consultancy would also certainly have cost more and would have complicated
matters when the road project was amended during implementation. However, an external
consultancy could have brought in experience and work practices to benefit more staff in the sector.
3.    Conclusion
In general, it can be said that the project has been successful in achieving its objectives and
that LTD has certainly benefitted from its experience in dealing with the Bank. As a result of this
and of the lessons learnt, along the project, LTD and most certainly the Bank, will be in a much
better position to work in closer collaboration for proposed future projects.
