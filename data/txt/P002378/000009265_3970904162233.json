        to improve the capacity and quality of key parts of the\n            transport system, specifically in the commercial port and\n            highway sub-sectors.  For the commercial port, the project\n            includes: (a) dredging of the entrance channel and the ship\n            turning basin; (b) construction of a petroleum products and\n            cement discharge terminal; and (c) rehabilitation of the\n            port's open areas.  Under the port component, the\n            project further involves; (d) financial studies; and (e)\n            technical assistance. For the highway component, it\n            includes: (a) rehabilitation of the road network; (b)\n            training for the Land Transport Division's staff; and\n            (c) technical assistance."}, "docdt": "1984-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
