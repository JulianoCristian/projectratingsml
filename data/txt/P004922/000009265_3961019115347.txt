IRRIGATION ENGINEERING PROJECT
[LOAN 2978-AL]
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Irrigation Engineering Project in
Algeria, for which Loan 2798-AL in the amount of US$ 14.0 million was approved on January 13, 1989
and made effective on April 13, 1989.
The loan was closed on June 30, 1994 (initially planned for December 31, 1992). The last
disbursement took place on June 28, 1994. A balance of US$ 9.18 million was cancelled.
The present ICR draft was prepared by an FAO/CP mission", on the basis of information
collected in Washington and discussions with two Algerian Government officials who visited the FAO
HQ in Rome from 13 to 18 March 1995. Due to security problems in Algeria, no field visit was
organized.
Preparation of the ICR could not be initiated during the last supervision mission, carried out in
September 1993, because other missions were scheduled before the expected closing date. Further
discussions on project progress between AGID officials and the Bank took place in July 1994 in Paris and
in November 1994 in Washington. This ICR is based on a review of the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR)
and legal documents, the five Bank supervision reports and project files of the ECA/MNA Information
Service Center, as well as on discussions with the Bank staff and AGID officials associated with the
project.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
DEMOCRATIC AND POPULAR REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA
IRRIGATION ENGINEERING PROJECT
[LOAN 2978-AL]
EVALUATION SUMMMARY
Introduction
1.    Bank Group lending to Algeria for agriculture started in 1974 and only four projects had been
approved (US$ 152 million in cumulative commitments) prior to the Irrigation Engineering Project.
Performance for the first three projects was mixed, reflecting the country's serious institutional
constraints. The Rural Development Project (Ln 1159-AL) was completed after considerable delays,
mainly due to a lack of Government commitment and coordination. The Bas-Cheliff Irrigation Project
(Ln 1802-AL) was 80% completed when the Bank closed the loan, two years later than initially forecast.
A Meat Industry Project was cancelled at the Government's request, a few months after the loan became
effective. A Water Master Plan for the Cheliff Valley was prepared as part of Loan 1802-AL and served
as the technical basis for the Cheliff Irrigation Project (Ln 2809-AL), closed on December 31, 1994
following refusal by the Bank to extend the closing date, although works financed under the loan were
not completed.
2.    The main objective of the Irrigation Engineering Project was to help Algeria prepare irrigation
development plans to increase farm output and rural incomes by making agriculture less vulnerable to
periodic droughts and rainfall uncertainties. The project components were: (a) inventories of soil, water
resources and existing small-scale irrigation, followed by development proposals; (b) nine feasibility
studies for the development of large-scale irrigation schemes; (c) preparation of ten-year national
development plans for small and large-scale irrigation, and (d) provision of technical assistance and
equipment to strengthen the relevant governmental institutions dealing with irrigation. In retrospect, it
could be said that the project's objectives were probably too ambitious given Algeria's limited
institutional/financial absorptive capacity at that time.
Implementation Experience and Results
3.    The main project's objectives were not achieved mainly because of the lack of Government's
ownership. Monitoring and coordination of project's activities were weak, resulting in considerable
delays. Most of the studies and development plans had not been completed at the project's closing date.
Out of the nine studies for the development of large-scale irrigation schemes which were contracted to
international consultants associated with local firms, only two studies were completed. Technical
assistance was not utilized mainly because of cumbersome local procedures. Only some laboratory and
soil survey equipment could be provided to ANRH on time.
4.    During the project's preparation, the Government made it clear that it would never adhered to
the concept of preparing the ten-year plans for large and small scale irrigation with Bank's assistance.
During negotiations, as a compromise, it has been agreed that the irrigation plans would be prepared by
the Government without the Bank's involvement but with external technical assistance which has never



- 111 -
been mobilized. After multiple reminders sent by the Bank, the draft ten-year plans for large scale and
small scale irrigated were submitted only in December 1993 and in April 1994 respectively, when the
loan was about to close, instead of December 1989 as stipulated by the Loan Agreement. Therefore, all
the studies were carried out without specific and rational long-term planning. Moreover, the draft ten-
year development plans were of limited value.
5.    Overall sustainability of the project is therefore questionable. The African Development Bank
is the only institution that expressed possible interest in one of the schemes for which the feasibility study
was financed under the project.
6.     Less than 40% of the project's total costs of US$ 20 million have been incurred, although total
commitments amounted to US$ 21.7 million (see Table 8A and para 20), in spite of the fact that the
project's closing date was extended to end June 1994, 18 months later than originally planned. The
Government's request to further extend the closing date was declined by the Bank.
7.     The main factors which adversely affected the project's implementation were: (a) the
Government's total lack of commitment to the success of the project; (b) cumbersome and lengthy
procedures related to procurement and payments to consulting firms and suppliers; and (c) since end
1993, civil disturbances which hampered the work of foreign consulting firms.
8.    As for the Bank's performance, one full year elapsed between appraisal and negotiation: no
convincing justification could be found for this unusually long period of time. The Bank's five
supervision missions were conducted by one irrigation engineer only, except for the last mission which
included an economist. These missions should have been multi-disciplinary and more frequent, to tackle
with the multiple problems emerging from the beginning of the project. It is also unfortunate that no
mid-term review ever took place since this could have provided the opportunity to re-design the project's
objectives and components, in particular the preparation of the ten-year plans for irrigation development.
9.    On the borrower's side, several disruptive changes took place in the various governmental
structures involved in project's implementation. Furthermore, AGID, the project executing agency
created in 1987, did not have sufficient experience and qualified human resources for managing and
monitoring the project's activities. Most of AGID's efforts to operate efficiently were thwarted by
cumbersome administrative and financial procedures beyond its jurisdiction. Its monitoring of the project
was rather weak, mainly due to lack of specialized technical assistance included in the project but never
used. Non-compliance with the Bank's audit requirements was also a persistent problem, and financial
monitoring of the project were not possible due to the lack of project's account in US dollars.
10.   The project outcome is therefore highly unsatisfactory. However, it must be pointed out that the
monitoring capacity of the AGID's Studies Department was progressively strengthened especially in
irrigation development plans and procurement procedures.
Summary of Findings, Future Operations, and Key Lessons Learned
11.   Future operations in the irrigation subsector should concentrate on the completion of the priority
studies so as to submit the resulting investment proposals to donors.



- Iv -
12.   The key lessons learned from the project can be summarized as follows:
(a)    Expanding irrigation should be contingent to the approval of a formal sector study and
a good regional land use and water resources plans;
(b)    The studies of large and complex irrigation projects must be carried out in several phases
(master plan, feasibility study and detailed design). Each phase should start only after
approval of the preceding phase. Detailed design should be carried out only when a
precise donor is been clearly identified;
(c)    Long-term planning may be unrealistic if not backed by Government commitment and
supported by a strong Bank-Government dialogue;
(d)    Procurement and disbursement procedures should be perfectly clarified with the Borrower
and training should be provided before the project's start so as to avoid considerable
delays;
(e)    When advanced technology such as satellite imagery is used, careful evaluation of the
Government's capacity to monitor the Consultant's work should have been done at
appraisal. The capacity of the Consultant to implement such technology should also have
been assessed during bid evaluation and the Bank's supervision missions should have
closely followed up the study's products,
(f)    Workable arrangements should have been made during appraisal and enforced by
appropriate covenants during negotiations, as regards technical assistance and training
component.

DEMOCRATIC AND POPULAR REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA
IRRIGATION ENGINEERING PROJECT
[LOAN 2978-AL]
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. Statement/Evaluation of Objectives
1.         The main objective of the Irrigation Engineering Project was to (a) assist Algeria in the
preparation of plans for the development of irrigation, (b) raise rural incomes and (c) increase farm output
by making agriculture less vulnerable to periodic droughts and rainfall uncertainties. The project's
components comprised: (a) studies for the development of small-scale irrigation schemes, (b) studies for
the development of large-scale irrigation schemes, (c) preparation of ten-year development plans for small
and large-scale irrigation, and (d) provision of technical assistance and equipment for strengthening the
relevant governmental institutions dealing with irrigation.
2.         Project costs totalled US$20 million, of which US$14 million (70%) in foreign currency,
to be entirely financed by the Bank loan. The Government was to pay the remaining costs in local
currency. Calculations were made on the basis of the prevailing official exchange rate of DA 4.7 = US$
1. Physical and price contingencies accounted for 10% of the total costs. A US$2 million special
account was set up at project commencement.
3.         The large-scale irrigation schemes were selected on the basis of existing water development
master plans and covered areas which has the highest agricultural potential in Algeria. Moreover it was
expected that the ten-year national irrigation development plans, the preparation of which was a legal
covenant in the Loan Agreement, would contribute to better identify priority schemes. The studies were
expected to provide: (a) information on the agricultural marketing structure and demand conditions in
Algeria, (b) cropping patterns to intensify foodstuffs production, (c) cost recovery levels recommended
for the schemes, and (d) improvements in agricultural research, extension and input distribution.
4.         The studies for the development of large-scale irrigation were initially limited to four
schemes, and then expanded to five additional schemes at AGID's request.
B. Achievement of Project Objectives
5.         The project objectives were not achieved, since most of the studies were not completed by
the project closing date" and the ten-year irrigation development plans, hastily prepared by the
Government, were of doubtful quality. Therefore, the project has not been able to assist the country in
The original closing date (December 31 , 1992) was extended in November 1991 to June 30, 1994.
In February 1994, the Government requested a new extension till end 1995. The Bank declined this
request.

the preparation of plans for future irrigation development; nor has it been instrumental in strengthening
the institutional capacity of AGID, or in improving cooperation between the Government agencies. The
specific results of the various project components are detailed below.
Studies for the Development of Small-Scale Irrigation (SSI).
6 .        Bidding procedures lasted two and half years from pre-selection of consulting firms in
December 1986 till contract approval in June 1989. Main difficulties came from the interpretation by
the Government of the Bank guidelines for the use of consultants, particularly as regards the simultaneous
opening of technical and financial bids. Despite Bank's reservations concerning the methodology
proposed by the ex-Yugoslavian firm Energoprojekt, associated with the Algerian consulting firm
ENHYD, the Government insisted on awarding the contract to this consortium. The contract was finally
signed in June 1989, after Bank non-objection.
7.         The first phase of the study, i.e. the inventory of existing irrigated areas, water and soil
resources, progressed very slowly till November 1991 when the UN embargo on the former Yugoslavia
hampered the continuation of the consultant's work. Despite the Bank's recommendation in November
1991 to the Government to intensify monitoring and control of the study progress, Energoprojeckt was
not able to complete this study, nor the El Tarf feasibility study (see Table 7) of which it was also in
charge.
8.         The actual achievement seems to be limited to: a) the provision of Landsat and Spot satellite
imagery for the whole of Northern Algeria (250,000 km2); b) a draft inventory of the existing SMI
schemes, including soil resources; and c) a draft report on the methodology to be used for the assessment
of the potential for future development. Reports were reviewed by AGID and ANRH and comments
were communicated without reaction from the consulting firms.
9.         In February 1993, the Bank recruited a consultant to assess the methodology used for the
inventory. The consultant concluded that: (a) satellite imagery was not accurate enough to provide a
reliable inventory of small irrigation schemes, and (b) instead, aerial photography should have been
adopted for the study.
Feasibility Studies for the Development of Large-Scale Irrigation schemes (LSI).
10.        Contracts for nine large scale irrigation schemes, totalling about 120,000 ha, were awarded
to international consulting firms associated with local engineering firms (See Table 7). The overall results
of these studies are unsatisfactory. Three groups of studies are to be considered:
-      Initial proposals (SAR). Of four studies of irrigation schemes totalling 91,000 ha,
contracted in 1989/90, only the study of El Asnam Plateau and Sahel Valley (7,000
ha) was completed in 1993; at closing date, only the preliminary studies and part
of the development options were completed for the other three schemes (84,000
ha). AGID expects to eventually complete these studies under local funding and
with national consulting firms.
-      Updating of the Oued Rhir Study. Initiated in 1991, this study aimed to (a)
propose development options on 7,500 ha in the Rhir Valley, which is part of the
Sahara Development Project financed by the Bank (Loan 3405-AL) and (b) provide



detailed designs for the selected option. The study was completed. Irrigation
systems on about 3,600 ha are expected to be implemented under Loan 3405-AL.
-      Additional feasibility studies. The Bank agreed to include four additional studies
in the project, covering a total area of 21,000 ha. For 3 schemes, totalling 13,500
ha, the reconnaissance studies and part of the development options were completed
at the closing date. The study of the fourth scheme should be re-tendered, since
the Hungarian firm (TESCO) has requested the cancellation of its contract.
National Ten-Year Master Plans for Small and Large-Scale Irrigation Developments.
11.        The two master plans should have been completed by the Government before the end of
1989, as stipulated in the Loan Agreement and should have been the project's priority objective. They
would have identified the priority schemes with the highest potential for irrigation improvement or
development which would then be studied under the Irrigation Engineering loan. Despite several Bank's
reminders, no progress was made in the preparation of the master plans. In 1990, the Government
discontinued its preparation of this master plans by alleging that uncertainties in the implementation
capacity of the construction sector would impede any planning effort for irrigation development. In
November 1993, the Bank threatened the Government to suspend loan disbursements, unless the two
master plans were not furnished to the Bank by December 31, 1993, for large scale schemes, and June
30, 1994 for small scale schemes.
12.        The Government hastily prepared the ten-year development plans on large scale schemes
and small scale schemes and send the two documents to the Bank just before the above deadlines.
Unfortunately, the conclusions and proposals of these two reports are not relevant enough for further use.
The two documents need to be seriously improved.
Technical Assistance and Training .
13.        Initially, 20 man-months of short-term technical assistance are planned to help resolve
specific technical problems encountered on project implementation, and also to provide on-the-job
training. They were not used, mainly because of the cumbersome local procedures to commission
individual consultants' services. As for training, AGID staff benefited from some limited training through
the monitoring of the studies carried out under the loan.
Equipment.
14.        The project provided scientific equipment (laboratory equipment and hydrological
measurement devices) to ANRH, and topographic instruments to AGID.
C. Major Factors Affecting the Project
15.        There were three main factors which negatively affected project implementation: (a) lack
of commitment to the objectives of the project, (b) lack of coordination and monitoring of the project's
activities aggravated by cumbersome procurement and disbursement procedures, (c) the use of Eastern
Europe consulting firms to undertake some of the studies, and (d) the security situation which prevented
foreign consultants from carrying out field work.



- 4 -
16.        Frequent changes in leadership at the Ministries of Equipment and Agriculture, AGID,
regional agencies and local units also caused serious disruption in the progress of the project.
17.         AGID was the main implementing agency for all project's activities, except for the
preparation of the national ten-year irrigation plans which were initially under the direct responsibility
of the Ministry of Equipment, and later transferred to the Ministry of Agriculture. The main AGID's
internal factors which affected project implementation were: (a) lack of quality control and proper
monitoring process; (b) limited receptiveness and/or difficulty in organizing training programs; and (c)
impossibility to mobilize technical assistance". The project was monitored by an insufficient number of
competent AGID staff who worked amid increasingly difficult working and security conditions and
declining purchasing power.
18.        At appraisal, it was assumed that the 48 month disbursement period was commensurate with
the nature of the studies. However, the actual disbursements were well behind schedule, because of
cumbersome procedure, great delays in paying invoices and in processing withdrawal applications.
D. Project Sustainability
19.        Sustainability is not, strictly speaking, a relevant indicator in the case of the studies financed
under the loan. However, the relevance of the studies, the timely delivery and the quality of the reports
produced are important matters of concern. To-date, only two of the eleven studies have actually led to
eventual activities: (a) the African Development Bank has shown interest in using the studies for the
development of El Asnam Plateau and Sahel Valley (7,000 ha); and (b) the up-dating of the Oued Rhir
studies led to a World Bank financing of 3,600 ha of irrigation rehabilitation in the context of the Sahara
Development Project (Ln 3405-AL), expected to be completed by end 1997.
20          The relevance of the other studies are questionable. The detailed designs and tender
documents prepared will be quickly outdated if not subsequently followed by execution of works. The
particular experience in Algeria has shown that after four or five years, unused detailed studies of
irrigation projects become obsolete, especially for rehabilitation works.
E. Bank Performance
21          Between January and April 1987, a simplified identification/preparation/appraisaI process
was carried out by the Government, with the assistance of the Bank and the FAO/WB Cooperative
Program. The final project design was consistent with the development strategy for irrigation pursued
by the Government and the Bank. Two years elapsed between the appraisal mission (April 1987) and
the loan effectiveness (April 1989): the project was presented to the Board in June 1988, and the loan was
signed in January 1989, allowing the project to become effective in April 1989. The project was initially
expected to be completed by the end of 1992, and was extended in November 1991 till June 1994 (the
final closing date). In April 1994, a Government request for a further project extension till end 1995 was
declined by the Bank. The AGID claims to be in a position to complete the various unfinished studies
with local firms and under national funding since foreign consulting firms cannot visit the country because
of security conditions.
"   From the beginning (June 1989), the Bank Supervision Mission insisted on the necessity to contract a special
agreement for technical assistance to monitor the project.



-5 -
22.        Between June 1989 and November 1993, five Bank's supervision missions took place, all
staffed by one irrigation engineer, except for the last one which included an economist. These missions
should have been more multi-disciplinary. Moreover, considering the important procurement and
disbursement issues, which emerged from the very beginning, the assistance of a procurement specialist
and of an economist/finance specialist would have facilitated project implementation. The Bank task
managers were not in a position to adequately advise AGID on the Bank procurement procedures and
accelerate disbursements, especially in the difficult local context, where administrative and financial
procedures were particularly complex.
23.        In May 1992, the Bank sent a Programming/Implementation Mission (PIM) to Algeria to
conduct a review of the main issues affecting the Bank's portfolio and to identify problems hampering
projects execution. The main bottlenecks were procurement, disbursement, institutional capacity,
mobilization of technical assistance, and the water tariff structure for the regional irrigation agencies.
For the studies showing important delays in execution, an action plan was prepared outlining the measures
to be taken to ensure continued Bank support. It is unfortunate that this action plan has never been
applied seriously by AGID. It is also regrettable that a mid-term review did not take place to possibly
reformulate the project objectives and components, in particular the ten-year national irrigation plans and
the small scale schemes inventory and development program.
24.        Most of the loan covenants were not complied with, despite several Bank reminders. This
situation could have led to the suspension of loan disbursements, but Bank management was reluctant to
take such stringent measures, considering the difficult circumstances prevailing in the country. In June
1993 and November 1993, the Bank threatened the Government of possible disbursement suspension if
an audit report and the ten-year plans were not sent before new deadlines defined to the Borrower. The
Government provided the requested documents just on time. However, the project's status was such that
the Bank closed the loan on June 30, 1994 without a further extension requested by the Government.
F. Borrower Performance
25.        During the 1980s, the irrigation sub-sector was significantly affected by serious disruptions
due to the following institutional changes:
-       1985: Creation of OPIs (Offices des perimetres irrigues), responsible for the
operation and maintenance of irrigation infrastructure in the main irrigated areas;
-      August 1987: Creation of AGID  (Agence Nationale pour l'Irrigation et le
Drainage), with full responsibility for design and construction of the irrigation
infrastructure, overall planning and coordination of activities related to irrigated
schemes under the control of the Ministry of Hydraulics and Forests, which
became the Ministry of Equipment and Housing in 1990.
-       1988: the OPI are given the status of EPIC (Etablissement public a caractbre
industriel et commercial), depriving them of Government subsidies but keeping
water charges at unsustainable levels, and therefore reducing OPI's efficiency
particularly in O&M tasks.
-       1992: the responsibility for the whole irrigation sub-sector was transferred from
the Ministry of Equipment to the Ministry of Agriculture.



-6 -
AGID Assessment.
26.        AGID made reasonable efforts to ensure an efficient implementation of the project, but most
of its efforts were thwarted by cumbersome administrative and financial procedures outside AGID
jurisdiction. AGID endeavored to strengthen its structures, the most noticeable results being the Studies
Department which was the most directly involved in implementing the project. AGID's efforts to recruit
competent staff were constantly hindered by private sector firms which attract qualified technicians by
higher remuneration and incentives.
27.        In general, the AGID staff was not familiar with the Bank procurement and disbursement
procedures nor with the complex national budget process of the various banks involved in the project's
administrative circuits. For procurement matters, despite the Loan Agreement stipulations, Government
officials maintained that Algerian laws prevailed over all other signed agreements.
Performance of consulting firms.
28.        The association of foreign and national firms was considered helpful and offered an excellent
training opportunity for Algerian firms. The foreign and local consulting firms involved in the project
generally performed well in the demanding Algerian conditions, in particular permanent payment
difficulties. The use of Eastern European engineering firms (Energoprojekt from the former Yougoslavia
and Tesco from Bulgaria) on several studies also generated some problems, such as the UN embargo on
EnergoProjekt. Security conditions which have made visits in Algeria difficult aggravated the project's
implementation.
Assessment of technical assistance and training.
29.        The project did not benefit from any technical assistance, although 20 man-months were
planned. This was mainly due to the cumbersome procedures for contracting short-term consultant's
services. AGID preferred not to undertake complex administrative proct lures to obtain technical
assistance which, also, was not always perceived as necessary. As for training, the project was expected
to constitute an excellent means for strengthening AGID staff; frequent contacts with the consulting firms
provided some limited on-the-job training; no other form of training was offered, due to local procedures.
Project monitoring.
30.        According to the SAR, several AGID department chiefs were expected to monitor the
consultants' activities and act as contact people for the consulting firms. In fact, only the AGID's Studies
Department was entrusted with some form of follow-up, but the actual technical monitoring of the project
was rather limited, mainly due to the lack of external technical expertise.
31.        Another monitoring shortcoming was the lack of an AGID book-keeping system in US
dollars, which did not allow a follow-up of resources and expenditures for each category of loan
proceeds, and did not provide balances for remaining activities. During the last supervision mission in
September 1993, the Bank proposed a simplified cost table system to AGID so as to monitor the project's
expenditures. This system has been used since then in all AGID progress reports.

Project progress report.
32.        AGID prepared 11 semi-annual progress reports from June 1989 to December 1994 which
were used by the Bank to follow-up the project from headquarters and during the supervision missions.
Compliance with covenants.
33.        Table 10 shows a detailed status of legal covenants. The Government complied with the
covenants related to project accounts, financial records and audits although, with delays and after several
Bank reminders.  The main covenant, regarding the submission of the draft ten-year irrigation
development plans by the end of 1989, was not complied with.
G. Assessment of Outcome
34.        The project outcome at the closing date was unsatisfactory since most of the studies and
development plans were not completed or satisfactorily conducted. AGID did not benefit from training
and technical assistance. However, from monitoring the various studies, it has acquired some experience
in approaches for preparation of irrigation development plans and in particular, its Studies Department
has been strengthened.
35.        Some feasibility studies are valuable, and if security conditions permit it, most of the
corresponding irrigation schemes can be implemented. The results of the inventory of small-scale
irrigation schemes by satellite imagery is disappointing..
36.        The ten-year national plans for irrigation development must be improved and must take into
consideration the results of the National Water Master Plan (PNE: Plan National de l'Eau), prepared by
the Ministry of Equipment, since allocation of water resources is a major issue, especially in the western
part of the country.
H. Future Operation
37.        Future operations should focus on the continuation of some of the most relevant feasibility
studies, concentrating on rehabilitation of existing schemes rather than on new schemes.
38.        At the project's closing date, the Bank proposed to the Government to prepare an
Agriculture Sector Adjustment Loan (ASAL) aiming to assist the Government in the necessary
reorganization of the agricultural sector, with a particular view to laying future irrigation development
in Algeria on sound foundations. Some of the studies of the Irrigation Engineering Project can be taken
into consideration in the ASAL.
I. Key Lessons Learned
39.        Key lessons learned from the project can be summarized as follows:
(a)        Priority should be given to rehabilitation rather than expanding irrigation with
new projects.  A formal Bank irrigation sector study, approved by the
Government, should clearly determine the sectoral priorities;



(b)        In the absence of any credible regional land use and water resources plans, the
design of large and complex irrigation projects must be carried out in various
phases: master plan, economic and technical feasibility and then detailed
design study.
(c)        Since the appraisal stage, Government made it clear that it would never
prepare the ten-year irrigation plans with the Bank's assistance. Long-term
planning may therefore be an unrealistic exercise if it is not backed by a
trustful dialogue Bank/Government;
(d)        Several years after the project's start, AGID developed some capacity to
supervise consulting firms. Training courses on procurement procedures
would have certainly accelerated the implementation of the project.
Disbursement is a major generic issue affecting all Bank's projects in Algeria
and not only the Irrigation Engineering project; it should have been addressed
at departmental level instead of project's level;
(e)        Evaluation of government capacity to monitor and subsequently use advanced
technology such as satellite imagery should have been made at appraisal. The
capacity of the consultant to carry out such a sophisticated study should have
been assessed during bid evaluation and Bank supervision should have detected
earlier the likely failure of the study:
(f)        Workable arrangements regarding technical assistance and training should have
been made during appraisal and enforced by appropriate covenants in the Loan
Agreement.

Table 5: Key Indicators for Project Implementation
No real key indicators were identify at appraisal. The delivery date (end 1989) of the draft of
the 10-year irrigation development plan was the sole covenant agreed in the loan agreement; the draft was
only submitted late-1993. The implementation of the other studies were also delayed, but the
postponement cannot be quantified, as no deadlines were proposed at appraisal.
