MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
UL THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE DEMOCRATIC AND POPULAR REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA
FOR AN IRRIGATION ENGINEERING PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed engineering
loan to the Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria for US$14 million is
submitted for approval. The proposed loan would have a term of 15 years,
including 5 years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate.
The loan would help finance irrigation engineering studies including the
preparation of a 10-year irrigation development plan.
2.       Background.  At Independen . in 1962, Algeria was predominantly an
agrarian society with a limited industrial base. The basis of independent
Algeria's economic policy was the promotion of industrialization and reduced
dependence on foreign investments and imports. The major instruments used in
the pursuit of this strategy were the application of centralized planning to
the economy, reliance on public enterprises in industry and services, an
agrarian revolution which included land reform with the creation of socialist
sector farms, and a shift from the export orientation developed during the
colonial period to meeting domestic food requirements. The strategy, fueled
by the development of hydrocarbons met with some success; the economy grew at
an impressive 72 p.a., compared to 32 p.a. for other middle income countries
as a group. This and other impressive achievements were, however, accompanied
by serious disequilibria. In the early eighties, Government moved to
eliminate these disequilibria with a shift in economic policy that emphasized
improved management and efficiency of the economy. This became all the more
important as most economic indicators fell sharply unfavorable in response to
the 1986 oil-shock. Responding to the oil-shock and the new policy direction,
Government has initiated a series of courageous and far-reaching reforms
cutting across most sectors of the economy. These reforms aim to decentralize
the economy, make it more responsive and market oriented, increase its
efficiency essevtially through better utilization of existing capacity, and
place greater reliance on the small but growing private sector. In the
agricultural sector Government has initiated profound reforms, notably the
liberalization of marketing and prices of fruits and vegetables and the
breakup of the state farm sector which accounted for about 60-70X of the
agricultural potential of the country.
3.       While agriculture's contribution to GDP has declined since
Independence it remains one of the crucial sectors in the economy; some 252 of
the labor force is employed in agriculture.  The growth of the sector over the
past 15 years, at about 2.6% in real terms, has been insufficient to keep pace
with the growing demand for food. Algeria now imports 70% of its basic food
requirements, compared to only about 302 twenty years ago. Yields of most
principal crops have stagnated and remain considerably below those of
neighboring countries with similar climates and soil conditions. With the
recent (1987/88) dissolution and virtual privatization of the state farm
sector, sectoral investments will now be made in a highly favorable
envirorment to bring about increased growth. In future, it is Government's



-2-
intention to focus on the strengthening of agricultural services and to
channel more resources for agricultural investment through credit to private
farmers and for improving agricultural infrastructure, in particular,
irrigation which can provide for a major source of stable growth in the sector
and make domestic production less dependent on uncertain rainfall.
4.       Algeria's irrigation potential, estimated at about 850,000 ha, is
still largely under-exploited. At present, Algeria's total irrigated area
area at 400,000 ha provides about 30S of the value of Algeria's agricultural
production and covers about 472 of total irrigable land. Comparatively,
Morocco, with 900,000 ha of irrigated land has exploited about 701 of its
potential and Tunisia about 802. Given a ten-year time span between the start
of design ane the end of construction, it is crucial to build up a portfolio
of irrigation engineering studies at the level required for financing
decisiont and contract awarding. In view of the heavy financial implications
of investment programs for irrigation and the consequence on agricultural
oroduction, it is also essential to set up adequate mechanisms for long-term
strategic planning. The proposed project would help meet these needs.
5.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Only about 1.71 of Algeria's total
land area is cropped in any year because of low and erratic rainfall, and the
limited availability of land suitable for agriculture. Algeria has scope for
raising agricultural production only through increasing yields, expanding the
area under irrigation, and reducing fallow. The project forms an integral
part of the Bank's strategy in the agricultural sector and is closely related
to the ongoing Cheliff Irrigation Project and prospective further investments
in irrigation (Mitidja), credit, extension and research, and fertilizer
distribution. The Bank's focas is thus on helping Algeria increase sectoral
growth by strengthening support institutions -- aimed at increasing yields
through better use of existing resources - and by expanding the avaiLability
of credit and the area under irrigation. The Bank's involvement is justified
because the project is expected to have an important impact on investment
planning in this key subsector.
6.       Project Obiectives.  Long-term planning for irrigation development
has never been given priority by MHF as priority has been given to the
provision of the major infrastructure required for domestic and industrial
water supplies. I comprehensive long-term plan for irrigation development is
now required to iu ntify investment priorities and ensure consistency of the
proposed investments with sectoral programs for water resources ind
agricultural development. This needs to be complemented with an adequate
portfolio of detailed engineering studies to avoid delays and help meet
Government's objective of expanding the area under irrigation by more than
10,000 ha per year. At the same time, the recently formed National Agency for
Construction and Operation of Hydraulic Infrastructures for Irrigation and
Drainage (AGID) needs to be strengthened through the provision of high level
technical assistance and necessary equipment and vehicles. Bank participation
in the proposed project would meet these objectives and would benefit the
Borrower by making available to AGID direct and indirect experience in
irrigation engineering available in the Bank. It would also provide real
opportunities for on-the-job training of AGID professional staff.

7.       Proiect Description.  The proposed project would comprise (a) the
preparation of regional programs for the development of small-scale irrigation
based on an inventory of existing schemes and an assessment of potential
througihout an area of 250,000 km in the north of Algeria; (b) the
preparation of engineering studies for four major Large-Scale Irrigation
projects, selected from priority projects, on an aggregated area of 85,000 ha
at .he level of detail required for execution; (c) the preparation of a
10-year strategic developsr.nt plan for irrigation development that would
clarify strategic options, assess priorities in light of their economic costs
and benefits, and review thc potential application of different technologies;
(d) the provision of short-term technical asaistance to AGID on specific
issues related to project implementation; and (e) the provision of key
equipment to improve ACID's and MHF's efficiency and capacity.
8.       Proiect Cost and Financing.  The total project cost is estimated at
US$20 million, including local taxes and duties equivalent to about
US$4 million. A breakdown of the project costs and of the financing plan is
shown in Schedu'e A. Amounts and methods of procurement and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events is given in Schedule C. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 6840-AL, dated
May 27, 1988, is also attached.
9.       Actions Agreed on.  During negotiations, agreement was reached on:
(a) the timetable for completing the 10-year development plan, (b) the
consultant selection and procurement procedures to be used in accordance with
Bank guidelines, and (c) the auditing of project accounts waintained by the
Government.
10.      Benefits.  The proposed project would improve irrigation investment
planning and would thereby improve the overall selection of projects that
would now be part of a well articulated irrigation development strategy. It
would also assess irrigation technologies seeking to find appropr4ate
least-cost solutions. Finally, it would help train and provide on-the-job
training for staff of AGID, the principal agency for planning and implementing
irrigation projects in Algeria.
11.      Risks.  The proposed Project does not involve special risks.  The
strong support being lent to irrigation development by the Government should
ensure the adequate and timely provision of local funds for project
execution. Satisfactory quality of consulting services will be assured by
itsing selection procedures consistent with Bank guidelines. Adequate
coordination and supervision would be provided by AGID.
12.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed Loan.
