The key\n            lessons learned from the project can be summarized as\n            follows: (a) Expanding irrigation should be contingent to\n            the approval of a formal sector study and a good regional\n            land use and water resources plans; (b) The studies of large\n            and complex irrigation projects must be carried out in\n            several phases (master plan, feasibility study and detailed\n            design). Each phase should start only after approval of the\n            preceding phase. Detailed design should be carried out only\n            when a precise donor has been clearly identified; (c) Long\n            term planning may be unrealistic if not backed by Government\n            commitment and supported by a strong Bank-Government\n            dialogue; (d) Procurement and disbursement procedures should\n            be perfectly clarified with the Borrower and training should\n            be provided before the project's start so as to avoid\n            considerable delays; (e) When advanced technology such as\n            satellite imagery is used, careful evaluation of the\n            Government's capacity to monitor the Consultant's\n            work should have been done at appraisal. The capacity of the\n            Consultant to implement such technology should also have\n            been assessed during bid evaluation and the Bank's\n            supervision missions should have closely followed up the\n            study's products, (f) Workable arrangements should have\n            been made during appraisal and enforced by appropriate\n            covenants during negotiations, as regards technical\n            assistance and training component."}, "docdt": "1995-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
