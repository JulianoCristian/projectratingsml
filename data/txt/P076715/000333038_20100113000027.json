AND CONTROL (APL)", "versiontyp": "Final", "loan_no": "7140", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the HIV/AIDS Prevention and\n            Control Project for Grenada were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was substantial, Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and Borrower performance was also moderately\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the project\n            design should match the country context and the capacity\n            available in-country. Using a template model that may work\n            well in other countries creates implementation delays and\n            unrealistic expectations. This applies especially to\n            commitment by all stakeholders, especially Civil Society\n            Organization (CSO) and to establishing the appropriate\n            institutional framework for program implementation.\n            Technical and fiduciary teams struggle to cope with\n            responsibilities at inception in a health sector that is a\n            first time borrower and where collaboration between more\n            than one ministry is key to successful implementation.\n            Therefore, ensuring that the operations manual is simple to\n            use and clearly outlines institutional and project team\n            roles and responsibilities as well as\n            authority/responsibility relationships is essential to the\n            success of the project. The project fell short of\n            accomplishing all its objectives. The timeframe needs to be\n            realistic, especially if working in countries where\n            implementing agencies have weak executing capacity and no\n            history of involvement in complex multi-sector programs and\n            where the leading sector is a first time borrower. The World\n            Bank needs to be strongly involved from the beginning\n            insisting on a quality operational manual that spells out\n            roles and responsibility of implementing agencies, which is\n            to be held accountable, fiduciary capabilities and proper\n            procedures for engaging line ministries and contracting with\n            civil society; and supervision missions staffed with\n            experienced professionals able to provide technical assistance."}, "docdt": "2009-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
