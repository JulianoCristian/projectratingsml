relevant\n            law, the Waste Management Act (2001), only recently\n            enforced. Regrettably, except for some general requirements,\n            specific biomedical waste regulations are non-existent, and\n            likewise, the policies in health facilities regarding\n            comprehensive waste management, with little or no training\n            for biomedical waste management. The recommendations this\n            report provides to minimize biomedical wastes, include\n            stipulations that new biomedical waste treatment\n            technologies, will be presented in another report. It does\n            nevertheless review practices, the most usual being\n            incineration of wastes. However, this practice for regular\n            wastes - which include plastics - as well as biomedical\n            wastes, and which does not segregate wastes, poses fire\n            hazards to surrounding vegetation, including threats from\n            other combustible materials, in addition to releasing air\n            pollutants - toxic dioxins, acid gases, particulates and\n            heavy metals. It is thus recommended the use of incinerators\n            be minimized, and, that halogenated plastics, heavy metals,\n            pressurized containers, and organic solvents be not burned\n            under any circumstance. Instead, biomedical waste should be\n            encapsulated, and buried in selected landfills, under\n            special arrangement with the Solid Waste Management\n            Authority. Specific short-term recommendations are provided\n            for each facility, and include the treatment of chemical\n            waste as hazardous materials, not to be drained, but rather\n            disposed of at selected landfills as well. General long-term\n            recommendations suggest strengthened laws and regulations;\n            institutional policy; administration and organization;\n            occupational safety and health; waste segregation and\n            classification; and, adequate handling and transportation\n            procedures, while contingency planning, should also include\n            training and education. Above all, stakeholder awareness and\n            participation, should lay the foundation for the development\n            of a national biomedical waste management plan."}, "docdt": "2002-04-29T00:00:00Z"}
