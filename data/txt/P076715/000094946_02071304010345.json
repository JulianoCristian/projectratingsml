Multi-Country APL for the Caribbean Region, with the\n            following objectives: 1) curbing the spread of HIV/AIDS\n            epidemic; 2) reducing the morbidity and mortality attributed\n            to HIV/AIDS; 3) improving the quality of life for persons\n            living with HIV/AIDS (PLWAs); and 4) developing a\n            sustainable organizational and institutional framework for\n            managing the HIV/AIDS epidemic over the longer term. There\n            are four project components. The first component identifies\n            areas of systematic discrimination, introduces measures\n            prohibiting discrimination and human rights denial, promotes\n            behavioral change, maintains people's awareness of\n            HIV/AIDS risks and protection measures as well as safe sex\n            practices, and launches a major schools initiative, resorts\n            to non-traditional practices, wages mass media campaigns,\n            and conducts special presentations. The second component\n            supports clinical preventive interactions for reducing and\n            controlling HIV/AIDS; clinical management of sexually\n            transmitted diseases, prevention of mother-to-child\n            transmission, tuberculosis diagnosis and treatment, and\n            blood bank and laboratories quality control. The third\n            component upgrades current services available for providing\n            care to PLWA, and for treatment, including introducing\n            triple anti-retroviral therapy; and finances manuals and\n            staff training. The fourth component funds institutional\n            development, management, and surveillance."}, "docdt": "2002-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
