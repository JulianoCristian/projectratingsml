F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The Government of Grenada (GOG)'s HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Project, funded
under the Multi-Country APL for the Caribbean Region, has the following objectives: a)
Curbing the spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic; b) Reducing the morbidity and mortality
attributed to HIV/AIDS; c) Improving the quality of life for Persons Living with
HIV/AIDS (PLWAs); d) Developing a sustainable organizational and institutional
framework for managing the HIV/AIDS epidemic over the longer term; e) responding to
the challenges in the prevention and control of HIV/AIDS in the aftermath of hurricane
Ivan.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The project development objective is to assist the Government of Grenada to control the
spread of HIV/AIDS and to mitigate its socio-economic impact through: (a) scaling up
prevention services for both high risk groups and the general population; (b) expanding
and strengthening treatment, care and support for people living with HIV/AIDS
(PLWHA); and (c) strengthening the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Health,
other Government agencies and civil society organizations to ensure an effective multi-
sectoral response to the epidemic.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

HIV was first diagnosed in Grenada in 1984. By 2001, with a population of about 101,000, the
number of reported cases had reached 216, of which 138 were males and 78 females. Most of
the cases were between the ages of 15-44, although as of 1994, seven children had been
diagnosed as HIV positive. At the time of project appraisal, 106 reported cases had died, leaving
110 persons living with HIV/AIDS. Among these, seven to ten persons were believed to be
certified AIDS cases (by virtue of their elevated CD4 counts). For each of the years between
1999 and 2001, 15-19 new HIV positive individuals were being detected in Grenada (see Annex
10).

In September 2000, the Caribbean Regional Plan of Action evolved as an outcome of the
Caribbean Regional Conference. The Plan of Action endorsed National Strategic Plans (NSPs)
with a comprehensive approach that included a) prevention; b) care and treatment; and c)
institutional development, management, and coordination (including monitoring and evaluation).
During the same time, the World Bank initiated its Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program (MAP)
for the Caribbean Region. The World Bank pledged US$155 million over several years on this
multi-country effort with the intended effect of engaging many countries, raising political
awareness, providing the first significant financial resources to combat the disease, and
demonstrating the World Bank's commitment and determination. Further underscoring
HIV/AIDS as an important focus for the region, the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) in 2001
for the Eastern Caribbean Sub-Region highlighted HIV/AIDS prevention and control as a key
policy issue and an urgent area of intervention.

In response to the increasing number of HIV-positive cases, and the global and regional push
towards a comprehensive approach to managing HIV/AIDS, Grenada developed in 2001 an NSP
that was consistent with the guidelines established in the MAP Adaptable Program Lending
(APL) for the Caribbean Region. It gave equal importance to prevention and treatment and care.
While led by the public sector, the strategy aimed to involve wide participation of civil society
through the NGO, FBO, and CBO communities.

The World Bank involvement in supporting the project was considered valuable given the
Bank's likely contributions to policy consolidation on HIV/AIDS in Grenada, improved
management of prevention activities, technical expertise for ensuring appropriate scaling up of
Anti-retro Viral Therapy (ART), and transfer of global lessons of experience. These were
particularly important issues to Grenada given the complexity of HIV/AIDS where best practices
were still emerging.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators

The Government of Grenada's (GOG's) HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Project, funded
under the Multi-Country APL for the Caribbean Region, had the following Project Development
Objectives (PDOs): a) curbing the spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic; b) reducing the morbidity
and mortality attributed to HIV/AIDS; c) improving the quality of life for Persons Living with


                                               1
HIV/AIDS (PLWAs); and d) developing a sustainable organizational and institutional framework
for managing the HIV/AIDS epidemic over the longer term.

The outcome indicators, relative to 2002 as a base year, included:

    a) Number of reported cases of positive HIV infection
    b) Mortality rates attributed to AIDS
    c) Level of discrimination and receptivity of PLWAs in public and workplace, and care
       givers
    d) National response management established and maintained, and HIV/AIDS program
       participants by multi-sector partners and agencies mainstreamed

Thirteen output and six process indicators are outlined in Annex 11.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

First revision (Board approved on November 19, 2004): Hurricane Ivan hit Grenada on
September 7, 2004 with devastating impact and created challenges in the prevention and control
of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The Hurricane damaged more than 90% of the island's building
structures, including the health service delivery infrastructure critical for the implementation of
activities under the HIV/AIDS project. The island's central laboratory and second largest
hospital were completely destroyed. The central hospital, other secondary care facilities, the
central medical store, and all health centers sustained various degrees of damage. The estimated
cost of reconstruction and rehabilitation was US$ 10 to 12 million.

The GOG and World Bank agreed to revise the project by adding an emergency work plan that
included the reconstruction and refurbishing of the central laboratory, including equipment for
HIV/AIDS testing, as well as for other priority rehabilitation activities. A new PDO was added
to the original list of PDOs: e) responding to the challenges in the prevention and control of
HIV/AIDS in the aftermath of Hurricane Ivan.

Second revision (Board approved on June 1, 2007): After a multiagency review of all
HIV/AIDS projects in the Caribbean1 and the Mid-Term Review (MTR) by the World Bank, it
was determined that the PDOs needed to be aligned more closely with project outputs rather than
with the national HIV/AIDS program to which they contributed. The revised project
development objective was to assist the GOG to control the spread of HIV/AIDS and to mitigate
its socio-economic impact through: a) scaling up prevention services for both high risk groups
and the general population; b) expanding and strengthening treatment, care and support for
PLWA; and c) strengthening the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Health, other
Government agencies and civil society organizations to ensure an effective multi-sector response
to the epidemic. The revised framework and targets are presented in Annex 12.

Support for the restructuring was as follows: a) the Prime Minister confirmed the Government's
intention to implement the project and acknowledged that it may be necessary to reduce the
scope of the project; b) the Bank remained the largest source of funding (85%) for HIV/AIDS in
Grenada (see Annex 13); c) the instability following the hurricane demonstrated the importance
of ensuring that the Government had a suitable response in place to reduce risk factors (including
HIV/AIDS) that arise from social volatility that follows natural disasters; d) the Government
demonstrated its commitment to enhancing implementation capacity evident from progress in
filling key positions within implementing agencies.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries, original and revised

Original: Project activities targeted the whole population, with particular emphasis on high-risk
groups such as HIV/AIDS-infected pregnant women, children born from HIV/AIDS infected
mothers, adolescents, sex workers, Men who have Sex with Men (MSM), uniformed personnel,
and hotel and tourism workers. Scaling up of programs for the prevention, care, and control of
the epidemic also intended to strengthen the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Health
(MOH), other related government agencies, and civil society organizations (CSOs).

First revision (Board approved on November 19, 2004): In addition to the original
beneficiaries, changes in the project as a response to Hurricane Ivan benefited population
rendered more vulnerable to HIV post Hurricane Ivan.

Second revision (Board approved on June 1, 2007): The second restructuring focused on,
among other things, improving the implementation of the project by simplifying the project
design and clarifying roles and responsibilities of the implementing agencies. These changes
contributed to carrying out the stated objectives of the national HIV/AIDS program. While the
beneficiaries remained the same as those specified in the PAD and first restructuring document,
the second restructuring enhanced the project so that its objectives were met and ensured that the
benefits reached the target groups. Specifically, the project aimed to reach 80 female sex
workers, 80 MSM, 80% of pregnant women accessing HIV/AIDS counseling and testing, and
provide ART to 50 PLWA (see revised Results Framework in Annex 12).

1.5 Original Components

The project activities targeted the whole population, with particular emphasis on high-risk
groups mentioned earlier. The project had four components as follows:

Component 1: Promotion and Behavior Change (US$1.41 million; Bank financing US$1.35
million): The project financed the technical assistance of legal experts, advocacy NGOs, and
PLWAs to (i) identify areas of systematic discrimination and the perceived denial of rights
against PLWAs, (ii) promote fair treatment, and (iii) introduce legislation prohibiting
discrimination and human rights denial. In addition, special population groups would be targeted
according to risk of infection, for promoting behavior change leading to healthy and safe sex
practices. Ministries and other agencies would carry out identification of these vulnerable groups
and formulate and implement action plans.




                                                3
Component 2: Prevention and Control (US$2.01 million; Bank financing US$1.89 million):
This component supported preventive activities for reducing and controlling HIV/AIDS:
voluntary, counseling, and testing (VCT); clinical management of sexually transmitted infections
(STIs); prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT); tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis and
treatment; Blood Bank and laboratories quality control; medical waste management; and condom
distribution. The project supported the creation of the National Infectious Disease Control Unit
(NIDCU) within the MOH. NIDCU's mission is to reduce the burden of infectious diseases and
arrest the progress of selected diseases.

Component 3: Access to Treatment and Care (US$ 1.15 million; Bank financing US$ 1.04
million): The project supported upgrading current services available for providing care for
PLWA, and for treatment, namely (i) strengthening laboratory capacity to diagnose HIV and
opportunistic infections (OIs); (ii) development/adaptation of clinical protocols, and training of
health personnel; (iii) pharmacy strengthening in order to provide a supportive environment for
the utilization of ART; (iv) strengthening Infrastructure for Community Health Services; and (v)
expanding the infrastructure and capacity for OI treatment and management of ART. Specific
family education materials for home care were also financed.

Component 4: Institutional Development, Management and Surveillance (US$2.34 million;
Bank financing US$1.46 million): The project supported the establishment and operation of the
(i) National AIDS Council (NAC) whose mandate was to provide policy guidance and leadership
to the multi-sector program; (ii) NIDCU. Moreover, the project provided resources for the
installation of a Surveillance System, which included system design, adaptation of available
software, and procurement of hardware, installation, provision of information technology (IT)
support, and the training for practitioners, laboratory staff and MOH researchers required to use
the system. The project also financed periodic surveys of knowledge, attitudes and behavior
(KAP) to support the targeting of messages. Lastly, it financed research proposals focused on
specific research issues, such as HIV/AIDS epidemiology, behavioral changes, clinical and
community management of HIV/AIDS and cost effectiveness of interventions.

1.6 Revised Components

First restructuring (Board approved on November 19, 2004): In response to the damage that
resulted from Hurricane Ivan, the GOG requested the reallocation of US$ 636,600 and SDR
525,200 (total of US$1.3 million) into a new disbursement category for a new component of the
project (Part E: Emergency Response to Hurricane Ivan). This component financed: (i) the
establishment and operation of the NAC Directorate as needed for its expanded role for the
prevention and control of the epidemic and difficult working conditions post Hurricane Ivan; and
(ii) strengthening Borrower's capacity to respond to the additional challenges on the prevention
and control of HIV/AIDS caused by Hurricane Ivan.

Second restructuring (Board approved on June 1, 2007): The Multiagency Review and MTR
concluded that the slow progress in implementing the project were due to Hurricane Ivan and the
extremely weak implementation capacity. The MTR also found that the project needed to reduce
its scope in view of the overall absorptive capacity and because of additional funds that the GOG
had received from the Global Fund to fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (hereafter



                                                4
referred to as the Global Fund). The changes simplified the project design and realigned project
components. The project components were consolidated from four to three to simplify execution:

Component 1: Civil Society Organizations and Line Ministries Response (US$ 0.34 million;
Actual expenditure US$ 0.27 million): This component supported the activities of CSOs and
non-health ministries in line with the Government's strategy of a multi-sector and multi-
stakeholder response to the epidemic. CSOs were determined to have access to vulnerable and
at-risk population groups, some of which were difficult-to-reach through regular Government
services, including: youth, commercial sex workers (CSWs), MSM, orphans, PLWA and others.
Support from the project was estimated to scale up ongoing activities; information, education,
and communication/behavior change communication; sensitization and advocacy to address
stigma and discrimination; distribution of condoms and care for PLWA and orphans.

Component 2: Health Sector Response (US$ 2.79 million; Actual expenditure US$ 1.64
million): This component supported the health sector response to the epidemic through
financing of treatment, care, and health facility based prevention services which included: ART,
strengthening of management of sexually transmitted infections, strengthening laboratory
services and blood safety; PMTCT; management of HIV/AIDS, OIs, and VCT; promotion and
distribution of condoms; information, education communication/behavior change communication
(IEC/BCC) and management of biomedical waste. Financing included (i) provision of drugs and
medical supplies; (ii) minor civil works (to refurbish health clinics to increase physical space for
extension of the VCT services; (iii) and rehabilitation of houses of PLWA); (iv) training; (v)
consultant services; (vi) and equipment, including a laboratory information system. The support
complemented financing from the Government and donors such as the Global Fund.

Component 3: Institutional strengthening, program management, Monitoring and
Evaluation (US$ 2.08 million; Actual expenditure US$ 1.44 million): This component
supported strengthening institutional capacity for program management, monitoring, and
evaluation. The project's results framework was revised to make it consistent with the national
monitoring and evaluation framework. The project supported the National HIV/AIDS
Directorate (NAD), NIDCU, NAC, and the centralized Project Coordination Unit (PCU), in the
office of the Ministry of Finance.

1.7 Other significant changes

First restructuring (Board approved on November 19, 2004): An amendment to the
Loan/Credit Agreements was made to reassign undisbursed loan and credit proceeds to address
new challenges in the prevention and control of HIV/AIDS emerging in the aftermath of
Hurricane Ivan. The GOG requested that US$ 1.3 million be relocated into a new disbursement
category for a new component of the project (Part E: Emergency Response to Hurricane Ivan).

In order to accommodate the request of the GOG, the following modifications to the Loan and
Credit Agreement were made:

       Article III of the Loan Agreement: the revised version incorporated the National AIDS
       Council Directorate as an agency critical for the execution of the project;



                                                 5
       Schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement: the revised version introduced new disbursement
       categories (6b and 7), reflected the requested reallocations of Loan (US$ 636,600) and
       Credit (SDR 525,200) and increased all the disbursement percentages to 100% as per the
       recently approved financial parameters;
       Schedule 2 of the Loan Agreement: the revised version included the additional
       development objective and the new project component with the activities to achieve the
       objective;
       Schedule 4 of the Loan Agreement: the revised version established more flexible
       procurement arrangements for the new project component.

Second restructuring (Board approved on June 1, 2007): In addition to revising the PDOs
and simplifying the project design by realigning project components as stated above, the
restructuring included the following:

       Revised results framework. The results framework needed to be aligned more closely
       with the project outputs rather than the national HIV/AIDS program to which they
       contributed (Annex 12).
       Changes to the institutional arrangements to clarify roles and responsibilities of the
       implementing agencies involved in the project execution. Factors that contributed to the
       slow implementation included the weak capacity and lack of clarity of institutional
       arrangements with unclear definition of roles and assignment of responsibilities;
       Updated costs of project activities with a reduction in the overall cost of the project to
       reflect a more realistic absorptive capacity. The GOG had, since the design of the
       project, received additional funding from the Global Fund. The experience during the
       initial years of project implementation had also shown that the absorptive capacity of the
       government was lower than had been initially anticipated. The World Bank's project
       funding was therefore reduced from the initial US$ 6.04 million to a new combined
       Loan/Credit sum of approximately US$ 5.28 million. The project costs were revised to
       take account of these changes.
       Extended loan closing date by two years to June 30, 2009 to allow adequate time for
       completion of project activities.

These changes were also reflected as amendments to the Loan and Credit Agreements.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Soundness of the background analysis: The Bank adopted design features from other MAP
programs in the Caribbean Region, including: a) demonstrating a high level of government
commitment to provide clear national leadership for a project; b) building collaboration networks
with NGOs and community groups; c) deconcentrating the functions to address the epidemic; d)
focusing on treatment and care as a continuum in the project; e) providing focus on behavior
change of specific groups; and f) adopting implementation measures that provide flexibility and
responsiveness to a changing epidemic.




                                               6
While these features exemplified what the project needed to accomplish, the Bank team did not
address the local challenges that might have hindered the implementation of these features and
how they might be overcome. For example, the project suffered implementation delays as a
byproduct of the lack of qualified experts in the country to manage and implement the program,
as well as weak institutional capacity. As indicated in the CAS for the Eastern Caribbean Sub-
Region in 2001, there was lack of human resource capacity and poor institutional capacity in the
region.

Assessment of the project design: Grenada had no prior experience working on large multi-
sector development projects in which a variety of implementing agencies are required to
collaborate. Given the poor institutional capacity in the country, the project should have had a
simpler design and organizational structure. Nonetheless, the project proceeded with a design in
which the three key governmental implementing agencies were placed in three different
ministries that had in the past shown to have communication problems ­ NAD within the Office
of the Prime Minister, NIDCU within the MOH, and PCU within the Ministry of Finance. To
complicate matters, incorporating CSOs into the design, while critical for a successful multi-
sector response, created further confusion. CSOs within Grenada had no previous background in
working across agencies or dealing with large donors, such as the World Bank, that required
involved reporting, procurement, and financial practices. Consequently, the design was too
complex as evident from the following problems that the project encountered:

       The capacity of the PCU, responsible for financial management and procurement,
       initially faced difficulties due to lack of staff with pertinent experience. This was the first
       of the nine World Bank projects in different sectors that the PCU would eventually
       handle; total World Bank funding for the nine activities equaled USD 43,294,317.
       Poor communications between the NAD and NIDCU, as well as with PCU, because of
       lack of leadership and credibility (documented in ISRs).
       National CSOs were slow to seek support from the project because of lack of information.
       The CSOs also faced the challenge of learning the complicated process of submitting
       funding proposals that met World Bank standards.
       Institutional arrangements had unclear definitions of roles and responsibilities for
       coordinating of their respective functions.
       Cumbersome implementation processes, procedures and reporting relationships that
       impeded efficient execution of the many multi-sector tasks resulted in slow execution of
       activities

Assessment of risks: The project received an Overall Risk Rating of "S." The Bank team
highlighted three critical risks ­ delays in counterpart funding, inability to maintain staff
consistency, and a problem of overcoming openness vis-à-vis stigmatization ­ to realizing
project outputs as well as three other risks ­ achieving financial sustainability, achieving good
project governance and accountability, and maintaining government commitment ­ that could
hamper accomplishing project objectives. The mitigating measures proposed addressed how to
minimize these risks. However, the measures proposed to address the project's inability to
maintain staff consistency focused broadly on building institutional capacity; given the lack of
human expertise in Grenada, addressing specifics such as how to develop human capacity that
could eventually fill vacant positions would have been more suitable to mitigate the problem. In
particular, the sub-risk category of maintaining consistent staffing received a risk rating of "M."


                                                 7
But the issues of adequate staffing remained a real problem throughout the life of the project;
thus, a risk rating of "M" for this sub-category may have been overambitious and should have
been an "S." The CAS for the Eastern Caribbean Sub-Region in 2001 had already highlighted
limited human capacity as a real problem in the region.

2.2 Implementation

First restructuring as a response to Hurricane Ivan: The restructuring involved reallocation
of USD 1.3 million into a new disbursement category to finance: a) the establishment and
operation of the NAC Directorate as needed for its expanded role for the prevention and control
of the epidemic and difficult working conditions post Hurricane Ivan; and b) strengthening the
GOG's capacity to respond to the additional challenges in the prevention and control of
HIV/AIDS caused by Hurricane Ivan. Specifically, the restructured project had hoped to supply
PLWAs with drugs, food, and supplies required for the rehabilitation of their homes, as well as
restore water damaged health service delivery infrastructure. Despite the urgency of
restructuring and responding, no budget expenditures were recorded in the system for one year
after the restructuring, indicating absence of implementation.

Second restructuring as a response to multi-agency review of the Caribbean projects and
the MTR: More than two years into the project, very few activities had been implemented; only
7% of funds had been disbursed at the time of the independent multi-agency review in October
2005. The assessment from the independent review highlighted the following shortcomings: a)
weak capacity and lack of clarity of institutional arrangements with unclear definition of roles
and assignment of responsibilities; b) cumbersome implementation processes and procedures,
especially for procurement and financial management; c) specific difficulties encountered in the
procurement of civil works and information technology; d) low level of buy-in and involvement
of key stakeholders outside the health sector; and e) Hurricane Ivan which struck the country and
disrupted all national programs. The MTR in February 2006 identified specific changes required
to put the project back on track. They included: reviewing the project development objectives;
revising the results framework; updating project costs; refining institutional implementation
arrangement and identifying critical staff needs. Following the MTR, the GOG responded by
filling management positions at the NAD, NIDCU, and PCU. This strengthened the capacity of
the Government to implement the Project.

Hurricane Ivan: The damage that resulted from Hurricane Ivan in 2004 destroyed the country's
infrastructure. During the next 15 months after the hurricane, the project slowed down,
disbursing only USD 81,081. This was underscored in the multiagency review and the MTR as a
major contributing factor for the slow implementation progress. In fact, one of the challenges
that the MOH faced in the aftermath of the hurricane was having to run its makeshift office out
of a ship.

Unfilled and unqualified staff key positions: Three key positions for project implementation
(NAD Director, Chief Medical Officer in the MOH, and Director of NIDCU) remained vacant
for a long time. Furthermore, the Acting Deputy NAD Director in place was inexperienced. This
created a vacuum in strategic leadership and coordination, which stalled the implementation of
the project. As mentioned earlier, the GOG responded to the second restructuring by filling in
key positions at NAD and NIDCU. The World Bank intensified its supervision, with the annual


                                               8
supervision expenditure increasing by 42% from USD 55,000 per year during the first four years
of the project to USD 78,000 per year during the last three years. Beyond this, the World Bank
also hired three short term consultants (implementation specialist, architect, and information
technology) to help strengthen implementation.

Change in Government: Elections held on July 8, 2008 resulted in a change in government that
affected key positions at the Ministries of Health and Finance. These newly placed government
officials had to catch-up on the status of a slow moving project. Based on discussions between
the Ministry of Health and the World Bank team, the new GOG expressed an interest to extend
the project with a broader health focus (see ISRs #19 and #20). The GOG failed to submit a
formal request to the Bank however, and so the project was not revised at that time. Overall, the
change in government shifted the country's health priority to a less HIV/AIDS-centric approach.
This shift resulted in an absence of interest and leadership that further deteriorated the
implementation of the project.

Lack of political commitment: Prior to the project, Grenada had an NSP that it had adopted
from the CARICOM HIV/AIDS strategy. In September 2003, Grenada drafted a revised NSP to
guide the country's national response to HIV/AIDS for an unspecified period. This draft was
never finalized and ratified by the government by the time the project ended. Another indication
of the government's weak commitment was the lack of physical space provided to NAD (or
limited space in the case of NIDCU) to properly implement its program activities. Although
adequate spaces were eventually provided, the space restriction that these agencies had to deal
with at the beginning set the standard for the questionable level of commitment from the
government. As such, most of the funds used for the project came from the IDA grant (86% of
original commitment), while only 63% of the government's original commitment was utilized;
the IBRD loan was hardly touched as only 1% of the original amount was disbursed (see Annex
1).

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E design: The required M&E elements proposed for the project were too complicated and
the process of installing an HIV/AIDS/STD Case Management and Surveillance Information
System and respective IT platform too involved. What worked instead were simple reporting
formats that were developed and used by CSOs, LMs, and private sector entities participating in
the national response. With these simple reporting tools, data were collected at the point of
service and aggregated by the M&E Coordinator at the NAD. The challenge with bringing
together all available data, however, was that the organizational arrangement did not give the
NAD authority over health sector activities as the minister of health insisted on keeping control
of all health sector activities. Consequently, data from the health sector were never submitted to
the NAD, preventing a clear overall picture.

M&E implementation: M&E implementation remained absent for most of the project due to
Hurricane Ivan, to weak implementation capacity, and to the absence of an M&E culture.
Because of the emergency situation created by Hurricane Ivan, the procurement of the
Information System and IT platform for this MIS was suspended. By the end of the project, three
quotations for developing the health information system had been received by the government,
but a selection had not yet been made. Adding to the bottleneck in moving the M&E component


                                                9
forward was the inability to quickly fill key positions: M&E Coordinator at the NAD and of the
Surveillance Officer at MOH. Successfully recruiting for these positions in 2007 helped to
initiate the process of data collection and draft the National M&E Framework. Moving forward,
only after the NSP has been ratified by the Cabinet will the MOH know whether its proposal,
including the future government funding needed to set-up the information and M&E system, can
proceed to completion.

M&E utilization: Collection of 2006 data, the first year of available data, occurred only after
hiring the M&E Coordinator and the Surveillance Officer. Since then, data collection has been
performed on a monthly basis through simplified forms. The 2006 to 2008 NAC annual reports
were based on a summation of quarterly reports. The evidence presented by the scarce data
provided useful guidance in finalizing the National Strategic Plan 2009-2015. Data were also
used for the 2008 UNGASS Country Progress Report.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Environment: Grenada participated in a review of its biomedical waste management and
agreed to consider recommendations to improve the situation, supported by the OECS Solid
Waste Program. Based on a medical waste management assessment, the project received an
environmental category of B. The assessment provided a list of recommendations to be
undertaken under the auspices of a newly formed Biomedical Waste Management Team within
the MOH. The recommendations focused on altering the structure of biomedical waste
management environment in the following areas: national laws and regulation; institutional
policy, administration, and organization; waste segregation and classification; waste
minimization; color coding and transporting; final disposal; and training for health care
personnel. At the time of the final supervision mission, only limited progress could be observed:
incinerators were purchased and installed, and a report on the legislation/regulations for
biomedical waste management was completed; however, procurement on a number of planned
items remained outstanding and planned training of staff did not take place. The indicator to
increase the number of public health practitioners trained in the last 12 months about Biomedical
Waste was not reached (target: 20; actual: 0). Thus, while the project did no harm, it did not do
as much in way of improvement as it could have done.

Fiduciary Management: Prior to the MTR in Feb 2006 and restructuring in June 2007, the
capacity of the PCU responsible for the FM remained inadequate as evident from the poor
quality and delays in FMR and withdrawal applications. The resignation of three officers
(accountant and two assistant accountants) greatly impacted PCU performance. Steps taken to
alleviate ineffectiveness in FM included bringing on board financial management staff with
experience from other World Bank projects and clarifying FM procedures and requirements.
Since then MFR, audit reports and withdrawal applications have all been prepared and submitted
in a timely fashion.

Procurement: Prior to the restructuring, the PCU experienced significant procurement delays
mainly due to understaffing, the lack of skills among existing staff and of coordination with the
NAS. In addition, a report by the former NAD Director in 2005 indicated that "the self-imposed
isolation of the PCU from the NAC and NAD is mainly the result of the parallel line of authority
established by the MOF in project implementation." Actions taken to resolve the problem


                                               10
included bringing in a procurement specialist and new staff with experience from other World
Bank projects; clarifying institutional and implementation arrangements and World Bank and
GOG procurement procedures; and providing technical assistance through World Bank resources.
Procurement picked up since restructuring when most of these corrective actions took place,
evident from disbursing USD 2.0M or 76% of all disbursed amount.

Disbursement: Project implementation, which had stalled in the first half of the project,
displayed substantial activity after the MTR when only 6% (USD 0.35M of USD 6.04M) had
been disbursed against the original loan/credit amount. Within six months of the MTR,
approximately 23% (USD 1.4M of USD 6.04M) had been disbursed or committed, exhibiting a
three-fold increase. This coincided with the enhanced capacity of NAD and NIDCU (NIDCU
Director and Surveillance Officer had been recruited) and fully staffing the PCU. The June 2007
restructuring resulted in further improvements in implementation. Between June 2007 and the
closing date of the project in June 2009, 87% of total funds disbursed for the project occurred
during this period; however, this only represented 38% of the original loan/credit amount or 44%
of the formally revised loan/credit amount. The total amount disbursed by the end of the project
was USD 2.6M, indicating a formally revised disbursement lag % = 49.78.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The NAD has been incorporated into the NIDCU under the MOH. However, none of the NAD
staff involved in the project were asked to stay. Two staff members have been hired, the
HIV/AIDS Response Coordinator and an administrative assistant, to take over the responsibility
of NAD, with support from NIDCU. While certain activities, such as engaging with CSOs, have
continued, the reduced NAD capacity means that the implementation of the HIV/AIDS Program
has slowed down. Additional staff will be needed to maintain and surpass the progress achieved
through the World Bank program. A budgeted plan for the AIDS Program of USD 6.00 million
through the year 2015 has been included in the current draft of the NSP (dated April 7, 2009).
However, the NSP has to be finalized and submitted to the Cabinet for ratification.

The Caribbean Epidemiology Centre (CAREC) was scheduled to undertake a regional
Behavioural Surveillance Survey (BSS) in 2009, which has now been postponed until 2010.
Results from this survey will follow-up on key indicators from the 2005 BSS, including those
used in the Results Framework for this project. Although plans for a national M&E system,
including funding needed, have been reviewed by the MOH, a functioning system cannot be put
in place until the NSP is ratified by the Cabinet.

The AIDS Strategy and Action Plan (ASAP) within UNAIDS provided feedback to Grenada's
NSP in 2008. However, given the draft status of the current NSP and the changed environment,
such as the impact of the economic crisis, follow-up support may be needed to finalize the NSP.
Support from the World Bank's Global Monitoring and Evaluation Team (GAMET) will also be
critical as the country establishes its system.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation



                                              11
The relevance of PDOs: satisfactory. The objectives are consistent with the CAS for the
Eastern Caribbean Sub-Region (2001) where the Bank aimed to help reduce poverty by building
human and institutional capacity, including direct provision of services to the population such as
HIV/AIDS services. The PRSP (2006) underscored efforts at poverty reduction, which included
reducing prevalence of HIV/AIDS by strengthening AIDS activities. It is now known that the
HIV epidemics in the Caribbean (including Grenada) are complex and possibly unique,
exhibiting neither the highly concentrated pattern of most countries nor the widely generalized
pattern of Eastern and Southern Africa. This makes programming especially difficult, and puts a
premium on employing heterogeneous prevention methods, which the project did. Currently,
Grenada is in the process of finalizing its NSP for 2009-2015, in which the document proposes to
engage a multi-sector strategy that the National HIV/AIDS Program began in 2003; the NSP is
awaiting Cabinet approval. The revisions made to the PDOs during both restructuring process
still had improving prevention and control of HIV/AIDS at its core.

The relevance of design and implementation: unsatisfactory. While the objectives of the
project remained consistent with the country's development and national priorities, the project
fell short of what it needed to achieve due to its design and implementation arrangements. For
such a small country, with a population of approximately 100,000, keeping the NAD and
NIDCU under the MOH could have produced a strong and high profile response to HIV/AIDS as
the current arrangement. However, the project design applied a MAP feature that may have been
successful in some larger African and Caribbean countries, namely "demonstrating a high level
of government commitment and providing clear national leadership for a project" by insisting on
placing the project in the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM). This design feature was not
applied in Jamaica or in St. Kitts & Nevis, where the projects were located in the MOH and
worked well; and it was applied, but has not been successful, in Trinidad & Tobago. As it was,
the Grenada project experienced great difficulties and significant delays partly because of the
disconnect between the NAD and NIDCU. Putting the NAD in the OPM created an additional
reporting relationship. It would have been better to keep both the NAD and the NIDCU under the
MOH. This would have fostered better communication, improved working relationship and
understanding of each other's role, and less rivalry. One of the first decisions of the new
administration was to move NAD out of OPM and into the MOH architecture, which currently
remains uncertain as the NAD and MOH wait for Cabinet approval. Furthermore, fiduciary
functions were centralized in the MOF for all donor-supported projects. This represented an
efficient design given that in Grenada, as in a number of small Caribbean countries, qualified
financial management specialists and procurement specialists are in short supply and must be
shared among projects. However, this created three reporting relationships to three different
Permanent Secretaries: one to MOH, one to MOF, and one to OPM.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Original PDO
Rating: Unsatisfactory. During the first seven months of the project, the NAD Director's
position was vacant, at which time no implementation actions were taken. After the position was
filled, delays continued due to lack of clarity in the role and responsibilities of the NAD, NAC,
and PCU. Under the original PDO, which lasted one and a half years from the start of the project,
only USD 0.27M (5% of original USD 6.04M loan/credit amount) was disbursed, mostly to



                                               12
cover operating costs, consultant services, and goods other than ARVs and laboratory materials
(data retrieved from client connection).


First revision to PDO
Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory. The revised PDO was exactly the same as the original,
except for the addition of a fifth objective focused on responding to the challenges in HIV/AIDS
prevention and control in the aftermath of Hurricane Ivan. This change also meant an additional
component to the project and two new disbursement categories. The new component provided
support to the Borrower and to the operations of the NAC Directorate in its capacity to respond
to the additional challenges caused by Hurricane Ivan. Expenses would be charged against the
new categories.

Implementation progressed slowly even as work was initiated on building homes for PLWAs,
rehabilitating health clinics, training staff, staffing key implementing agencies, clarifying
institutional and implementation arrangements for implementing agencies, revising the M&E
framework, and implementing the bio-medical waste management, including reviewing of legal
framework and drafting of legislation for waste management.

Second revision to PDO
PDO #1: Scaling up prevention services for both high-risk groups and the general
population.
Rating: Moderately satisfactory. As enumerated in Annex 12, the project succeeded in
expanding condom promotion (target: 250,000; actual: 413,219), increasing the number of
people counseled and tested for HIV (target: 2,500; actual: 3,477), increasing access to
interventions among the youth (target: 300; actual: 1,218), and increasing the percentage of
pregnant women counseled and tested (target: 80%; actual: 80%).

Two of seven indicators that support this PDO fell well short of accomplishing their targets: the
number of FSW (target: 80; actual: 28) and the number of MSM (target: 80; actual: 13) reached
by HIV/STI prevention. Based on UNAIDS data modeling, low-end estimates of population size
among vulnerable groups indicated that Grenada had at least 105 FSWs and 521 MSMs.2 Using
these estimates, the project only reached 27% of FSWs and 3% of MSMs. See Annex 14 for
more details as to why these targets may not have been reached.

PDO #2: Expanding and strengthening treatment, care and support for PLWA.
Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory. The target for the indicator that supports this PDO is the
"cumulative number of PLWA receiving anti-retroviral therapy" was almost achieved (target: 50;
actual: 47). Despite not reaching its goal, the figure 1 below shows that Grenada made progress.

Available data indicated that while more people are getting tested, only 0.23% tested positive,
well below the prevalence rate of 0.42%.3,4 There is a concern that it is the healthy people who
are being tested rather than those most-at-risk. In addition, the graph in Annex 10 depicts a high
mortality rate among AIDS cases, indicating that the health sector is reaching cases late.

Due to implementation delays, the project failed to conduct Post-Exposure Prophylaxis training
or establish a health information system and a Biomedical Waste Management system as planned.

PDO #3: Strengthening the institutional capacity of the MOH, other Government agencies
and CSOs to ensure an effective multi-sector response to the epidemic.
Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory. The number of line ministries implementing HV/AIDS
work plans (target: 6; actual: 4) and number of engaged NGOs receiving financial and technical
support within the last 12 months of the project (target: 35; actual: 12) were lower than the
project targets (see Annex 12). However, looking beyond just the last 12 months, 107 project
proposals were submitted from 53 CSOs between 2006 and 2009. Of these, 63 projects from 31
CSOs were approved and executed. The project also saw an increase in private companies
engaged in HIV/AIDS activities, including 17 companies being supported by PANCAP. Within
the Region, Grenada has had more private sector involvement than any other country. The first
three years of the project when hardly anything was accomplished represented a missed
opportunity to have line ministries and NGOs participate early. A big part of the success during
the last three years of the project came about from filling the NAD Directorate position with
capable persons who successfully engaged line ministries, CSOs, and private companies.

For the health sector response, the number of public health practitioners trained on VCT (target:
20; actual: 33) and PMTCT (target: 20; actual: 31) surpassed their targets. It is clear that the
health sector, particularly the NIDCU, had much to offer and was one of the stronger
implementing agencies in the project. The setback that hindered achieving more under this
objective was not being able to fill the Director position at NIDCU for a large period of the
project. Based on the indicators that support this PDO (Annex 12), the project surpassed four of
the eight (50%) indicators.

Summary of Outcomes: Moderately unsatisfactory. The overall achievement of the project is
rated Moderately Unsatisfactory based on a weighted calculation of the PDOs (see details in
Annex 15).

3.3 Efficiency
Almost half of the resources were originally planned for highly cost effective interventions (see
Annex 3). However, at the end of the project, only 23% of the funding was expensed for this
purpose, thus decreasing the potential impact of such interventions. For example, although
16.6% (or USD 1.00 million) was allocated for IEC, including those targeting high risk groups,
the project only spent 5.6% (or USD 0.34 million) on it throughout the life of the project. Had
more been spent on targeted IECs, as well as other planned activities, the project could have
made more progress in reaching CSWs and MSMs; as it stands, the project fell short of reaching
its targets (see Annex 12).

One success that can be pointed out despite limited spending is condom distribution. Even
though only a third of the original planned funding was used for condom distribution, the project
surpassed its target by 65%, distributing 413,219 condoms. The success can be attributed to
strategic decisions of where and when to distribute the condoms, such as during Carnivals. The
engagement of CSOs and the private sectors should also be credited since condoms were
distributed through them. Despite the strong success that the project had with reaching the youth
population, condoms may not have reached all high-risk groups given that the project failed to
achieve reaching its target with regards to CSWs and MSMs. It is hoped that CSWs and MSMs
would have been part of the youth population who most likely benefited the most.

A cost benefit analysis was calculated comparing a without-project scenario and a with-project
scenario (see Annex 3). The analysis estimated the HIV infections averted, resulting in
quantifiable benefits of averted productivity losses and savings on in-patient care and on
treatment of opportunistic illnesses. The net present value (NPV) of the project was estimated to
be negative USD 1,991.43 (based on a 10% discount rate) demonstrating that the project had not
added value to Grenada's effort to curbing the spread of HIV/AIDS. However, the data also
show that Grenada's prevalence remained constant at 0.42% over the life of the project and 41
new infections were averted. Without the project, the prevalence would have increased by 19%
from 0.42% to 0.50% during the same time period. From this perspective, the project had an
impact in the country. But because of the number of cases, the impact of the program in averting
41 new infections is not fully captured in the NPV. The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) could not
be calculated due to negative cash flows throughout the life of the project. Efficiency is rated as
moderately satisfactory.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory. The overall rating is moderately unsatisfactory based on
the following sub-ratings:     Relevance of the project ­ satisfactory;
                       Design of the project ­ unsatisfactory;
                       PDOs - moderately unsatisfactory based on a weighted rating scale (see
                               Annex 15 for details);
                       Efficiency ­ moderately satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development. While the project did well in
reaching the youth 15-24 years of age through its many mass campaigns and pregnant women


                                                15
through its PMTC program, it missed the opportunity to make an impact on other higher risk
groups indicated in the development objective, namely MSM and FSW. The indicator targets for
these groups show that the project fell short of meeting the target. These groups represent a
marginalized segment of the population, many of whom may be living in poverty; thus, a link
with them presents an opportunity, not only to provide them with HIV/AIDS related services, but
also to bring them into the system.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening. The project suffered long delays initially due to lack
of capacity to respond to the procurement and financial management needs required in
successfully implementing large donor-funded programs. By the end of the project, staff
members of implementing agencies, particularly the PCU, were submitting financial reports that
complied with Bank standards. Likewise, CSOs had to learn how to complete funding requests
forms using Bank standards, as well as coordinate their activities with other CSOs and
government ministries. In November 2009, the MOH received requests from CSOs for condoms
that would be used in mass campaigns during Carnival. This points to the strengthened capacity
of CSOs to initiate their own activities and to work with the MOH as part of their network. The
enhanced capacity in these agencies places Grenada in a better position to respond to and
implement future World Bank projects.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Substantial. The project reflects the country's priorities and commitment to fighting
HIV/AIDS as reflected in Grenada's NSP. In addition, efforts made since the program began in
2003 have increased awareness dramatically in the general population; the project helped
promote an openness in discussing HIV/AIDS. CSOs have been invigorated with the new
opportunities to work closely with a large multi-sector project, to which they can greatly
contribute.

Despite these changes, numerous other events posed detrimental barriers to the sustainability of
the development outcomes, including:

       The new government that has been in place since July 2008 is still in a transition mode.
       The first minister of health has already been replaced. The decision has been made to
       incorporate the NAD into the MOH. Presently, however, a restructured MOH
       organization map has not been approved, leaving the NAD and its current functions
       uncertain about the future. NAD staff in position during the project have all been released
       and no replacements have been identified other than one government official who will
       replace the NAD Director and be supported by one administrative assistant. Feedback
       from ASAP can provide useful, strategic guidance on the best option for moving forward.
       The project had difficulty in recruiting and keeping qualified staff during the life of the
       project. The lack of experience caused long delays in implementation. As a solution, the
       World Bank was able to provide expert assistance and increased support. As the program
       moves forward, it is anticipated that similar problems will continue. No sustainable


                                               16
       solution was developed to alleviate the constrained technical capacity in the country, and
       it is not clear how such a problem will be handled without the Bank's direct support.
       No M&E system was in place when the project ended. The complexity of the initially
       proposed M&E structure resulted in long delays in setting it up. The government does
       not appear to have the technical capacity to proceed and evaluate the system. This will
       require assistance from the World Bank and GAMET's ability to make such an
       evaluation.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

   (a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Unsatisfactory. The Bank designed a project that would be aligned with the Caribbean
and Grenada's priority of halting and controlling the spread of HIV/AIDS in a comprehensive
manner. The design also considered the environmental impact of the project and incorporated a
waste management system. The Bank utilized a multi-sector design common in many African
multi-sector MAP projects at the time. However, Grenada in many respects differed from
African countries and the multi-sector design may have inadvertently created project risks from
the beginning. For example, many African countries enjoy the presence of strong, sophisticated
institutions that developed through years of development assistance from large international
organizations. Grenada lacked the experience of many of its African counterparts. Grenada
presented many challenges in trying to learn and implement a large donor-supported project
within a short period of time. The project suffered implementation delays. Organizational
arrangements were complex dividing responsibility for project execution among three ministries
with no one being accountable for the whole project. This design flaw accounts for a large part
for the poor project performance. The M&E portion was too complicated and thus remained
incomplete at the end the project; an M&E plan had yet to be developed and approved by the
GOG. In addition, the Bank misjudged the country's absorptive capacity and failed to identify
project risks that had already been previously identified in World Bank publications, such as the
difficulty of poor institutional capacity and lack of human resource as major barriers in the
Caribbean (CAS 2001). More time and effort should have been placed in preparing the project.
As Annex 4 indicates, six staff weeks during the preparation stage represented a limited and
quick effort.

   (b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately satisfactory. The project's TTL changed four times over the life of the
project. The quality of supervision prior to the MTR was unsatisfactory. After the MTR the
supervision team met with all the government and non-government implementing bodies. This
provided the team with an opportunity to discuss relevant issues with all the partners, thus
gaining a better sense of how the project was truly running. Procurement and financial
management specialists were brought in to discuss issues with the local team and to develop a
solution. As a result, both procurement and financial management improved over time.




                                               17
The Bank had a delayed response to the needs of the stakeholders and keeping in mind the
objectives of the project. This was evident during the restructuring processes. It was only after
the MTR that several key decisions were made such as: (i) advertising the position of NAD
Director regionally and hiring a qualified and experienced person from Trinidad on a two year
contract later extended by one year until project closing; and (ii) appointing a Director of the
NIDCU. These two persons working in tandem with the new coordinator of the restructured
PCU were able to move the project quickly forward. The MTR also highlighted the potential
benefits that CSOs can offer if only they were intricately involved in the program. Listening to
the challenges faced by the CSOs, a restructured project included a more substantive role for
CSOs, as well as an easier process for participating. Moreover, many of the changes instituted
during the second restructuring mirrored recommendations provided by a multi-agency team that
performed a regional review of all Caribbean HIV/AIDS projects mid-way through Grenada's
project. To ensure improved implementation after the restructuring, the Bank increased its effort
as evident from the increased supervision budget.

   (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory. While the project design incorporated a comprehensive
multi-sector project based on previous experience, it had significant shortcomings and design
flaws. This earned the quality at entry a rating of unsatisfactory. For the supervision portion of
the World Bank's work, there were two phases: pre and post MTR. The post MTR supervision
identified shortcomings proactively and proposed resolution of threats. With this background,
the World Bank earned a supervision rating of moderately satisfactory. Given the contrasting
ratings between the quality at entry and quality of supervision, the final rating took into account
the outcome rating of moderately satisfactory per guidelines from the OPCS ICR handbook. The
overall Bank Performance rating is moderately unsatisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

   (a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory. At the inception of the project, the GOG had already
worked on responding to the HIV/AIDS situation through its commitment to the Caribbean
Regional Action Plan and through its work locally for a short period with the Strategic Team for
AIDS Reduction (STAR). The work of STAR involved government and leading business
partners developing a response to the ongoing situation. While the GOG was committed to
controlling the impact of HIV/AIDS, its readiness to appoint key staff was lacking. The
Borrower's own assessment should have identified its capacity as insufficient. Without the
guidance from key staff, the project stalled until the vacancies were filled, which for some took
years. This was critical given the lack of leadership from the NIDCU, which was solely
responsible for all the health component of the project. The Borrower could have also managed
its own internal working relationship more so that confusion and internal conflicts between the
OPM, MOH and MOF could have been resolved. As it was, much implementation time was lost.
It must be noted that for about 18 months after Hurricane Ivan, working conditions in Grenada
were extremely difficult; during this period hardly anything was accomplished. In fact, the
project was extended by two years to allow for activities to be fully implemented. By the end of
the project, the GOG presented a plan for incorporating the NAD permanently into its MOH.


                                                18
However, the plan has yet to be approved by the Cabinet. In the meantime, only one key person
is representing what was formerly the NAD; all the other NAD staff members have been let go.
Future government funding for HIV/AIDS specific activities also remains uncertain.

   (b) Implementing Agencies (NAD) Performance

Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory. The project went through a difficult time finding someone
to fill the Director's position. During this time, hardly any activities were implemented. Once
the position was filled at NAD, along with a full set of staff, it was active in moving forward
with its mandate. Much of the activities planned for the non-health component of the project
began only in 2006 (see Annex 2), a testament to the effort given by the NAD Director and its
staff. The NAD Director's background and insight provided a springboard towards reaching the
targets identified in the Results Framework. As an example, it was the Director's idea to
introduce more colorful and differently designed condoms than what was traditional distributed.
This resulted in a dramatic increase in condom distribution, surpassing the target of 250,000 by
2009 (actual: 413,219 condoms distributed). Moreover, the NAD faced a challenging
relationship with NIDCU. Given the division in responsibilities (NAD did all the non-health
components and NIDCU did all the health components), there appeared to be confusion as to
who should be answering to whom. Also, the fact that the first and second Directors hired were
non-Grenadians caused resentment among other local government and key staff who saw the
position going to an outsider with higher pay. In the end, however, the NAD did not reach some
of the targets set by the end of the project.

   (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory. While the GOG and the NAD can identify a list of
accomplishments, there were also significant shortcomings.

6. Lessons Learned

The following six lessons were learnt from the project:

       Efficiency: The use of NPV and cost-effectiveness analysis is of doubtful validity in such
       projects. The NPV indicated that the project did not add value. However, the small
       number of cases in Grenada, the wide range of uncertainty about the behavior of the
       epidemic in the absence of the project, and the lack of knowledge as to the effects of
       individual interventions raises a question of how reliable the NPV is in determining the
       benefit of the project. The professional literature is casting increasing doubt on the
       efficacy of some interventions and on the feasibility of calculating the discrete benefits of
       many others. It now appears more likely that some of the most important outcomes of
       HIV programs are the threshold effects (i.e. the non-linear dynamic effects) they produce
       on norms and behaviors through the cumulative impact of multiple interventions.

       Project design: Project design should match the country context and the capacity
       available in-country. Using a template model that may work well in other countries
       creates implementation delays and unrealistic expectations. This applies especially to



                                                19
      commitment by all stakeholders, especially CSOs and to establishing the appropriate
      institutional framework for program implementation.

      Project coordination:          Technical and fiduciary teams struggle to cope with
      responsibilities at inception in a health sector that is a first time borrower and where
      collaboration between more than one ministry is key to successful implementation.
      Therefore, ensuring that the operations manual is simple to use and clearly outlines
      institutional and project team roles and responsibilities as well as authority/responsibility
      relationships is essential to the success of the project.

      Implementation Capacity. The project fell short of accomplishing all its objectives. The
      timeframe needs to be realistic, especially if working in countries where implementing
      agencies have weak executing capacity and no history of involvement in complex multi-
      sector programs and where the leading sector is a first time borrower. The World Bank
      needs to be strongly involved from the beginning insisting on a quality operational
      manual that spells out roles and responsibility of implementing agencies, who is to be
      held accountable, fiduciary capabilities and proper procedures for engaging line
      ministries and contracting with civil society; and supervision missions staffed with
      experienced professionals able to provide technical assistance.

      Sustainability. The ability to retain technical and fiduciary staff after project closure is a
      necessary condition to guarantee operational sustainability. This did not happen in
      Grenada in the case of technical staff and only few will be available to continue
      controlling the spread of the HIV/AIDS virus and mitigate its impact. One tool to help
      sustain the national response is the NSP however in this case the NSP was never finalized
      and approved. The NSP is critical to ensuring the GOG's commitment to continue the
      HIV/AIDS Program, as well as conveying the message that HIV/AIDS prevention,
      treatment, and care remains a high priority for the government. The World Bank needs to
      ensure that the NSP is finalized and approved prior to project closure and offer the
      services of ASAP in developing NSPs specific to country situations.

      The Bank's Engagement in the Health Sector. Grenada is among the Caribbean
      countries with an estimated prevalence rate of less than one percent and with an epidemic
      that can be defined as concentrated in most at risk groups such as MSM, CSWs, and
      inmates. The government expressed interest in a broader approach that would assist the
      country in strengthening health services delivery in general, focusing on non-
      communicable diseases, which are the leading causes of death, while simultaneously
      maintaining the progress made in controlling the spread of the HIV virus. The Bank's
      future engagement in the health sector should be focused on health system strengthening,
      which could have sustainable impact.

The following section highlights the key outputs of the project by components.

  Components                                                  Outputs
Civil Society        Community-based activities targeting vulnerable groups. Prior to 2006, hardly any
Organizations        activities were accomplished due to the absence of leadership from the NAD. The
and Line             hiring of a competent NAD Director in 2006 was a significant factor in the increased
Ministries           participation of line ministries and CSOs beginning in 2006. From 2006-2009, 107
Response             project proposals were submitted from 53 CSOs. Of these, 63 projects from 31 CSOs
                     were approved and executed. A total of USD 211,556 was disbursed to support these
                     activities, with the World Bank providing 87% (USD 184,444) of the funding and the
                     Global Fund providing the remaining 13% (USD 27,112). This amount surpassed the
                     USD 100,000 allocated to this subcomponent. CSOs received additional support
                     through quarterly meetings, sensitization sessions, technical training, and provision of
                     IEC material for distribution. During this period, CSOs become fully engaged despite
                     their initial challenges with complying with funding proposal and procurement
                     requirements. This included private companies such as the Grenada Coca-cola Bottling
                     Company, Sisson Paints Company, Republic Bank, and RBTF Bank

                     The CSOs targeted the following vulnerable populations: MSMs, CSWs, prisoners,
                     rural women, and youths. A highlight of what the CSOs accomplished include the
                     following:

                       HIV/AIDS Community Outreach program that involved a 30-part radio drama
                          series entitled `Under the Shadows of Darkness.' The series addressed HIV/AIDS
                          issues and reached 159 persons.

                     Line Ministries. Five line ministries5 that submitted 2007-2009 workplans and received
                     76% (USD 12,058) of funding from the World Bank and 24% (USD 3,827) from the
                     Global Fund to support their activities. In addition, these line ministries participated in
                     sensitization sessions and Focal Point training events based on the International Labor
                     Organization's (ILO's) HIV/AIDS workplace training that required 40 hours of

                HIV/AIDS training. The funded activities included:
                  Identifying and training Focal Points within each ministry to serve as HIV/AIDS
                    resource person.
                  An HIV/AIDS Art Competition held by the Ministry of Education.
                  Sensitization and Health and Family Life Education (HFLE) programs developed
                    for teachers in primary and secondary schools.
                  HIV educational activities by CARICOM that reached approximately 1500 youths.

                Policy Development and Legislative Reform. In collaborating with the GOG, the last
                few years saw progress on several fronts:
                  Development of a National HIV/AIDS Policy, with the GOG covering the full
                     cost, and Guidelines for the Management of HIV/AIDS in the Public Sector.
                  Development of HIV/AIDS policies for schools and the workplace (remains to be
                     fully ratified by the Cabinet).
                  A National Assessment of Law, Ethics and Human Rights, with funding from
                     PANCAP. A regional workshop had been conducted, but a national legal
                     document remained to be drafted following the recommendations emanating from
                     the findings of the national assessment.
                  The project supported the work of consulting legal experts, advocacy NGOs and
                     PLWHA to identify areas of systematic discrimination and perceived denial of
                     rights against PLWHA to promote fair treatment and introduce legislation
                     prohibiting discrimination and protecting human rights.
                  The ILO and PANCAP funded work focused on creating a supportive environment
                     in the workplace. An HIV/AIDS Workplace Committee and the Private Sector
                     Representative on the National AIDS Council also contributed to the workplace
                     initiatives. A draft workplace policy had been completed and needs to be presented
                     to the MOH.

Health Sector   The NIDCU Director position remained unfilled for quite some time, resulting in a lack
Response        of strategic leadership and coordination that prevented rapid implementation progress
                despite project restructuring post Hurricane Ivan and increased supervision efforts.
                Ratings of "MU" reflected as such. Only after a Director was hired and the second
                restructuring in 2007 did implementation progress, receiving ratings of "MS" and "S".
                Towards the end of the project, planning and procurement delays resulted in the
                downgrade in rating.

                National Infectious Disease Control Unit (NIDCU). Establishing NIDCU was critical
                to respond to the health sector component of the project. The World Bank loan allocated
                the following funds for the National Infectious Disease Control Unit:
                   Director (position filled by current director: 2009)

             Treatment and Care. One of NIDCU's primary responsibility included providing
             treatment and care. During the life of the project, NIDCU showed progress on the
             following activities:
                Development of the National Treatment and Care Manuals and Protocols.
                Staff training. However, Global Fund grant and grants from other international
                   funding agencies funded most of the training
                Upgrade of the NIDCU
                Home care as part of continuum AIDS care; however, since 2006, this activity
                   was merged with home-based care activities under component 1.
                Technical Assistance in the design & supervision of homes for PLWHA/health
                   centers
                Rehabilitation and construction of five homes for PLHIV
                Provision of pap smears for HIV+ women. The GF paid for specialized services.
                Development of policy and protocols for post exposure prophylaxis (PEP)
                   strengthening. However, staff training for PEP never took.

             Promoting Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT). The project focused on a
             multi-pronged approach that produced the following outputs:
               VCT for couples (Couple Challenge Program)
               VCT Policy and Protocol that followed Johns Hopkins program for International
                   Education in Gynecology and Obstetrics (JPIEGO) standard format and
                   distributed to all health centre
               VCT outreach services during National VCT Days (2006-2008) and monthly
                   community outreach program, including IEC materials for outreach programs
               Opening of VCT sites (inclusive of the antenatal clinics) in 35 health centers in
                   Grenada and Carriacou. The Global Fund also provided US$30,000 to train
                   members of civil society, health care professionals and PLHIV community about
                   VCT; three health care professionals as Trainer of trainers; and health care
                   professional on `rapid testing.'

             Condom Distribution. Between 2006 and March 2009, the project spent US$ 24,272
             on procuring condoms, which were distributed through the NGOs, private sector, and
             pubic sector agencies. OECS/PPS procured additional condoms for distribution
             primarily to the health sector. Also, the GOG and the Global Fund provided an
             additional US$7,440 and US$13,392, respectively, for procuring condoms. In addition
             to condoms, the World Bank procured four female and five male demonstration models;
             UNFPA donated three female demonstration models to the National AIDS Directorate,
             Grenada Family Planning Association and the National Infectious Disease Control Unit.
             The `training of trainers' program facilitated condom distribution. Specifically, the
             NAD Coordinator for Line Ministry/Civil Society, who trained as a National Condom
             Management Trainer by UNIFEM, organized national workshops on condom
             management and HIV education for civil society and public and private sector agencies.

             Activities that were not completed.
               Upgrading of Condom Storage Sites ­ NGOs indicated that this was no longer a
                   need because of newly installed air-condition units that provided a cool
                   environment for the storage of the condoms. In addition, the rapid process of
                   distributing condoms did not require creating additional storage spaces.

                  babies born to infected mothers.

             Activities that were not completed.
               Purchasing laboratory kits ­ the challenges experienced by the health sector
                   served as a barrier to any progress.

             Pharmaceuticals (including anti-retrovirals), laboratory equipment and supplies
             for diagnosis and clinical management of HIV/AIDS, opportunistic infections
             including tuberculosis and STIs. The project spent funds on the following activities
             geared toward pharmacy strengthening:
                Purchase of anti-retroviral drugs and OIs drugs
                Upgrade of pharmacy facilities and preliminary designs for the
                   reconstruction/rehabilitation of other health facilities

             pharmacy information system.

             Medical Waste Management. As part of the component, major initiatives moved
             forward that placed Grenada in a better position to handle medical waste by-products.
             The National Biomedical Waste Committee played a critical role in developing key
             documents. The various outputs under this sub-component included:
                A Biomedical Waste Management Manual for Healthcare Personnel Bio-medical
                  Waste Management Policy for Grenada
                Bio-medical Waste Regulations for Grenada

As described in the PAD, Grenada's project likely reflected a highly cost-effective design given
that 54% of the project's funding went to activities corresponding to interventions included in
Table 1. However, a comparison between the planned allocation and actual allocation shown in
table 2 indicates that much less was spent on these activities. Based on the original loan and
credit amount of USD 6.04 million, the actual allocation towards these activities as a share of the
total cost accounted for only 23.2%. If solely looking at the actual disbursement of 2.64 million,
these activities received 52.8% of the total funding. This indicates that while the project only
implemented 44% of the funded activities due to various reasons, the project remained consistent
with its original focus given that it allocated 53% of the funding to these activities. The project
benefited from supplemental funding from external donors, most prominently the Global Fund,
in all four intervention areas.

Economic Impact of the Project

Although the project received support from many sources, as much as 85% of the financing came
from the World Bank (see Annex 13). Thus, any observed impact from HIV/AIDS services may
be attributed in large part to the World Bank financing.

With this in mind, a cost benefit analysis to determine the project's estimated net present value
(NPV) is presented in this section. Tables representing a without-project scenario and with-
project scenario were constructed to calculate the number of HIV infections averted that can be
attributed to the project. From these infections averted, the project benefits were calculated for
the cost benefit analysis.

The prevalence rate in year t is equal to the prevalence in year t-1 + incidence in year t ­ AIDS
deaths in year t. HIV prevalence in both scenarios is assumed to be 0.42% in 2002, based on
trend analysis using 2003 and 2007 HIV prevalence estimates.6,7 AIDS deaths, which came from
the number of reported deaths, are assumed to be the same in both the without-project scenario
and the with-project scenario.

The incidence rate between 2002-2009 is assumed to be 15 per 100,000 total population in the
without-project scenario, based on the author's own calculation using the Spectrum Modeling
Software8. This incidence rate may be an underestimate of the counterfactual trend, however,
since HIV incidence is likely to increase without prevention interventions. An underestimate of
HIV incidence may lead to an underestimate (or more conservative estimate) of the project
benefits. Table 3 shows the number of people newly infected with HIV and total people living
with HIV for the without-project scenario. Based on these assumptions the prevalence rate

The with-project scenario on Table 4 uses the same population figures but calculates number of
newly infected with HIV based on the prevalence rate observed in Grenada throughout the
project. The prevalence rate used is 0.42% based on estimates by CAREC (2003) and UNAIDS
(2007); the prevalence rate for the other years were linearly interpolated based on these two
estimates. Using these prevalence rates, we calculated the number of people living with HIV and
the number of people newly infected with HIV.

The number of infections averted was the difference in number of people newly infected with
HIV between the without- and with-project scenarios. The benefits from these averted infections
are calculated in Table 5 and are comprised of averted productivity losses (by remaining in the
workforce) and savings on in-patient care and on treatment of opportunistic illnesses. The
assumptions for this calculation are as follows:




                                                   31
       On average, an averted infection provides an individual with thirty-three more years of
       productive life. This figure is calculated as pension age of 60 years minus average age of
       infection of 27 years.
       Average annual productivity is valued at USD 3,446, which is per capita spending in
       2005.
       An infected patient will live for 10 years after infection with adequate care.
       The average annual cost of care per patient is USD 1,059, which is calculated as 14
       hospital days at USD 61 per day + $200 in palliative care and prevention/treatment of
       opportunistic infections.
       Benefits accrue five years after the infection has been averted for the disease to progress
       and translate into productivity losses and health care costs for the individual.

The stream of costs and benefits from the HIV prevention components of the project are shown
in Table 6. The calculation assumes that the GOG will spend US$1 million a year after project
closing to maintain the program based on Grenada's most recent draft of its NSP 2009-2015
dated April 7, 2009. From these costs and benefits, the NPV of the prevention components of the
project is negative USD 1991.43 (based on a 10% discount rate). Because the cash flows during
the life of the project were all negative, the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) could not be calculated.

The NPV is an indicator of how much value the World Bank investment adds to curbing the
spread of HIV/AIDS in Grenada. Given the NPV<0, the data indicate that the project was not
value added. However, not having invested in Grenada on an HIV/AIDS program could have
resulted in even more value destruction. For example, the project still exhibited benefits. In
particular, estimates in 2003 and 2007 illustrated a flat prevalence of 0.42% in the presence of
the project. Without the project, estimates demonstrated that the prevalence rate would have
increased by 19% throughout the life of the project from 0.42% to 0.50%. This brings up the
issue of relying solely on the NPV to determine the project's efficiency. In Grenada's case, such
small numbers of infections averted distort the project's impact based on NPV calculations.

Introduction and Overview of the HIV/AIDS World Bank Project

In 2002 Grenada successfully negotiated and was granted a loan from the World Bank to conduct
HIV/AIDS projects. The amount of money given to be used for activities was USD $5.3 million.
The project was to be completed in June of 2009. The Office of the Prime Minister was the
ministry under which the project was to be governed. A body of stakeholders referred to as the
National AIDS Council (NAC) was given the mandate to manage and give direction to the
project. The implementing agency was the national AIDS Directorate or NAD as it is commonly
called.
A document entitled Grenada HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Project, Project
Operational Manual (update) Draft February 2007 is the document used to give guidance to
the functioning of the National AIDS Council (NAC), the National AIDS Directorate (NAD), the
Project Coordination Unit (PCU) and other stake holder bodies that will assist in the
implementation of the World Bank HIV/AIDS Project during the initial stages of the project until
the National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan ( NSP) was done.
The objectives and purpose of the project is outlined in this document and thus helps in creating
a proper evaluative report of the World Bank project. This document was produced by the
Ministry of Health.
 Overall the objective endevoured to *Assist the Grenada Government to control the spread of
HIV/AIDS and to mitigate its social-economic impact through:
 A) Scaling up prevention services for both high risk groups and the general population;
B) Expanding and strengthening treatment, care and support for people living with HIV/AIDS
(PLWHA) and
C) Strengthening the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Health, other Government agencies
and civil society organizations to ensure an effective multi- sectoral response to the epidemic.

Component 1: HIV/AIDS Response by Civil Society Organizations and line Ministries
This component will support The activities and projects that Line ministries Civil societies,
NGO's CBO's, faith based organization, youth Groups, private sector and non Health
organizations will create to assist in the fight against HIV/ AIDS.
During the period 2003 ­ 2009 there were over 106 projects written and submitted to be finances
by the above mentioned groups. A wide cross- section of the population and vulnerable groups
were provided with information and training programmes. This aided in the development of the
members of the said groups to combat the epidemic and the assist in the change of attitudes and
behaviors as it relates to HIV/AIDS in the general public.
Under this component the following sub activities were done:

   1) Information Education and Communication (IEC) activities done in this area were aimed
      to provide and maintain the general public awareness of HIV/AIDS and issues
      surrounding it. Stigma and discrimination awareness activities were promoted and done
      through IEC campaigns (e.g Put D breaks on AIDS; How yuh playing; and other similar
      activities) the general public was given information that would have assisted them in
      making educated decisions to protect themselves and treat other persons that may be
      infected with the disease with respect and human regard. Thus protection through
      condom use, stigma and discrimination were the main focus in the IEC campaigns. In
      terms of education for prevention; condom use was the aspect of the prevention strategy


                                               37
       that was mainly focused on. Abstinence and being faithful was not given much focus and
       not much programmes around these prevention components were done. Students and the
       persons within the education system can be considered as being part of the vulnerable
       group as they are not person who work, they have to depend on parents, condom use fro
       students is not allowed. Thus there was need to develop a programme that would have
       allowed students to gain strategies to deal with sexual advances made towards them.

   2) Advocacy the objective for this activity under component 1 was to provide favorable and
      policy environment that protect the rights of PLWHA. The review of legislation was done
      and documents written to address the issue of human right violations against PLWHA's.
      A human rights desk was established and manned by HOPALS an organization affiliated
      with CRN+.

   3) Delivering HIV/AIDS prevention services to high risk groups:

              Disaster Preparedness kits to PLWHA's
              Health and nutrition education for PLWHA's
              Prison programme
              Programme for MSM, SW
              Programme for youth
              Programme for women in the rural communities
              Programmes done by NGO's, CBO's and other civil societies

   4) Work place policy this aspect of the project sort to the development of work place policy
      as it relates to workers and issues surrounding HIV/AIDS. Consultancies were done and
      policies created to govern HIV/AIDS issues in the government work place. Thus
      documents were produced and are currently being used to deal with HIV/AIDS in the
      work place. The private sector has welcomed this policy and has allowed persons to
      educate their staff on HIV/AIDS prevention.

Component 2: Health sector response

The objective of this component was to support the health sector response through financing of
treatment, care and health facility based prevention services which will include: antiretroviral
therapy, strengthening management of sexually transmitted infections, strengthening laboratory
services and blood safety; PMTCT; management of HIV/AIDS opportunistic infections; VCT;
health distribution of condoms; information, education communication/behavior change
communication and management of biomedical waste.
The health sector would have completed most of the objectives set out for it to accomplish.
There was a great deal of success in this component as efforts were made to fulfill the mandate
of the objectives to ensure that the needs of clients were met.
While there was a great degree of success there were some challenges that hampered the
objectives being properly met. There was the challenge of staff to assist in reporting and data

                                              38
entry to ensure up to date records. There was a breakdown of communication between the NAD
and the NIDCU thus little support was given from the NAD to the NIDCU. Projects written by
the NIDCU to be financed were sometimes not considered or no response was given to the
NIDCU as to the status of the project submitted. This rift created problem in the execution of
projects that required the collaborative efforts of the both departments.

Component 3 Institutional Capacity for Programme Management, Monitoring and
Evaluation

This component of the project supports to the strengthening of the institutional capacity for
national HIV/AIDS programme management and for Monitoring and Evaluation of the national
response. Monies allocated for this component was spent yet the project lacked proper
management and supervision. Persons were not adequately prepared to handle the management
of the project and as such project lack proper relevance and thus did not create the impact on the
Grenadian public as they should. Value for money was lost
Allocation for proper Monitoring and Evaluation was not made and most projects submitted.
Overall there was not an M&E Report written at the end of the project. This has made it very
difficult to prepare a proper completion report.
Management care and supervision of items bought for the NAD office left much to be desired
and as a result it created wastage of materials. Due care and attention was not paid to the
equipment bought as there was a great deal of damage done to computers and other equipment.
Consultations were done and consultants were paid to produce documents for guidance and
management of HIV/AIDS. Some documents were produce from these consultations and are
helpful in providing direction towards the HIV/AIDS programme. However there are documents
still outstanding from consultations that were done under the Project. An example of this is the
NSP (National Strategic Plan). To date the NSP has not been ratified by cabinet because it was
not done to the satisfaction of the stakeholders, thus It has not been used to give guidance to the
National AIDS Programme.

Country's Performance

Grenada had the task of using the World Bank project to avert the spreads of HIV/AIDS and
educate the general public so to ensure that they take preventative measures to assure safety. This
overall objective though worked on was not fully achieved due to the method of implementation
of the programmes that were done. To measure the impact is a challenge as some of the project
written did not effectively have a component that allowed proper measurement of the impact.
The absence of the M& E officer in the evaluation of the some of the projects that were done
facilitated gaps in making proper evaluation of what was done. Over all, the project came to an
end in June and no M&E was done to ascertain the success/failure of the project
The following are some areas that speak to the Grenada's performance.

Highlighted Areas of success

     Condom distribution
         A vast number of condom were distributed during the existence and are currently
           be asked for by the general public. Persons are expressing the need for the
           availability of condoms and the need for it use at all times.


                                                39
    Distribution of IEC materials
         There are expression for the need of IEC material by organizations and the
            general public
    ARV distribution to PLWHA
         Reports from NIDCU indicates that most of their clients are accessing ARV's
            made available to them through the Project
    VCT training and campaigns
         Number of persons have been trained and are used to conduct testing throughout
            the country bringing much ease to nurses and other health care providers
    Basic knowledge of HIV/AIDS
         The general public has shown that the education programmes that were done were
            successful. Through discussions that are held via radio and television and the
            contribution made by persons via these mean shows a greater level of HIV/AIDS
            awareness.
         There is an increase in the amount of condoms distributed thus it is hoped that
            there is an increase in its use as well.
         There is still more to be done as some programmes were not designed to reach the
            "person on the ground". There are still myths and beliefs that need to be dealt
            thus education about the disease is still needed.

Concerns, failures and challenges

There are a number of concerns that are evident in the project that have been raised by the
Ministry of Health more specifically persons working in the field of HIV and AIDS. The
following are the concerns raised:

     Although persons are aware of the issues surrounding HIV/AIDS there is little change in
      sexual behavior.
     Incorrect information about HIV/AIDS was given in some of the education programmes
     Person handling the project were not adequately trained to manage the project
     There were communication issues between the Ministry of Health and the NAD
     Protocol for NGO's, CBO's and other organizations to access money was not always
      followed
     Programs paid for was started and not completed as there was little monitoring done.
     Persons and some groups/organizations did not submit reports about their projects at the
      end of their projects
     Little or no money was allocated to conduct M&E surveys and research on projects
     Little information was given to the M&E officer to make proper monitoring and
      evaluation of projects done
     The M&E officer was not allowed to sit on the committee to vet projects
     M&E was not part of some of the projects submitted



                                            40
     There were persons who worked with the World Bank project who were affiliated with
      NGO's or sat on the board of NGO's that submitted projects
     The impact of most if not all projects done was not measured as the M&E Officer was
      not allowed to be part of these project evaluation.
     The National Strategic Plan was not ratified and thus was not used to give direction to the
      project
     Monies was spent on hiring consultants and the product of some of these consultation are
      still forthcoming or are not yet completed

WORLD BANK'S PERFORMANCE

The World Bank facilitated a great opportunity for Grenada to create a positive impact in the
fight against HIV/AIDS. This opportunity was accepted and although under-utilized was
welcomed and it did make a small contribution in the fight against HIV/AIDS in Grenada. The
role that the World Bank played could have been better performed.
World Bank being the custodian of experience in the area of various projects throughout the
world was in a position to offer training and capacity development to the Grenadian project.
They did not provide those services enough to Grenada in the teething stages of the project and
as such Grenada suffered in being unable to create a solid foundation from which to build the
project with. While guidelines and protocols were established the monitoring of the strict
adherence to these guide lines seem not of great concern to the World Bank and thus was
forthcoming and badly lacking in the entire project.
There was need for training and capacity building for those persons who were given the task of
giving leadership to the project; specifically the NAD and the NAC. A more strict and close
monitoring mechanism should have been put in place to govern the approval of projects-if not
approval; at least after the project would have been approved some mechanism to evaluate the
relevance /impact of these projects at least for a time of one year. The M&E Officer should have
had strict guidelines that were created and monitored by the World Bank. These strict monitoring
would have deterred corruption and misuse of funds.
While there was a lot of money to accomplish the task, monies were not allocated to do proper
monitoring and evaluation, surveys and research were not done to ascertain the areas that needed
attention and thus monies were spent on projects that lack relevance and impact. Allocation
should have been made for research pre and post the Project to evaluate the impact of the project
and to identify areas that needed attention.
The project was filled with other funding agencies offering help to Grenada's efforts against the
HIV/AIDS epidemic. These agencies all fell under the NAD and NAC and this created some
management and administration challenges. To answer to various agencies and financiers would
require trained and qualified staff. Different agencies or government ministries should have been
given the responsibility to handle different funding agencies and not just one body ie.NAD/NAC.

Recommendations

       A simplier system of accessing finance should be developed
       The involvement of the M&E officer in all aspects of project analysis and
       development.


                                               41
   Monitoring and evaluation should be made and integral part of all projects submitted and
   must be budgeted for as part of the research component of the entire project.
   Shorter time span for reporting should be done and strict monitoring should be done by
   the Government and World Bank. This is to facilitate identification of problems with a
   view to addressing them early, also with the hope of getting early feedback.
   Structures such as the NSP, protocols governing the access of finances for projects;
   should be established before the project begins.
   There was a lack of adequate management skills to handle the project properly, thus there
   should be early training in project management especially projects of this kind.

Annex 14: Reasons that may have contributed to the difficulties in reaching high-risk
groups

First, stigma about HIV/AIDS remains high. An average of 6% among those in the 15-24 and 25-
49 years of age had accepting attitudes towards PLWA. 10 Current legislation in Grenada
contributed to such stigma; for example, the Criminal Code Section 431 states that "If any two
persons are guilty of unnatural connexion...each such person shall be liable to imprisonment for
ten years." This entry has been associated with MSMs and CSWs.

Second, the project partly relied on CSOs to reach high-risk groups because of their
"comparative advantages, focusing on serving the needs of specific target groups at risk" as
mentioned in the PAD. However, there was no indication that CSOs with long history of intimate
connection with either FSWs or MSMs succeed in quickly reaching target groups. With a
baseline of 0 in 2005 for both indicators, reaching 80 individuals would be insurmountable
without anyone with special access to these groups that remain plagued with stigma and
discrimination.

   (rounded)

 The overall rating is Moderately unsatisfactory based on subratings of the three PDOs: PDO1=Moderately satisfactory; 
PDO2=Moderately unsatisfactory; and PDO3= Moderately unsatisfactory;


While progress was slow between 2003-2006, the project improved drastically after the second
restructuring in 2007. During the period between the second restructuring and the end of the
project in 2009, the project disbursed 81% of its total USD 2.64 disbursement and accounted for
much of the accomplishments noted under the project. More time would have been needed to
complete all of the project's objectives. Based on a weighted average of PDO ratings, the
summary of outcomes was determined to be Moderately Unsatisfactory.

Given that the project was only functioning close to full capacity only between 2006 and 2009,
detecting the impact on HIV rates is difficult. The number of reported HIV cases jumped from a
two-year average of 15, 15, and 30 cases in 2002-03, 2004-05, and 2006-07, respectively.
Likewise, the number of reported AIDS cases rose from a two-year average of 14, 11, and 21
cases in 2002-03, 2004-05, and 2006-07, respectively. The increase in reported HIV cases in
2007 is partly explained by the detection of six new cases through the VCT program. For the
period when data are available, the percentage of patients getting tested among those visiting
antenatal clinics rose from 58% in 2005 and 50% in 2006 to 80% in 2007. This can be directly
attributed to the efforts of the PMTCT Coordinator, who was hired in 2007 and focused solely on
the PMTCT element of the project. Based on estimates showing that prevalence rates have
remained at 0.42% throughout the life of the project (see Annex 3), the increase in reported
cases HIV cases provide evidence that more cases are being detected, rather than an actual
increase in infection.

While it is difficult to make other direct assertions to the effect of project activities to the
changes in reported cases, advocacy activities and mass campaigns (see Annex 2) could be seen
as having raised awareness and contributed partially to the rise in reporting. Data show that 80%
of the population were reached through the mechanism of the mass media, distribution of
assorted IEC material, community outreach activities, Carnival campaigns in Grenada and
Carriacou, posting of banners with HIV/AIDS IEC messages in strategic areas in Grenada and


                                                             51
Carriacou, radio drama production, and use of motorcades and civil society to distribute IEC
material.

A study could have been designed to capture more conclusive data on high-risk groups, as well
as to verify the trends observed in the general population. For example, while the project clearly
surpassed its target for the number of condom distributed, the impact of this activity is not likely
to be seen in such a short period. Thus, we can only surmise that with the increased demand for
condoms that the project generated, the project will have made an impact in curbing the spread
of HIV/AIDS through its prevention activities.
