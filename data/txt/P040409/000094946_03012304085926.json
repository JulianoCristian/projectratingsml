being highly satisfactory;\n            project sustainability is highly likely. The World\n            Bank's overall performance is judged satisfactory;\n            similarly, Borrower performance is rated satisfactory\n            overall. Lessons learned include the following: Emergency\n            lending requires a clear assessment of the essential\n            elements for successful implementation, and demonstrated\n            government commitment to these elements. In this project,\n            the Government agreed to hire an experienced international\n            contractor using sole source negotiations and to provide $12\n            million to initiate the contractor's work. On the\n            Bank's part, emergency lending requires 1) intensive\n            implementation supervision to keep the project on track; 2)\n            willingness to take risks where the prospects for success\n            are uncertain; and 3) a continuity of project managmeent,\n            especially from the field office. The closing date of an\n            emergency project should be extended when the purpose is to\n            complete project components that will greatly enhance the\n            sustainability of project benefits. In this case, extending\n            completion to ensure that the water separation unit was\n            completed was essential for achieving sustainability of the\n            long-term integrity of the oil pipeline. To keep survey\n            participants' expectations on level with project\n            funding capabilities, the PIU needs to set clear social\n            program priorities, and maintain regular and timely\n            communications with the affected population. Only minimum\n            attention was paid to the extensive harm that the previous\n            oil spill had done to local communities. The local\n            population, however, viewed the most recent damage to their\n            ecosystem in the context of a long history of environmental\n            assaults. A return to the status quo just prior to the most\n            recent environmental assault left a residue of grievances of\n            justice unfulfilled. To minimize this kind of problem, the\n            Bank might wish to include a project component directed at\n            ameliorating preexisting problems. If loan funds are\n            provided to organizations that are candidates for\n            restructuring, frequent management or ownership changes\n            (including privatization), are likely to cause delays in\n            project implementation. The Bank needs to consider ways for\n            the loan's legal documentation to include agreements on\n            ways that the Bank and the Government would respond to such events."}, "docdt": "2002-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
