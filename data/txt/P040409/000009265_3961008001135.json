August and September\n            1994 and January 1995, leaks from the Kharyage-Usinsk\n            pipeline in the Usinsk region of the Komi Republic have\n            resulted in one of the world's largest oil spill. In\n            excess of 100,000 tons (730,000 barrels) of oil are\n            estimated to be trapped in very difficult to access bogs and\n            creek beds, three times the amount released during the Exxon\n            Valdez spill. In autumn 1994 over 20,000 tons (140,000\n            barrels) of oil were released into the Kolva River when\n            temporary dikes built to contain the oil, failed during\n            heavy fall rains. Serious damages were caused to downstream\n            communities, in particular, Kolva village, as a result of\n            the releases. The Komi Republic emergency Situation\n            Commission on October 10, 1994 declared an emergency in the\n            Kolva River area. Wholesale release of the remaining oil\n            into the river would create an ecological disaster,\n            threatening the livelihood of the downstream communities\n            which depend on the river system and the overall environment\n            of the Pectora river system into which the Kolva and Usa\n            rivers flow. Immediate priority is completion of structures\n            to contain the oil to allow orderly removal and disposal of\n            gross oil. Construction of significant new structures is\n            also required in the very limited time remaining before\n            spring thaw. In addition to the significant containment and\n            cleanup efforts required, further serious spills are likely\n            from the pipeline if urgent rehabilitation investment are\n            not undertaken. Continuation of oil production and transport\n            is also important to provide fuel for the heating plant\n            serving the Usinsk region. The project is justified on the\n            basis of the severity of the present and potential\n            environmental disaster, as well as the need to continue oil\n            production in a sustainable way in the Komi region. In\n            addition, this emergency operation will provide a vehicle\n            for studying and introducing oil spill mitigation measures\n            in Russia's pipeline network."}, "docdt": "1995-04-05T00:00:00Z"}
