RUSSIA:  Emergency Oil Spill Recovery and Mitigation Project (Ln. 
3872-6-RU)
Loan Amendment
Dear Mr. Ignatiev:
We have received a request to issue a special commitment in favor of Komineft, 
the implementing agency under the above referenced Project, in favor of Nittetsu Shoji 
Co., LTD., the supplier under a contract for supply and installation of equipment for 
the oil-water separation plant KTS-1. We understand that this contract should be 
financed out of the Loan. However, because the Loan Agreement does not now include any 
category for the supply and installation-type contracts, we do not have the 
possibility of financing all the itemized included foreign and local costs in this 
contract, unless we introduce an amendment to the Loan Agreement for this Project.
Accordingly, we propose to introduce the following technical amendment to 
Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement (Withdrawal of the Proceeds of the Loan). The 
percentage of expenditures to be financed by the Bank for Category (3) (Pipeline 
remediation works under Parts B.2 and B.3 of the Project), shall be modified to read: 
“100% of foreign expenditures, 100% of local expenditures (ex-factory costs), 82% of 
local expenditures for other items procured locally, and 82% for local transportation 
and installation.” 
If you agree with the above amendment, please sign and date both original copies 
of this letter, returning one to the Bank. The amendment will become effective as of 
the date hereof, once the Bank has received a signed and dated copy of this letter.
Sincerely,
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR 
   RECONSTRUCTION  AND DEVELOPMENT
