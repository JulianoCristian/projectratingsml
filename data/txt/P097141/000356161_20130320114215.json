It was first restructured on\n            December 5, 2011, and it is expected to close on September\n            15, 2013. It has three components: 1) skills training for\n            unemployed youth; 2) improving the policy framework for\n            delivering of training; and 3) project management and\n            institutional strengthening. The major change and rationale\n            for this level two project restructuring is to revise the\n            Project Development Objective (PDO) indicator in order to\n            better measure the project's impact on the\n            employability of youth over the long term."}, "docdt": "2013-03-13T00:00:00Z"}
