                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the first phase (operation) of the APL is to assist the Government of St. Lucia to increase the employability ofyouth through private-sector driven
                         training. This objective will be pursued through three means: (i) establishment of acompetitive training scheme that finances private sector-driven training and
                         traineeships, (ii) development of an improved policyframework for delivering training by enhancing OECS collaboration in training and introducing occupational
                         standards to increasequality and value of training, and (iii) strengthening institutional capacity to better implement, monitor, and plan training.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation continues to improve but still remains slow. The overall pace of training (component 1)hasincreased.Progress is being made on developing and implementing
                         policy documents although these need to be formallyadopted.Certification of trainees remains slow although the Government held a certification ceremony for the first group
                         oftrainees. TheGovernment is also pursuing the issuance of Caribbean Vocational Qualifications (CVQs), although this requiresclearance fromCARICOM.
