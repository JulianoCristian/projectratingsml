The\n            restructuring includes: (a) changes to the scope of\n            activities; (b) revisions to project financing; (c) an\n            update of the results framework; and (d) an extension of the\n            closing date. In summary, the changes entail the following:\n            i) a reduction in the number of trainees to be better\n            aligned to market absorption capacity; ii) an elimination of\n            the monetary contribution of employers to the training\n            scheme in order to offset the economic downturn and\n            encourage their participation; and iii) a shift in resources\n            from training to building and sustaining the policy\n            framework for competency-based training and quality assurance."}, "docdt": "2011-12-05T00:00:00Z"}
