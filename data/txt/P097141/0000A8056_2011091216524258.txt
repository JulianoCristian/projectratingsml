                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the first phase (operation) of the APL is to assist the Government of St. Lucia to increase the employability of youth through private-sector
                         driven training. This objective will be pursued through three means: (i) establishment of a competitive training scheme that finances private sector-driven
                         training and traineeships, (ii) development of an improved policy framework for delivering training by enhancing OECS collaboration in training and introducing
                         occupational standards to increase quality and value of training, and (iii) strengthening institutional capacity to better implement, monitor, and plan training.
