"Ratings for the OECS Skills for\n            Inclusive Growth Project for St Lucia were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: targeting the most vulnerable\n            sectors of the population, particularly poor at-risk youth\n            who tend to have structurally less access to labor markets\n            than their peers from other socio-economic groups, is a\n            clear priority from an equity perspective. The argument for\n            also including more educated, unemployed youth is supported\n            on the grounds of both equity and efficiency, particularly\n            in times of high unemployment. Both employers and trainees\n            appear to value them greatly. Under the project, soft skills\n            were emphasized throughout the training, including the\n            technical training and the internship. The success of the\n            training programs is highly susceptible to operational\n            factors such as amount and timeliness of stipends. The\n            remarkable decrease in drop-out rates as a result of\n            fine-tuning operational details attest to their importance."}, "docdt": "2014-03-14T00:00:00Z"}
