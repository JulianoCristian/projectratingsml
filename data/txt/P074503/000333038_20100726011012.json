Lessons learned include: despite\n            changes of ministers, continuity and commitment of senior\n            level ministry officials during the project's life are\n            the key to the smooth project implementation, and therefore\n            to the overall project success. Achieving public consensus\n            on reform issues by sharing with the public the work\n            accomplished and conducting open discussions on issues\n            affecting beneficiaries are essential for building ownership\n            and commitment to reforms and developing the culture of\n            accountability. Good analytical work to inform project\n            design, competent technical assistance as well as envisaging\n            adequate time for the education system to accept changes and\n            innovations (and for preparing it to the changes) at the\n            initial stage are crucial when fundamental reforms are\n            expected. Providing continuous guidance in the context of an\n            ambitious reform agenda is essential. International\n            Development Association (IDA) supervision must be continuous\n            and intensive. Proactive and timely monitoring and support\n            by the Bank's team are crucial for project success."}, "docdt": "2010-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
