Excellency and Sir:
     We refer to the Loan Agreement entered into between the
Republic of Tunisia (the Borrower) and the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) dated June 30, 1989, and
to the Project Agreement entered into between the Bank and the
Banque de l'Habitat (BH) of even date, for the above-referenced
Project.  Following meetings held by representatives of the Bank,
the Borrower and the BH on December 8, 1989, the Bank hereby agrees
to the request to amend the provisions of paragraph (3) of Schedule
7 to the Loan Agreement to read as follows:
     "(3) BH shall pay interest on the amounts of the Subsidiary
          Loan withdrawn and outstanding from time to time and at
          a date equal at least to the rate applicable to the Loan
          pursuant to Section 2l05 of this Agreement on the date
          of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement plus one percentage
          point."
     Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing amendment by
signing and duly dating the form of confirmation below on the
enclosed duplicate original of this letter and returning it to us at

     This amendment letter shall become effective on the date the
Loan Agreement becomes effective.
