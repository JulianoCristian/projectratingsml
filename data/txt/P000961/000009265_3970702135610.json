The irrigation\n            investment should be operationally and economically\n            sustainable and, for this purpose, would be farmer-owned and\n            managed and appropriate in scale.  Where group operation is\n            not necessary, the schemes would be restricted to group\n            units of not more than thirty farmers, each farmer managing\n            about one hectare of irrigated crops on land which is\n            already under cropping.  A key aspect of the project would\n            be the training of farmers in proper and safe methods of\n            abstracting, distributing and managing the application of\n            water to the soil with due consideration for possible\n            hazards, such as damage to the soil, transmission of\n            water-borne diseases, pollution for chemicals used in crop\n            and soil management practices, excessive abstraction of\n            water from streams and aquifers, or restricting the use of\n            land and water to traditional user and not displacing\n            legitimate users."}, "docdt": "1993-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
