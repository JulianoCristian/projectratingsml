Part I\n            reviews the investment program within macroeconomic, and\n            agricultural sector frameworks, outlining the Bank's\n            achievement of objectives, future reforms, and policy\n            implications. Part II accounts for the implementation of the\n            projects, showing mixed results, for while satisfactory\n            outcomes prevail for the National Agricultural\n            Research(NARP), National Agricultural Extension (NAEP),\n            Agricultural Diversification (ADP), and Agriculture Sector\n            Investment (ASIP) projects, with sustainable likelihood, the\n            outcome of the National Livestock Services Project (NLSP) is\n            rated partial, in that trade liberalization increased\n            imports of livestock products, affecting domestic\n            production, and, the slow counterpart fund release hindered\n            implementation. Lessons drawn from the projects, suggest\n            mainly that: 1) enterprise, management, and marketing\n            development should be included within extension services to\n            expand its scope; 2) effective research management requires\n            not just monitoring, and evaluation, but effective\n            management information systems; 3) under low income\n            circumstances, privatization should be progressive, with\n            realistic expectations on community contributions; and, 4)\n            project, and infrastructure interventions, require efficient\n            technical, and financial assistance."}, "docdt": "2000-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
