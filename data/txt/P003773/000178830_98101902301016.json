      Project will improve incomes of small farmers and\n            businessmen, and provide additional employment\n            opportunities, by assisting Bank Indonesia in strengthening\n            its existing\n            Small-Investment-Credit/Small-Permanent-Working-Capital-Credit\n            (KIK/KMKP) program and laying the groundwork for a gradual\n            improvement of Government technical services to small-scale\n            enterprises. The project will finance KIK lending, for about\n            two and one half years, in the provinces of East and Central\n            Java and West Sumatera. Approximately 10,000 subloans will\n            be made by handling banks for productive activities in\n            virtually all sectors of the economy. Technical assistance\n            will involve the strengthening of KIK/KMKP program\n            supervision, the establishment of three Provincial Project\n            Management Units, training of Bank Indonesia and handling\n            banks' staff, a study of the credit insurance system,\n            an evaluation study of the project's impact, and a\n            study of handling banks' total administrative and\n            financial costs under the program."}, "docdt": "1978-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
