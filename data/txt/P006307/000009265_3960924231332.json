{"cdata!": "The major physical components of the\n            Second Urban Transport Project for Brazil were successfully\n            completed and at a cost below appraisal estimates. The\n            TRENSURB rapid transit line was constructed and technical\n            assistance was provided to establish its management and\n            operating company. However, the failure to implement\n            complementary measures is having a negative effect on\n            TRENSURB's operational and financial performance. The\n            ultimate success of the project is contingent on the\n            resumption of economic growth in the region and on the\n            implementation of complementary measures such as bus\n            integration and car parking restrictions. The most serious\n            shortcoming of the project was the failure to undertake and\n            implement a public transport tariff study as originally\n            envisaged. One major lesson learned is that, in cases where\n            there is a need for substantial policy and implementation\n            decisions involving different levels of Government agencies\n            subject to conflicting political and social pressures, their\n            commitment should be realistically assessed during\n            preparation. Regarding the original objective of TRENSURB\n            covering its working costs, the appraisal was unrealistic to\n            expect that this would take place during the initial\n            operation period. The rail system must first demonstrate its\n            reliability to users. In the meantime, TRENSURB should\n            undertake a staff review to streamline costs and conduct a\n            tariff study to determine the optimal user charges. The Bank\n            should closely follow up the implementation of these tasks."}, "docdt": "1987-12-24T00:00:00Z"}
