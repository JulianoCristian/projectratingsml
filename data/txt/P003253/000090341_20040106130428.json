unsatisfactory, the sustainability was unlikely, the\n            institutional development impact was modest, the Bank and\n            borrower performance were both unsatisfactory. The lessons\n            learned indicate that the complexity of design, number of\n            components and implementing agencies, and dependency of key\n            project activities on other donors must be minimized to\n            reduce the implementation risks associated with these\n            project features. Thorough preparation of the project,\n            particularly clarification of institutional issues and\n            implementation arrangements, is crucial for satisfactory\n            launch of implementation. In the Africa Region, use of the\n            Readiness for Implementation filter developed by AFTQK to\n            check if the project is adequately prepared. Fashionable but\n            unproven trends in project design, e.g., avoidance of\n            Project Management Unit (PMUs) in countries with\n            insufficient implementation capacity, or cookie-cutter\n            approach using the same project design in different country\n            circumstances, should be resisted. Summary suspension of\n            project activities and early closure of non-performing\n            projects is desirable from the perspective of portfolio\n            management, freeing of under-utilized funds and forging more\n            effective dialogue with the government. For projects with\n            low government ownership and deteriorating responsiveness,\n            early intervention by the sector and country management is\n            necessary to complement the supervision efforts of the task\n            team so the project can be revived and brought on track\n            early. In the case of clearly unrealistic and unachievable\n            project objectives, these must be revised downward otherwise\n            no improvement in project performance will be sufficient to\n            earn the project satisfactory ratings."}, "docdt": "2003-12-18T00:00:00Z"}
