In regard to the sturgeon\n            hatchery, water pollution during the hatchery operation will\n            be minimized by proper wastewater treatment. Hatchery wastes\n            will be collected in concrete bins and burned regularly. To\n            mitigate the impact of cross-breeding of sturgeon species,\n            tanks will be used to segregate various species of breeding\n            stock and roe will be hand fertilized from know donor\n            species. There will be measures to control dust from the\n            feedmill and worker training to minimize exposure. To clean\n            up the oil field, wastes will be categorized by contaminants\n            and severity for disposal. There will be adequate on-site\n            storage facilities for handling recovered oil. Anti-dusting\n            measures will be used during the oil field cleanup. The\n            major impact of the mercury cleanup is the removal and safe\n            disposal of a large amount of toxic mercury. A mercury\n            recovery technology which meets international standards will\n            be used. After the mercury recovery, the soil will be\n            dewatered and then transported to the landfill for safe\n            disposal by covered trucks along a route away from inhabited\n            areas. Pilot tests will be carried out to identify an\n            effective way of dewatering and stabilizing waste sludges\n            stored on the mercury recovery plant site. Excess water will\n            also be treated before discharge to the Caspian Sea."}, "docdt": "1998-08-10T00:00:00Z"}
