This\n            project has 5 components. Component 1 restores the capacity\n            of Azerbaijan to produce sturgeon fingerlings by building a\n            new hatchery; and creates a sustainable institutional and\n            financial basis for future hatchery operations. Component 2\n            demonstrates mercury cleanup technologies and procedures by\n            decontaminating one heavily polluted area. It tests\n            pilot-scale sludge treatment; develops and applies a\n            low-technology method for mercury recovery; transports\n            wastes; constructs a safe, new landfill; designs and\n            implements a monitoring program for mercury emissions; and\n            does a follow-up assessment. Component 3 tests cleanup\n            methodologies on a pilot basis and mitigates existing\n            pollution in one onshore oil field of the Abseron peninsula.\n            It finances a series of pilot projects to determine the most\n            cost-effective method for treating oil-contaminated\n            sediments and sludge; cleans up oil residues; and continues\n            operating the implementation unit in the state's oil\n            company. Component 4 strengthens the environmental\n            management system by reviewing its legislative and\n            regulatory framework and building the capacity of the State\n            Committee of Ecology.
