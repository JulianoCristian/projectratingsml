Lessons from\n            the project are: 1) Having a diligent and flexible approach\n            to implementation helps address design shortcomings and\n            reorients the project to achieve development objectives. 2)\n            Put in place institutional structures to sustain project\n            activities early during project implementation, and phase in\n            their independence instead of suddenly cutting them off from\n            financial and technical support when the project closes. 3)\n            Clearly identify desired outcomes in pilot activities and\n            include follow-up. 4)When remediating contaminated land,\n            identify and address institutional aspects such as land\n            ownership and land use planning up-front to avoid illegal\n            land occupation. 5) Clarity regarding fiduciary\n            responsibilities, is important when an agency other than the\n            parent Ministry is responsible for implementing one\n            component. 6) Be realistic regarding how quickly it is\n            possible to transform activities and institutions that were\n            historically state-operated to a model based on a\n            commercial, market-based approach. 7) Capacity building\n            needs to address development of professional management\n            capability, not just technical aspects. 8) For technical\n            assistance to be effective, the government and implementing\n            agencies have to regard it as useful for achieving highly\n            desired outcomes. In this project, technical assistance\n            effectively supported implementation and built local\n            capacity through on-the-job training."}, "docdt": "2005-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
