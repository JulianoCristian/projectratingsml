The\n            loan was approved on August 4, 2009, signed on September 24,\n            2009 and declared effective on December 9, 2009.\n            Implementation of the project, including compliance with its\n            loan covenants is satisfactory. There are no outstanding\n            audit reports. The outcomes and results recorded in the most\n            recent supervision reports are consistent with the\n            expectations set out in the project appraisal document. The\n            project keeps progressing fairly well. Civil works are\n            underway in all cities, except Bogota's North Quito\n            South Line of the Bogota Transmilenio (NQS), which has been\n            completed. Four BRT systems are under operation: Bogota NQS,\n            Pereira (PE), Bucaramanga (BU) and Barranquilla (BA). The\n            last one is under 'early operation' and will start\n            full operation in December. Medellin (ME) and Cartagena (CA)\n            expect to launch operations by 2011. As requested by the\n            borrower, the reallocation is necessary to allocate US$22.5\n            million. As mentioned before the NQS-line is under operation\n            and works have been completed. According to the schedule of\n            transfers of the project, the Bogota subproject will require\n            this amount to accomplish the agreement between the\n            Government of Colombia and the city of Bogota."}, "docdt": "2011-11-23T00:00:00Z"}
