The\n            loan was approved on August 4, 2009, signed on September 24,\n            2009 and declared effective on December 9, 2009.\n            Implementation of the project, including compliance with its\n            loan covenants is satisfactory. There are no outstanding\n            audit reports. The outcomes and results recorded in the most\n            recent supervision reports are consistent with the\n            expectations set out in the project appraisal document. The\n            project keeps progressing fairly well. Civil works are\n            underway in all cities, except Bogota's North Quito\n            South Line of the Bogota Transmilenio (NQS), which has been\n            completed. Four Bus Rapid transit (BRT) systems are under\n            operation: Bogota NQS, Pereira (PE), Bucaramanga (BU) and\n            Barranquilla (BA). The last one is under 'early\n            operation' and will start full operation in December.\n            Medellin (ME) and Cartagena (CA) expect to launch operations\n            by 2011."}, "docdt": "2010-10-06T00:00:00Z"}
