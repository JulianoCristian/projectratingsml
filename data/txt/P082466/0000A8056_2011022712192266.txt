                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the Project are to: (i) develop quality and sustainable BRTSs in selected medium and large cities to improve mobility along the
                         most strategic mass transit corridors; (ii) improve accessibility for the poor through feeder services and fare integration; (iii) build greater institutional capacity
                         at the national level in order to formulate integrated urban transport policies, and at the local level in order to improve urban transport planning and traffic
                         management.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project keeps progressing fairly well. Civil works are underway in all cities, except Bogota's NQS, which is completed. 4 Bus Rapid transit (BRT) systems are under operation:
                         Bogota NQS, Pereira (PE), Bucaramanga (BU) and Barranquilla (BA). Medellin (ME) and Cartagena (CA) expect to launch operations by 2011.
                          A second additional loan for US$ 300 Million was approved by the Bank board in August 4th, 2009. This operation will finance the Government of Colombia (GOC) transfers of 2009,
                         2010 and 2011. After the approval of this new operation, the total amount of Bank collaboration to the National Urban Transport Project (NUTP) is $757 million. This AF has been

                         declared effective in December 2009. A new loan ($ 350 million) is currently under preparation which will continue financing of GOC transfers for Pereira, Bucaramanga, Cartagena,
                         and Medellin and the inclusion of three new cities under the SPTS program for medium sized cities: Monteria, Sincelejo and Valledupar (Ciudades Amables Sistemas Estratégicos de

                         Transporte). This loan will finance Government transfers to the NUTP between 2011 and 2016.
                         Transfers between the GOC and the municipalities have progressed according to the yearly disbursement program. The GOC has transferred about 58% of all the program transfers
                         in the participating cities. This flow of transfers is expected to conclude in 2016 according to the most recent CONPES documents prepared by DNP.
                         Construction of BRT trunk lines is well advanced and completion percentages -with respect to the total contracted civil works- vary between 69% (Cartagena) and 100% (Bogotá
                         NQS, Pereira, and Bucaramanga). In terms of civil works, no major issues have been raised.
                         The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) is providing key support to the implementation of the project.
