F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The development objectives of the Project are to: (i) develop quality and sustainable BRT
systems in selected medium and large cities to improve mobility along the most strategic
mass transit corridors; (ii) improve accessibility for the poor through feeder services and
fare integration; (iii) build greater institutional capacity at the national level in order to
formulate integrated urban transport policies, and at the local level in order to improve
urban transport planning and traffic management

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The First and Second Additional Loans did not introduce any changes to the PDO, as
they only increased the geographical and physical scope of the original project. The
Original Loan supported the implementation of the NUTP in the cities of Bogota,
Cartagena and Pereira MA and contemplated the inclusion of additional cities after they
met minimum conditions. The First Additional Loan allowed for the financing of works
in additional cities that achieved compliance with eligibility requirements, including
Barranquilla, Bucaramanga and Medellin-Valle de Aburra; and covered a financing gap
of USD 100 million in the financing of Bogota's NQS BRT corridor. The Second
Additional Loan funded a scale-up in the NUTP's physical scope (in Barranquilla,
Bucaramanga, Cartagena and Medellin-Valle de Aburra), including the expansion of
trunk corridors and feeder routes to meet increased demand and the improvement of
associated infrastructure.

                system (between 74 and 83 percent according to SISETU and independent survey

(incl. %        as the novelty factor disappears and systems’ occupation increases. The
achievement) perception of the service in Bucaramanga is not as favorable as in other systems,
                reflecting the limited coverage of the system in the early stages of operation. It is

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.        At the time of appraisal, Colombia was already a highly urbanized country, with
approximately 75 percent of its population living in cities. By 2004, four Colombian cities
(Bogotá, Medellin, Cali and Barranquilla) boasted over 1 million inhabitants, three cities
(including Cartagena and Bucaramanga) had populations between 500,000 and 1 million and 33
cities (including Pereira) had between 100,000 and 500,000 inhabitants. 1

2.       Then as now, Colombian cities were centers of economic growth. Between 2000 and
2004, GDP growth in large and mid-sized Colombian cities was one percent higher than for the
nation as a whole, contrary to the situation in other Latin American countries, such as Brazil and
Mexico, where non-urban sectors were more dominant over the same period of time. 2 Not only
was economic growth higher in cities, but it also was relatively less concentrated in the country’s
largest urban agglomeration. Compared to other Latin American countries, such as Argentina and
Chile, Colombia’s economic activity was, and still is, more balanced across its largest cities.

3.       The urbanization process also moved poverty issues away from rural areas and into the
cities. At the time of appraisal, it was estimated that two thirds of the population living below the
poverty line was located in urban areas. A large part of the urban poor lived in the cities’
periphery and lacked access to reliable and affordable transportation services. See Annex 10 for a
detailed sector background.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

4.      The development objectives of the Integrated Mass Transit Systems (IMTS) Project (the
Project) are to: (i) develop quality and sustainable Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems in selected
medium and large metropolitan to improve mobility along the most strategic mass transit
corridors; (ii) improve accessibility for the poor through feeder services and fare integration; (iii)
build greater institutional capacity at the national level in order to formulate integrated urban
transport policies, and at the local level in order to improve urban transport planning and traffic
management. See Annex 11 for a detailed description of the Project.

5.      The Project supported the implementation of a national mass transit program by
consolidating the ad-hoc support of the Government of Colombia (GoC) to the Bogota BRT
System (Transmilenio) into a broader country-wide program: The National Urban Transport
Program (NUTP). The Project funded a time slice of GoC transfers to implementing agencies in
Cities / Metropolitan Areas (MAs) that were part of the NUTP: Bogota (Transmilenio),
Barranquilla (Transmetro), Bucaramanga (Metrolinea), Cartagena (Transcaribe), Pereira
(Megabus) and Medellin-Valle de Aburra (Metroplus).3 The Project also supported institutional
strengthening activities at the local and national levels in support of the implementation of the
NUTP. See Annex 10 for a description of the NUTP.

6.         The key Project Outcome Indicators (as approved) are the following:

  The Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) supported the development of the BRT system in Cali; and the
Andean Development Corporation (CAF) and Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEP) supported
Transmilenio’s Suba corridor.

                                                                                                            13
     1)      Improve mobility and quality of public transport services in strategic corridors:
             a. Reduction in generalized door-to-door travel cost (fare, time) to users;
             b. Percentage of people rating the BRT system as being better than previous one;
     2)      Improve the accessibility of low-income populations:
             a. Increased use by the poor (two poorest quintiles) of public transport services
                along the project’s area of influence;
     3)      Enhanced institutional capacity for urban transport policy formulation and system
             development:
             a. At the local level, system occupation per square meter is below a given threshold
                while maintaining no subsidies;
             b. At the national level, at least three (revised to six) BRT systems are operating
                successfully in participating cities and the GoC systematically monitoring
                program performance and its impact, in line with the requirements of National
                Urban Transport Program.4

7.      Project performance was also monitored against a set of Intermediate Output Indicators,
including the following: Number of kilometers of segregated trunk lines constructed; Number of
kilometers of pre-trunk and feeder lines constructed; Number of terminals / garages constructed;
Number of stations constructed; Number of construction contracts awarded; Number of operation
contracts awarded; and Number of fare collection contracts awarded. 5

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

8.       The First and Second Additional Loans did not introduce any changes to the PDO, as
they only increased the geographical and physical scope of the original project. No changes have
been introduced to the nature of the Key Project Indicators, but targets have been revised to
reflect the additional financings. Outcome indicator (iii) (b) was modified following the approval
of the First Additional Loan to account for the widening in the geographical scope of the Project,
increasing the expected number of BRT systems operating successfully from three to six. In
addition, output indicators were revised as part of the appraisal of the Second Additional Loan in
order to account for changes in the Project’s physical scope.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

9.       The main beneficiaries of the Project are public transit users in participating cities, who
following the implementation of BRT systems are expected to benefit from greater access to
safer, better-quality and faster transportation services. Since the public transit constituency is
primarily made of low-income users (up to 70 percent of users of traditional bus services are from
the lower income strata – strata 2 and 3), the Project benefits the urban poor, by giving them
better access to services and economic opportunities and lowering their generalized transportation
cost. The Project also benefits the urban population at large, who will experience better overall
urban mobility and environmental conditions through the relief of traffic congestion, reduction in

4
  In the PAD for the First Additional Loan (page 15), the target for this indicator was increased to “six BRT
systems operating successfully in participating cities” (see Revised Key Indicators section below)
5
  These intermediate output indicators were first defined as “General Summary Indicators” in the PAD for
the Original Loan. These General Summary Indicators included other measures for which targets were
never established and that have not been included in Project reporting over time. The PAD for the Second
Additional Loan focused these indicators on a set of Intermediate Output Indicators and established targets
for each city (Annex 9 of PAD for Second Additional Loan).These Intermediate Output Indicators have
been tracked as part of ISRs and are the ones evaluated for the purpose of this ICR.

                                                                                                          14
road accidents and air pollution. With the implementation of the Project, cities have been able to
incorporate new, low-emission6 high capacity buses, reduce over-supply and introduce cleaner
fuel types7. Other beneficiaries are the residents and businesses along new transit corridors and
renovated public space.

1.5 Original Components

10.      The Original Loan had the following two components:

         1. Part A- Capacity Building: Technical assistance and policy advice to the GoC and
            participating municipal governments, including: Strengthening the GoC’s capacity to
            formulate national urban transport programs; Improving the institutional capacity of
            sector agencies at participating cities to ensure adequate system implementation;
            Strengthening the operational capacity of participating cities with respect to the
            implementation of urban development and transport strategies; Supporting overall
            project coordination, evaluation, supervision and implementation, including the
            strengthening of the Project Coordination Unit (PCU), the development of studies
            and audits and the establishment of a monitoring and evaluation system.
         2. Part B - BRT System Development: Development of BRT systems including:
            Construction of segregated transportation corridors in participating cities /
            metropolitan areas; Construction of about 20 kilometers of segregated corridors in
            Bogota (Transmilenio’s Norte-Quito-Sur Corridor-NQS); the resettlement of affected
            persons; and the design and implementation of Environmental Management Plans
            (EMP) associated with construction works.

1.6 Revised Components

11.     The original components were maintained throughout implementation. The eligible
categories of the two additional financings did not require a change in the original components.
The First Additional Loan disbursements corresponded mostly to Component 2, while the Second
Additional Loan disbursements supported a scale-up of both Component 1 and of Component 2.
1.7 Other significant changes
12.     With the Second Additional Loan, the project’s financing arrangements were changed to
include land acquisition and resettlement compensation as eligible expenditures. In accordance
with policy, the Bank’s land committee reviewed the arrangements put in place for the financing
of land acquisition and authorized this change in eligible expenditures. This provided an
additional degree of flexibility on the allocation of project costs between the national and local
governments. Up until then, land acquisition expenditures had been financed exclusively by local
governments.8 The Second Additional Loan had four restructurings that did not change the PDO.9

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry


6
  Buses comply with EURO emission standards, which limit CO2 and local pollutant emission levels per
kilometer.
7
  Compliance with EURO standards required the Colombian National Oil Company (Ecopetrol) to provide
systems with Ultra-low Sulfur Diesel, which was previously not available in Colombia.
8
  The Bank financed approx. 2 million in land acquisition, out of a total of USD 116.4 million that has been
carried out so far under the NUTP.
9
  See Annex 11 for details.

                                                                                                         15
13.       The Project’s background analysis was based on previous policy and project design work,
partially funded with the Bank’s Regulatory Reform Technical Assistance Loan. The Project was
also built on a strong political commitment from the national government. The GoC made
implementation of the NUTP a priority, making a long-term budgetary commitment and
executing the required co-financing agreements with local governments. The Project design is
considered satisfactory having addressed multiple implementation challenges, including the need
to build project ownership among local stakeholders and the high capacity building and
supervision requirements associated with having to create multiple implementing agencies.
Finally, the risk assessment is considered satisfactory as the team identified some of the most
critical risks and mitigation measures at appraisal. See Annex 11 for a detailed description.

2.2 Implementation

Mid-term Review

14.     The mid-term review workshop, carried out in October 2006, identified important
strengths in the program including: the exchange of experiences between participating cities; the
hiring of multidisciplinary teams at implementing agencies; and the collaboration between the
central and municipal levels of government. These strengths were counterbalanced by the small
budget available for technical assistance to enhance the capacity of implementing agencies, and
the limited capacity of these agencies to negotiate concession agreements encouraging
competition while at the same time giving preference to traditional local bus operators.
Participants noted the advantages of working with the Bank, including: enhanced credibility,
comprehensive safeguard policies, clarity in contracting rules and the technical support from the
Bank’s team. On the other hand, in the opinion of implementing agencies, working with the Bank
entailed having to deal with an additional level of bureaucracy and required public officials and
contractors to become familiar with the Bank rules that differ from local legislation.

15.     Some of the main implementation issues identified included: limited coordination
between the different agencies and municipalities involved in each project; inadequate capacity at
implementing agencies to negotiate with private concessionaires; and the high attention given to
the construction of infrastructure over the planning of operations.

Implementation Performance

16.     Project implementation, including compliance with loan covenants, is considered
satisfactory. The Project –first of its kind for the Bank and for Colombia– was highly complex,
involving multiple new municipal government agencies and the construction of several
transportation systems. Project implementation was successful in navigating these challenges.
Most implementation issues were the result of factors outside the control of the Project and were
addressed in a satisfactory manner:

17.      Delays in Project execution: Implementing Agencies had a steep learning curve to
internalize Bank safeguards and fiduciary policies. Initially, through continuous and extensive
training activities, the Bank heavily supported the building of these competencies at the PCU and
Implementing Agencies, which had to develop specialized procurement, environmental and social
units from the ground up. These initial difficulties were overcome, as implementing agencies
built strong teams that developed a high degree of ownership over the Bank’s policies and learned
from each other as implementation progressed. Other delays in execution were mainly the result
of changes in the scope of the project, incomplete designs and unforeseen costs (see Efficiency
section below).


                                                                                               16
18.      Partial execution of technical assistance component: Although in early 2012 the loan
closing date was extended to allow additional time for the execution of this component, the MOT
was unable to execute it due to budgetary and procurement shortcomings and about 40 percent of
the total amount allocated for this component (about USD 2.4 million) was not disbursed. These
shortcomings were the result of broader institutional issues originating in the public management
system as a whole and that were not within the operational purview of the Project.

19.      Project Coordination Unit (PCU) capacity was affected by public management
issues: The Project invested heavily in building a very capable PCU that played a fundamental
role in implementation and that now has an expanded role. Nonetheless, after 2010, when the unit
was further integrated into MOT’s structure, its performance started to be affected by high
personnel rotation and operational issues related to the public management system. As a result,
the capacity of the PCU to provide technical support has weakened and the unit is currently
focused on monitoring. The integration of the PCU into MOT is still being consolidated and will
need further adjustments as the PCU evolves from Project implementation to policy-making.

20.      Lack of mandate and supervision resources for addressing operational aspects:
Despite the Bank and Borrower’s efforts, implementing agencies were not accompanied in key
operational areas, such as the negotiation of operating agreements and structuring of concessions
to develop bus terminals (remunerated through user tariffs). This was due to the fact that the
national policy gave exclusive responsibility in this area to local implementing agencies. The
situation also reflected the priority that the program gave to the objective of completing the main
infrastructure works over operational aspects and the limited resources available for loan
supervision. The Bank compensated for the lack of mandate and resources by mobilizing
technical assistance to municipalities via the supervision budget, grants and trust funds.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

21.     The Project contemplated the development of a comprehensive M&E framework.
Although with some initial delays, this framework (known as SISETU for its initials in Spanish)
was designed and implemented in the form of a web-based application. Nevertheless, despite its
breadth and high technical quality, the M&E framework was never internalized by the MOT or
implemented consistently. A recent evaluation of the M&E framework found that despite the
technical merit of the indicators, the complexity of the performance measures required is not
commensurate with the capacity of the entities in charge of collecting the data and calculating the
indicators. 10 As a result, compliance with reporting has been very low and measurements are
only available for a limited number of indicators and mass transit systems. Furthermore, MOT did
not internalize the system, focusing more on monitoring reporting compliance rather than on
supporting local agencies with implementation. The MOT is currently working with
Implementing Agencies to facilitate the use of the M&E system and ensure that indicators are
adequately measured and reported on a regular basis. See Annex 12 for a complete evaluation of
the design, implementation and utilization of the M&E framework.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

22.     Environmental: The Project’s environmental management methodology included
innovative aspects and became a reference for other projects in Colombia and in other countries



10
  Framework consisted of a set of 35 indicators to measure performance in three areas: (i) performance of
local transport; (ii) efficiency and effectiveness; and (iii) impact on the urban environment.

                                                                                                        17
in the region.11 All construction contracts, except a few related to small feeder road rehabilitation
works, encompassed the adequate implementation of Environmental Management Plans (EMPs).
Main issues were related to penalized non-compliance by contractors and also to the need to
adjust the weightings of contractor environmental management evaluation forms, which in some
instances did not give grounds to adequate penalties. A mid-term workshop and various other
periodical meetings were held to review the program and make adjustments.

23.      Social: Social management teams without previous experience in the use of Bank
resettlement policies and working under newly created Implementing Agencies successfully
implemented more than 20 resettlement plans. Implementing Agencies internalized this social
management culture to the point that they now use these procedures even in projects that are not
financed by the Bank (see Institutional Change / Strengthening Section). The most significant
implementation issue in this area was related to the resettlement of public space occupants (street
vendors), which requires more collaboration between implementing agencies and participating
cities to manage the transition of vendors out of informality and into the formal sector of the
economy. 12 Despite these issues, all resettlement processes were satisfactorily undertaken in
compliance with Bank policy.

24.     Financial Management: There were minor shortcomings in the financial management
function. Main issues were related to missing financial reporting deadlines, delays in the
implementation of financial control systems at Implementing Agencies and instances of ineligible
expenditures (particularly expenditures related to the replacement of public utility networks) that
were identified as part of audits and supervision. The first two issues were resolved through
intensive training of officials and close support. The last one required the design of a technical
clearance form certifying the eligibility of expenditures. Although the National Audit Office has
issued observations, which are being addressed by MOT, there are no outstanding qualified
opinions.

25.     Procurement: Performance in this area was generally adequate except for a few issues
related to the use of procedures established in local legislation as part of Bank-financed
procurement processes. These instances were addressed through active supervision and training
of Implementing Agencies. Procurement supervision, including one Independent Procurement
Report, ex-post evaluations, and field visits, found no significant deviations from Bank policies.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

26.      Finalization of Project investments: Only a few of the civil works that have been
partially financed with loan proceeds are yet to be completed, including: two tranches of the high
capacity bus corridor in Cartagena (one is 50 percent completed and the other 95 percent
completed) and some terminals, stations and pre-trunk corridors. 13

27.     Next phase/ follow-up operation: In July 2011, the Board approved a new loan
operation for USD 350 million to continue funding the mass transit systems in Medellin – Valle
de Aburrá and Bucaramanga (included in the Project) and to support the development of a

11
   Environmental Management Plans were mandated as part of civil works contracts and its remuneration
was based on performance, with a minimum value as percentage of the total contract value to ensure
adequate planning and implementation. The guidelines developed for the Project were used in other
projects in Mexico and Ecuador.
12
   This is the case of Cartagena, where Transcaribe has carried out all of the actions required to implement
the resettlement plan according to policy, but the local administration has not yet executed the plan due to
institutional weaknesses and political instability.
13
   The length of the two tranches is nearly 0.8 kilometers, less than 5% of the total corridor length.

                                                                                                         18
Strategic Public Transport Plan (SEPT for its initials in Spanish) for various small cities,
including Sincelejo and Valledupar.14 It is envisioned that this loan will have a larger Technical
Assistance (TA) component of USD 15 million, available to support MOT in the definition of the
regulatory framework for mass transit systems and assist Implementing Agencies in the
optimization of operations.

28.     Sustainability of outcomes: Despite the advances made through the NUTP, there is
consensus that the evolving experience and lessons learnt with the implementation of BRTs
around the country merit revisiting the legal framework for urban transport interventions. In this
sense, the MOT is considering issuing a new Mobility Law to address key issues for system
sustainability. The Bank is supporting the analytical work required to prepare this legislation.
Also, now that the main infrastructure works have been completed, and considering that systems
have not been yet able to reach the forecasted demand levels, the focus of the program is now
evolving towards optimizing operations. 15 In January 2013, the GoC established a working
committee made up by representatives of DNP, MHCP and MOT. This Committee is charged
with devising and executing a plan to ensure the sustainability of the systems.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: High

29.     The Project outcomes are extremely relevant to the GoC and participating municipalities.
The results of a perception survey carried out in 9 Colombian cities (including all Project cities)
in 2011 indicated that citizens considered urban mobility as the most critical aspect that should be
addressed by the next municipal administration (28 percent on average). The same survey
evidenced a downward trend in mobility conditions (as measured by perceived travel times for all
survey respondents) in most large and medium size cities (except Barranquilla, Medellin, Pereira
and Valledupar). 16

30.      In addition, due to commercial liberalization policies and the upsurge in economic
growth, the vehicle fleet in the country more than doubled from 2000 to 2010, resulting in
increasing congestion. Studies based on conservative economic growth estimates forecast a two-
fold increase in the number of vehicles by 2025 and a three-fold increment in the number of
motorcycles.17 Given the physical and financial limitations to the expansion of infrastructure and
to city densification, the improvement of urban public transport is, without doubt, critical for the
development of the country and the quality of life of three-fourths of its population.

31.      In this context, the Project has and continues to be relevant for the strategic priorities that
the Bank has defined for its engagement in Colombia. The Project was consistent with the
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussed by the Board in January 2003, which gave high
priority to the promotion of competitiveness in the productive sector and to the improvement of
high quality basic infrastructure services for the least privileged segments of the population. The
Project objectives are also relevant to the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY 2012-16,
14
   Support to the National Urban Transit Program Project (P117947). Link to Project Document. The total
loan amount was later revised downwards to USD 292 million, to account for the fact that GoC transfers
for Pereira and Cartagena had been exhausted.
15
   During 2013, the Bank is has mobilized consultants to support operation optimization strategies.

opportunities for shared prosperity and increased productivity.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Rating: Satisfactory

32.      The achievement of the PDO is rated Satisfactory. The Project substantially delivered
the outputs necessary for the implementation of mass transit systems in participating cities and
largely achieved or is expected to achieve the objectives set at appraisal. A summary of the
results framework indicators and articulation between outputs, outcomes and inputs is included in
Annex 2.

Objective 1: Develop quality and sustainable BRT systems in selected medium and large cities
to improve mobility along the most strategic mass transit corridors

33.     Achievement of this objective is considered satisfactory. The projects in operation are
deemed of high quality and are perceived to have contributed to improve mobility as measured by
the associated key performance indicators.

34.     Progress against key performance indicators: At the launch of BRT systems in
Bogota, Pereira and Barranquilla, users rated the service favorably relative to the traditional bus
system (between 74 and 83 percent according to SISETU and independent survey statistics).
Nonetheless, in these cities, service quality perception has decreased as the novelty factor
disappears and systems’ occupation increases. The perception of the service in Bucaramanga is
not as favorable as in other systems, reflecting the limited coverage of the system in the early
stages of operation. It is expected that user perception will improve as the system consolidates its
operations and is implemented fully. On the other hand, Generalized Transport Cost (GTC) has
declined in Pereira, but increased in Bogota, mostly as a result of increased transfer times. Ex-
post cost-benefit analyses show that reductions in travel time are an important source of economic
benefits in Pereira and Bogota. GTC statistics are not available for other systems (see Annex 2).

35.      Other Factors supporting the assigned rating: The BRT systems developed with
Project support are deemed to be of high quality and consistent with best practice and
international standards. A recent evaluation carried out by the Technical Committee of the BRT
Standard at the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP) designated two of the
sub-projects with the Gold Standard: Bogota-NQS and Medellin; and two others with the Silver
Standard: Pereira and Barranquilla. 18 The Gold Standard is given to projects that are consistent in
almost all respects with international best practice and achieve the highest in operational
performance and efficiency, while providing a high quality of service. The Silver Standard
projects include most of the elements of international best practice and are likely to be cost
effective on any corridor with sufficient demand to justify BRT investment.19 Furthermore, the
Colombian BRT systems have proven an interesting knowledge sharing platform for technical
delegations of more than 20 countries in Latin America, Asia, Africa and Europe.20




18
   The Technical Committee of The BRT Standard comprises globally-renowned experts on BRT. The
Technical Committee certifies corridors and recommends revisions to The BRT Standard as needed.

36.     Progress against output indicators: Given that the Project funded a time slice of the
GoC’s contributions to the program and that projects are being developed in phases, construction
works are still ongoing but most of the required infrastructure for the operation of the initial
phases of the systems has been delivered. Most of the key infrastructure that is still to be
completed consists of terminals/ bus garages that were developed under concession agreements
with private entities, which did not receive financing from the Project (See Annex 2 for Project
output indicators and Annex 3 for a detailed description of Project outputs).

Objective 2: Improve accessibility for the poor through feeder services and fare integration

37.     The achievement of this objective is considered satisfactory. The BRT systems have
given people in the lower income strata greater access to quality transportation systems.

38.      Progress against key performance indicators: The majority of users in Barranquilla
(more than 70 percent) and Pereira (more than 60 percent) are poor. The proportion of poor users
is about a third in Bogota and Bucaramanga. The percentage of users in the lowest income strata
(strata 1 and 2) compares well relatively to proxy baselines in the cities for which this information
is available (see Annex 2).

39.       Other factors supporting the assigned rating: As of September 2012, an average of 38
percent of system passengers in systems with integrated feeder services used these services.21
Bogota had the highest proportion with 48 percent and Bucaramanga the lowest with 25 percent.
The Megabus system seems to have had the greatest impact on the poor, achieving a reduction in
travel time and cost of transport for people belonging to strata 1 and 2. Although Transmilenio
achieved an improvement in travel times for the poor, generalized cost of transport increased
slightly.

Objective 3: Build greater institutional capacity at the national level in order to formulate
integrated urban transport policies and at the local level in order to improve urban transport
planning and traffic management

40.      The achievement of this objective is considered moderately satisfactory. The Project
has contributed significantly to build greater institutional capacity at the national and local levels,
but it has not been able to achieve all of its outcome and output targets.

41.      Progress against key performance indicators: The Project financed the development of
six BRT systems: five currently in operation (Barranquilla, Bucaramanga, Bogota-NQS, Pereira-
Dos Quebradas, Medellin-Valle de Aburra) and one that is still under construction (Cartagena)
and should enter into operation by 2014 (96 percent of trunk corridors contracted had been
completed). Therefore, the Project is one system short of reaching the outcome target of having
six systems in operation. Nonetheless, a sixth system in the city of Cali, financed by the IADB,
but also part of the NUTP and thus receiving technical support from the PCU is also in operation.
The other indicator selected to evaluate this objective (occupation per square meter), where
available, shows that the more mature systems (Bogota, Pereira and Barranquilla) are operating in
a satisfactory manner (see Annex 2).

42.     Other factors supporting the assigned rating: It is important to consider that besides
Bogota and Medellin, none of these cities had experience in the development and operation of a
mass transit system or the transport planning capacity required to implement this type of projects.
As a result of the support provided by the Project, now every city or metropolitan area now has an

21
     Medellin does not currently have a feeder service and the system in Cartagena has not started operations

                                                                                                           21
Implementing Agency, with qualified personnel and adequate management systems. Furthermore,
these entities have entered into agreements with local transit authorities for the restructuring of
routes, setting of tariffs and operation of the BRT systems. Participating cities, such as Pereira
and Cartagena, are now moving to set-up a city-wide integrated transport scheme with the BRT
system as its backbone. Although a national mobility law has not been passed, the institutional
capacity at the national level has also been improved as a result of the Project with the creation of
a specialized Urban Mobility Unit at MOT (See Chapter 3.5.(b)).

43.      Progress against output indicators: Also, the Project fell short of achieving its
institutional strengthening outputs. MOT was unable to implement fully the Capacity Building
Component due to operational issues that delayed contracting. Some of the envisioned outputs,
including the establishment of a formal national framework to regulate mass transit operations
were not achieved. The Bank mobilized other sources of funding for the provision of TA to
address this situation.22

3.3 Efficiency

Ex-post Economic Evaluation

44.     As of the end of 2012, the DNP has carried out ex-post economic evaluations for the sub-
projects in Barranquilla, Bucaramanga, Bogota and Pereira. The evaluations were conducted by
external consultants and are incorporated into the National System for Public Management and
Results Evaluation (SYNERGIA). Ex-post evaluations for the systems in the cities of Cartagena
and Medellin have not been carried out as the first one is still under construction and the second
has only started operations in December 2011. All evaluations consist of a Cost-Benefit Analysis
(CBA) based on the World Bank’s methodology, ensuring that the results are consistent with the
ex-ante analysis carried out as part of appraisal.23 A summary of all of the available ex-post
evaluations and a description of the methodology used is included in Annex 4.

45.     The ex-post evaluation for the mass transit systems developed in the cities of Bogota,
Bucaramanga and Pereira show that the BRT systems financed by the Project produced social
benefits in excess of their costs. The evaluation for Barranquilla was broken down in two periods
of analysis: one ex-post evaluation that only accounts for the cost and benefits in 2010 and 2011
and that not surprisingly results in a negative rate of return; and an updated evaluation of
projected benefits and costs from 2012 to 2018 that shows a positive rate of return, well in excess
of the discount rate. Given that the benefits of the project are expected to accrue over time, and
not only over the construction period, the second evaluation is more relevant for the purpose of
this analysis. All evaluations, except for Bucaramanga (due to a reported lack of sufficient
information), took into account the losses resulting from construction delays from the calculated
project benefits. An analysis of the projects’ deviations from budget and time is included in the
following section and is detailed in Annex 13.

Cost increases and construction delays

46.    The initial scope of projects was adjusted to include additional interventions required to
comply with revised operational requirements. These adjustments resulted in cost increases and

22
  See Annex 2 for Project output indicators and Annex 3 for a detailed description of Project outputs
23
  With the exception of the evaluation for Bogota, the evaluations are not limited to the traditional CBA
methodology and incorporate the assessment of additional benefits, including increased urban land values
and user safety. These benefits have not been considered for the purpose of this ICR so as to make the
results consistent and comparable with previous evaluations. However, these results are reviewed and
reported in the economic evaluation annex.

                                                                                                      22
the extension of construction schedules. The majority of the total cost increase (23 percent) for all
systems financed with the Project (except Bogota) came from expansions in infrastructure and in
the geographical footprint of the project aimed at servicing a larger portion of demand. The cost
of the projects in Barranquilla, Bucaramanga, Cartagena and Pereira increased for this reason.24
The city where actual costs proved to be significantly higher than originally estimated was
Medellin (47 percent of final cost was related to cover costs in excess of those estimated in the
Project’s original CONPES Document). On average, cost overruns accounted for 14 percent of
final estimated cost. See Annex 13 for an explanation of scope, cost and schedule deviations.

47.     However, irrespective of revisions to the projects’ scope, the duration and size of some
construction contracts were increased, leading to higher costs and longer than anticipated
construction times. This is due to larger than expected interventions to restructure utility networks
and greater quantities of works (Bucaramanga and Medellin), topographical and other design
errors and delays in securing the Right of Way (ROW) (Cartagena) and land acquisition delays
and additional works to address project interference with utility networks (Barranquilla). The
MOT estimated that the value of contract additions was approximately 10 percent of the total
contract value as of 2010. The delays are also directly associated with the institutional capacity in
each city, as can be seen in the relatively low speed of construction (1 to 3 Km. per year on
average) for Barranquilla, Bucaramanga, Cartagena and Medellin, when compared to Bogota
(about 8 Km per year). This is due to the fact that as opposed to other participating cities, where
the executing agency was created for the purpose of the Project, the executing agency in Bogota
(Urban Development Institute or IDU) had extensive experience in the execution of works, being
the public works agency of the city.25

Overall Cost-Efficiency of BRT Technology

48.     BRT systems are considered efficient in terms of relative infrastructure costs and their
capacity to move high volumes of passengers, which is comparable to the capacity other, more
expensive technologies. The cost per kilometer of BRT systems is typically between USD 0.5 and
15 million. This compares well with USD 13 to 30 million for an at-grade Light Rail Transit
(LRT) system; USD 40 to 200 million for an elevated system and USD 45 to 350 million for an
underground metro system.26 The average cost per kilometer of trunk corridor (excluding rolling
stock) for the BRT systems financed by the Project is of approximately USD 6 million (excluding
Transmilenio).27 Transcaribe had the highest cost per kilometer of trunk corridor contracted (USD
8.1 million) and Megabus the lowest (USD 3 million). Although estimates of cost per kilometer
may differ depending on the interventions that are included in the calculation, it can be concluded
the BRT systems represent an economical option to serve the expected demand levels.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

49.    The NUTP is regarded globally as a groundbreaking and highly successful national
program and as a challenging and innovative project within the Bank. The Project was very
ambitious, taking on the financing of mass transit systems and public transport reorganizations in

24
   The Project in Pereira-Dos Quebradas was expanded to include the construction of a trunk line in San
Mateo Avenue and of a road interchange in Dos-Quebradas

multiple cities, when most Bank projects focus on only one. 28 This wide-ranging program was
government-led, but the Bank played a key role supporting the Project’s internal champions and
contributing to the design and implementation, and ultimately, to the internalization of improved
policies in the environmental, social and technical areas. The program created an urban transport
culture in the country and has laid the groundwork for further interventions in other cities. There
were many critical issues that could have derailed implementation but were successfully
addressed, including political interference, the difficulty in building institutional capacity from
the ground in participating cities, and the complications inherent in building large infrastructure
works in urban settings.

50.      BRT systems developed with Project support have contributed to improve the quality of
life in Colombian cities. The Project’s achievements have been recognized by the DNP’s own
evaluation of the program, the Bank’s innovation award and independent evaluations carried out
by specialized bodies. The approaches under this program are now considered international best
practice and have been replicated by cities around the world.29 See Annex 14 for a more detailed
overview of the Project’s achievements and recognition.

51.      The proposed rating is Satisfactory in consideration of the following: (a) the Project is
very relevant to the development of a highly urbanized country with exploding motorization rates
and poorly regulated and low quality public transport services that are used by the majority of the
population; (b) the Project’s objectives defined as developing quality mass transit systems,
increasing the access of the poor and enhancing institutional capacity for urban transport
management at the local and national level have been either substantially achieved or are likely to
be achieved; and (c) although the sub-projects have experienced cost increases and delays, most
of these instances are the result of scope adjustments to meet operational and requirements and,
despite time overruns, the BRT systems developed continue be cost-effective relative to other
transit system technologies.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
52.      Increased accessibility for disabled populations: As part of the implementation of the
Project, the Bank supported the incorporation of accessibility features into the design of BRT
systems with the objective of enabling the inclusion of disabled populations. Early in the
implementation of the Project, the Bank hired a specialized consultant who visited participating
cities and provided technical advice based on international best practices in the area of universal
access. Later on, with resources from the governments of Finland and Norway, the Bank prepared
a set of accessibility guidelines and presented the findings to implementing agencies as part of a
workshop with representatives from implementing agencies.30 Currently, pedestrian overpasses,
stations and trunk buses are completely accessible for the disabled. Buses are required to dock at
stations a distance not greater than 25cm (12 inches) and have onboard specially designated seats
for the elderly and spaces for wheelchairs. These guidelines and best design practices have been
used in BRT designs in other developing country cities, including Hanoi and Dar es Salaam.

28
   The Project’s performance indicators included a target of having at least six BRT systems operating
successfully, while other multi-city Bank projects are designed so that an analog indicator is achieved with
50 percent or less of the cities successfully operating urban transport sub-projects.

53.     Road and industrial Safety: The Bank provided technical support for the development
of the Safe Mass Transit Program (“Masivos Seguros”), carried out by the Road Safety Promotion
Fund (“Fondo de Prevencion Vial”) in partnership with the MOT. The Fund performed a road
safety audit of the systems’ design with a view towards ensuring that the infrastructure built
incorporated safety features. The NUTP’s M&E system included a road safety indicator (number
of accidents per million passengers in the system) that showed an improvement in this area in
Bogota and Pereira, when compared with reference values for the without project situation.

54.     Gender Impact: The Project’s initial design did not incorporate gender-specific
measures. However, the Project has had an impact in this area as BRT systems provide safer
environments for women due to features such as proper lighting, security cameras, and restricted
access to stations. Moreover, buses incorporate preferential seating for pregnant women and
areas for baby strollers. Systems also employ women as drivers, workshop technicians, project
administrators and executives in a sector that had been predominantly reserved for men.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
55.      Institutionalization of a sustainable urban transport program: The Project has
contributed to the implementation of the NUTP to the point that the MOT has now expanded the
program to smaller-size cities and set up a Unit with a mandate beyond the implementation of the
Bank’s Project. Since February 2012, the PCU is known as Sustainable Urban Mobility Unit
(UMUS for its initials in Spanish) and has been charged with the implementation of both mass
transit and SETPs in all participating cities across the country.

56.     Institutionalization of safeguard policies at the central and local government levels:
Through the Project, Implementing agencies developed an important degree of ownership over
Bank policies in this area and internalized them into their own policy frameworks, now largely
based on the Bank’s methodology and procedures: Medellin instituted a new resettlement policy;
Barranquilla started to account for social management costs into their urban development plan;
and Cartagena created a new public space management office that borrowed heavily on the work
that Transcaribe had done in this area following Bank guidelines. The MOT has adopted an
environmental and social policy framework for application to all urban transport projects based
largely on Bank’s policies and methodologies, independent of their source of financing. The
MOT intends to institutionalize this framework via a Decree.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
57.     Development of BRT expertise at the Bank and innovation: Through the Project,
Bank staff has acquired expertise in the development of BRT systems that has been used in other
regions. 31 For instance, staff working in Project participated in the evaluation of a BRT system
proposed for Vietnam. In April 2009, the Project received an internal award as part of the Bank’s
Innovation Fair. The team used the proceeds from the award to prepare and publish a book on the
benefits of the NUTP: “Transport on a Human Scale”.32 The team also produced a video showing
the results of the NUTP from the perspective of Project beneficiaries.33

58.     Change in the business model of urban transport companies: The mass transit system
operators are formal enterprises that pay taxes and that provide their employees with the benefits
mandated by Law. This has been a transformational process that has changed the informality and
poor working conditions that were the norm in the traditional bus services. The new framework is

   Annex 14 provides additional information on the transformative impact of the NUTP.

not based on bus drivers’ competing for customers, but rather on formal enterprises competing for
route concessions. This change was first achieved with Transmilenio in Bogota and was later
replicated in all of the cities where a mass transit system was developed with Project support.
Colombian BRT operators have built a remarkable experience which has allowed them to win
operating concessions in mass transit systems in Chile, Peru and Panama.

59.      South-south knowledge exchange: The BRT systems developed with Project support
have served as examples for other cities in developing countries that are implementing similar
systems. Participating cities have received visits from delegations of other countries, including
Brazil, Paraguay, South Africa, China, Vietnam, Tanzania, Peru and Mexico. Also, Colombia is
becoming an exporter of consultants in the area of BRT development. These professionals are
now working in the implementation of systems in Asia and elsewhere in Latin America.
Knowledge exchange goes beyond BRT expertise, as the NUTP is regarded as international best
practice in collaboration between central government and municipal authorities to address
endemic urban transport issues in many countries. Since its inception, delegations from more than
20 countries have visited Colombia to learn about the program. Similarly, multi-city transport
programs are being developed in other countries such as Mexico and Argentina with direct IBRD
involvement and there has been a significant collaboration and sharing of knowledge between
Colombia and other developing countries. There was also south-south exchange in the
environmental and social management in the form of a tour of developing country officials that
visited the projects to learn from the experience in this area.

60.      Positive urban development impacts: The implementation of the systems has resulted
in the development of a new model of urban development that gives priority to public transport
and has also strengthened the use of non-motorized modes through integration. Emphasis has
been placed on connecting bicycle paths, foot paths and pedestrian areas to the public transit
system. The implementation of the NUTP has also resulted in improvements in public space in
the cities were they have been implemented. The MOT estimates that at least 2.5 million square
meters of new public space were generated. Finally, projects have had a side impact in the
renewal of utility networks (construction of 1,340 Km of networks) that had to be intervened as
part of construction works.34

61.     Environmental benefits: Although environmental objectives were not included as part
of the Project’s Results Framework, the benefit of emission reductions was accounted for in the
economic evaluation of projects. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that four BRT systems developed
as part of the Project have been registered with the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM):
Transmetro, Metroplus, Megabus and Transmilenio- Phases II-IV. The combined reduction in
emissions that the first three projects are expected to achieve through 2019 is 1.5 million tons of
CO2, while Transmilenio’s phases II-IV is expected to result in a reduction of approximately 4.0
million tons of CO2 over the same period of time. 35 As explained in Annex 4, reductions in
pollutant emissions from transport have also been linked to a decrease in deaths and diseases
from respiratory illnesses. Finally, the financed sub-projects also incorporated the creating of
green areas and public space surrounding the physical infrastructure. 36 The DNP found that the
projects had resulted in improvements in the greening of transport corridors in the form of tree-
planting (at least 100,180 trees planted according to MOT).

62.     While this is not an Intensive Learning ICR and no specific beneficiary survey has been
conducted for the purpose of the present evaluation, the team carried out an analysis of user
perception based on the “Cómo Vamos” citizen Survey (See Annex 5 for a complete analysis of
the survey results).37 Perception surveys may not accurately reflect the operating performance of
BRT systems because respondents’ opinions are often shaped by single events or skewed by the
specific situation at the time the questions are asked and are not a reflection of the general
performance over a period of time. However, this survey offers interesting data for the Project
because it is carried out in all participating cities and results are analyzed across cities and over
time and presented every year. Relevant results for the Project are summarized below:

     Box 1: Citizen Perception Surveys (“Cómo Vamos”): Summary of Findings
      The average percentage of people using mass transit systems has more than doubled since 2008,
         but the level of user satisfaction has declined as the novelty factor disappears and the BRT service
         is no longer comparatively evaluated against the service of conventional buses.
      Users’ perception regarding the absolute and relative quality of the system is positive in
         Barranquilla and Medellin.
      Survey respondents in the Metropolitan Area of Bucaramanga are not yet completely satisfied
         with the service offered by the system.
      Survey respondents who indicated that Megabus was their main mode of transportation are
         generally satisfied with the system although the level of satisfaction decreased between 2011 and
         2012.
      Satisfaction with the Transmilenio system has decreased continuously since 2008, while system
         usage has increased constantly over the same period of time.
      In Cartagena, the majority of survey respondents are dissatisfied with Transcaribe as an institution
         (operations have not yet started) given the delays in implementation.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

63.      The project faces risks related to demand and financial sustainability and the need for
supportive regulation. Nonetheless, given mitigation measures in place and improving situation,
these risks are deemed moderate.

64.      Demand and financial sustainability risk: With the exception of Transmilenio in
Bogota, at the time of Project close, the mass transit systems developed with Project support had
not been able to reach the demand levels initially forecasted, threatening long-term financial
sustainability. 38 Trends in demand growth are positive for al cities; however, BRT systems in
Bucaramanga, Barranquilla and Medellin-Valle de Aburra are currently mobilizing only 31
percent of the projected number of passengers per day on average. This is due to a combination of
factors including: inability to eliminate parallel traditional bus routes that directly compete with
the systems, high competition from informal transport modes, inaccuracy in demand forecasting
models, increase in motorization (cars and motorcycles) and, in some instances, sub-optimal
tariff policies. On the financial side, the Metroplus system (Medellin-Valle de Aburra MA)
reported an overall deficit of approximately USD 5.6 million in its first year of operation (3.9
million in the first semester and 1.7 million in the second), although the monthly financial

Colombianas. La Encuesta de Percepción de la Red Cómo Vamos 2012, Ipsos Napoleón Franco, Marzo de

38
   Based on latest demand numbers available and provided by the MOT. Transmilenio is currently
mobilizing 117% of its projected demand, Megabus at 84%, Metrolinea and Transmetro close to 40% and
Metroplus only 15%. The BRT system in Cali (not part of the Project).is also having lower demand than
initially forecasted and is experiencing financial difficulties.

                                                                                                          27
shortfall has been declining as demand increases. As of October of 2012, the Metrolinea system
(Bucaramanga MA) was reporting monthly operational deficits of approximately USD 0.3
million.39

65.      There have been recent improvements in system operations and demand levels, and the
Government is committed to managing this risk appropriately. Metrolinea has made important
operational improvements that have allowed it to gain demand from traditional bus operators
(more than two-fold increase in the number of passengers per day in the last year). Metroplus has
also increased demand over time but continues to be in deficit. In the case of Metroplus, it is
important to consider that the whole system is expected to mobilize a greater number of users,
given its integration with the metro rail, cable cars and future tramway (approximately 52 percent
of demand). It is expected that this system will also evolve towards complete integration with
traditional bus operators. Also, the GoC is currently working on devising measures to reestablish
the financial equilibrium of these systems (see Chapter 2.5).

66.      Political / regulatory risk: The project is also exposed to the risk of declining political
support from local governments and potential unsupportive regulations. This is a critical juncture,
when most systems are consolidating and require from strong institutional support. Political risk
is deemed moderate as projects have reached a level of implementation that makes their reversal
politically costly. In regards to regulatory risk, the GoC recognizes the importance of establishing
a national framework for urban transport that sets the stage for supportive transport service
regulation and transit management policies at the local level and shields projects from political
interference at the local level (see Chapter 2.5).

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

67.     The quality of entry is deemed satisfactory because the Project’s concept and design
addressed long-standing structural issues that stood in the way of high-quality and efficient mass
transit systems in Colombian cities. The Project’s design also built upon the successful
experience of Transmilenio and background studies that were also supported by the Bank.

68.      Project implementation arrangements proved to be effective and allowed to deliver
results in a complex environment. The implementation arrangements incorporated decentralized
investment management and planning (Implementing agencies) and the mobilization of local
funds, combined with strong technical and financial oversight at the central government level
(PCU). This design was successful at ensuring city ownership while reducing the risks inherent to
the relatively lower institutional capacity at the local level.

69.      The Project was successful in attracting private investments, while taking the steps
necessary to promote affordability. In the chosen PPP model, the public sector was responsible
for infrastructure investments (trunk and pre-trunk lanes and stations), while the private sector
was responsible for investing in: trunk and feeder bus fleets, maintenance facilities and operation
of fare-collection systems. The infrastructure investment is not recovered by bus fares, which are

intended to cover Operation and Maintenance (O&M) expenses only. 40 The model also
encouraged “competition for the market”, rather than “in the market” through long-term
concessions, addressing one of the fundamental weaknesses of urban transport in Colombia.

70.      The mass urban transit systems developed under the Project are based on BRT
technology, which is considered a cost-effective solution that provides a service of similar quality
to that of other transportation systems, such as light rail or metro, at a lower cost (See efficiency
section). The Specific Investment Loan (SIL) instrument chosen provided the flexibility needed
to implement multiple sub-projects and to also fund and accompany the technical assistance
activities required to ensure a successful implementation. Despite resulting in lower financing
costs, the DPL and APL instruments were analyzed but discarded in light of the reduced
flexibility of having to establish triggers upfront and the benefits of active Bank supervision of
investments. During appraisal of the Original Loan, it was already envisaged that the GoC would
likely request a follow-up operation to continue supporting the NUTP.

71.     In retrospect, the Project’s design at appraisal could have placed greater emphasis on the
operational and regulatory aspects associated with the operation of the mass transit systems and
devoted more resources to the TA component. In addition, the Project could have built in
guidelines or policy mandates upfront (in the form of a legal framework or as part of the co-
financing agreements with participating cities) regulating issues related to sustainability. For
example, guidelines could have regulated a) the use of tariff revenues to finance exclusively
O&M expenses and not infrastructure, and b) the coordination between Implementing agencies
and other local entities to ensure supportive regulation and supervision of competing services.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

72.      The Bank provided constant support to Implementing agencies in the development of the
required capacity in the safeguards and fiduciary areas. The Bank team carried out multiple
workshops and constantly visited implementing agencies to ensure adequate implementation. It
also mobilized technical experts in different areas and leveraged funding from other sources (trust
funds and grants) to support the implementation of the Project. The Bank team carried out at least
two missions per year, in which it directly met with officials at implementing agencies, providing
technical advice and opening avenues for cross-fertilization and knowledge sharing among these
entities. In multiple instances, the Bank deployed specialists (particularly in the procurement and
social areas) to various cities.

73.      As the sub-projects moved from construction to operation, it became evident that nascent
institutions with limited transport operations experience required from sustained and on-the
ground technical support. The Bank carried out operations planning workshops in Bogota and
Cali, which were attended by representatives from all Participating Cities and sent a specialist to
Bucaramanga to help Metrolinea deal with operational issues. Also, as part of supervision
missions the Bank team stressed the importance of properly structuring the concessions for
associated infrastructure and advocated for a greater emphasis on the planning of operations.
However, Bank influence in these areas was more limited given that they were outside the scope
of the financing, which mainly focused infrastructure development. Furthermore, the fact that the
national framework gave full responsibility over operational aspects to local implementing
agencies and lack of resources prevented the Bank from having a larger role in this area.


40
  The public sector subsidized the construction of infrastructure (through the municipal gasoline surtax and
central government contributions) to ensure affordable rates.

                                                                                                         29
74.     Finally, although the Bank developed a detailed M&E plan at appraisal and produced a
detailed estimation of its costs, it did not follow up closely on its execution. The Bank could have
carried out a more proactive evaluation of the M&E framework’s implementation including the
degree to which it had been internalized by MOT and the capacity of implementing agencies to
comply with the established reporting requirements. Lastly, the Bank could have adjusted the
Project’s key performance indicators in accordance with progress in the implementation of the
M&E framework.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

75.     Rating is considered Moderately Satisfactory due to the Bank’s satisfactory
performance in ensuring an adequate design at entry and high quality of supervision particularly
in the fiduciary and safeguards areas. This Project required a substantial supervision effort,
requiring the Bank to provide training, supervision and technical assistance services to five local
government agencies that had to create an administrative apparatus from scratch and had no
experience in the use of Bank policies and procedures. Nonetheless, this positive performance is
counterbalanced by minor shortcomings related to a sub-optimal follow-up on implementation of
the M&E framework and more proactive intervention in areas that, despite being outside of the
scope of the Project, have had an impact on operational performance.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

76.      The performance of the MOT has been satisfactory in consideration of the high level of
political support given to the Project, which built upon a successful scheme established by the
national government and implemented in partnership with local governments: the NUTP. The
other members of the Project’s Technical Committee performed in a satisfactory manner: The
MHCP has made the funding transfers to municipalities according to the pre-set annual schedule;
while the DNP has been effective in developing the original and revised preparatory studies and
policy guidelines for all sub-projects and in carrying out the ex-post evaluation of investments.
The MHCP, MOT and DNP are now engaged in an effort to consolidate the systems and ensure
their financial sustainability.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

77.     The performance of the PCU was very satisfactory for the most part, but affected by the
high personnel turn-over that occurred after 2010 and that resulted in a progressive weakening of
the Unit’s technical assistance capacity. Although the MOT was highly committed to the
execution of the project, operational shortcomings in the procurement function prevented the
execution of the technical assistance component, which in turn constrained the ability of the PCU
to operate effectively. The PCU has evolved towards a supervisory function and now has a more
limited capacity to provide the close technical support required by the Project.41

78.     Despite initial delays associated with the lack of experience, the newly-created
implementing agencies performed well. This is noteworthy given an initial context of limited
participation and ownership by local government authorities. However, there were minor issues

41
  The overall project management performance rating was downgraded from Satisfactory to Moderately
Satisfactory in 2011 to account for this situation.

                                                                                                     30
of non-performance procurement and financial management (as indicated in the Implementation
Performance Section) and that resulted in a moderately satisfactory evaluation of these areas
during supervision. 42 In addition, construction contracts were awarded based on preliminary
designs that had to be revised as the operational requirements of the projects became more
evident and necessary additional works were identified, particularly in relation to utility networks.

79.     Finally, although the PCU devised a robust M&E framework for the NUTP, the
indicators system was never internalized and its utilization has not been consistent. Implementing
agencies have had difficulty in measuring and furnishing the required information to the PCU,
which also lacks the capacity to support the measurement of indicators at the local level.
Shortcomings in the M&E area included: (i) lack of institutional capacity to measure and monitor
the indicators that make up the M&E framework; (ii) insufficient knowledge of the methodology
for the calculation of the indicators; (iii) lack of clarity in data collection responsibilities within
implementing agencies and across relevant entities in participating cities.43 Also, the MOT did
not appropriate the M&E tool, which was developed by an external consultant, and did not act
timely to promote utilization.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

80.     This rating reflects moderate shortcomings in the performance of the PCU and
implementing agencies and minor shortcomings in Government performance. The performance of
the PCU was strong in the initial years, but declined towards the end of the implementation
period. On the other hand, implementing agencies had project management and fiduciary issues at
the beginning that were corrected over time as they evolved into more structured entities. The
implementation of the M&E framework has not been successful, affecting the overall borrower
performance rating.

6. Lessons Learned

Mass Transit Program Design

81.      Coordination between implementing agencies and other entities in charge of
regulating traffic and transport should be a cornerstone of any program in this area: The
reorganization of bus routes and regulation of transport operators and control of informality fall
under agencies such as metropolitan authorities (i.e., Barranquilla, Pereira, Medellin and
Bucaramanga) or traffic management agencies (i.e., Cartagena and Bogota’s Secretaria de
Movilidad). These entities need to be engaged strongly since day one to ensure they adopt the
complementary measures required to enhance the operational performance of the entire urban
transport system. The lesson learnt is that this type of national mass transit program needs to
include the strengthening of these agencies and also to work early on the approval and
implementation of supportive regulations that mandate coordination and effective regulation of
traditional bus operators, control of informality, and elimination of parallel routes.



42
   Performance ratings for the procurement and financial management functions were downgraded from
Satisfactory to Moderately Satisfactory in November of 2009 and December of 2007, respectively. The
Financial Management Rating was further downgraded to Moderately Unsatisfactory in July 2010 and
upgraded back to Moderately Satisfactory in September 2011.

                                                                                                    31
82.     The implementation of BRT systems goes beyond building the infrastructure and a
greater upfront effort needs to be placed on operational aspects: There is the sense among
Project stakeholders that the focus on bus operations needs to be strengthened as these projects
are not infrastructure schemes, but rather transport schemes, requiring deep planning of
operational, transit management and regulatory aspects that transcend beyond the realm of the
Implementing Agency in charge of executing the works, including: route reorganization,
development of bus scrapping schemes and regulation of informal transport services. Although
these aspects were considered in the present Project, the lesson learned is the need to carry out
detailed operational and regulatory assessments upfront, on a parallel front to the execution of the
works in order to lay the groundwork for the start of operations. This lesson is already being
applied to the SETP projects that the Bank is supporting under the new operation.

83.     Synergies and knowledge transfer are fostered by the simultaneous implementation
of projects in multiple cities: Important synergies have been created as a result of the
simultaneous implementation of projects in cities participating in the NUTP. This has resulted in
a continuous flow of know-how and best practices among participating cities, the PCU and the
Bank, in areas such as civil works management, procurement and fiduciary processes, safeguards
management, operational design, strategies for initiation of operation, among others. The Project
has also benefited from these informal knowledge sharing arrangements to strengthen the
implementation and institutional capacity of the new medium-sized cities which will begin
implementation under the SETP operation.

84.     There is a role for the Central Government in the implementation of urban
transport services reforms at the local level: Given that small and medium-size cities lack both
financial and technical resources, the participation of the GoC becomes crucial in promoting
reforms at the municipal level. This Project showed that this role needs to take the form of
constant support from the national government, particularly in areas such as the regulation of
transport services and negotiation of concession agreements. The GoC has learned these lessons
and is moving towards the formulation of a national urban mobility law.

Design of Bank Instruments

85.      Although the SIL instrument offered advantages over other instruments, Bank
support to well-structured government programs could take the form of a programmatic
results-based approach: The SIL allowed for close supervision of investments and for enhanced
technical support, but it also created additional costs and inflexibilities resulting from the
definition of eligible expenditures. In this sense, the Bank could not finance costs associated with
land purchases (this category was allowed in the Second Additional Loan) and could not cover
the cost of utility relocations. To reduce this inflexibility and for high-quality programs, the Bank
could consider in similar future operations an output-based approach whereby financing is
provided to the national government to make its contributions to the program, without a
connection to specific investments, but conditional on the achievement of agreed outcomes, in a
similar fashion to that of the Program for Results (P4R) instrument, which did not exist at the
time of Project Appraisal.

86.     The technical assistance component for this type of projects should have an
important weight and alternative ways of deploying this component should be considered:
The client highly valued the Bank’s technical support in areas deemed critical to ensure the
sustainability of mass transit projects. However, resources were not sufficient to allow for closer
support in key areas such as the negotiation of concession agreements for infrastructure and
operations. The lesson learned for future operations is that a large TA component and more
continuous and close technical support to the implementing agencies are required. This lesson

                                                                                                  32
was already taken into account in the follow-up operation approved in 2011, which includes a
relatively larger TA component. The Bank could also look at other potential ways to deliver TA,
including contracting of activities directly by the Bank, to ensure that projects receive critical
support on time when faced with structural limitations in the public procurement system.

Project Design and Implementation

87.      Capacity building should go beyond enhancing the capacity of the implementation
unit and also focus on strengthening its mandate and facilitating its work within the
Ministry: The performance of the PCU was affected by factors outside its direct control and
related to the institutional environment in which it operated. Future projects should build the
capacity of the dependencies on which the performance of the PCU depends (i.e., procurement
and financial management) and seek a long-term commitment to maintain its link to the highest
levels of the institution or alternatively, strengthen the department to which the unit reports.

88.      M&E Framework design needs to account for the capacity of responsible agencies
and mandate its internalization by the Borrower: Despite the technical merit and design
quality of the set of 35 indicators under SISETU, in practice, implementing agencies did not have
the capacity to calculate them and the level of reporting was low. When the resolution mandating
reporting of these indicators came out in 2009, and due to legal requirements, the focus of the
PCU turned to ensuring compliance as opposed to providing technical assistance in the
measurement of indicators with limited results. Currently, the MOT is working on passing a new
resolution rationalizing the M&E requirements. A lesson learned for future projects is that it may
be worth focusing on a set of SMART (simple, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-bound)
indicators that can be effectively managed by implementing agencies. In addition, the M&E
framework implementation needs to be the direct responsibility of the PCU and not a task
delegated to an external consultant and that is never internalized and implemented.

89.     Early consolidation of the environmental and social management capacity is
important to ensure timely project implementation: The local Implementing Entities include
environmental and social management teams. Experience has shown that the earlier these teams
are onboard and being able to participate in project design and planning, the higher the rate of
success for the particular project activity. On the other hand, examples have shown that where
environmental and social teams were not brought onboard early on, unmanaged social issues
caused serious implementation delays, and adverse impact on the affected populations.
Furthermore, environmental and social management teams need to place especial consideration
on tackling problems and designing communication and implementation strategies for vulnerable
groups.

90.      Urban transport infrastructure projects need to account for the risk of cost and
time overruns arising from the need to relocate / replace public utility equipment and
facilities that are affected as part of construction works: One of the main causes of delays and
cost overruns in the Project was associated with the additional works required to deal with
affected utility networks, for which accurate plots did not exist in some cases, and that had to be
funded by local governments (not eligible for Bank financing). Future projects should take this
risk into account and establish clear working arrangements with public utilities and clearly
delineate responsibilities. Budget contingencies should account for the potential additional cost. 44



44
 Several authors have devoted entire research projects to analyze the reasons that explain why the
majority of transport infrastructure projects tend to experience cost overruns and completion delays. For

                                                                                                            33
Private sector participation

91.      Although private sector participation through commercial real estate developments
can be positive and mobilize additional resources, the structuring of PPPs in this area needs
to be carefully planned and monitored to avoid pitfalls: Three of the sub-projects
(Metrolinea, Transmetro and Transcaribe) executed concession agreements with private entities
for the development of bus terminals associated with real estate developments. The implementing
agencies for these systems assigned a portion of the tariff to remunerate the concessionaires over
the concession period. Not only it can be argued that these projects were over-dimensioned, but
also they pose a financial sustainability threat on the system, reducing the resources available for
the operation and maintenance of the system. It has also been argued that charging public
transport users for the stations they use is regressive. It is important to strengthen the capacity of
implementing agencies to adequately evaluate these projects and to ensure that Project design
includes mandatory regulations issued by the National Government that provide guidance on the
structuring and negotiation of these concession agreements.

92.      The contracting of operations should contemplate the conflicts of interest that could
potentially arise from the fact that the selected companies/ consortia could be operators of
both the mass transit system and the traditional bus system at the same time: The NUTP
was designed so that existing bus companies would be given preference in the selection of mass
transit system operators. This was done to ensure political support for the project and build
ownership amongst operators. In some of the participating cities (i.e., Barranquilla and Pereira),
conventional bus companies that now make part of BRT operations consortia continue to operate
their conventional services on parallel to BRT corridors. This particularity does not allow for the
necessary incentives to eliminate the competition between BRT routes and conventional routes to
exist, since conventional-BRT operators can make a profit no matter what system keeps the
passengers. The lesson here is to include regulations aimed at managing this potential conflict of
interest and prevent the negative impact that this situation can have on the operational
performance of the mass transit system.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
93.      The Project has created a mass transit culture in the Country: “The greatest learning
which can be attributed to the implementation of the Colombia NUTP is a change in the beliefs,
traditions and customs in the way in which citizens commute, as well as the urban, social and
environmental transformation triggered by the BRT projects. This required a proactive approach
to communications strategies before, during and after the phases of construction and
implementation of BRT projects.”

94.     Bank involvement has been fundamental for the achievement of the Project’s
objectives: “The funding and constant monitoring of the Bank made it possible to achieve the
main objectives of the project: construction of transport infrastructure in the participating cities,
strengthening of institutional capacity in the transport sector and improving access for people
with low income to public transport systems. Bank involvement also allowed for the transfer of
knowledge at the national and international level, the execution of communication programs to
support infrastructure projects, the generation of guidelines for implementation, the creation of a
new approach for national and local authorities to engage the communities and the economic and


example, see Bent Flyvberg’s Megaprojects at Risk (2003), and Harry Dimitriou’s Mega Projects and
Mega Risks (2004).

                                                                                                    34
social sectors in Participating Cities. What was done is equivalent to a true revolution of public
transport in Colombia with a single goal: to improve the quality of life of citizens”.

95.      The Project has contributed to other higher-level objectives: “The contribution of the
Colombia Mass Transit BRT projects to the economic development of the country is not limited
to the economic development of the urban areas they are located in. The BRT projects are a way
in which the Colombian Government, regions and private sector show they are capable of setting
ambitious goals and achieving them. These goals have been achieved in part since entities
ranging from the National Government to the Local BRT agencies have taken part in the
implementation of the projects, anticipating the magnitude and complexity associated to them.”

  Annex 2. Results Framework Analysis

  Project Outcome Indicators (Key Performance Indicators)
  The indicators noted with a star (*) are the Key Performance Indicators defined at appraisal. Some of the BRT systems have not calculated /
  reported these indicators through SISETU or other means. The Bank made direct requests to implementing agencies in an effort to collect
  sufficient data to evaluate the achievement of the PDOs. Other indicators (additional to the ones defined at appraisal) have been added to the tables
  below in order measure progress in the achievement of the PDOs. The baseline of Key Performance Indicators was developed in 2007 by Steer
  Davies Gleave, at the request of MOT, and it is not available for all indicators and systems.

  Progress in outcome indicators can be directly traced back to the output indicators for the Project, mainly related to the delivery of soft (executed
  operations and fare-collection contracts) and hard infrastructure works (stations, kilometers of trunk and pre-trunk lines, terminals and garages)
  required to launch and sustain the operation of BRT systems. Finally, the Project provided the inputs in the form of the financing of civil works
  and technical assistance activities.

  Project Output Indicators
  In order to implement BRT systems aimed at improving mobility conditions and improving access by the poor, the Project financed the
  construction of segregated busways (trunk corridors), pre-trunk and feeder routes, stations, terminals and garages and associated infrastructure. In
  addition, the Project also supported technical assistance activities that enabled the preparation and execution of construction, operations and fare
  collection contracts required for the implementation of these mass transit systems based on a PPP scheme. Overall, output targets have been
  substantially achieved (up to a level that allows for the operation of the systems), with the exception of the construction of terminals / garages
  developed through concessions and not financed with project proceeds.

Annex 4. Economic and Financial Analysis

The ex-post economic analyses and evaluations for the BRT subprojects discussed in this Annex
are based on the contents of ex-post economic evaluations hired by the Colombian National
Planning Department –DNP to independent consulting firms and incorporated into the National
System for Public Management and Results Evaluation (SYNERGIA). To December 31, 2012,
ex-post economic analyses have been hired by DNP and conducted by independent consultants in
Barranquilla, Bogota, Bucaramanga and Pereira. Evaluations have not been undertaken neither in
Cartagena or Medellin, the former since its BRT system is yet to start operations, and the latter
since its very recent start of operations did not give time for a proper ex-post evaluation to be
conducted during 2012. The following table summarizes key information related to the ex-ante
and ex-post evaluations for all projects. The table also indicates the start dates for revenue-
operations for all systems. Most information was obtained from local Implementing Entities, the
DNP and the MT. All data was updated whenever possible.

The ex-post evaluations for the four cities described above were done in different years and
encompass different evaluation periods. As illustrated in Table 1, the evaluation period for
Bogota and Pereira is 20 years, while for Bucaramanga is 24 years. It should be noted that
although the Project addressed in this ICR financed only the Transmileno NQS corridor of phase
II in Bogota, the ex-post evaluation for Bogota is done for Phases I and II.

The evaluation for Barranquilla was divided into two periods of analysis: one ex-post evaluation
that only accounts for the cost and benefits accounted between 2010 and 2011, and an updated
evaluation of projected benefits and costs from 2012 to 2018. Unsurprisingly, the Barranquilla
evaluation encompassing only two years of analysis results in a negative rate of return. The
updated evaluation, although only spanning over 6 years, shows a positive of return.

    a. Methodology

The methodology used for the ex-post evaluations is based on the standard World Bank
methodology used to estimate and evaluate BRT projects. This ensures that the results are
consistent with the ex-ante analysis carried out as part of appraisal. An explanation on costs and
benefits included in the evaluations is explained on the following paragraphs.

Costs
The costs the methodology associates with a BRT project fall into two categories: (ii) one-time
investments, particularly in infrastructure development, institutional capacity building and
purchase of the new bus fleet; and (ii) recurring annual costs of the system’s operation and
maintenance. In addition, there are one-time losses in time due to construction works. The
following table summarizes the evaluated costs for each city.

As illustrated in Table 2, ex-post evaluation for all cities takes into consideration time losses
during construction, different one time investments and recurring annual costs. According to the
Bucaramanga evaluation, there was not enough data for this city to allow the calculation of time
losses during construction. All other cities did calculate this component.

In general terms, Barranquilla is the only subproject which displays costs in a way different to
other cities. However, this does not mean costs are not comparable among cities. Overall, cost
estimations for all cities take into account the most significant investments during construction
and operation phases. The following paragraphs discuss the way in which one time investments
and recurring annual costs are presented in the ex-post evaluation of each city.

One time investments: As shown above, the only city which explicitly calculated financial costs
is Barranquilla. Other cities have incorporated the financial costs directly in other investment
components. Also, Barranquilla is the only subproject which does not document the investment

                                                                                                                          57
costs associated to the implementation of the Implementing Agency in charge of managing the
entire project during operational phase. The analysis of the report suggests this cost was included
as part of the infrastructure investment component.

Recurring annual costs: Barranquilla presents a condensed value for recurring annual costs. These
costs include mainly fleet operating costs and fare-collection system operating costs. The
evaluations for Bogota, Bucaramanga and Pereira present specific values for operational and
maintenance costs of bus fleet, fare-collection system, Implementing Agency and infrastructure
maintenance costs.


Benefits

The evaluated benefits are encompassed by the four main categories of the standard World Bank
methodology: (i) time savings of transit users; (ii) savings in operating costs for the replacement
of buses; (iii) accident reduction; and (iv) pollution/emission reductions, including savings
occurred from modal shift (from private cars to mass transit).

The ex-post cost-benefit analysis compares the incremental costs and benefits of a with-project
scenario to a without-project scenario that does not assume any type of infrastructure investments
and maintains the original level of service. The comparison assumes in both scenarios an increase
in demand due to the population growth and the passenger demand for travel in the corridors of
the cities studied. As it will be shown over this Annex, the benefits of the BRT projects come
mainly from savings in time and optimization of bus operation. With the exception of the
evaluation for Bogota, the benefits calculated in the other evaluations are not limited to the
benefits calculated in the traditional CBA methodology and incorporate the assessment of
additional benefits, including increased urban residential land values and user safety. These
benefits have not been considered for the purpose of this ICR so as to make the results consistent
and comparable with previous evaluations. The following table summarizes the benefits
considered in the standard methodology and the benefits calculated in the evaluation of each city.
The table contains a column which defines the benefits included in the standard World Bank
CBA analysis (area within the dotted lines).

As Table 3 illustrates, the Bogota evaluation is the only one that calculates only the World Bank
methodology benefits. Pereira and Barranquilla calculate travel time savings for private car users.
These benefits may be calculated since BRT projects tend to organize traffic and free streets from
conventional buses which due to the nature of their operation (slow speeds and frequent stops)
tend to slow down traffic. However, it can also be argued that the reduction in congestion and
possible increase in mixed lane travel speeds is not significant over the long term since the road
network tends to rebalance and thus more cars will be attracted to the mixed lanes running
parallel to the BRT corridor. It is also worth noting that according to the Bucaramanga ex-post
analysis, there was not enough data which allowed estimating savings due to reductions in road
accidents. All other cities reported savings in road accidents.

Of particular interest is the Barranquilla ex-post evaluation, since in this subproject consultants
estimated savings beyond the World Bank methodology, including: (i) savings in deaths due to
illnesses related to poor air quality; (ii) savings in deaths and wounded due to improved citizen
safety; (iii) savings in property loss due to improved citizen safety; and (iv) increase in residential
land value. The Barranquilla analysis does a separate CBA analysis which does not include any of
these additional benefits in order to make the CBA comparable with the ex-ante analysis. As
mentioned before, additional benefits have not been considered for the purpose of this document.

Common considerations in the calculation of costs and benefits
The with-project scenario includes the effects of both the trunk lines and the feeder lines. The
analysis includes the assessment of the operating costs for both services where the trunk network
uses new high-capacity buses and the feeder routes are served by new regular buses. The savings
in travel time for project users assumes the same number of passengers with or without the
project and an average value of travel time for urban transport users, based on the information
obtained from stated preference surveys conducted in each city. The benefits to existing car users
in the corridors are estimated in Barranquilla and Pereira but not in Bogota or Bucaramanga,
since the latter considered benefits to be temporary since road network re-configuration tends to
equilibrate travel times in the long run. Generated trips and modal changes (i.e. car users
switching to transit) are estimated and considered as additional benefits to the each project, thus
increasing travel demand. In addition, benefits from reductions in accidents and pollutants are
calculated based on accident records and emission models which take into consideration the
reduction of bus fleet and transport oversupply, as well as the incorporation of more efficient
combustion technologies in the new fleet.

    b. Summary Results

For the purpose of the analysis included in this ICR, an exercise of comparison of costs and
benefits of subprojects was undertaken. Costs and benefits were taken from the ex-post
evaluations in COP and converted to current USD. The following paragraphs summarize the total
costs and benefits found in the ex-post evaluations to later compare key indicators of the ex-post
evaluations: Net Present Value –NPV-, Economic Rate of Return –ERR- and Cost-Benefit Ratio
–CBR.

    a. Summary of Benefits and Costs

Costs
Costs were aggregated into the categories included in the methodology and shown in Table 2. The
following table includes all economic costs for Barranquilla (2010-2011), Bogota (phases I and
II), Bucaramanga and Pereira.

Table 4 presents total costs for one time investments and recurring annual costs. The costs
reflected in the table are numerically identical to those reported in the ex-post evaluations. Costs
were calculated for each case using shadow price index, and COP/USD exchange rates were
taken for the year in which the analysis was conducted. Costs associated with time losses during
construction are included. The highest time-loss associated costs are found in Pereira ($193
million) while the lowest are for Barranquilla ($16.7 million). Given the comparable total
corridor kilometers delivered in Pereira and Barranquilla, the enormous difference in costs
associated to time losses calls the attention. Other costs are more comparable in proportion to the
total corridor kilometers delivered.

The total costs with and without time losses during construction were calculated. An estimation
of the economic costs per kilometer of corridor was conducted for the sake of comparison for this
ICR. The results show that the average economic cost per kilometer is between US$ 20 and $30
million (current dollar prices). These results are consistent with other analysis of typical BRT
infrastructure costs.

Benefits

Benefits were drawn from the ex-post analysis for Barranquilla (2010-2011, 2012-2018), Bogota
(phases I and II), Bucaramanga and Pereira. The following table includes all economic benefits
reported in the ex-post analysis, including additional benefits not quantified in the standard World
Bank methodology. For the sake of comparison, this ICR only adds the costs of the standard

                                                                                                                  60
methodology. It should be noticed that in some cases (particularly Barranquilla), additional
benefits not included in the standard methodology may be higher than standard benefits. Table 5
summarizes benefits for the four cities mentioned before.

A Note on the Barranquilla ex-post Benefits: The benefits included in the ex-post analysis for
Barranquilla are not directly comparable to benefits from other cities’ ex-post analysis, since the
Barranquilla evaluation is the only one which distinguishes between two evaluation periods:
2010-2011 (actual operation period at time of evaluation) and 2012-2018, which the evaluation
calls “ex-ante” analysis. The authors of this ICR opted to include all the benefits quantified for
the 2010-2011 period, and a general, aggregated benefit quantified for the 2012-2018 period.
Additionally, the Barranquilla ex-post includes a series of additional benefits which are not
calculated in other evaluations (e.g. citizen safety, land value) and that are in many cases more
important in terms of magnitude than the benefits included in the standard methodology. The
highest benefit in Barranquilla (excluding potential increases in land value) is given by a
reduction in deaths due to reduced transport-related contaminant emissions.

Table 5 presents total benefits for the period of analysis for each city. The benefits reflected in the
table are numerically identical to those reported in the ex-post evaluations. Economic Benefits per
kilometer vary importantly between cities. This is partly explained by the specific context of each
city. For example, Barranquilla and Bucaramanga have the lowest benefits associated to savings
in travel times for project users. According to information gathered during the preparation of this
ICR, these lower benefits are explained since trunk-feeder systems tend to force users to transfer
between feeder and local services. This may add additional travel time to users. In smaller cities,
where the average commuting trip is under 30 minutes, the additional time taken by doing
transfers is not easily compensated by higher travel speeds in BRT corridors, thus reducing the
total time savings in travel times. Also, the fact that most cities (except Bogota) have not reached
yet the initially estimated daily passenger demand means that in some cases benefits due to
savings in travel times are lower than they should be. This situation is especially true for the case
of Bucaramanga.

                                                                                                                 61
An estimation of the economic benefits per kilometer of corridor was conducted for the sake of
comparison for this ICR. For the case of Barranquilla, benefits per Kilometer were calculating by
adding up benefits from the 2010-2011 and 2012-2018 periods. The results show benefits close to
$40 million per kilometer, except for Bucaramanga. As explained before, it is expected that
benefits for Bucaramanga increase notoriously when demand reaches the levels initially
forecasted. These results are consistent with other analysis of typical BRT infrastructure costs.

Results of the Cost-Benefit Analysis
The ex-post evaluation for the mass transit systems developed in the cities of Bogota,
Bucaramanga and Pereira show that the BRT systems financed by the Project produced social
benefits in excess of their costs. For Barranquilla, benefits are greater than the costs only when
taking into account expected benefits for the 2012-2018 period of analysis. As discussed earlier,
this should not be surprising since the 2010-2011 evaluation period does not allow the accrual of
benefits beyond the initial first year of operation.

The results of the ex-post analysis are congruent with the ex-ante economic evaluations
conducted during appraisal. The following table summarizes the results of the CBA analysis done
for each subproject both at appraisal and on ex-post evaluations.

Table 6 allows a comparison between the results of the ex-ante and ex-post evaluations for all
projects. As discussed earlier, the only case in which an ex-post evaluation produces a negative
ERR, NPV and CBR is the Barranquilla analysis for the 2010-2011 two year period of analysis.
Ex-post ERR, NPV and CBR for Bogota and Pereira are higher than those calculated at appraisal.
In Bucaramanga, the ERR is positive and acceptable although lower than the rate calculated at
appraisal.

Main Economic Benefits
Table 6 shows the main economic benefit found in the ex-post evaluations for each subproject. In
all cases besides Barranquilla, the main benefits are directly linked to the improved conditions of
the urban public transport system: Reduced public transport vehicle operating costs, and savings
in travel times. These results are consistent with the objective of the project and reflect the
positive impact the BRT subprojects have on Colombian cities. In Barranquilla, the ex-ante
analysis concluded that the main economic benefit would be the reduced vehicle operating costs.
However, ex-post analysis conclude that the main economic benefit is the lower mortality
associated with pollution. Barranquilla is the only case in which the ex-post evaluation found the
lower mortality associated with pollution as the main economic benefit. For Bogota,
Bucaramanga and Pereira, ex-ante analysis at appraisal had concluded the main economic
benefits of the BRT subprojects would come from a reduction in the costs associated to the
operation of the public transport system. This conclusion was congruent with the ex-post analysis
for the Bucaramanga ex-post analysis. Ex-post analysis in Bogota and Pereira concluded that the
main economic benefit is reduction in user travel times instead lower operating costs in the urban
public transport system. These results indicate the benefits for the total population of project users
outnumber the benefits derived from increased efficiency of the system. It is possible that the
main economic benefit for Bucaramanga will also be reduction in travel times as actual demand
catches up with the initially forecasted demand. Overall, the main economic benefits for all
subprojects are congruent with the Project objectives and may be considered as evidence of the
satisfactory achievement of the Project Objectives.

Construction delays and cost increases: Most subprojects required additional civil works than
the ones initially estimated due to changes in the scope of the BRT subprojects or to unforeseen
needs to intervene public utility networks. Consequently, the duration and size of most
construction contracts was increased, leading to higher costs and longer than anticipated
construction times.

In Barranquilla, Bucaramanga and Medellin, there were larger than expected interventions to
restructure utility networks and greater quantities of works. In Cartagena (not included in the ex-
post evaluations), topographical and other design errors, as well as delays in securing the Right of
Way (ROW) led to higher costs. In Pereira, these processes took less time, allowing for the start
of operations within the original schedule.

Construction delays were mainly the result of: (i) issues attributable to the public sector related to
defective project designs and delays in delivering the ROW; (ii) issues attributable to contractors’
non-performance and (iii) the lack of comprehensive utility network inventories and plots in
participating cities. The delays are also directly associated with the institutional capacity in each
city, as can be seen in the relatively low speed of construction (1 to 3 Km. per year on average)
for Barranquilla, Bucaramanga, Cartagena and Medellin, when compared to Bogota (about 8 Km
per year). This is due to the fact that the executing agency in Bogota (Urban Development
Institute or IDU) had extensive experience in the execution of works, being the public works
agency of the city.46

Changes in Land Value as an additional benefit of BRT subprojects

The ex-post evaluations for Barranquilla, Bogota, Bucaramanga and Pereira include an analysis
on the effects on residential land value around the catchment area of the BRT corridors. The
evaluations reported that Real Estate Market Monitor databases report effective increases in land
value (above market increases) in zones within 1 kilometer of BRT corridors. The increases are
more perceptible around terminals and interchange stations. A summary of the findings in every
city is presented in the following paragraphs:

Barranquilla: The ex-post analysis found an increase in land value for residential plots within the
catchment area of the BRT system. According to the evaluation, increase in land value is the
second most important benefit found in the ex-post evaluation when considered additional
benefits not included in the standard World Bank methodology. Benefits associated to increase in
residential land value are US$ 245.31 million (Table 5).

Bogota: The ex-post analysis states that the Bogota Real Estate Market Monitor reported effective
increases in land value between 2000 and 2001 in zones within 1 kilometer of Transmilenio. This
increase occurred, according to the study, at times where land value dropped overall. Other
studies, including price studies and panel surveys between 2000 and 2004, found positive
tendencies in land value for plots within walking distance of Transmilenio. However, there are
differences between positive and negative changes in land value according to the socioeconomic
strata of the plot. Increases in land value were found especially in low and middle income strata,
while on high income strata there were decreases in land value, especially in cases of “immediate
closeness”, where residential plots lose value as they become more attractive for commercial
purposes and they become more exposed to noise and safety issues. The Bogota ex-post analysis
does not calculate a rounded number for the benefits associated to increase in residential land
value.

Bucaramanga: According to the ex-post analysis, the Metro Area of Bucaramanga has
experienced a positive dynamic in real estate construction and an increase in land value due to a
healthy demand for real estate and lower availability of empty plots within the Metro Area.
However, the study found that the average increase in land value for plots within the catchment
area of Metrolinea is similar to the increase in areas outside the catchment area of the system. A
higher increase in land value was found in areas around terminal stations. The Bucaramanga ex-
post analysis does not calculate a rounded number for the benefits associated to increase in
residential land value.

Pereira: the ex-post analysis for Megabus compared increases in land value in zones directly
served by Megabus with increases in land value in zones not directly served by the system. The
study compared a total of six cases, of which 3 are zones directly served by Megabus and the
other 3 are not directly served. The ex-post analysis calculated an average differential in
residential land value increase of 25.81% between zones directly served and not directly served
by Megabus. A differential of 67.69% was found in commercial land value under the same
analysis circumstances. The Pereira ex-post analysis does not calculate a rounded number for the
benefits associated to increase in residential land value.

Annex 6. Beneficiary Survey Results

Citizen Perception Surveys (“Como Vamos”) Surveys

Introduction

The survey has a defined methodology that is applied consistently across participating Colombian
cities and across time with a yearly frequency. It is an annual public perception survey that
collects the opinion of between 1,000 and 1,500 individuals that represent the various zones
and social strata in participating cities and com from both genders. With a total population
surveyed of almost 12,000 this survey has become one of the most important sources of
information available on the quality of life of the majority of the Colombian population, who
resides in cities. The “Como Vamos” survey is a private sector initiative bringing together the
chamber of commerce, a local newspaper and a private university in each city, and the
Corona Foundation.

The main evaluation tool is the series of public perception indicators designed for each
sector. The survey includes a chapter that focuses on mobility and a number of questions related
to the perceived performance of public transport in general, and of the mass transit system in the
cities where one exists. IPSOS- Napoleon Franco administers the survey and processes and
analyzes the data. The survey has been carried out in participating cities over the following
periods: Pereira (2011-12), Barranquilla (2008-12), Medellin (2006-12), Bogota (1998-2012) and
Bucaramanga (2010-12)

Overall results for Urban Mobility and Mass Transit System

Perception surveys may not accurately reflect the operating performance of BRT systems because
respondents’ opinions are often shaped by single events or skewed by the specific situation at the
time the questions are asked and not to general performance over a period of time.

The latest analysis for all cities in Colombia (Quality of Life Perception Survey in 10 Colombian
cities: “Cómo Vamos” 2012), released in March 2013, showed a deteriorating perception of the
population regarding mobility conditions and an erosion of satisfaction with mass transit systems,
relative to other transportation modes.47

On average, about 53 percent of users are satisfied with the mass transit system, down from 71
percent in 2008. Also, for the first time since 2008, the average satisfaction of users of traditional
public transport services surpassed that of mass transit system users. From 2008 to 2011, mass
transit systems had been rated higher than the traditional bus system (buses and mini-buses).

The average percentage of survey respondents that use mass transit systems (in the cities where
they exist) has increased since 2008.Nonetheless, average usage of public transport as a whole
(including both mass transit and traditional bus services) has experienced a downward trend. This
has corresponded with an increase in the proportion of survey respondents that frequently use
private vehicles and motorcycles, which as increased every year since 2005.

                                                                                                   68
On the other hand, satisfaction with city and neighborhood roads has been increasingly
consistently. In 2012, on average 53 percent and 38 percent of survey respondents were satisfied
with the quality of neighborhood and city roads, respectively. These percentages have increased
from 41% and 30 percent in 2008-2009.

Survey results with regards to overall urban mobility conditions and the performance of mass
transit systems in the cities that participated in the Project is included below. The main
conclusions for the main cities include:
     Users’ perception regarding the absolute and relative quality of the system is positive in
        Barranquilla and Medellin.
     The survey indicates that the population of the Metropolitan Area of Bucaramanga is not
        yet completely satisfied with the service offered by the system.
     Understandably, given the delays in the implementation of the project, the perception of
        citizens regarding Transcaribe is not the best. In the latest survey (2012), 62 percent of
        respondents indicated that they are not satisfied with the progress made so far in the
        construction works and 41 percent believe that the system will not contribute
        significantly to improve mobility in the city (34 percent it will improve conditions and 25
        percent consider the situation will remain the same).
     Survey respondents who indicated that Megabus was their main mode of transportation
        are generally satisfied with the system although the level of satisfaction decreased
        between 2011 and 2012.
     Satisfaction with the Transmilenio system has decreased continuously since 2008, while
        system usage has increased constantly over the same period of time.

Barranquilla (Transmetro)

In 2012, 66 percent of survey respondents indicated that they use public transportation for work
and study related trips. The proportion of public transport users has remained relatively flat since
2009, when it experienced an important increase to 64 percent from 49 percent in the previous
year.48 Regarding the mass transit system, the percentage of people using Transmetro as their
main transport mode has increased from 4 percent in 2011 to 13 percent in 2012. This increased
has occurred at the expense of traditional buses and taxis, which have seen reduced their share in
9 percentage points and 1 percentage points, respectively, over the same period of time.

The overall satisfaction with the system was 83 percent in the year following the start of
commercial operations (2011), decreasing to 70 percent last year. The proportion of people who
believe that Transmetro significantly improved or somewhat improved the mobility situation in
the city increased from 41 percent in 2011 to 47 percent in 2012. The percentage of people who
considered that the introduction of Transmetro did not have any impact on mobility decreased
from 43 percent in 2011 to 36 percent in 2012, while the percentage of people who considered
that Transmetro somewhat or significantly worsened mobility increased slightly to 17 percent up
to 16 percent over the same period of time.

The perception of survey respondents regarding the quality of service of Transmetro relative to
that of traditional bus services has remained positive, particularly for the actual users of the
system. In 2012, 76 percent of system users considered that Transmetro offered better service
than traditional buses and only 6 percent considered the relative level of service of the BRT

48
  This increase mainly corresponded to an upsurge in the use of buses, from 43 percent in 2008 to 59
percent in 2009; and coincided with a drop in the reported use of private vehicles (privately-owned cars and
motorcycles) from 29 percent in 2008 to 18 percent in 2009.

                                                                                                         69
system to be worse. This is similar to the results obtained in 2011, when 78 percent of users
considered Transmetro’s service to be better than that offered by traditional buses and only 3
percent indicated the opposite. The relative value of Transmetro is lower when looking at the
population as a whole. In 2012, 55 percent of all survey respondents (users and non-users) gave
Transmetro’s service a higher mark than that given to traditional buses (13 percent rated it lower),
down from 57 percent in 2011 (8 percent rated it lower).

Finally, the overall perception regarding neighborhood roads has improved since 2009, when only
34 percent of survey respondents were satisfied with the quality of these roads. In 2012, 63
percent of respondents were satisfied with the general condition of roads in their neighborhood.
The level of satisfaction in the southeastern segment of the metropolitan area, where the Project is
rehabilitating local roads for feeder services has increased from 49 percent in 2010 to 57 percent
in 2012.

Bogota (Transmilenio)

Overall satisfaction with the mass transit system in Bogota has declined from 49 percent in 2008
to 33 percent in 2011. Although satisfaction with the mass transit system has declined, until 2011
it remained above that of the traditional public transport services. Nonetheless, for the first time
since the launch of the survey, traditional bus services’ users reported a higher level of
satisfaction (47%) than users of Transmilenio (28%).

Transmilenio usage among the surveyed population has continued to increase and is now 27
percent, relative to the 6 percent verified in 2002. The introduction of the complete NQS corridor
after 2006 seems to have resulted in an increase in Transmilenio usage, which went from 14
percent in 2007 to 24 percent in 2009. Usage of traditional public transport reported a large
decrease from 47 percent in 2011 to 36 percent in 2012. This coincided with an increase in
private transport from 25 percent to 18 percent over the same period of time. It was also observed
that public transport in Bogotá (Transmilenio buses and minibuses) continue to show lower levels
of user satisfaction, while bicycles, taxis and buses to improve this level

Bucaramanga (Metrolinea)

Public transportation use (for work and study trips) in the city has remained flat at around 47
percent in the last year. Nonetheless, the percentage of people who use the Metrolinea system has
increased from 7 percent in 2010 and 2011 to 16 percent in 2012. The increase in Metrolinea use
appears to have occurred at the expense of the use of traditional bus services (“buses and
busetas”), which has gone down from 35 percent in 2010 to 24 percent in 2012. The share of
informal transportation (mostly moto taxi) has remained constant at 3 percent. These results are
consistent with the increase in demand that has been verified for the system since the start of
operations in 2009 and point to a substitution of traditional bus services for Metrolinea.

Also, the percentage of the surveyed population that now has used the system at least once went
up from 43 percent in 2011 to 59 percent in 2012. This increase in first time use has mostly been
the result of increased usage by low income – strata 1 and 2- (increase from 37 percent in 2011 to
55 percent in 2012) and middle income populations–strata 3 and 4- (increase from 47 percent in
2011 to 63 percent in 2012).

Breaking down usage by zone shows that the area in which most people have used the system is
Floridablanca (78 percent in 2012 and 64 percent in 2011). Usage in Piedecuesta has experienced
an important increase (from 26 percent in 2011 to 69 percent in 2012) as the system has recently

                                                                                                 70
expanded to that area, resulting in an important increase in overall ridership. Giron continues to
report the lower number of people who have used the system (16 percent in 2011 and 24 percent
in 2012).

The survey indicates that the population of the Metropolitan Area of Bucaramanga is not yet
completely satisfied with the service offered by the system. The overall satisfaction with the mass
transit system has gone down from 48 percent in 2010 to 46 percent in 2011. The satisfaction of
all survey respondents with respect to the mass transit system was not included as part of the
2012 survey.

At the same time, the perception of the users that carry out most of their trips in Metrolinea is not
satisfactory. The percentage of satisfied users was 38 percent in 2010 (48 percent dissatisfied), 47
percent in 2011 (14 percent dissatisfied) and 19 percent in 2012 (56 percent dissatisfied). This
may be associated with more crowding of buses as ridership increases.

Respondents do not seem to perceive a large difference between the level of service offered by
Metrolinea and that offered by the traditional bus services. The percentage of respondents who
believe that Metrolinea offers a better service than traditional buses and busetas was 19 percent in
2010, 39 percent in 2011 and 23 percent in 2012. The percentage of people who believe that
Metrolinea offers a poorer service when compared with traditional bus services was 37 percent in
2010, 33 percent in 2011 and 54 percent in 2012. The decreasing quality of service perception,
relative to traditional bus services, can be verified across all income groups.

The fact that user satisfaction and perception relative to traditional bus services was first ranked
low in 2010, increased in 2011 and then decreased again in 2012 points to the evolution of system
operations. The system started with low frequency and coverage that were later improved in
2011, leading to higher ridership in 2012, which is calling for adjustments in operations to
increase the quality of service.

When asked about whether mobility situation in the city had improved as a result of the start of
operations of Metrolinea, 63 percent of respondents considered that mobility had worsened,
compared to 53 percent in 2011 and 44 percent in 2010. At the same time, the segment of the
surveyed population that thought that mobility in the metropolitan area had improved as a result
of the roll out of Metrolinea deceased from 26 percent in 2010 to 13 percent in 2012.
Nonetheless, the above results are different according to the income level of respondents.
Segmenting the results by income category shows that the percentage of low income population
(strata 1 and 2) who believes that the overall mobility of the city has improved with Metrolinea
has stayed flat at 15 percent in 2011 and 2012, while the percentage of people in this same
income group who perceives the opposite had decreased from 63 percent in 2010 to 47 percent in
2012. This corroborates the view that private car users (higher income brackets) have a negative
perception of the system due to the priority given to public transport for the use of road
infrastructure.

The 2011 survey included questions aimed at identifying the satisfaction of users with regards to
specific aspects of the Metrolinea system. The aspects with which users were satisfied the most
included: station comfort (55 percent), bus comfort (52 percent), travel times (46 percent),
accessibility for disabled persons (46 percent) and safety in buses and stations (40 percent). On
the other hand, users expressed the most dissatisfaction with: crowding (47 percent), route
coverage (41 percent) and proximity of stations to final destination (35 percent). The latter results
are to be expected as it takes time for people to get used to a new paradigm in mass
transportation.

                                                                                                  71
Cartagena (Transcaribe)

Understandably, given the delays in the implementation of the project, the perception of citizens
regarding Transcaribe is not the best. In the latest survey (2012), 62 percent of respondents
indicated that they are not satisfied with the progress made so far in the construction works and
41 percent believe that the system will not contribute significantly to improve mobility in the city
(34 percent it will improve conditions and 25 percent consider the situation will remain the same).
The largest proportion of people who believe that the system will result in an improvement in
mobility conditions can be found in the historic and northern part of the city (41 percent) and the
lowest in the tourist and “De la Virgen” areas (26 percent).

The perception of citizens regarding Transcaribe as an institution has been eroded since 2009.
The favorable perception of the institution has gone down from 71 percent in 2009 to 34 percent
in 2012, while the percentage of people who value highly the management capacity of the
institution has decreased from 50 percent in 2009 to 24 percent in 2012. Only a quarter of
responded has high confidence in the institution, down from a third in 2011.

On the other hand, the percentage of people satisfied with road conditions in Cartagena has
increased from 8 percent in 2008 to 39 percent in 2012. 71 percent of respondents now report that
access roads to their neighborhoods are paved versus 65 percent in 2008. Road conditions for the
lowest income segment of the population are improving. 35 percent of respondents in the low
income strata (strata 1 and 2) are satisfied with road conditions, an important increase from the 15
percent who indicated the same in 2011.This may have to do with the increase in the percentage
of low income people who report that their access roads are now paved: 62 percent in 2012 versus
52 percent in 2011.

Medellin (Metroplús)

Since the system only started operating in December 2011, the 2012 survey was the first one to
include a specific question relative to the use of Metroplus. According to the survey, 0.4% of
survey respondents use Metroplus as their main mode of transportation for school and work-
related trips. This low participation is a reflection of the fact that Metroplus serves as a feeder to
the metro rail system and that feeder routes to the system are still under development.

According to the survey, due to its integration with the metro rail system, the total impact of the
implementation of Metroplus cannot be looked at in isolation. Considering that the share of the
metro rail system increased slightly to 13.4 percent, in total, close to 14 percent of survey
respondents indicated that they predominantly use either the metro rail or BRT systems for work
or study purposes.

The satisfaction of all surveyed individuals with respect to the mass transit system in Medellin
and Aburra valley has consistently been around 90 percent since 2008. From 2011 to 2012, the
level of satisfaction with the mass transit system fell from 98 percent to 93 percent, but continues
to be the highest of any Colombian city.

Finally, 94 percent of responded considered that Metroplus offered a safe transportation service ,
similar to the safety perceptions regarding the Rail and Cable services, also operated by the Metro
Company.



                                                                                                   72
Pereira (Megabus)

The “Como Vamos” survey has only been conducted in Pereira in 2011 and 2012. In the latest
survey, the perception of citizens regarding mobility conditions in the city seems to have
worsened. Citizens seem to observe more congestion than in the previous year, as indicated by
their perceived travel times for work and school. This may be related to works affecting traffic
flows during the year and corresponds to the perception of users of all modes, not only mass
transit. Nonetheless, according to survey results, the users and level of satisfaction with Megabus
have decreased somewhat.

According to the survey, the modal share of public transport (for work and school related trips)
has decreased by two percentage points from 48 percent in 2011 to 46 percent in 2012. This
decrease was not a result of increased private vehicle (car and motorbike) use, which actually
decreased by two percentage points to 32 percent, but was due to an increase in walking and
bicycle use. The overall share of Megabus went down from 21 percent in 2011 to 14 percent in
2012.

Survey respondents who indicated that Megabus was their main mode of transportation are
generally satisfied with the system. In the 2012 survey, 73 percent of respondents indicated that
they were satisfied and 16 percent expressed they were somewhat satisfied. Only 11 percent of
the people surveyed indicated that they were not satisfied with the system. This represents a
decrease in satisfaction relative to 2011, when 84 percent of users were satisfied, 14 percent
somewhat satisfied and only 2 percent were unsatisfied.

Lastly, although not directly related to the project, the survey also points to decreasing
satisfaction with almost all aspects of city traffic, except for road signaling, traffic lights and the
organization and control of public transport. These are areas in which citizens reported an
increase in satisfaction, but for which for which there continues to be a very high level of
dissatisfaction (at or above 50 percent). It is worth mentioning that the biggest improvement in
perception is related to the level of organization and control of public transport: reduction of 5
percentage points in dissatisfaction.

Citizens also perceive deterioration in the overall condition of the roads in the city and in the
neighborhoods. The level of satisfaction with neighborhood roads has gone down from 76 percent
in 2011 to 63 percent in 2012, while general satisfaction with city roads had decreased from 69
percent to 55 percent.

B. Highlights of the World Bank’s Technical Assistance

As a result of the execution of the World Bank Loans which financed 6 of the 7 Colombian cities
participating in the Colombia NUTP, the MOT can highlight the following benefits derived from
the World Bank technical assistance to public entities involved in the execution of the program:

    1. Pavement Management Manual Handbook

The Project supported the preparation and publishing of a virtual book titled "Pavement
Management Manual" which encompasses experience in design, construction and maintenance of
pavements in each BRT. The manual constitutes the basis for the implementation of an efficient
system of administration of pavements main part of the operating infrastructure of integrated
mass transit systems in the country. The result of this work was sent to the local BRT agencies as
a reference document to identify and make decisions in the event of an alkali-aggregate reaction
in concrete pavement systems. In December 2012, the first version of the maintenance manual
was made widely available.

    2. Visible Works Program

During the execution of the loans, the “visible works program” was implemented by the
government, meeting the following objectives:
    To use the program as a monitoring tool, to ensure transparent and efficient recruitment
        in developing Mass Transit works throughout the country
    To reiterate the interest and the support of the National Government in monitoring mass
        transit projects in the country.
    To present to the public the progress and achievements in infrastructure projects and the
        current vs. the start of operation.
    To address the precise concerns of the community through their spokesmen and address
        them effectively.
    To strengthen the sense of belonging of projects in cities both within the community and
        in the unions.

    3. Specialized Technical Assistance to Local BRT Agencies

A specialized technical assistance program was made available in form of a pool of renowned
experts. The program covered topics such as structuring of technical, legal and financial
concessions, bus operations and fare collection. The program took place during the monitoring
and implementation stages of each BRT. Local BRT agencies also had the support of specialists
in geotechnical, materials and pavements engineering. A specialist experienced in the operational
design and implementation of mass transit systems and other specialists in different areas were
hired by the MOT. Note that this allowed a permanent linkage with project management bodies
and special counseling at different stages of the implementation of each system.

    4. Knowledge Transfer

To promote the exchange of knowledge and experiences, meetings were held regularly with local
BRT agencies to discuss these issues and generate new strategies of solution to the complexities
of projects. During the period of management, execution unit coordinated and participated in the
development of the following activities:

                                                                                               77
       Workshop of experiences for bus operators and their role during the entire process
        leading to the implementation of the system.
       Workshop aimed at having the experience of start of operation in Cali (MIO integrated
        system). This system was not financed by The World Bank. The workshop was attended
        by CEOs and operational managers of implementing agencies.
       In particular they discussed the plan to publicize and promote the system and lessons
        learned and recommendations.
       A system maintenance seminar was conducted, which was aimed that local operational
        managers submit to the other entities, the experiences we have had in maintaining the
        transport system infrastructure (stations and portals), road and public space that has been
        built.

    5. Communications Actions

Listed below are the communications actions that were developed in the framework of the
strategy for the achievement of the objectives indicated, as a support the process for the
implementation of BRTs in Colombia:

       Tour each of the cities where the projects are developed, together the Mayor of each city,
        the observers, contractors, supervisors, unions, community leaders and media. In these
        meetings, a summary of the status of each system is done, including the recognized
        problems and solutions raised by local implementing agencies. It is shown that local and
        national governments are committed to the work within the implementing programs of
        each system. These meetings are part of the "Visible works" program.
       Visits to regional and national media: media rounds were held in all the cities in which
        they are building different systems, like the city of Bogota in the media with national
        coverage. People who give interviews are in charge of the project execution, in
        representation of BRT agency managers and management bodies representing the GoC,
        specifically the Minister and Deputy Minister of Transport.

Through this exercise, achievement of project goals was divulgated to the media in order to
spread the message proposed in the strategy and contextualize the various journalists about reality
and purposes of the BRT.

Meetings with columnists: Meetings were held with columnists in different cities. Through these
meetings columnists were informed of progress of various projects. This is an exercise that is
recommended to develop in all cities where BRT systems were implemented. The final objective
of these meetings was to better inform those in charge of generating opinion in the media.

Media Monitoring: A media monitoring exercise was done to written media, radio, television
and Internet media, on a daily basis, to document the news generated on mass transit.

Media training for managers, spokespersons and communications equipment each BRT:
The objective was to provide tools for better transmission the message to different audiences. It
sought to create a unified message starting from the national government and replicated in
managers in their regions to finally be reinforced through press releases issued by the heads of
communications. It aimed to show mass transit systems as a mega work of national and local
government, and not as independent works.




                                                                                                78
Radio Spots: a project to position around the BRT in national and local media was structured.
The strategy was to play local cribs in every participating city making these in turn in national
cribs.

Identification of issues of importance to public opinion: After performing the media
monitoring and analysis of news, a new briefing in BRT news was produced focused on:
        o Transparency in handling money and procurement processes
        o Compliance in the work schedule.
        o Impact of works on both vehicular and pedestrian mobility of citizens.
        o Works costs and certainty that the resources for the works are insured.
        o Fuel used in the integrated mass transit systems.

In principle, national media were recording negative or decontextualized information that
polarized debate about systems. From the communication strategy implemented and spreading the
message of recognition problems, presenting solutions and work schedules with commitments for
the community, the debate entered an equilibrium process, with an increase in informative or
neutral information and a decrease of the positive and negative stubs.

Annex 10: Project Background

Urban Transport Sector Background

In Colombia, three out of four people in the cities used public transport to carry out their daily
activities. The majority of them was poor and spent a relatively large fraction of their income in
transportation. Despite this, urban infrastructure development had traditionally favored the use of
private vehicles, which used approximately 80 percent of the available roadways, but only
mobilized 25 percent of the people in cities. Bus transportation in Colombian cities operated with
sub-standard quality and operating speeds significantly below those of international benchmarks,
resulting in long travel times, traffic congestion, high incidence of road accidents and elevated
levels of air and noise pollution.

Due to the factors explained above, developing efficient, reliable and affordable transportation
systems was, and still is, a key component of the country’s development agenda. Many
challenges stood in the way of achieving this objective, including an inadequate regulatory
framework and lack of institutional capacity to implement policies in the sector. The existing
regulatory framework for the authorization of bus routes encouraged oversupply because it gave
control of the routes to private intermediaries, whose profit did not depend on optimizing
operations, but on the number of buses affiliated with them. Bus owners paid a fixed rent to the
intermediaries, inducing them to maximize their revenue by fiercely competing for passengers in
what became known as the “penny wars” (“Guerra del Centavo”). Buses operated under a de
facto unregulated system that encouraged competition in the market (for passengers) and not for
the market (for routes). In addition, national and municipal authorities did not have the sufficient
institutional capacity to formulate and implement effective transport planning and traffic
management policies.

The city of Bogota was the first in the Country to embark on the development of a mass transit
system based on Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) technology49, which became known as Transmilenio.
In this system, a competitive bidding process was used to determine the bus operators that have
the right to exploit a route or number of buses. Bus operators in turn needed to acquire and
operate a high capacity and modern bus fleet under the coordination and supervision of a public
implementing agency, which programs and controls service supply with to-the-minute accuracy.
The buses operate on exclusive busways, built by the city government, resulting in higher
operating speeds and better-quality services. By the time of appraisal, this system was already
operating with highly satisfactory results.

The National Urban Transport Program

In order to respond to these challenges and following the successful experience of Transmilenio
system in Bogota, the Government of Colombia (GoC) instituted a National Urban Transport
Program (NUTP). The program established an enabling policy framework for improving urban
transport across the Country and institutionalized its support to the development of similar mass
transit systems in other cities. 50

49
  BRT technology improves travel conditions for passengers because buses have exclusive lanes;
passengers board buses from at-grade stations, and pay their fares upon entering the station.
50
   The legal foundation for NUTP was given by Laws 86 of 1989 and 310 of 1996. However, the NUTP was only
formally launched following the approval of two National Economic and Social Policy Council (CONPES) Documents

                                                                                                           81
The NUTP was created with the purpose of improving the quality of life and increasing
productivity in Colombian cities. This goal depended on the successful implementation of mass
transit systems in large cities (more than 600,000 inhabitants), which in turn contributed to the
achievement of multiple objectives: improving the efficiency and safety of public transport
services; providing reliable access to the poor; enhancing private sector involvement in service
provision; reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions; and encouraging comprehensive
urban development processes. Following the successful experience of Transmilenio in Bogota
and, given the resources available at the national level 51 and the operating requirements in
participating cities, the NUTP opted for BRT as the preferred technology for the development of
mass transit systems. Through the NUTP, the GoC committed to funding up to 70 percent of the
cost of developing BRT infrastructure in the metropolitan areas (MA) of Barranquilla,
Bucaramanga, Medellin and Pereira and the cities of Cartagena, Cali and Soacha.

The NUTP was built upon a partnership between the Central Government and participating cities.
The GoC formalized its commitment through the approval of city-specific economic and social
policy documents (CONPES documents), which detailed the proposed mass transit projects and
the conditions of central government support and served as basis for subsidiary agreements
executed between each municipality and the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (MHCP for its
initials in Spanish). This mechanism earmarked future national budget allocations (“ Vigencias
Futuras”) to be disbursed alongside local counter-party funds against the execution of public
works.

World Bank Support

The World Bank’s engagement with the GoC on urban transport dates back to the mid-nineties.
At this time the Government was pursuing a series of regulatory reforms to promote private
sector participation in infrastructure, and the city of Bogota was laying the groundwork for the
implementation of Transmilenio. By the time of appraisal, the Bank, through the Bogota Urban
Services Project, had supported the development of Transmilenio and assistance scaled up
significantly after the launch of the NUTP in 2002-03. In addition, though the Regulatory Reform
Technical Assistance Loan (P040102), the Bank had previously supported the development of the
NUTP and the conceptual design of several of the BRT systems that were later implemented
through the Project.




issued in 2002 and 2003 (Documents 3167 and 3260), which established the policy and institutional framework for the
program.
51
  Colombian Law 310 of 1996, known as the “metros law”, established the commitment of national
resources to finance urban mass transport systems.

                                                                                                                82
Annex 11. The Integrated Mass Transit Systems Project

The Bank supported the NUTP through the Integrated Mass Transit Systems Project (IMTS)
Project (the “Project”), which was funded by three successive loan operations: the Original Loan
of USD 250 million approved in June 2004 (Loan 7231-CO / P082466); a First Additional Loan
of USD 207 million approved in June 2007 (Loan 7457-CO / P101356); and a Second Additional
Loan of USD 300 million approved in August 2009 (Loan 7739-CO / P114325).

The above-mentioned loans financed a time slice of the NUTP corresponding to 100 percent of
GoC transfers to participating cities (Bogota’s NQS corridor, MA of Barranquilla, MA of
Bucaramanga, Cartagena, MA of Pereira and MA of Medellin-Valle de Aburra) with the purpose
of developing BRT systems.52 These loans also funded institutional strengthening activities both
at the local and national levels in support of the implementation of the NUTP.

Initially, the responsibility for project implementation fell under the National Planning
Department (DNP for its initials in Spanish), which served as the Secretariat of a Technical
Committee made up by the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (MHCP for its initials in
Spanish), in charge of managing resources, and the Ministry of Transport (MOT), in charge of
sector issues. The overall responsibility for project implementation was transferred to MOT in
time for Project Negotiations stage53, once certain conditions were complied with, including the
establishment of an adequately staffed implementation unit. For this purpose, the MOT
established the Integrated Mass Transit Project Coordination Unit (PCU).The PCU at MOT, in
close coordination with DNP and the MHCP, has been responsible for the overall implementation
of the Project at the national level, providing technical support to the NUTP and monitoring and
evaluating program implementation.

At the local level, participating cities established implementing agencies in charge of executing
the civil works and coordinating the operation of the BRT systems. The local implementing
agencies included: Transmetro S.A. (Barranquilla MA), Transmilenio S.A. (Bogota), Metrolinea
S.A. (Bucaramanga MA), Transcaribe S.A. (Cartagena), Metroplus S.A. (Medellin-Valle de
Aburra MA) and Megabus S.A. (Pereira-Dos Quebradas MA). 54 With the exception of Bogota,
these agencies were all created for the purpose of implementing the construction of the
infrastructure and later managing the operation of the system.55

An important innovation was the corporate governance of Implementing Agencies, set up as
Limited Liability Companies with independent boards comprising members of the local and
national governments (MOT, DNP and MHCP initially, and later representatives appointed by the
office of the president).



52
   The Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) supported the development of the BRT system in Cali; and the
Andean Development Corporation (CAF) and Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEP) supported
Transmilenio’s Suba corridor.
53
   Within the World Bank’s project cycle.
54
    In the case of Bogota, the local government relied on a specialized municipal works agency: Urban
Development Institute (IDU) to carry out the construction of the BRT infrastructure, while operation rested
with the implementing agency: Transmilenio S.A.
55
   In Bogotá the Urban Development Institute (IDU) is in charge of the construction of the infrastructure
and Transmilenio S.A. is in charge of the operation of the transport system.

                                                                                                             83
The Original Loan and Additional Financings

The Original Loan supported the implementation of the NUTP in the Metropolitan Areas (MAs)
of Bogota, Cartagena and Pereira and contemplated the inclusion of additional MAs after they
met minimum conditions. The First Additional Loan allowed for the financing of works in
additional MAs that achieved compliance with eligibility requirements, including Barranquilla,
Bucaramanga and Medellin-Valle de Aburra; and covered a financing gap of USD 100 million in
the financing of Bogota’s NQS BRT corridor. The Second Additional Loan funded a scale-up in
the NUTP’s physical scope (in Barranquilla, Bucaramanga, Cartagena and Medellin-Valle de
Aburra), including the expansion of trunk corridors and feeder routes to meet increased demand
and the improvement of associated infrastructure.

Approximately 99 percent of the loan went to the financing of infrastructure works. As it can be
seen in the table below, close to 60 percent of the loans’ proceeds went to the financing of
Transmilenio’s NQS corridor in Bogota.

The Loan Agreement was amended to change the amounts allocated under eligible categories
with the purpose of increasing the allocation for the financing of the NQS corridor in Bogota in
two occasions: October 2010 (first restructuring approved in March 2011) and again in April
2011 (second restructuring approved in December 2011). This change was required to complete
the payment of all transfers associated to that sub-project, as the associated contracts had been
completely executed more than four years before. In 2012, the Loan Agreement was amended
again, first in January (third restructuring approved in March 2012) and then in March (fourth
restructuring approved in April 2012) to extend the closing date of the Second Additional Loan
from March 31, 2012 to August 31, 2012 and to December 31, 2012, respectively. 56 This
extension was requested to give additional time to the PCU to execute a remaining loan balance
of approximately USD 1 million under the Capacity Building Component.



56
  This extension required a Regional Vice-President approved extension beyond the three-year limit for
additional financing loans.

    Project Preparation

    Project’s background analysis was based on previous policy and project design work and on a
    well-thought national policy framework. The Project’s design built on the successful experience
    of the Transmilenio System in Bogota (supported by the Bank’s Bogota Urban Services Project)
    and on the experience gathered by the Bank in other interventions in LAC countries. 57 The
    Project also built on previous analytical work financed by the Regulatory Reform Technical
    Assistance Loan. This Loan financed the feasibility studies for four BRT sub-projects
    (Barranquilla, Cali Cartagena and Pereira), as well as other analytical work that helped establish
    the NUTP policy (CONPES 3093).

    The Project introduced a fundamental change in the urban transport sector and required a strong
    commitment from the GoC and participating cities. The GoC institutionalized a longstanding
    commitment to urban transport reform by instituting the NUTP and by approving long-term
    policy and co-financing agreements for the development of each of the systems included in the
    Project. The NUTP established a roadmap to guide design and implementation.

    The Project is a highly-complex operation because it involved multiple sub-projects (construction
    of BRT systems) in different cities, some of which were relatively small and lacked the sufficient
    institutional and technical capacity to plan and implement mass transit systems. Of the six cities
    covered by the Project, only two (Bogota and Medellin58) had a mass transit system prior to the
    start of Project operations. Also, all cities had strong private traditional bus operators that needed
    to be engaged in the reform process. Finally, projects needed to strike a balance between
    affordability and financial sustainability. The Project design is considered generally satisfactory
    having addressed these realites.



    57
       The Bank partially financed the construction of the first phase of Transmilenio (Loan 4021-CO) and
    supported the second phase of the improvement of feeder roads for the system (Loan 7162-CO). The Bank
    also had experience with the financing of BRT systems in Peru and Chile.
    58
       Medellin has a metro system operating since 1995. The current rail system has two lines and an extension
    of 28 km.

                                                                                                            85
The perceived impact of risks was accurate in the identification of risks “from outputs to
outcomes” and less so in the identification of risks “from component to outputs”. The risks to
achieving the PDO through the delivery of Project outputs included: a substantial risk of
regulatory failures (poor route reorganization and supervision of private operators); and a
moderate risk that high prices and inadequate feeder services limited access for poor populations.
This assessment is consistent with the most significant risks that can actually be verified now in
the form of incomplete route reorganization and inadequate regulation of services and,
potentially, in the negative impacts that charging infrastructure to the user tariff can have on
affordability.

On the other hand, risks precluding the delivery or project outputs included: a high risk of
insufficient political support; a substantial risk that implementing agencies are not able to execute
financing, operation and fare-collection agreements; and a substantial risk that private operators
of traditional services would be unwilling or unable to participate in the Project. None of the
above risks resulted to be as critical for the delivery of outputs as envisioned in the PAD, as most
of the issues in these are related to inadequate project designs leading to construction delays, and
the need to strengthen the operations management capacity at implementing agencies.

Annex 12. Assessment of the Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) System

Design

The National Urban Transport Policy (CONPES Document 3260) entrusted the Technical
Committee with the responsibility of monitoring and evaluating the implementation and
outcomes of the NUTP. According to the original project design, the data collection needed for
M&E would be a shared responsibility of the implementing agencies and the DNP (later MOT).

In 2004, under the Original Loan, a comprehensive results framework was developed to monitor
and evaluate the performance of the Project. As part of the loan covenants applicable to the
Original Loan’s implementation, it was agreed that the Borrower would carry out a study to
determine the impact of the NUTP in terms of improved mobility, increased accessibility by the
poor and institutional capacity; and that a baseline of associated indicators for participating cities
would be constructed no later than six months following the Original Loan effectiveness date
(January 2005). It was also agreed that the Technical Committee and participating cities would
present the results of this study at the mid-term review mentioned above and at project end. In
addition, the subsidiary agreements executed between the MHCP and participating municipalities,
which govern the implementation of mass transit systems, contemplated as part of the obligations
of Implementing Agencies, the establishment of an M&E system and the provision of project
performance information as per the directions of MOT and based on the requirements of the
Bank.

The M&E framework was implemented with some delays relative to the time frame envisaged at
the time of Project design. Initially, with support from the Bank, the Borrower commissioned an
initial study to develop a set of indicators and to establish a baseline for the mass transit systems
in Pereira and Bogota.59 This study was carried out by Steer Davies Gleave (SDG) and completed
in early 2006. This was later complemented with a study that expanded the scope of this task to
all participating cities and also included the development of a web-based system for the reporting
of performance indicators. This follow-up activity, carried out by the same consulting firm, was
commissioned in November 2006 and completed in October 2007. 60 The proposed M&E
Framework consisted of a set of 35 indicators to measure performance in three areas: (i)
performance of local transport; (ii) efficiency and effectiveness; and (iii) impact on the urban
environment.

However, despite the progress achieved in developing a set of indicators and a web-based tool,
the M&E framework was not consistently implemented in the years that followed. The
commitment of Implementing Agencies to periodically report on the performance of the mass
transit systems developed in each city was only formalized in 2009, through Resolution 4147 of
the MOT, in effect since January 1 of 2010. This Resolution created the Urban Transport
Monitoring and Evaluation System (SISETU for its Spanish initials) in the cities that develop
mass transit projects with partial financing from the Central Government. The SISETU was built

upon the set of 35 indicators developed by SDG with Bank support in 2007. The Resolution gave
further legal grounding to the requirement that Implementing Agencies periodically collect and
submit information to monitor performance.

Utilization and Sustainability

A recent evaluation of the SISETU found that despite the technical merit of the indicators, the
number and nature of the performance measures required is not commensurate with the technical
capacity of the entities in charge of collecting the data and calculating the indicators. Only two of
the five systems in operation (Transmilenio and Transmetro) were able to report 100% of the
quarterly information that needed to be submitted to the system in 2010.61 It can be seen that the
implementing agencies with the longest operating histories (Transmilenio, Megabus and
Metrocali) have had a better record in the reporting of M&E indicators.

At the request of the Bank, in February 2013, the MOT carried out an evaluation of the SISETU
that found that the level of compliance of implementing agencies with reporting requirements has
not been satisfactory. Reporting (measured as the number of indicators reported over the total
number of SISETU indicators) averaged 60 percent in 2010, the first year of reporting. With the
exception of Metroplus, which started operations in 2011, the number of indicators reported by
implementing agencies has gone down between 2010 and 2012. Metrolinea did not report any
indicators for the year 2011, while Transmetro only reported 11 percent of the indicators in that
same year. As of February 2013, none of the implementing agencies had reported indicators for
the year 2012. 62The MOT has indicated that the web-based tool is not user friendly and has some
reliability issues, creating an additional hurdle for reporting agencies. The set of indicators and
web-based tool were developed by external consultants, and the PCU never developed the
internal capacity required to maintain the tool and update it based on needs.

The MOT is currently working with Implementing Agencies to facilitate the use of the M&E
system and ensure that indicators are adequately measured and reported on a regular basis. Some
of the measures being contemplated include simplifying the M&E framework by reducing the
number of indicators to be reported so as to make it feasible for Implementing Agencies to
calculate these. The MOT has also clarified responsibilities for the collection of indicators
according to the competencies of different agencies at the municipal level. The MOT expects to
issue a new resolution on this matter, incorporating the feedback received from implementing
agencies, and to improve the web-based tool to make it more effective.

Annex 14. The National Urban Transport Program (NUTP): A Transformational
Project

The Integrated Mass Transit Systems (IMTS) Project and the national policy it supports, the
National Urban Transport Program (NUTP), have shown results that go beyond the infrastructure
interventions. Over the nine years that the Bank has supported the program, Bank teams have
witnessed how the influence of the IMTS Project has surpassed national boundaries to become an
international reference in urban transport transformation. This annex is not the first time that this
transformative impact has been documented nor will it be the last. This annex seeks to highlight
the main transformations that resulted from the NUTP and that have been recognized by
numerous transport-advocacy organizations, NGOs, governments and international experts.


As means of Introduction: The panorama of the urban transport sector in Colombia in 2004

For many years, the streets of large Colombian cities resembled battle grounds. Due to the lack of
adequate regulations, public transportation routes were awarded to private sector companies
which acted as intermediaries, and who would hand over the routes to individual bus owners and
operators. These transport entrepreneurs, acting almost as if they were franchisees, would recruit
drivers to collect profits at any cost. At the same time, drivers were faced with the harsh reality of
urban transport in shifts of 14 or more hours without any working benefits. These shifts included
a fierce competition for passengers while collecting fares, dodging pedestrians, outmaneuvering
competing drivers on the same route, and simply surviving the relentless urban transport war.
Press reports even suggested that at certain points bus drivers would allow thieves to hijack buses
in exchange for a part of their “earnings.” Such is the nature of the infamous “Penny Wars”.

Colombian women and men were used to a polluting transport system, characterized by noise,
filth, fumes and insecurity. These elements painted an image of a dangerous, dirty gray city,
which in the worst sense of the expression could be called a cement jungle. Everyone’s daily trips
were done in this environment. Even if business owners and the government would take care of
their employees’ work environment, it was the city’s environment that required the most
attention. The transport system was also associated with theft, scams and traffic accidents. To be
a user of public transport was at some points a reason of shame, and the collective imaginary of
the experience of using public transport had a widely-spread negative connotation.

The Integrated Mass Transit Systems in the Metropolitan Areas of Barranquilla, Bogota,
Bucaramanga, Cartagena, Medellin and Pereira

The infrastructure of mass transit already forms part of the collective social imagery of most
Colombians. Long buses quietly zooming by the streets alongside the traffic, the imposing
stations with their metallic glow, the pedestrian bridges that emerge like giant tentacles and the
road network that multiplies like a spider’s web are all postcards of life in Colombian cities.
However, behind that impressive material infrastructure hides a human infrastructure that has
made the project a reality and the Integrated Mass Transit Systems, IMTS, a source, not only of
changes, but also of employment.

The IMTS has tackled many challenges, and not only in terms of logistics, infrastructure and
technology. It has also coped with the important issue of knowledge transfer—how to take the
successful experiences to other regions, new urban settings, and to generate local structures or
integrated models for its operation. Since the beginning, the IMTS has put an innovative working
model into practice. Even though the initiative had a prototype in Bogota’s Transmilenio and

                                                                                                   90
some guidelines were set by the National Government, the IMTS modus operandi established that
each city would have control to plan and define their destiny. In order to do so, a legal,
administrative, technical and financial framework was devised and a Project Coordination Unit
was created that together with the World Bank, would work in collaboration with each Local
Authority. Such were the arrangements to take advantage of the massive resources that the State
had allocated to solving urban transportation problems in the principal cities of the country. As
time went by, this initiative gave life to new institutions, new dynamics and authorities. It
established specific operating alternatives for each city—all with a similar, yet unique logic. In
fact, one of the conditions for the municipalities to participate in this National program was to
create autonomous Local Transit Agencies entities to develop the projects. Beyond the mobility
and transportation objectives, the IMTS represents a decentralized and democratic work model
that, in some ways, has managed to transport knowledge and human beings to different
destinations in Colombia.

The IMTS transcends dimensions that are merely operative on the matter of transportation in
order to reflect on other aspects that surround it. The construction of infrastructure like parks,
public bathrooms, roundabouts and bridges has made the transportation network more efficient
and more functional, as well as having an important urban impact. The “city experience” has also
improved for the user, and it has heightened the collective strengths in order to generate a
conscience about the city’s urban and architectural heritage. Thanks to this, the urban scenario
becomes more fertile every day.

Transport as a Social Enabler

Thanks to the arrival of the Integrated Mass Transit Systems, (IMTS) a new bus operating scheme
was proven possible, challenging prejudices and negative images on urban bus systems and
dramatically changing livelihoods for those working in the bus-operating industry. In the
transition from the traditional system to the IMTSs many positive changes were brought to stay.
IMTS have created many quality jobs in cleaning, infrastructure maintenance, ticket sales and bus
operation. It has also allowed bus manufacturers to employ about 1,600 workers for putting
together bodywork and assembling 12 and 18m buses. For women and men driving buses, in
addition to receiving legal social benefits, adequate salaries, and an 8-hour work day, IMTS
drivers are only asked to meet pre-established benchmarks for service quality, safety and speed.
Just as passengers have benefitted from a substantial decrease in traffic accidents and much more
pleasant travel experience, bus operators and route owners have also adjusted to new rules.
Although they now work under a greater degree of regulation and supervision, they have also
found better business opportunities and more respectability. As it tends to happen in times of
peace, those that survived the “Penny War” have found a new life of well-being and tranquility.

        “I was a bus driver for 13 years, but I’ve worked the last five months as a bus operator.
        Before that, my job was very stressful, especially because the work day was very long. I
        complied with the owner’s passenger limit and, and after 310 passengers, the profits
        belonged to me. I made sacrifices to get them. Now, my life has changed 100% because I
        work for three hours, rest for one, and then I continue until I complete eight working
        hours. I have time for myself, my family, to go to the doctor, to study. Also, society now
        views me in a different light, and no longer looks down on me as before. Now I have
        goals set for myself: owning a house and having a well-established family.”
                                                             John Jairo Mina Vidal. Bus Operator

There was also a positive impact to the women and men that participated in the construction of
the system’s structures. To 2009, the construction of infrastructure had generated more than

                                                                                               91
150,000 jobs. A good number of them were given to the unskilled labor force and to individuals
from each region due to a policy that assigns a percentage of the jobs to citizens of areas where
the projects are being constructed.

Transport and Gender


The concept of an integrated system implies that there are various subsystems that follow the
direction of the “mother” system. Oddly enough, the term acquires another connotation when
referring to the IMTS, because it has been particularly eloquent when describing the way it has
addressed the needs of women. Women were especially vulnerable to abuse on the streets—
especially late in the evening. They had to protect their children in the middle of the anarchy of
traffic or deal with the chaos in transportation while pregnant. They have found in the IMTS an
inclusive and, why not, “maternal” project. The network’s security system and its access corridors
provide safer scenarios because they are equipped with proper lighting and restricted access to
improve security conditions. The blue seats inside the buses —for preferential use by pregnant
women— and the areas allocated for baby carriage, complement the mobility experience for
mothers. The System considers women’s’ needs in other ways too. For instance, they have access
to the same employment opportunities as men. This is supported by the fact that the employment
structure of the IMTS includes women holding positions in management, inspection areas, ticket
sales, cleaning vehicles and even driving, which traditionally is associated with men. Also,
women benefit from special considerations in cities like Cali and Bogota where mothers that are
heads of families have priority in being hired for positions in ticket sales. In answering to
women’s’ real needs, the IMTS recognizes their contribution to the Colombian society as women
and as mothers, and because of this, it guarantees dignified, fair and equal treatment. As such,
nothing is more coherent than defining the IMTS as the “mother system” of urban transport in
Colombia.

Transport and Universal Accessibility


The IMTS have all owed citizen access to an unprecedented mobility experience in its cities—an
experience that implies new benefits and new challenges. However, the systems have also
allowed citizen access to new perspectives, many of them related to their individual and
collective identities. One of them is the relationship to people with some form of disability and
their right to participate in public transport. The idea of incorporating this important sector of the
population to the network came up in the first phase of Transmilenio, when ramps, safety
elements and audible mechanisms were included in the system with the idea of satisfying the
particular needs of disabled people. Shortly afterwards, special devices were installed and more
inclusive signposting was erected on the trunk lines. Currently, these lines provide a significant
amount of handicap accessibility elements. In the future, the systems are expected to adapt the
surrounding areas of feeder stops, mimicking the trunk line experience, in order to provide a more
inclusive urban design. Beyond resources such as signposting for the blind, audible signals for the
deaf and ramps for people in wheelchairs, the most important access code in the system is the
code of conduct. This allows people with disabilities to access the world of equality, and
promotes a behavior based on principles of respect and solidarity among users. The IMTS intends
to give access to all people. For this reason, the systems have elements such as station ramps,
access platforms and preferential spaces inside the buses.

        I think we can say that the Bus Rapid Transit, BRT, experience in Colombia has already
        been a vital source of good practice far beyond Latin America. BRT construction around

                                                                                                   92
        the world tends to “look” accessible with its use of ramped platforms and floor-level
        boarding. But looks can be deceiving and the Colombian BRT systems now in operation
        go beyond mere appearance to create systems which can and do set a standard for
        replication elsewhere.

                                                                                    Tom Rickert

        Transmilenio gave me many good things. First of all, it takes me everywhere quickly,
        even though people complain that it’s too crowded. The trip is really fast. Second, there’s
        the comfort of having a guide tell me which bus to take. Third, the bus makes fixed stops
        as part of an itinerary; the other buses would see I was blind and assume I was going to
        get on to sing or beg. They also have elevators that help a lot
                                                                                       Luis Rincon
                                                                        Blind User of Transmilenio

Transport and Environment


The IMTS have developed important initiatives to minimize their negative impact and to generate
the best work and life environment possible for Colombians. On one hand, the systems are
designed to use efficient technologies. In some cases, the Local Transit Agencies have decided to
use cleaner fuels as well. The underlying objective is to use natural resources in more efficient
ways compared to the conventional bus system. This is why the IMTS implement policies such as
converting old buses that do not meet age and environmental efficiency requirements, into scrap
metal. On the other hand, the systems also work on the creation of green areas surrounding the
physical infrastructure and on decreasing the environmental impact of its construction. The
projects consider the environment an integral part of the system and an inseparable part of the
social and logistical dimension of a mass transit system. There is no better way to improve
Colombia’s work environment.

        According to studies conducted by our center of investigation for Urban and Regional
        Sustainability SUR, one of the most effective measures to reduce air pollution in a city
        like Bogota has to do with the organization of its public transport. For example, a couple
        of years ago we measured the breathable particulate matter (PM10) in different city
        streets and discovered that the levels of pollution on a street with a high flow of
        traditional transit vehicles (buses and minibuses) are more than double the levels
        registered on a road that uses mass public transportation (TransMilenio in the case of
        Bogota). This means that, in addition to the implementation of emission control
        technologies and improved fuels, the organization of the buses and mini buses has been
        an essential element in order to improve the city’s air quality.
                                                                                   Eduardo Behrentz

Transport and Advances towards PPP schemes

The experience of the first mass transit networks shows that the stations and the terminals that
house BRT buses constitute virtual engines for progress in the surrounding areas. The current
goal in all the cities is to tap the systems’ development potential in order to generate participation
of the private sector in the projects’ finances. With this in mind, the IMTS has started to develop

                                                                                                   93
bus depots and terminals where the private sector builds the stations, the workshops, the parking
lots and the offices together with commercial projects or housing developments in neighboring
lots. This way, the system is generating property added value, which, in turn, allows
entrepreneurs to invest and capitalize on commercial opportunities. This formula of mixed
investment generates unprecedented opportunities for this kind of infrastructure and, above all, it
allows the motors of the buses to become a driving force for change and progress.


Results beyond the World Bank, beyond Colombia

As of end of 2012, five of the six Bank-financed BRT systems are operating: Transmilenio-
Bogotá, Megabus-Pereira, Transmetro-Barranquilla, Metroplus-Medellin, and Metrolinea-
Bucaramanga. The most famous is Bogotá’s Transmilenio, conceived in 1998, and which served
as a model for the roll-out of the other BRT systems.

More than 20 trust funds have complemented the Bank’s knowledge services agenda. These
multi-year engagements have sought to build the knowledge base of the central government and
of the governments of Bogotá and other cities to, among others, (i) strengthen capacity for
analyzing urban mobility and options to improve planning, management, operations and financial
sustainability of integrated public transport systems, (ii) strengthen capacity for planning and
implementing travel demand management strategies and non-motorized modes, (iii) provide how-
to guidance for the implementation of possibilities to better coordinate land-use with transport
demand and promote transit-oriented development, (iv) assess and revisit tariff policy issues,
particularly pertaining to affordability, accessibility, and how-to guidance for the implementation
of targeted public transport subsidies, and (v) mainstream issues of road safety, gender and
universal accessibility in public transport.

But besides internal recognition to this project within the World Bank (2009 Sustainable
Development Innovation Fair Winner, 2009, Latin America and the Caribbean VPU Awards,
2010) and inspiration to similar operations in other regions of the Bank (Vietnam, China, India),
the IMTS has obtained recognition and acknowledgement in the international field.

The IMTS has become an important point of reference throughout the world. Since
Transmilenio’s inception, delegations from more than 20 countries, including China, India,
Vietnam, South Africa, Kenya, Finland and the United States have visited Colombia to learn
about the program. The technical experience acquired by local experts has deemed them as global
specialists and consultants on the subject who travel throughout the world sharing the Colombian
experience and inverting the north to south transfer of knowledge in favor of a south to north and
south to south experience. This is, consequently, the human infrastructure on which the physical
infrastructure is erected, and this is its contribution: the raw material that supports the Colombian
IMTS.

Colombia’s urban transport program has also received financing from the Inter-American
Development Bank (IADB) and the Andean Development Corporation (CAF). The IADB has
financed the implementation of the BRT-based, integrated transit system in Cali, and the CAF has
financed Bogotá’s Transmilenio Suba corridor and will help implement Cucuta’s system.
Furthermore, the results of the IMTS have also triggered positive changes in the transport
agendas of other multilateral development banks (MDBs), sustainable transport advocacy NGOs
such as ITDP and EMBARQ, governments and academic centers. The contribution of the
Colombia IMTS program to the field of sustainable urban transport has without doubt changed
the landscape of the field for a long time to come.

        Starting in 2001 we have seen a series of excellent Colombian students coming through
        the MST program all of whom have performed very well academically and contributed
        greatly to the success of the MST program itself. To date we have had six students from
        Colombia since 2001 all of whom received their undergraduate education in Colombia
        and were strongly influenced by TransMilenio in deciding to pursue graduate education
        in transportation and applying specifically to MIT to do the MST degree. I have no doubt
        that without the leadership Colombia took through TransMilenio many of these students
        would not have been attracted into the transportation field or come to a first rate US
        Research University such as MIT for their graduate education.

Moving Forward

Challenges remain to consolidate the sustainable urban mobility policy that Colombia embarked
on more than a decade ago. The most pressing concern is the need to move forward with the full
integration of public transport systems, since amidst the new systems, traditional public transport
buses still operate. As cities move towards this full integration of public transport services, issues
of accessibility and affordability become crucial to guarantee that the most vulnerable population
is served. Furthermore, in an era of unprecedented urbanization and motorization, demand
management schemes become crucial policy considerations, so that auto users actually pay for the
costs they impose on society. The Bank will continue to support this agenda by mobilizing its
financial, knowledge, and convening services to work towards more livable, green and inclusive
Colombian cities.
