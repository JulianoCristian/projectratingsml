                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the Project are to: (i) develop quality and sustainable BRTSs in selected medium and large cities to improve mobility along the
                         most strategic mass transit corridors; (ii) improve accessibility for the poor through feeder services and fare integration; (iii) build greater institutional capacity
                         at the national level in order to formulate integrated urban transport policies, and at the local level in order to improve urban transport planning and traffic
                         management.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project keeps progressing well. Civil works are underway in all cities, except Bogota's NQS, which has been completed. 4 Bus Rapid transit (BRT) systems are operating:
                         Bogota NQS, Pereira (PE), Bucaramanga (BU) and Barranquilla (BA). Valle de Aburra (VdA) in the sector of Medellin (ME) is expected to launch operations by 2011 and Cartagena
                         (CA) in 2012.
                          A second additional loan for US$ 300 Million was approved by the Bank in August 4th, 2009. This operation will finance the Government of Colombia (GOC) transfers from

                         2009-2011. After the approval of this new operation, the total amount of Bank support to the National Urban Transport Project (NUTP) is $757 million. A new loan ($ 350 million) will
                         be presented for Board approval on July 21, 2011. The new loan will continue financing the GOC#s transfers for Pereira, Bucaramanga, Cartagena, and Valle de Aburra and will

                         include two new medium sized Sincelejo and Valledupar (Ciudades Amables Sistemas Estrategicos de Transporte Publico). This loan will finance the Government#s transfers to the
                         NUTP between 2011 and 2016.
                         The current loan is almost fully disbursed (99%). The remaining $2.4 million will be used in the TA component. Transfers between the GOC and the municipalities have progressed
                         according to the yearly disbursement program. The GOC has transferred about 59% of his commitments to the NUTP. This flow of transfers is expected to conclude in 2016
                         according to the most recent CONPES documents prepared by National Planning Department (DNP).
                         Construction of BRT trunk lines is well advanced and completion percentages -with respect to the total contracted civil works- vary between 71% (Cartagena) and 100% in (Bogota)
                         NQS, Pereira, Barranquilla and Bucaramanga.
                         The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) is providing key support to the cities in the implementation of the project.
