                         The development objective of the Project are to: (i) develop quality and sustainable BRTSs in selected medium and large cities to improve mobility along the most
                         strategic mass transit corridors; (ii) improve accessibility for the poor through feeder services and fare integration; (iii) build greater institutional capacity at the national
                         level in order to formulate integrated urban transport policies, and at the local level in order to improve urban transport planning and traffic management.

                         Project is coming to its end. Civil works financed by the project are almost finished in all cities. 5 Bus Rapid transit (BRT) systems are operating: Bogota NQS, Pereira (PE),
                         Bucaramanga (BU) Barranquilla (BA) and Medellin (ME). It is expected that Cartagena will start operations in year 2013.
                          A second additional loan for US$ 300 Million was approved by the Bank in August 4th, 2009. This operation will finance the Government of Colombia (GOC) transfers from
                         2009-2011. After the approval of this operation, the total amount of Bank support to the National Urban Transport Project (NUTP) is $757 million. A new loan ($ 350 million) has been
                         presented for Board approval on July 21, 2011. The new loan will continue financing the GOC#s transfers for Bucaramanga, Cartagena and Valle de Aburra and will include two new

                         2011 and 2016.
                         The current loan is almost fully disbursed (99%). The remaining $2.4 million will be used in the TA component. Transfers between the GOC and the municipalities have progressed
                         according to the yearly disbursement program. The GOC has transferred about 80% of his commitments to the NUTP. This flow of transfers is expected to conclude in 2016
