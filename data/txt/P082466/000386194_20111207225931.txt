7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes

This Second Additional Loan focuses on a project scale up. There is no change in the parent project
PDO.

The PDOs of the Integrated Mass Transit Systems Project are to: (i) develop high quality and
sustainable BRTS in Participating Cities to improve mobility along strategic mass transit corridors;
(ii) improve accessibility to public transportation for the poor; and (iii) build greater institutional
capacity in the Borrower’s public transportation institutions in order to formulate integrated urban
transport policies, and to improve urban transport planning and traffic management. The Additional
Financing included the financing of land and resettlement compensation.

2.      The loan was approved on August 4, 2009, signed on September 24, 2009 and
declared effective on December 9, 2009. Implementation of the Project, including
compliance with its loan covenants is satisfactory. There are no outstanding audit
reports. The outcomes and results recorded in the most recent supervision reports are
consistent with the expectations set out in the Project Appraisal Document. The Project
keeps progressing fairly well. Civil works are underway in all cities, except Bogota’s
NQS, which has been completed. Four Bus Rapid transit (BRT) systems are under
operation: Bogota NQS, Pereira (PE), Bucaramanga (BU) and Barranquilla (BA). The
last one is under "early operation" and will start full operation in December. Medellin
(ME) and Cartagena (CA) expect to launch operations by 2011.

3.      This operation will finance the Government of Colombia (GOC) transfers of
2009, 2010 and 2011. After the approval of this new operation, the total amount of Bank
collaboration to the National Urban Transport Project (NUTP) amounts up to US$757
Million. Transfers between the GOC and the municipalities have progressed according to
the yearly disbursement program. The GOC has transferred about 61% of all the program
transfers in the participating cities. This flow of transfers is expected to conclude in 2016
according to the most recent CONPES documents prepared by DNP. This project will
also include the financing of transport projects in three new medium size cities under the
program "Ciudades Amables - Sistemas Estratégicos de Transporte".

4.     As requested by the Borrower, the proposed reallocation is necessary to allocate
US$22.5 million from category 6, Transfers for Parts B.3 (a) & (b); to category 5,
Transfers for Part B.2 and B.4, in order to finance the NQS-Bogota line. As mentioned
before the NQS-line is under operation and works have been completed. According to
the schedule of transfers of the project, the Bogotá subproject will require this amount to
accomplish the Agreement between the Government of Colombia and the city of Bogotá.
The Government has requested this change to address their current budget needs for the
NQS line and to allow for financing of the other activities to take place using other
sources and over time.
