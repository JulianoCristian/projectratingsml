     levels required to meet the unsatisfied demand (currently\n            representing 35 percent of production in Oran and 44 percent\n            in Constantine) and future demand in the areas.  In Oran the\n            project provides for the construction of a new surface water\n            production system, a demineralization plant and the\n            rehabilitation of the existing production facilities.  In\n            Constantine it provides for the construction of new water\n            production works and expansion of the distribution network,\n            collection and treatment of wastewater for refuse in\n            irrigation.  Technical assistance will be provided under the\n            project to the recently established regional water companies\n            to help them streamline their organization, operational\n            procedures and financial systems.  It will also supply water\n            for industrial and commercial development."}, "docdt": "1985-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
