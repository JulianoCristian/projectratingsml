Report describes\n            the preparation, appraisal, and implementation of the\n            National Water Supply and Sewerage Project of Algeria. The\n            main project objective was to increase water production to\n            supplement water supply for the cities of Oran and\n            Constantine, in order to meet current demand and future\n            needs. The project's second objective was to expand and\n            overhaul distribution networks to make production and\n            distribution systems more efficient in those cities. This\n            objective was essential in order to reinforce the\n            distribution capacity so that the additional volumes could\n            reach the target population. The project's third\n            objective was to improve the organization, management, and\n            operation of the regional water companies by furnishing them\n            with equipment and training. The Bank's role has been\n            to help Algeria strengthen its capacity for project planning\n            and implementation and to set up an effective institutional\n            framework while providing support for sector policy\n            formulation. The importance accorded by the Algerian\n            authorities to this vital sector has been demonstrated more\n            than once, and the fact that works under several components\n            included in projects eligible for international financing\n            have been implemented even before the respective loans\n            became effective proves that the authorities are committed\n            to bringing the projects to fruition."}, "docdt": "1995-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
