NATIONAL WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
(LOAN 2591-AL)
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This Project Completion Report describes the preparation, appraisal, and implementation of
the National Water Supply and Sewerage Project, for which Loan 2591-AL in the amount of
US$262 million was approved on June 20, 1985 and signed on March 13, 1986. The loan became
effective on December 12, 1986. It was to have been closed on December 31, 1992; however, the
closing date was extended to December 31, 1993 and again to December 31, 1994 to permit further
payment of foreign expenditures on contracts already signed but expected to be completed only by
the end of 1994. To date, US$251.5 million have been disbursed, leaving a balance US$10.5 in
the loan account, which cannot be closed out until the outstanding balances of the special accounts
are refunded to the Bank.
This report was prepared by the Private Sector Development, Finance and Infrastructure
Division of the Maghreb and Iran Department, Middle East and North Africa Region with the
assistance of Mr. Salah-Eddine Khemissi, an Algerian consultant. It was based on information from
the files of the ECA/MENA Information Center as well as information provided by the Borrower.






DEMOCRATIC AND POPULAR REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA
NATIONAL WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
(LOAN 2591-AL)
PART 1: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
Project Background
1.    The two decades that followed Algeria's independence (1966-1987) saw a population
explosion, with the country posting average demographic growth at one of the highest rates in the
world (3.5%). Natural population growth, in combination with the exodus from the countryside to
the urban centers where most industries and services are located, had given rise to extremely heavy
demand for social infrastructure that was difficult to satisfy in the near term, in particular in the
areas of water supply, transportation, education, and telecommunications. Large metropolises such
as Algiers, Oran, Constantine, and Annaba saw their populations virtually double between 1962 and
1987 by virtue of their administrative, commercial, port, airport, and industrial activities, to reach
1.5, 0.63, 0.44 and 0.3 million inhabitants, respectively.
2.    Up to the 1970s, all Algerian towns were supplied with easily tapped groundwater, except
for several population centers in the Oran region, such as Oran, Tlemcen, and A'in Tamouchent,
which were supplied by means of the Beni Bahdel and Mefrouch dams because local groundwater
resources were insufficient. With the groundwater resources to the north of the country virtually
depleted, a need began to be felt in the early 1970s to use existing dams to supply water to certain
towns and to seek out new sources of surface water to meet household and industrial needs. During
the second half of the 1970s, a major dam construction program was undertaken to meet an ever-
growing demand by the population and by industry and agriculture. By the mid-1980s, annual water
utilization was about 3.4 billion m3, of which 2.54 billion m3 (75%) were used by agriculture, 0.7
billion m3 (21%) for domestic consumption, and 0.14 billion m3 (4%) by industry.
Evaluation of Project Objectives
3.    The main project objective was to increase water production to supplement water supply for
the cities of Oran and Constantine, in order to meet current demand and future needs. This
objective was justified because various national development plans launched since the early 1970s,
particularly in water supply and sewerage, failed to meet the needs generated by this urban
explosion, and unmet demand for potable water in the country's largest cities, with the exception
of Annaba, had risen as high as 50%. The supply of water for the city of Oran and surrounding
areas was essentially guaranteed in 1985 using surface water from the Beni Bahdel dam (82,000
m3/day) and the Fergoug dam (60,000 m3/day), as well as groundwater from the Br6deah Aquifer,
which is of poor quality (with salinity > 4.5 gll), and the Ras El Ain spring, with the latter two
providing 25,000 m3/day and 8,000 m3/day, respectively. The city of Constantine and surrounding
area were supplied solely with groundwater from the Boumerzoug Aquifers (30,000 m3/day). The
daily volume produced until 1985 was barely 55,000 m3/day, and unmet demand for water rose as
high as 50%.



- 2 -
4.    The project's second objective was to expand and overhaul distribution networks to make
production and distribution systems more efficient in those cities. This objective was essential in
order to reinforce the distribution capacity so that the additional volumes could reach the target
population.
5.    The project's third objective was to improve the organization, management, and operation
of the regional water companies by furnishing them with equipment and training. This objective
was justified because the period from 1983 to 1985, when Loans 2461-AL and 2591-AL were being
prepared, was marked by two major events in the restructuring of the water resources sector. The
first of these events, which occurred in 1983, was the creation of 13 regional companies for water
distribution using infrastructure belonging to the National Potable and Industrial Water Distribution
Company (SONADE). These companies were patterned after the Societe de Distribution d'Eau
d'Alger [Algiers Water Distribution Company] (ex-SEDAL, now EPEAL), which was an example
of success coming from close cooperation between the Algerian government and the Bank. The
second event was the creation in 1985 of the Agence Nationale de l'Eau Potable et Industrielle et
de l 'Assainissement [National Water and Sewerage Agency] (AGEP) and the Agence Nationale des
Barrages [National Dam Agency] (ANB). These agencies were created during a restructuring of
the central administration of the Ministry of Water Resources, Environment, and Forests.
Achievement of Project Obiectives
6.    Oran Water Supply. During the past decade, the population of the Oran region has been
subject to very strict water constraints as a result of the ten-year drought that plagued the entire
western area of Algeria during the period. In fact, the lingering effects of the drought on
northwestern Algeria, in particular, have seriously set back the achievement of the main project
objective. In the meantime, to meet demand from its customers, EPEOR has had to resort to water
rationing, turning on the supply for only a few hours one day out of every two, or even one out of
every four. With Bank support, under the Water Supply and Sewerage Rehabilitation Project (Loan
3743-AL), EPEOR is also rigorously carrying out a leak detection and repair program as well as
rehabilitating the aging distribution network in the city of Oran. Moreover, medium- and long-range
plans are being formulated to address this catastrophic situation.  They include, inter alia,
desalination of brackish water in two large coastal lakes and an elaborate inter-basin transfer system
that would transport water from the Chlef plateau down to the coastal cities of Oran, Arzew, and
Mostaganem.
7.    As a result of the drought, it has been impossible to operate the various facilities
continuously at full capacity for any length of time. Nevertheless, on the rare occasions when
conditions were met in terms of both stream flow in the Tafna River and water quality, all facilities
functioned normally. The cumulative volumes of water pumped and treated from the Tafna dam
had reached 46 million m3 by the end of 1994, calculated since the provisional commissioning of
the facilities in 1991. Of this volume, 24.3 million m3 came from the lower Tafna River, and the
rest was released from the Sidi Abdell dam. With an annual average of 11.7 million m3, the system
is currently operating at only 16.7% of its capacity.
8.    Constantine Water Supply. The Constantine region has also undergone several years of
drought and a protracted lack of rain, which has had a considerable influence on the various sources



- 3 -
of water supply for the city of Constantine. Water from the Hamma Bouziane wells has declined
markedly, as have the volumes of water diverted by the Hammam Grouz dam. However, all of the
facilities commissioned in 1987 are functioning normally and have reached their installed capacity.
9.    Constantine Sewerage. Work is still underway on construction of the sewer mains and the
waste water purification plant. It should be possible to assess the system's output by the end of
1996.
10.   Equipment for the Water Companies. The nine regional companies (EPEAL, EPEOR,
EPEA, EPECO, EPES, EPEC, EPEM, EPETI, and EPET) have received a considerable amount
of equipment under Loan 2591-AL, including vehicles, public works equipment, plumbing and
electrician's tools, and maintenance equipment. This has enhanced their operating conditions
considerably, thereby improving public water distribution. The 26 Wilaya water companies have
also benefited from the supply of equipment under Loan 2821-AL. They had lacked basic resources
of this type since their creation in 1987, so provision of the equipment they needed to function,
helped to ensure better water supply and sewerage services.
11.  Institutional Development. The project's institutional objectives have been partially achieved.
Only the organizational and management study of the water supply and sewerage subsector has been
completed successfully, but under the Second National Water Supply and Sewerage Project (Loan
2821-AL). This study set forth proposals for the organization of water supply and sewerage
companies through the redeployment and reorganization of the 35 existing companies into 13
regional companies in the form of etablissements publics a caractere industriel et administratif
[industrial and administrative public establishments] (EPICs) with an eventual change in status to
entreprises publiques economiques [public economic enterprises] (EPEs), and privatization at a final
stage. The study also recommended that the by-laws and mandate of AGEP be modified to make
it more autonomous and to focus mainly on providing technical assistance to public water companies
to improve their technical and financial performance.
12.  It should be noted that EPEOR and EPECO, like the other companies, were subjected during
the course of this organizational study to a detailed diagnostic assessment that led to
recommendations for improvements in management procedures. In addition, at the beginning of
1994, EPEOR created a central division in charge of production and water sales at a tariff of DA
1.50 per m3 to the various EPEOR distribution units. This division took over from the units in
selling water to large-scale consumers. In terms of human resources, EPECO had 886 employees
to serve its 116,831 customers at the end of 1992, i.e. a ratio of 135 customers per employee, a
more or less acceptable figure. EPEOR, however, had 1,762 employees serving 205,680 customers,
hence a ratio of 117 customers per employee, which was insufficient for an enterprise of EPEOR's
size.
Implementation Record and Major Factors Affecting the Project
13.   General. The studies carried out in the early 1980s under Loan 1545-AL for water supply
and sewerage in Constantine, on the one hand, and for water supply for Oran, on the other hand,
served as a basis for the preparation and design of the National Water Supply and Sewerage Project
(Loan 2821-AL) and subsequently for the preparation of tender documents for the works involved.
In 1983, the administration published a notice of prequalification of international companies. This



- 4 -
prequalification served to launch the tender process for construction of the various components of
the Issers-Keddara Production System Project financed under the Algiers Regional Water Supply
Project (Loan 2461-AL). It also covered the Constantine water supply and sewerage project and
the Tafna-Oran conveyance works.
14.   The Oran water production system comprised: (a) construction and equipping of a diversion
dam on the lower Tafna River, a storage reservoir at Djebel Dzioua, and a water pumping and
treatment facility to produce approximately 221,000 m3/day for the Oran area; (b) supply and
installation of a pipeline linking the diversion dam on the lower Tafna River to the pumping,
treatment, and storage facilities in the city of Oran; (c) construction and equipping of a
demineralization plant with a capacity of approximately 400 I/s; and (d) overhaul of the Beni Bahdel
and Fergoug production systems. The companies that took part in the civil engineering work and
the supply and installation of equipment for the Tafna-Oran system were selected on the basis of
limited bidding following prequalification of some 20 foreign firms. As in the case of water supply
for Algiers, the bidders were able to bid either on all five lots comprising the project (diversion
dam, pumping station, pipeline, Dzioua dry-season reservoir, and pretreatment and treatment
stations), on the first four lots, or on the lot comprising pretreatment and treatment of water from
the Tafna. After examining the bids, the administration opted to award a contract combining the
first four lots, and leaving the civil engineering for the pretreatment and treatment projects to be
covered by an addition to the contract to be awarded for the supply and installation of equipment
for treatment of water from the Tafna. The contract to supply water pipelines was awarded to a
local firm.
15.   After the work had commenced in late 1985, and as progress was being made on the
implementation studies and the additional soil sampling programs at the work sites, it became
apparent that a review of the initial design of some of the works was needed. Accordingly, the
method for sealing the Dzioua dry-season reservoir, which had been selected at the time when the
detailed preli minary design was prepared (using a protected polyethylene membrane), was abandoned
in favor of a seal using a natural material - clay - that is readily available in the region. This
change was dictated by the significant settling differentials, on the order of two to three meters, that
could occur when the reservoir was filled. The diversion dam design was reconsidered because it
called for costly additional work, in particular protection walls along a considerable stretch of the
river banks downstream, and construction of a stilling basin. The design was abandoned in favor
of a lateral diversion dam located about 500 m upstream from the site of the original diversion dam.
A change was made in the site of the pretreatment facility and the pumping station, since the site
chosen in the original detailed design was located in a flood plain. Also, given the installed capacity
of the pumping station (13 MW), a 60-KV high-tension power line had to be brought in from the
Remchi station 30 km away, which had not been planned for in the design. These unexpected
changes in design translated into considerable delays in implementation and increased the cost of the
project. The use of a local company under a subcontract to lay 70 km of pipeline linking the Dzioua
reservoir to the two target reservoirs brought about significant delays in acceptance. The works,
which were to have been finished in 1990, were not completed until the end of 1994.
16.   The Constantine water production system comprised: (a) construction of water collection,
treatment and conveyance facilities for water from the Rhumel River and groundwater from Hamma
Bouziane to produce 80,000 m3/day of potable water for the Constantine area; (b) installation of
pipelines to expand and upgrade the primary water distribution network in the city of Constantine;



- 5 -
and (c) laying of pipelines to collect and treat waste water from Constantine to be reused for
agriculture.  This project also saw significant delays during its startup in 1984 and during
implementation. Two years after the tender process had begun following the prequalification of
companies, no contract had yet been awarded. In 1986, the administration decided to divide the
project into two subprojects: water supply and sewerage. The Constantine water supply was
supplemented with the use of water from the Hamma Bouziane spring and the Hammam Grouz dam.
To extract water from the Hamma Bouziane spring, three wells were dug by a local company in
1986, producing a total artesian output of 200 I/s. International Competitive Bidding (ICB) was
launched for the supply of cast-iron pipe to convey water from the aquifer and the dam, and a
contract was awarded to a local firm to lay the pipe after a limited call for quotations. The pipe was
supplied and laid within the contractual deadlines. A contract was awarded to a foreign firm
through limited international bidding (LIB), and completed on schedule, for the supply and
installation of equipment for the Touifez and El-Bir pumping stations. This to improved the
Constantine water supply by adding 12,000 m3/day. Contracts for the stations to treat the water
from the dam, to decarbonate the water from the Hamma Bouziane spring, and to treat waste water
were awarded to a single foreign firm following ICB in 1987. The water treatment station, which
has a nominal capacity of 48,000 m3/day, has posted an average daily production of 25,000 m3 since
it was commissioned in early 1989. The Hamma water decarbonation plant, however, has not yet
been set up for lack of a site.
17.   The implementation of the Constantine sewerage works has also encountered obstacles since
its startup. The package of tender documents for ICB prepared by AGEP in 1987 for the
construction of 52 km of primary sewer mains and the civil engineering for the purification plant
had been drawn up on the basis of a preliminary design, the actual detailed design being included
as one stage in the work to be done by the company selected to carry out the project. Once the
detailed design had been finalized by the company selected for the project, the scope of the work
defined in the specifications was expanded, since the administration had extended the area of the
water supply study to urbanized areas not included in the original study. Variations in quantities,
and sometimes in the nature of the services, led to several reappraisals, and a local company was
called upon to carry out part of the work. By the end of 1994, the closing date of Loan 2591-AL,
overall progress on the sewerage project was only 50%.
18.   Technical assistance and the provision of equipment comprised: (a) preparation of financial
and management studies on regional water companies and organization of a training program for
water company staff; (b) supply of operating equipment, including general and individual water
meters for the regional water companies; and (c) preparation of feasibility studies for water supply
and sewerage projects to meet demand for water in urban areas. The component involving training
of water company staff was not used to best advantage, and finally only 30 persons were trained,
half of them from EPEOR and EPECO. The training took place at a specialized water utility center
in Toulouse, France, under a UNDP/ILO project. In addition, AGEP has organized several
seminars and workshops on management, accounting, and commercial aspects as well as customer
service and human resources.
19.   The nine regional companies created when the water supply and sewerage sector was
restructured in 1987 benefited from the ensuing equipment procurement in 1988. All-terrain
vehicles, public works, maintenance and transportation equipment, and plumbing and electrical tools
were purchased for a total of US$10.2 million and the other Wilaya companies benefited from



- 6 -
procurement of largely similar equipment, valued at US$24.5 million under Loan 2821-AL.
Moreover, the 35 firms' stock of meters was supplemented in 1989-90 by the purchase of a large
amount of individual and general meters.
20.   The remaining project components, i.e., construction of a demineralization plant for water
from Bredeah and rehabilitation of existing water production facilities at Oran, have not been carried
out as planned. The plant has not in fact been built and only a part of the rehabilitation work has
been done.
21.   Consulting engineers to supervise the project works were engaged as follows: (a) for the
Tafna Oran project components, supervision was done by an international firm of consulting
engineers; (b) supervision of civil engineering for the pretreatment and treatment plants was
delegated to an engineer from the firm entrusted with the supply and installation of the equipment;
and (c) supervision of the Constantine water supply and sewerage works was done by Algerian
engineers and technical assistance engineers. All consultants carried out their responsibilities in a
fully satisfactory manner.
Project Sustainabilitv
22.   Although the Tafna-Oran pipeline has not yielded the expected results given the several
consecutive years of drought that have affected western Algeria, once the normal hydrological cycle
has been restored, its operation will contribute to improving water supply for the population centers
of Tlemcen and Ain Temouchent in the Oran region.  Proper maintenance of all the water
production systems serving the Oran region, together with rehabilitation of distribution networks,
reduction of losses due to leaks, and systematic consumer metering are essential prerequisites for
guaranteeing the region's water supply over the long term. EPEOR and the local hydraulic agencies
(DHWs) must make every effort to derive maximum benefit from the project to rehabilitate the
water supply and sewerage systems (Loan 3743-AL), since 50% of the cost of the system
rehabilitation component is accounted for by Oran, Tlemcen, Ain Temouchent, and Mascara. The
sustainability of the potable water supply for Constantine is contingent, as elsewhere, on ensuring
proper maintenance of water infrastructure, constant leak detection and repair, and systematic
metering.
23.   Progress is being made in carrying out institutional reforms in the urban water supply
subsector aimed at providing a framework for programming investments at the national level,
improving the operational efficiency of water utilities, expanding services to urban and industrial
consumers, and setting tariffs high enough to achieve full cost recovery. Rates for domestic and
industrial consumption remain below the economic cost of providing those services, averaging
US$0.20 per m3 for domestic and industrial consumption, compared with the long-run marginal cost
of additional water estimated at US$0.52 per m3. Through the supervision of ongoing projects and
preparation of a planned natural resources management project, the Bank has intensified its dialogue
with the Government by advising on steps to be taken to restructure tariffs and arrive at the eventual
privatization of water utilities. This process has already begun with the formulation and signing of
concessionary agreements between the Government and the two of the best-managed utilities: EPEA
(Annaba) and EPEOR. By mid-1997, it is envisaged that similar agreements will be signed between
the Government and EPECO, as well as the other remaining regional utilities.

Bank Perfornance
24.   The Bank's role has been to help Algeria strengthen its capacity for project planning and
implementation and to set up an effective institutional framework while providing support for sector
policy formulation. Since the first Bank loan in 1978, one of the main objectives has been to
reinforce the sector's institutions. This objective has been addressed on two fronts. First of all,
improved policies on tariffs, water conservation, and water rights have been proposed by the Bank.
The first increase in water tariffs since the country's independence was approved under the first
project financed by the Bank. Further tariff increases followed, with the two most recent being a
doubling of tariffs in 1993 and a 33% increase in 1994. Moreover, the Government is committed
to the application of regional tariffs reflecting the actual cost of water beginning in 1997. The new
tariff policy, along with significant autonomy in sector management and better consumer services,
are the essential features of the new Water Supply and Sewerage Rehabilitation Project (Loan 3743-
AL). At the same time as the change in policy, the Bank proposed a reform of sector organization.
With the first loan, the Bank sought to create regional water companies.
Borrower's Performance
25.   From 1970 to 1993, Algeria invested the equivalent of US$16.5 billion - an average of
1.8% of GDP - in the development of water supply and sewerage infrastructure. The importance
accorded by the Algerian authorities to this vital sector has been demonstrated more than once, and
the fact that works under several components included in projects eligible for international financing
have been implemented even before the respective loans became effective proves that the authorities
are committed to bringing the projects to fruition. The construction of the Keddara dam to supply
water to Algiers and work on the Tafna pipeline, which commenced respectively two years and one
year before Loans 2461-AL and 2591-AL were approved, are a good illustration of that
commitment. Except for the Constantine water supply component of the project, which was carried
out on schedule, the remaining components incurred major delays in implementation. These delays
were essentially attributable to the shortcomings found at the detailed design level at the time of
implementation of the works, which led to reconsideration of the design of certain items, such as
the Tafna dam and the seal for the Dzioua reservoir. As to the delays incurred in implementation
of the Constantine sewerage component, they were attributable to a total lack of detailed designs,
tenders having been issued on the basis of preliminary designs. Nevertheless, the supervision of
project implementation was quite well done by the AGEP staff responsible for the project.
Assessment of Outcome
26.   Final Project Cost. The basic project components, i.e., the conveyance of water from Tafna
to Oran and sewerage for Constantine, have undergone major design modifications involving
considerable variations in the quantities of work to be done and considerable delays in
implementation. Table 6A shows the differences between the costs estimated at the time of the
appraisal and the actual costs as of the end of 1994. These differences reflect cost overruns on the
order of 60%, 30%, and 71% as compared with the original costs established for the Oran
conveyance, Constantine water supply, and Constantine sewerage components, respectively.
Exchange rate fluctuations beginning in early 1988 severely eroded the value of the local currency.
The exchange rate in relation to the dollar, which remained relatively stable during the years from
1985 to 1987, rose quite rapidly from DA 5 per US$1 in 1988 to DA 42 per US$1 by the end of



- 8 -
1994. The overruns and slippage in schedules could have been avoided if the water supply studies
had been conducted properly and, above all, monitored by the administration.
27.   Financial Performance. The base tariff and the structure of water and sewerage prices set
by the 1985 decree have not changed since 1992. The fact that water tariffs have not been raised
for the entire period has often led to operating ratios in excess of 1. The tariff increases applied
in early 1994 are now allowing the companies to cover their operating costs. The tariff increases
supposed to enable the two companies to improve their financial capacity and to finance new
investments at a rate of 10% (EPECO) and 15% (EPEOR), respectively, were not introduced during
project implementation. Except for covering operating expenses, the tariff structure of current water
prices does not allow the companies to cover finance charges on the debt service or to make the
payments due to the Algerian Treasury for repayment of Loan 2591-AL. The objectives set under
the water supply and sewerage project (Loan 2501-AL) with respect to transferring and converting
the assets upon completion of the water supply and sewerage works for the Oran and Constantine
systems, together with the related indebtedness, were not met as agreed during the loan negotiations.
28.   Comparison of the financial projections made during project appraisal with the actual
financial statements for the 1986-1992 period reveals some major disparities, owing mainly to: (a)
higher than expected local inflation (an average of 6% was projected for the period, whereas it
reached 24% in 1992); (b) the failure to transfer assets and indebtedness relating to the facilities to
EPEOR and EPECO upon completion; and (c) higher operating costs, particularly for personnel.
The two companies posted losses for the 1986-1992 period and their net worth declined markedly,
becoming negative for EPECO and to a fifth of the 1986 figure for EPEOR in 1992.
29.   Economic Justification. Meeting the potable water needs of the populations of Oran and
Constantine and improving conditions for collecting and treating waste water produced by
Constantine and its partial reuse for agriculture were the only justifications for the project. The
benefits anticipated in terms of improved hygiene and public health and protection of the
environment cannot be quantified. However, in view of the continuing severe scarcity of water
resources in the Oran region, the project's overall rate of return is negative.
30.   Environmental Impact.  The works comprising the Tafna-Oran conveyance system are
integrated perfectly with their immediate environment. The design of the lateral diversion dam on
the Tafna River and the judicial selection of its site deserve to be cited as examples of how to
preserve the essential nature of a watercourse. The Dzioua dry-seasonal reservoir, which extends
over 60 hectares at the site of an old crater, offers an attractive view. The Constantine sewerage
component serves to improve and protect the environment of the city and of the Rhumel
watercourse, which crosses it.
Future Operation
31.   A large-scale operation is planned for FY97.  Its objective will be to set up an
organizational, as well as political and legal, framework necessary for an integrated and systematic
approach to the management of natural resources in each region. The policy content will focus on
efforts to strengthen the country's capacity to formulate a national water policy, plan for water
resource development and waste water reuse, and respond in a timely manner to critical sector
issues. Bank intervention will not only assist in formulating administrative procedures for sector

management but also enhance interaction among the three ministries charged with the development
and management of natural resources: Equipment, Agriculture, and Interior. As an important step
toward a more integrated management of the land and water resources, it is envisaged that
institutions in each hydrographic region would be set up, as autonomous entities, to plan and
supervise the exploitation of the region's natural resources and address the needs of its ecosystems
while promoting the sustainable development of water resources, including waste water reuse, the
forests, and the land.
Lessons Learned
32.   The Bank should not make loans on the basis of project summaries. The details of project
design as well as bidding documents should be available at the time of appraisal, and procurement
should be already underway by the time of loan approval. Contracts for civil works and the related
supply of equipment should be awarded to a single contractor who would be responsible for the
implementation of the entire works. Project implementation experience shows that coordination
between the civil works contractor and the supplier of equipment is both difficult and time-
consuming.
33.   The Bank should avoid the kind of system whereby the water companies were to have
reimbursed the Government for works financed under this loan. Whenever possible, it should insist
on making direct loans to public enterprises. In the case of the Water Supply and Sewerage
Rehabilitation Project (Loan 3743-AL), concessionary arrangements have been introduced whereby
the Government retains ownership of the project-financed installations and the beneficiaries pay a
semi-annual leasing fee based on the operational life and replacement value of the installations,
which obviates the need for subsidiary loans to achieve cost recovery objectives.

DEMOCRATIC AND POPULAR REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA
NATIONAL WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
(LOAN 2591-AL)
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
JUNE 26, 1995
BORROWER'S COMMENTS
1)    OBSERVATIONS
The first observation concerns the presentation of the report. The report would have
benefitted from a summary listing all the chapters contained in the report.
Furthermore, the tables mentioned on page 9 showing the financial gaps between projected
and actual costs are not attached to the document.
Finally, the procedures for withdrawal of loan funds are not dealt with in the report. A
comment on this subject is included in the conclusion of the present report.
II)  COMMENTS ON THE PROJECT COMPONENTS
In general, the report retraces faithfully the implementation process of the loan 2591-AL.
However, we would like to give specifics regarding the Tafna project.
In fact, as far as the bidding documents are concerned, four lots had been presented to the
bidders and not five as indicated in the Bank's report.
These lots were as follows:
*     Lot 1: Diversion dam on the lower Tafna River
Pumping Station
Supply of equipment for pre-treatment
*     Lot 2:  100 km steel pipeline and storage reservoirs
*     Lot 3:  Sealing of the Djebel-Dzioua reservoir
*     Lot 4:  Treatment Station at Djebel-Dzioua.



Emphasis should have been put on the disadvantages and the negative effects caused by
imposing subcontracting on the Constantine and Tafna projects.
Furthermore, the components aimed at the improvement of the performance of water
production enterprises of Constantine and in Oran have not been discussed.
III) CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The conclusions and lessons learned (Loan 2591-AL) are numerous and very useful. They
related to the timetable of the studies, the financial performance of the loan (disbursements and
percentages of financing), and finally, the institutional arrangements.
Delays and cost overruns recorded in the Tafna project were essentially the results of
numerous modifications of the detailed preliminary plan.
The subcontracting of some works to a national enterprise increased delays in the timetable
and led to a dispute with the contractor.
The Bank should not have accepted this method, which is, in fact, contradictory to its
procurement guidelines.
The Constantine project reflects the fact it had been launched based on a brief preliminary
plan.
Whereas the water supply works were executed in a satisfactory manner, this was not the
case for the sewerage works.
In fact, when the final detailed preliminary plan was received by the Administration, the
list of works to be executed became much longer than initially set.
In addition to the sub-contracting, this aspect led to cost overruns and important delays.
For this project, the Bank should not have accepted this course of action.
The disbursement procedures caused delays in the payments of subcontracting enterprises.
It took several months for some letters of credit to be opened.
Whereas the seminar organized by the Bank and AGEP in Algiers at the end of June 1994
was very useful, its organization could have been improved by the parties involved (IBRD, BAD,
BADR, Central Bank of Algeria).
From an institutional standpoint, subsidiary loan agreements signed by EPEOR and EPECO
have somehow harmed the relations with some authorities.



In effect, according to Algerian Law (Constitution, State Law, Water Code), the State
provided the new installations as a grant. In case of the Constantine and Tafna Projects, the
installations, on completion, have been allocated to EPECO and EPEOR respectively for
operational use.
Since these two enterprises are committed to reimbursing the costs of the installations, they
reserve the right to claim the ownership.
Therefore, accounting figures in some of these enterprises' financial statements show an
imbalance that may lead to erroneous analyses.
We will not end without pointing out the problems with customs duties to be paid for by
the project institutions for the acquisition of imported equipment financed by Bank loans.
Provisions should be introduced in loan agreements exempting these beneficiaries from
payment of customs duties.
