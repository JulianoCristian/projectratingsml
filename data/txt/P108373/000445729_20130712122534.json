were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory; risk to development\n            outcome was high; bank performance was satisfactory; and\n            borrower performance also satisfactory. Some of the lessons\n            learned included: fast disbursing operation financing only\n            recurrent expenditures without any conditionality, reform\n            requirements, or an explicit capacity building component is\n            an efficient and effective vehicle for responding to\n            emergency and crisis situations. The success of the ESSP III\n            is primarily due to the fact that it was aligned with the\n            Palestinian Authority (PA's) strategy to help prevent a\n            collapse in social service delivery. Even in weak capacity\n            environments, it is possible to have good Monitoring and\n            Evaluation (M&E) systems. Introducing reforms such as\n            the contracting for tertiary services under an emergency\n            type operation, there is a need to assess capacity issues as\n            well as the feasibility of the contracting mechanism used.\n            Close supervision and flexibility to respond to urgent needs\n            and changing requirements through additional financings are\n            important to ensure that the program remains responsive to\n            the emergency situation. The Bank can mitigate risks for its\n            programs by having the external auditor carry out spot\n            checks of expenses and all supporting documents every\n            quarter. And the ESSP approach of providing targeted\n            emergency budget support is more effective in ensuring that\n            essential services continue to receive their share of scarce\n            resources when compared to the alternative approach of\n            providing general budget support."}, "docdt": "2013-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
