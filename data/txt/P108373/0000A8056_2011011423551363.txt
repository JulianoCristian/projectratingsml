                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Emergency Services Support Program is one of the most successful funding mechanisms in channeling emergency funds under very critical circumstances. Budgetary support
                         provided by the Emergency Services Support Program sustained essential services in the key sectors of education, health and social welfare. The project is doing remarkably well,
                         taking into account the Gaza situation as education, health, and social services continue to operate around the same levels as the 2007 baselines. Assistance through the Emergency

                         Services Support Program also remains steady for support to vulnerable groups (women, youth, and disabled). Based on the available information, the same number of public
                         schools continue to operate. Since effectiveness, the project has been rated satisfactory for implementation performance and for achievement of project development objectives.

                         Compliance with the legal covenants has also been satisfactory.

                         Given the unsettled situation in West Bank and Gaza, the Palestinian Authority is quite keen to keep this emergency funding mechanism fully operational, should a further crisis arise.
                         Furthermore, the Palestinian Authority deems the Emergency Services Support Program a Palestinian mechanism that enables the Palestinian Authority to show its commitment and
                         support by providing much needed financing to maintain social and other critical services during crisis situations.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The most significant accomplishment is that the ESSP structure and mechanism are now considered as a Palestinian administered mechanism that can be scaled up or downwards
                         to fund non-salary recurrent expenditures for social sector ministries that ensures that key public services are not disrupted and benefit to a large extent the poorer segments of the
                         Palestinian population, that don't have money to seek private health care or send their children to private schools.

                         The original $10m grant and the first $5 additional financing have been fully disbursed and will be closed by December 31, 2010. The designated account will be fully recovered over
                         the four months grace period (April 2011).

                         A second additional financing in the amount of USD 3 million was approved by the Board on October 21, 2010. The Grant Agreement was signed with the PA on November 11 2010
                         and was declared effective on December 1, 2010. The PA will use those funds to respond to emergency needs especially for fuel and other emergency needs in Gaza, as the
                         situation continues to be fragile.
