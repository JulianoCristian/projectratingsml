                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Implementation progress under the Third Emergency Services Support Project (ESSP III) has been satisfactory and the project is on track to achieve its development objectives by
                         the project closing date. Original financing for ESSP III in 2008 totaled US$10 million which was followed by two additional financings in the amounts of US$5 million and US$3
                         million in 2009 and 2010, respectively. In total, US$18 million was provided by the Bank to the PA in order to provide the Palestinian population with essential services.

                         Both the original grant and the first additional financing grant closed on December 31, 2010. Since then only the second additional financing grant has been under implementation.

                         Overall, the assistance provided through the ESSP III prevented deterioration of education, health and social services in West Bank and Gaza. Targets have basically been met. At
                         the conclusion of the project, facilities continued to operate at the same or higher levels than the 2007 baselines. In terms of health services, the project allowed for continued

                         services such as cleaning contracts, rent, water and electricity, fuel, communications and maintenance. Through the Ministry of Health (MoH), the project has also provided fuel for
                         hospitals in West Bank and Gaza (WBG) as well as emergency and medical services vehicles. Through the Ministry of Education and Higher Education (MoEHE), the project has
                         been covering operating costs and universities academic staff salaries and through MoSA, the project has been covering operating costs including those for rehabilitation and
                         vocational training centers. The Project is financing approximately 11% of recurrent non-medical budget expenditures of the MoH, 8% of the recurrent budget expenditures for the
                         MoEHE and 32% of the recurrent budget expenditures of the Ministry of Social Affairs (MoSA) The Palestinian Authority (PA) is keen to keep this emergency mechanism fully
                         operational, should a further crisis arise.

                         As of May 10, 2012, a total of US$2.98 million (99.5%) was fully disbursed, whereas the remaining balance (approximately $0.02m) is fully committed and is expected to be fully
                         disbursed by end of June 2012.

                         This project was running in parallel with the Emergency Services Support Project (ESSP) Multi Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) which closed in June 2011. Since the two trust funds are
                         financing the same components and have a similar developmental objective, the ESSP MDTF Implementation Completion Report (ICR) which was delivered in December 2011, has
                         provided important insights into the upcoming evaluation for the ongoing ESSP III.
