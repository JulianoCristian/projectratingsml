                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Implementation progress under the Third Emergency Services Support Project (ESSP III) has been satisfactory and the project has achieved its development objectives. Original
                         financing for ESSP III in 2008 totaled US$10 million which was followed by two additional financings in the amounts of US$5 million and US$3 million in 2009 and 2010, respectively.
                         In total, US$18 million was provided by the Bank to the Palestinian Authority (PA) in order to provide the Palestinian population with essential services.

                         June 30, 2011. The IEG review of the ESSP MDTF ICR highlighted that the project objectives were relevant, reflecting the emergency nature of the situation in which the Government
                         was experiencing a serious fiscal crisis, and that the design was appropriate. It also concluded that the objective of mitigating the deterioration of basic services was achieved
                         pointing to the project's substantial achievement of targeted outcomes in the education, health, and social assistance sectors. The IEG review of the ESSP MDTF ICR provides
                         important insights into the evaluation of the ESSP III.

                         Assistance provided through the ESSP III has prevented deterioration of education, health and social services in the Palestinian Territories. Targets have been met. At the conclusion
                         of the project, facilities continued to operate at the same or higher levels than the 2007 baselines, as follows: (a) The number of public primary schools operating (1,192) is 23 percent
                         higher than the 2007 baseline (972), and the number of students (623,380) is 81 percent higher than the 2007 baseline (345,250). In nine universities, the number of academic staff
                         supported by the Project (3,311) is 3 percent higher than the 2010 baseline (3,209), and the number of students 2012 (136,070) is 10 percent higher than the 2010 baseline
                         (123,429). (b) Regarding the utilization rates of the two hospitals (the Shefa and Rafedia Hospitals), actual values for overall occupancy and gynecology occupancy equal or exceed
                         the 2007 baseline values. Regarding the number of outpatients, there is an increase of 37 percent for the Rafedia hospital, but a decrease of 19 percent for the Shefa hospital. The
                         decrease for the Shefa hospital is due to the fact that there were not enough funds to take care of outpatients.(c) Regarding the social services provided by MOSA facilities, there
                         have also been increases in the number of beneficiaries compared to September 2007. For instance, there was a modest, 6 percent increase for the number of disabled beneficiaries,
                         a noteworthy, 23 percent increase for the number of students in training centers, and a very substantial 230 percent increase for the number of youths in youth centers.

                         The ESSP MDTF and the ESSP III supported about 70% of operating costs of the recipient entities. Through support to the Ministry of Health (MoH), the project has been covering
                         various costs such as cleaning contracts, rent, water and electricity, fuel, communications and maintenance. It has been providing fuel for hospitals in the Palestinian Territories as
                         well as for emergency and medical services vehicles. Through the Ministry of Education and Higher Education (MoEHE), the project has been covering operating costs and the
                         salaries of universities' academic staff who are not civil servants. Through the Ministry of Social Affairs (MoSA), the project has been covering operating costs of rehabilitation and
                         vocational training centers benefiting vulnerable populations and youths. The Project has been financing approximately 11% of recurrent non-medical budget expenditures of the
                         MoH, 8% of the recurrent budget expenditures for the MoEHE and 32% of the recurrent budget expenditures of MoSA The Palestinian Authority (PA) was keen to keep this
                         emergency mechanism fully operational in order to be able to respond quickly to crises.
