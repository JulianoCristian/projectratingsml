                         Implementation progress is satisfactory and the project is on track to achieve its development objectives. In relation to the provision of health services, the project allowed for

                         Rafedia in Nablus) are at 72%. In education, a total of 1159 schools are operating. With regard to social protection, the 13 centers of the Ministry of Social Affairs continued to operate

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The original US$10million grant and the first US$5 million additional financing have been fully disbursed and closed in December 31 2010.

                         A second additional financing in the amount of US$3 million was approved by the Board on October 21, 2010. The Grant Agreement was signed with the Palestinian Authority (PA)
                         on November 11 2010 and was declared effective on December 1, 2010. The second additional financing is now fully operational and project implementation continues to proceed
                         smoothly and remains on track. As one of its priorities, the PA will use the available funds to respond to emergency needs especially for fuel and any other emerging needs in Gaza,
                         as the situation continues to be fragile.
