                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Implementation progress is satisfactory and the project is on track to achieve its development objectives. In relation to the provision of health services, the project allowed for
                         continued services such as cleaning contracts, rent, water and electricity, fuel, communications and maintenance. The average occupancy rates for the two main hospitals (Shifa in
                         Gaza and Rafedia in Nablus) are at 73.8%. In education, a total of 1192 schools are operating. With regard to social protection, the 13 centers of the Ministry of Social Affairs

                         this emergency mechanism fully operational, should a further crisis arise.

                         It is also important to note that this project was running in parallel with the Emergency Services Support Project (ESSP) Multi Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) which closed in June 2011.
                         Since the two trust funds are financing the same components and have a similar developmental objective, the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) which is currently being
                         prepared for the MDTF, will help provide insights to the upcoming evaluation for the ongoing ESSPIII Additional Finance. Any recommendation emerging from the MDTF ICR will be
                         taken into consideration as an area for improvement under ESSP III.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The original US$10 million grant and the first US$5 million additional financing have been fully disbursed and closed on December 31 2010.

                         A second additional financing in the amount of US$3 million was approved by the Board on October 21, 2010. The Grant Agreement was signed with the PA on November 11 2010
                         and was declared effective on December 1, 2010. The second additional financing is now fully operational and project implementation continues to proceed smoothly and remains on
                         track. As one of its priorities, the PA will use the available funds to respond to emergency needs especially for fuel and any other emerging needs in Gaza, as the situation continues
                         to be fragile.

                         While the closing date of the project is June 2013, most likely the project will close well in advance, i.e. by June 2012, at the latest. It's highly unlikely that there will be any additional
                         fund allocation for the program over the coming FY since the Bank and other donors already provide significant budget support to the PA under the Development Policy Grant
                         program.
