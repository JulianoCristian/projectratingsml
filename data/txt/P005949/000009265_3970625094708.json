associated liquids and expanding the use of gas.

The project will help\n            (a) substitute natural gas for petroleum products; (b)\n            reduce gas wastage; (c) increase oil production from\n            declining reservoirs; (d) eliminate bottlenecks in the\n            transport system for liquids; (e) improve the basis for\n            potential natural gas exports; and (f) strengthen YPF's\n            finances and improve its financial management and control."}, "docdt": "1985-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
