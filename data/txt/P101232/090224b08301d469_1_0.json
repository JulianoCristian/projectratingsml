moderately unsatisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was high, the Bank performance was\n            moderately unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately unsatisfactory. Ratings for the Eight-Ninth\n            Poverty Reduction Support Credit Project for Uganda were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was high, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            Inadequate accounting of political economy factors in the\n            design of major reforms can adversely affect the design,\n            implementation and outcomes of DPOs. Lack of focus on\n            domestic revenue mobilization is a prime example. Pressures\n            to extend budget support within the broader, coordinated\n            donor support framework without hard conditionality to raise\n            domestic revenues can undermine incentives for domestic\n            revenue mobilization. This, in turn, can undercut\n            macroeconomic adjustment needed for sustainable fiscal\n            policy as well as the adequacy of funding for basic\n            services. Implementation and evaluation are frequently\n            undermined when objectives are not tightly linked to prior\n            actions and there is no measurable and relevant results\n            framework, when outcome indicators are ambiguous, and when\n            targets do not incorporate an explicit and convincing theory\n            of change. Achievement and sustainability of development\n            outcomes are facilitated by careful attention to political\n            economy dimensions, both at the design stage and when making\n            changes in a DPO series. For example, the failure to\n            increase revenue mobilization over a long period of time,\n            which was not addressed under the program, was directly\n            related to the political economy of political patronage and\n            large, entrenched tax exemptions and culture of\n            non-compliance. DPOs can show improvements in design and\n            outcomes when they actively use lessons from the past\n            operations as well as integrate important technical\n            knowledge products (such as CEMs and PERs). Such lessons can\n            also inform the Bank to take proactive, if difficult\n            measures such as the cancellation of an operation."}, "docdt": "2015-06-29T03:04:05Z"}
