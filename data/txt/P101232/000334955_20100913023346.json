Support\n            Credit Program (PRSC 8) is the first in a series of\n            operations prepared in a Joint Budget Support Framework\n            (JBSF) with development partners. It is the first of three\n            development policy lending (DPL) operations to support\n            Uganda's poverty reduction strategy. The operations\n            cover the period 2010-13. The government's previous\n            poverty reduction strategies reduced the share of households\n            living in poverty from 44 percent in 1997, to 38 percent in\n            2001/02, and to 31 percent in 2005/06. The operation takes\n            into account the impact of the global slump on the Ugandan\n            economy, which became more evident in 2009/10. In 2008/09,\n            the global economic slowdown resulted in an underperformance\n            in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of 1.5 percentage\n            points and a shortfall in fiscal revenues equivalent to 0.5\n            percent of GDP. This was underpinned by slowdown in exports\n            and lower foreign direct investment, which constrained\n            private investment and threatened to reduce the pace of\n            poverty reduction. Preliminary estimates suggest the impact\n            was worse than anticipated in 2009/10 as domestic demand is\n            feared to have slumped. The fiscal stimuli envisaged through\n            government's earlier strategy for public investment\n            through infrastructure spending in the 2008/09 and 2009/10\n            has been constrained by implementation and absorption\n            capacity issues. To ensure that the economy remains robust\n            and to be able to address any vulnerability to growth and\n            poverty reduction, fiscal policy will have to remain\n            accommodative. To this end, supplementary resources provided\n            under the Crisis Response Window will help the government\n            maintain investment and counteract the global crisis, while\n            the PRSC support for efficiency gains in public spending can\n            in turn help to address implementation and absorptive\n            capacity issues."}, "docdt": "2010-08-30T00:00:00Z"}
