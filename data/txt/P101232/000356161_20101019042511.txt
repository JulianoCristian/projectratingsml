                                SUMMARY OF DISCUSSION* 


                               Meeting of the Executive Directors

                                        September 30, 2010


     The Executive Directors approved a credit to the Republic of Uganda for the Eighth
Poverty Reduction Support Credit in the amount of SDR65.9 million (US$100 million
equivalent), including SDR26.4 million (US$40 million equivalent) in Pilot Crisis Response
Window (CRW) resources, on the payment terms and conditions set out in the President's
Memorandum (IDAJR20 10-0283) on September 8, 201 O.

      Executive Directors expressed broad support for the operation, which is designed within a
harmonized framework of joint budget support provision from 11 development partners (JBSF).
They welcomed this collaboration and reiterated their call for enhanced donor coordination and
harmonization. The operation focuses on key reforms that are likely to improve access to and
quality of public services while creating fiscal space through efficiency gains for needed
infrastructure investments. Directors underscored the critical importance of the reform process
being undertaken in the core areas of the PRSC for achieving the objectives of the National
Development Plan - Uganda's PRSP. The importance of sound practices in public financial
management and procurement as well as strengthened institutions and regulatory frameworks
was also stressed.
