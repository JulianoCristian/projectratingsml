modest, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the borrower performance\n            was unsatisfactory. The lessons learned indicate that\n            initiatives with objectives targeted at building capacity in\n            the financial and private sectors have a better chance of\n            success if these are conditioned upon sustained government\n            support toward macro-economic stability and development of\n            the business climate, incentive framework, and reliable\n            infrastructure. The success of financial intermediary loans\n            is dependent upon a disciplined credit environment. Business\n            development services are more effective if implementation\n            arrangements are simplified; do not tax an\n            organization's capacity, and do not deter the\n            participation of eligible applicants. Eligibility for grants\n            should have explicit criteria to ensure that grants are\n            extended to those activities that have potential to generate\n            high level of positive externalities and are used to fund\n            activities in addition to those that private entrepreneurs\n            will fund with their own resources. The distribution of\n            simple and straightforward guidelines and instructions to\n            banks, matching grant implementers, and potential clients\n            and the intensive delivery of promotional activities can\n            improve project outreach and performance if these are done\n            during the project launch and the early years of project implementation."}, "docdt": "2003-03-28T00:00:00Z"}
