rehabilitation and maintenance; (ii) test and evaluate\n            various methods of rehabilitation and maintenance of feeder\n            roads under different institutional and financial\n            arrangements in selected rural areas throughout the country;\n            and (iii) develop a local capacity to rehabilitate and\n            maintain feeder roads and bridges on a sustainable and\n            replicable basis.  The project finances: (i) a technical\n            assistance, study and training program to develop the\n            organization and management systems necessary to maintain\n            the national feeder road network; (ii) a four-year program\n            of low-cost rehabilitation and maintenance of feeder roads\n            under various institutional arrangement; and (iii) research\n            and development activities to evaluate the environmental,\n            social, financial and economic impact of rural road\n            improvement.
