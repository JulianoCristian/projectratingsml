The Bank loan is a combined\n            operation:  sectoral for PROSANEAR, and a project loan for\n            the municipality of Campinas in the State of Sao Paulo.  The\n            project consists of two main components:  one for  (a) low\n            income areas which will improve health and environmental\n            conditions by providing water and sanitation services to the\n            extremely poor urban families; and (b) an expansion of the\n            City of Campinas water supply to eliminate existing water\n            rationing.  The low income areas sector component consists\n            of:  (a) a group of subprojects benefitting approximately\n            200,000 and 700,000 low income urban population with water\n            and sewerage services, respectively; (b) provision of\n            complementary sanitation services; and a (c) technical\n            assistance program for PROSANEAR and for increasing the\n            evaluation and supervision capabilities of the Federal\n            Savings Bank (CEF). The Campinas component consists of works\n            to improve and expand the city's water supply system to\n            meet demand through 2002 benefitting more than 860,000 people."}, "docdt": "1988-06-10T00:00:00Z"}
