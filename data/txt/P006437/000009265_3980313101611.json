sustainability\n            was unlikely, Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: utilities have limited experience and\n            assign low priority to water and sanitation in poor areas.\n            Most utilities have little experience with projects aimed at\n            extending services to poor areas, and often are reluctant to\n            adopt low-cost technologies and build partnerships with\n            community organizations. to address these issues, future\n            projects should identify key staff in utilities willing to\n            test new technologies and work with poor communities, secure\n            support from utility managers and local politicians, and\n            promote cultural change in the utilities by investing in\n            workshops and field visits from the early stages of project\n            preparation. The bulk of resources were allocated to the two\n            subprojects in Belem and Rio de Janeiro. Although the Belem\n            project was implemented satisfactorily, the Rio project\n            suffered delays that were reflected in overall project\n            performance. The allocation of resources should recognize\n            the potential for weak performance by taking into account\n            the implementation capacity of sub-borrowers and the\n            commitment and stability of top managers in the\n            participating utility."}, "docdt": "1997-06-11T00:00:00Z"}
