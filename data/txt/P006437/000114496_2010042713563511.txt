Re:
Loan 2983-BR (Water Project for Municipalities and
Low-Income Areas) - Amendment
Dear Mr. Torres:
Please refer to the Loan Agreement dated December 30, 1988 (the Loan Agreement) 
between the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) and Caixa 
Economica Federal (the Borrower).
In response to the request by the CEF, the Municipality of Campinas and the 
Sociedade de Abasticimento de Agua e Saneamento, S.A. (SANASA), the Bank is pleased to 
inform you of its agreement to amend the Loan Agreement as set forth in Attachment I 
to this letter to increase in Schedule 1 (Withdrawal of the Proceeds of the Loan), the 
percentage of disbursement from 66% to 100% of the amounts disbursed by the Borrower 
to SANASA for expenditures incurred after September 1, 1990, which would represent 
Bank financing of 50% of total costs after this date, to amend Schedule 2 (Description 
of the Project), to include in Part B, the construction of a booster pumping station.  
Also, Section 3.05 (b) is amended to postpone the date for final approval of 
subprojects under Part A of the Project from June 30, 1991 to June 30, 1992.
In addition, I am pleased to inform you that the Bank agrees on an exceptional 
basis, and without constituting a precedent of any sort, to CEF's request regarding 
the reimbursement of amounts withdrawn from the Special Account for ineligible 
expenditures under the terms and conditions set forth in Attachment II of this letter.
If you agree with the foregoing proposals, please so indicate by signing the 
duplicate copy of this letter and returning it to us.
Because of their interest in this matter, I am sending copies of this letter and 
attachment to Her Excellency Zelia Maria Cardoso de Mello, Minister of Economy, 
Finance and Planning; Dr.
Ibrahim Eros, President of the Central Bank of Brazil; Ministro Clodoaldo Hugueney 
Filho, Secretary of DEAIN in the Ministry of Economy, Finance and Planning; Dr. Jaco 
Bittar, Prefeito Municipal
of the City of Campinas and Dr. Jose Ma.  Gotti Alvarenga, President of SANASA, 
Campinas.
Sincerely yours,

ATTACHMENT II
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR THE REIMBURSEMENT
OF US$ 7,362,758.55 INTO THE SPECIAL
ACCOUNT BY THE BORROWER
1.
The Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the equivalent of US$7,362,758.55 were 
withdrawn from the Special Account for expenditures ineligible for financing under the 
Loan.  As provided
in the Loan Agreement, the Borrower is under the obligation to redeposit forthwith 
such amount into the Special Account.
2.
Because of the exceptional circumstances of this case, the fact the Borrower 
does not have at this time the financial resources to meet its obligations referred to 
in paragraph 1 above and in order to avoid further delays in the implementation of 
Part B of the Project, the Borrower has requested the Bank to agree to a schedule of 
deposits which will refund the Special Account as follows:
      US$ 2,000,000 already deposited;
      US$ 200,000 on or before the end of February 1991;
      US$ 100,000 on or before the end of March 1991;
      US$ 200,000 on or before the end of each April, May and June
      of 1991;
      US$ 400,000 on or before the end of each July, August and
Page  3
      September of 1991;
      US$ 700,000 on or before the end of each October,
      November and December of 1991 and January 1992;
      US$ 462,758.55 on or before the end of February 1992.
3.
Without limitation to the provisions of Section 10.03 of the General Conditions 
applicable to the Loan Agreement, the Bank has no objections to such schedule of 
deposits provided, however, that any delay on any of the above listed deposits will, 
automatically and without the need of further notice or any action by the Bank, cause 
the full amount up to then not refunded to the Special Account to become due and 
payable forthwith and the Borrower hereby agrees to effect such payment in full, 
pursuant to the provisions of the Loan Agreement.
4.
The amount available in the Special Account as Authorized Allocation shall be 
limited to US$ 4,637,241.45 and shall be increased only by the deposits made by the 
Borrower into such Account pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2 on or before the dates 
therein set forth.
5.
The Borrower, the Guarantor and the Bank agree that the method of  refunding the 
Special Account referred to herein is of an exceptional nature and does not constitute 
a precedent with respect to any other Loan made to or guaranteed by the Federative 
Republic of Brazil.
