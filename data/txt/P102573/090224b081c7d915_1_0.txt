                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Afghanistan Skills Development Project (ASDP) became effective in March 2008. The project is implemented by the Ministry of Education (MOE) and the Ministry of Labor,
                         Social Affairs, Martyrs and Disabled (MOLSAMD). The overall size of the project is USD 38 million of which USD 20 million is from IDA and USD 18 from ARTF. While
                         implementation progress has been as per design, current political and security concerns continue to constrain the achievement of desired objectives to the full by the current closing
                         date. For this reason, the project has undergone a level two restructuring, effective July 31st, 2012, to make changes/modifications in the results framework including the

                         Between the last ISR and the current one, progress towards achievement of PDO has been steady. The building up of a system is dependent on the performance of the Committee
                         on Education and Skills Policy, chaired by the First Vice President. The committee functioning had become somewhat lax, with its secretariat lacking in effectiveness. During the

                         period January-March 2013, issues have been sorted out with the Office of the First Vice President, and one of the Advisers to the First Vice President has been assigned the direct
                         responsibility of looking after the functioning of the CESP secretariat. The Secretariat has recently held an Awareness workshop for all stakeholders where progress on various
                         systemic and strategic issues was discussed. The issue of establishment of Boards continues to be a contentious one with both the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Labor
                         pitching for ownership. The final decision will rest with the President.
                         106 National Occupational Skills Standards have been developed under the NSDP which has been supported by project funded TA for the purpose. These have been shared with
                         other development partners and other Ministries, in addition to the DMTVET which will now align its curricula to these Standards.

                         More graduates of informal training courses under NSDP have reportedly found productive employment. A Third Party verification process is now under way to check the figures
                         reported by the Government. In the NSDP part of the project, the final sets of contracts on training delivery to chronically poor women, youth, and Drug Users, were signed and
                         contract execution commenced. Issues in the Ministry of Labor (MOLSAMD) have been sorted out and the new Deputy Minister is taking keen interest in the project.

                         The issue of finding an international implementation partner for the National Institute of Management and Administration (NIMA) has been sorted out and contract finalized. Other
                         aided institutes have submitted business plans which are being reviewed. There have been no student related or faculty related issues in any of the aided institutes. Construction
                         work has been completed on schedule. All institutes receiving project support have started to carry out reforms with respect to their administrative, academic and financial
                         autonomy; Afghanistan National Institution of Music (ANIM), the Blind School and the National Institute of Management and Administration (NIMA) are the most advanced.
