                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Afghanistan Skills Development Project (ASDP) became effective in March 2008 and is closing at the end of June 2014. The project has been implemented by the Ministry of
                         Education (MOE) and the Ministry of Labor, Social Affairs, Martyrs and Disabled (MOLSAMD). The overall financing amount for the project is USD 38 million, of which USD 20 million
                         come from the Bank and USD 18 from ARTF. While implementation has been carried out in line with the original design, political and security concerns have constrained timely
                         implementation as well as the achievement of some of the original objectives to the full extent. For this reason, the project was restructured effective July 31st, 2012, to make

                         Since restructuring, progress towards achievement of PDO has been steady. The functioning of the Committee on Education and Skills Policy (CESP) had become somewhat lax,

                         with its secretariat lacking in effectiveness. During the period under report, the CESP had organized a full meeting in which the handover of management of the secretariat to the
                         CESP was formalized, and a decision was taken to formally appoint the Economic Adviser to the First Vice President as the Coordinator of the secretariat. Following the meeting
                         which also discussed the roadmap, a request was received by the Bank for continued support to the secretariat and the Bank promised support until June 2015. The funds for this
                         purpose will be taken from the Second Afghanistan Skills Development Project (ASDP II).

                         Over 150 National Occupational Skills Standards have been developed by the NSDP supported by ASDP. These have been shared with other development partners and other
                         Ministries, in addition to the DMTVET which is in the process of aligning its curricula to these Skills Standards.

                         More graduates of informal training courses under NSDP have reportedly found productive employment. A third party verification process is under way to check the figures reported
                         by the Government. The preliminary results confirm the earlier findings of rise in wages after training for both men and women. Under Component 3 of ASDP, training delivery to
                         chronically poor women, youth, and drug users, is continuing. Training for disabled has begun in January 2014 and will be concluded by June 30, 2014.

                         The international implementation partner for the National Institute of Management and Administration (NIMA) has been in place since last September and has submitted reports on
                         their detailed plan of work. It has also done a preliminary evaluation of curricula and Faculty and organized successfully the entrance examination using international norms and
                         standards. It has designed, administered and graded the tests. About 227 students got admitted but some found admission at the university of Kabul and left. NIMA has now become
                         a corresponding member and candidate of ACBSP and discussions are on with Ivy Tech Community College for certification of the current cohort of graduating students. Other
                         institutes supported by the project have submitted their business plans which have been evaluated by a government Technical Committee. Construction work has been completed on
                         schedule. All institutes receiving project support have started to carry out reforms with respect to their administrative, academic and financial autonomy. Among these institutes, the
                         Afghanistan National Institute of Music (ANIM), the Blind School and the National Institute of Management and Administration (NIMA) are the most advanced. AIT has reconstituted
                         its Governing Council which has held its first meeting, opened a bank account and has submitted a staffing plan to be able to implement its business plan as for now only the
                         coordinator is in place.

                         All development partners investing in the TVET sector have now come together to coordinate the TVET strategy of Afghanistan. Donor investments and areas of support were
                         discussed.
