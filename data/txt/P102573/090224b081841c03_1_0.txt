                         Implementation Status Overview

                         Social Affairs, Martyrs and Disabled (MOLSAMD). The overall size of the project is USD 38 million of which USD 20 million is from IDA and USD 18 from ARTF. While
                         implementation progress has been as per design, current political and security concerns continue to constrain the achievement of desired objectives to the full by the current closing
                         date. For this reason, the project has undergone a level two restructuring, effective July 31st, 2012, to make changes/modifications in the results framework including the

                         Some of the notable successes include: As result of restructuring, a voucher program was introduced to allow meritorious and economically disadvantaged graduates of the DMTVET
                         institutes opt for more professional training in their area of preference. As a result 71 graduates from three DMTVET aided institutes are enrolled in advance courses for management,

                         learning in the countries of the region i.e. India. All institutes receiving project support have started to carry out reform actions concerning their administrative, academic and financial
                         autonomy; Afghanistan National Institution of Music (ANIM) and the National Institute of Management and Administration (NIMA) are the most advanced. After graduation of first
                         cohort of 1,510 students from National Institute of Management and Administration (NIMA) in October 2011, now the institute has registered 1400 students for its second cohort from
                         31 provinces in the country. From the first cohort, 1058 students obtained Diplomas from the University of Jyvyskala, Finland. Post-qualification employment record of the first cohort
                         is better than 70%, graduates being employed in the private and public sectors. and Afghanistan National Institute of Music (ANIM) continues to provide world class musical education
                         to children largely from disadvantaged backgrounds. MOLSAMD has provided, through the National Skills Development Program (NSDP), informal vocational training to 7500
                         persons and 1600 BDS trainers, with a post-training employment record of better than 75%. A draft National Qualification Framework (NQF) has been prepared and a new road map
                         has been developed by Committee on Education and Skills Policy (CESP) for facilitating further work concerning the development of regulatory and quality assurance framework for
