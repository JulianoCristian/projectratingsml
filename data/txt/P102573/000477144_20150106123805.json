Both the Bank\n            and the Borrower received moderately satisfactory\n            performance ratings. A restructuring took place during the\n            project that affected the following: A Supplemental Letter\n            (Performance Indicators) was included at the time of\n            restructuring because of limited progress on developing a\n            regulatory and quality assurance framework and some\n            indicators and targets were too ambitious or could not be\n            measured. Other key changes made include: (i) scope of\n            Component 1 was revised to make it achievable; (ii) results\n            indicators and targets were revised to make them realistic\n            and measurable; (iii) covenants were added to improve the\n            implementation of a governance framework; (iv) covenants\n            were added to strengthen actions to ensure compliance; (v)\n            closing date was extended by 16 months; (vi) a pilot voucher\n            program was added; and (vii) training of additional\n            vulnerable persons and new training of rehabilitated\n            injectable drug users (IDUs) were added under Component 3.\n            There were six lessons recorded from this project and they\n            are: (1) Strong commitment and leadership are critical for\n            successfully steering reforms in a Technical and Vocational\n            Education and Training (TVET) institute. (2) Sustained\n            implementation support and supervision by the Bank in a\n            fragile situation is likely to lead to improved project\n            implementation. (3) Even in a challenging fragile situation,\n            institutional capacity can be enhanced. (4) Progress on\n            improving gender equity is feasible even in situations with\n            substantial cultural constraints. (5) Timely project\n            restructuring can play a pivotal role in improving project\n            implementation. (6) Projects can achieve good results even\n            in remote and insecure areas in a fragile context."}, "docdt": "2014-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
