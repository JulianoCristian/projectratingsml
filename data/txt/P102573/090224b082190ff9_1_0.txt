                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Afghanistan Skills Development Project (ASDP) became effective in March 2008. The project is implemented by the Ministry of Education (MOE) and the Ministry of Labor,
                         Social Affairs, Martyrs and Disabled (MOLSAMD). The overall size of the project is USD 38 million of which USD 20 million is from IDA and USD 18 from ARTF. While
                         implementation progress has been as per design, current political and security concerns continue to constrain the achievement of desired objectives to the full by the current closing
                         date. For this reason, the project has undergone a level two restructuring, effective July 31st, 2012, to make changes/modifications in the results framework including the

                         Between the last ISR and the current one, progress towards achievement of PDO has been steady. The building up of a system is dependent on the performance of the Committee
                         on Education and Skills Policy, chaired by the First Vice President. The committee functioning had become somewhat lax, with its secretariat lacking in effectiveness. During the

                         period under report, the CESP has had a full meeting in which the changeover of management of the secretariat to the CESP was formalized, and a decision was taken to formally
                         appoint the Economic Adviser to the First Vice President as the Coordinator of the secretariat. Following the meeting which also discussed the basic roadmap, a request was
                         received by the Bank for continued support to the secretariat and the Bank promised support until June 2015. The funds for this purpose will be taken from the Second Afghanistan
                         Skills Development Project (ASDP II). The secretariat has developed a detailed roadmap which has been discussed with the Bank Team in draft. The final version will be submitted to
                         the Bank shortly. The Office of the First Vice President will sort out the issue of physical location of the secretariat with the Ministry of Labor at the governmental levels
                         106 National Occupational Skills Standards have been developed under the NSDP which has been supported by project funded TA for the purpose. These have been shared with
                         other development partners and other Ministries, in addition to the DMTVET which is in the process of aligning its curricula to these Standards.

                         More graduates of informal training courses under NSDP have reportedly found productive employment. A Third Party verification process is now under way to check the figures
                         reported by the Government. The preliminary results confirm the earlier findings of rise in wages after training for both men and women. In the NSDP part of the project, training
                         delivery to chronically poor women, youth, and Drug Users, is continuing. Training for disabled will begin in January 2014 and will be concluded before scheduled completion of the
                         project. Issues in the Ministry of Labor (MOLSAMD) have been sorted out and the new Deputy Minister is taking keen interest in the project.

                         The international implementation partner for the National Institute of Management and Administration (NIMA) is in place and has submitted reports on their detailed plan of work.
                         They have also done preliminary evaluation of curricula and Faculty. Detailed Faculty evaluation reports will be submitted shortly (Dec 31). NIMA has now become a corresponding
                         member of ACBSP and discussions are on with Ivy Tech Community College for certification of the current cohort of graduating students. Other aided institutes have submitted
                         business plans which have been evaluated by a government Technical Committee. Construction work has been completed on schedule. All institutes receiving project support have
                         started to carry out reforms with respect to their administrative, academic and financial autonomy. Among these institutes, the Afghanistan National Institute of Music (ANIM), the
                         Blind School and the National Institute of Management and Administration (NIMA) are the most advanced. AIT has reconstituted its Governing Council which has held its first
                         meetings

                         All development partners investing in the TVET sector have now come together to coordinate and sort out issues concerning specific investments. These issues are discussed in
                         every Mission and the whole sectoral investment pattern is becoming clearer. This is a continuing agenda for all the development partners.
