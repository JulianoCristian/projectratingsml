of cement pipes in the selected\n            areas totalling 500,000 feddans; (b) deepening and widening\n            of about 1,226 km of existing, and excavation of about 346\n            km of new open drains, involving approximately 23 million\n            cubic meters of excavation; (c) construction of one pumping\n            station of a capacity of 3.5 cubic meters per second,\n            including transmission line; (d) reclamation by leaching of\n            about 12,000 feddans of saline soils distributed throughout\n            the area to be drained including subsoiling and gypsum\n            application in about two thirds of this area where soils are\n            alkaline; (e) extension of the Government's bilharzia\n            control program by about 120,000 feddans abutting the\n            existing program area and between the Asyut and Dairut\n            barrages; and (f) financing the cost overrun on molluscicide\n            procurement under the
