PREFACE
This Isa performance audit of two Bank and IDA-assisted projects
in the  Arab  Republic  of  Egypt.    The  lending  operations  for the two
projects, Upper Egypt Drainage II (UED II) and Nile Delta Drainage II (NDD
II), totalling US$116.0 million (m), were approved by the Board in June
1976, May 1977 respectively.l/ The loans/credits were closed respectively
in June and December 1985.    All  loans  and credits were fully disbursed.
This audit consists of a zaemorandum prepared by the Operations Evaluation
Department (OED) and two Project Completion Reports (PCRs). The PCRs were
prepared by r-AO/World Bank Coooperative Program (FAOICP) staff, accompanied
by an overview memorandum prepared by staff of the former EMENA Projects
Department. The audit memorandum is based on a review of the Appraisal
Reports,21  the  corresponding   President's   Reports ,31 the  Development
Loan/CrediF Agreements,41 and the  PCRs.   Correspondence with the borrower
and internal Bank memoranda on the projects contained in Bank files have
also been consulted and Bank staff associated with the projects have been
interviewed.
An OED mission visited Egypt in December 1987. The mission held
discussions with officials in the ministries and other agencies associated
with the projects in Cairo and selected governorates. Field visits to a
representative selection of project sites were also undertaken for the
purpose  of  familiarization  and   to   interview  staff  responsible  for
$mpl_emntation and project beneficiaries.
The audit finds the two PCRs comprehensive and accurate with
respect to the projects' principal achievements and shortcomings. The well
written overview usefully supplements the PCRs by providing valuable
additional insights and clarifying certain issues from the Bank viewpoint.
The points discussed by the audit have been selected because of their
relevance to these and other agricultural sector projects in Egypt,
including projects currently being implemented.

PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT

UPPER EGYPT DRAINAGE II (LOAN 1285-EGT; CREDIT 637-EGT)
NILE DELTA DRAINAGE II (LOANS 1439 & 1440-EGTt CREDIT 719-EGT)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
The projects covered by this PPAR were the fourth and fifth
agricultural sector projects in Egypt to be supported by the Bank/IDA. The
two projects have been combined in one report because of their similarities
In tenms of objectives and implementation experience.
Obiectives
Both projects shared the same basic objective of Increasing
agricultural productivity   in   the   irrigated   agriculture  subsector.
Improvements were to be effec:ed through public sector investments intended
to benefit alm,st all irrigated farmers in the project areas.
Implementation Experience
Start-up and execution of both projects were delayed considerably.
Construction delays were due to several factors, including Inadequate
construction planning and mauagement by EPADP, time consuming procurement
procedures, cumbersome  and   rigid   contract  administration,  below-par
performances by public sector contractors, local budget shortfalls, and
cement shortage in the early years (Overview, para. 18). Additionally,
much of the difference between appraisal end actual attainments is a
consequence of  over-optimistic  targetting  end  -nrealistic scheduling of
civil works set at appraisal (PPAN, pare. 10).
Results
In spite of delays (see above) the two projects were successful,
with economic rates of return (ERRs) of 191 end 24Z respectively (Overview,
pares. 54-56).
The bilharIia control components were also successful in that they
effected large reductions in intensity of infection at low cost rUED II
PCR      S para. 4.30  and NDD II PCR, pare. 4.32).
Sustainabilitv
Sustainability of the civil works  constructed under the projects
depends to a high degree on the efficiency of operation and maintenance
(O&M), which is  problemtic  in  the  absence  of an effective monitoring
system of drain performance (Overview, pares. 35-36).



Sustainability in the case of the bilharuia control program is
heavily dependent on the effectiveness of the surveillance and screening
procedures, and the maintenance of effieient snail control and bilharzia
treatment services (PPAM, para. 26).
Findings
Both projects should have been more thoroughly prepared prior to
appraisal (PPAM, paras. 49-51).
The Bank should have been more sensitive to the reluctance of GOE
to use loanlcredit funds for hiring foreign consultants, and should have
been more active in seeking technical assistance from bilateral or
International grant aid sources (PPAM, paras. 52-53).
Civil works construction targets and schedules for the drainage
projects should have been based on a more critical assessment of the
Implementation capacity of EPADP, and on a more realistic appreciation of
the prevailing constraints to rapid progress (PPAM, paras. 54-55).
The very successful bilharzia control program reflects creditably
on the GOE, the Bank and the consultant concerned (PPAM, paras. 56-57).



PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT MEMORANDUM

UPPER EGYPT DRAINAGE II (LOAN 1285-EGT; CREDIT 637-EGT)
NILE DELTA DdAINAGE II (LOANS 1439 & 144O-E'U: CREDIT 719-EGT)
I.  PROJECTS' BACKGROUND
Context
1.       Agriculture in Egypt is virtually  restricted to about 6.2 million
feddans of irrigated land along the Nil, Valley and Delta. Overall growth
of the sector accelerated sharply from the mid-1960s through the 1970s due
to cumulative benefits from the Aswam Dam and the introduction of high
yielding crop varieties, but has stagnated through the 1980s due to limited
land availability, a decline in crop yields caused by inadequate drainage,
labor shortage, and institutional weaknesses in applied research, extension
and marketing.
2.       The two projects covered  by  this  audit were identified and pre-
pared in the mid-1970s as a response to the above problems.
3.       The projects (UED II and  NDD  II) were designed as repeater proj-.
ects to succeed two similar projects previously supported by the Bank in
the irrigated area.
Objlectiver
4.       The projects aimed to halt  a  decline in land productivity due to
lack of drainage through establishment of good drainage conditions within
their respective areas. This was to be brought about through installation
of buried field tile drains and drain collectors, construction of new open
main drains, remodelling of existing drains, and erection of pumping sta-
tions. They also included support for extending an ongoing bilharxia con-
trol program which had been commenced under an earlier drainage project.
Design
5.       Identification and preparation was  undertaken in the mid-1970s by
the Egyptian Public Agency for Drainage Projects (EPADP), with some assist-
ance from an FAOICP mission in the case of NDD II. The EPADP preparation
for UED II was based on design standards and construction methods previ-
ously used in the first two drainage projects, but these were modified at
appraisal by a decision to invite field drainage construction bids from
foreign contractors, and to introduce polyvinylehloride (PVC) corrugated
plastic pipes in place of the concrete pipes used previously. These



-2-
changes were introduced in order  to  accelerate the iplementation rate of
the drainage program. This program was running at an annual rate of around
180,000 feddan in the late 1970s, and was to be increased by an additional
140,00 feddan annually in each project area by 1979 and 1982 respectively.
An aggregate annual drainage program total of around 370,000 feddan was
expected for the years 1981 and 1982 as a result of the above improvements.
Estimated Project Costs
6.       Bank and cofinancier loans and  credits and total project costs at
appraisal were as follows:
Proiect                     Appraisal
Ln./Cr.   Ln./Cr.     Total
Amount    Amount       Cost
US$ m      DM m       US$ m
UED II Bank/IDA      50.0                   282.1
USAID           30.0
NDD II Bank/IDA      66.0                   207.0
KfW (DH m)                 50.0
Total                146.0      50.0        489.1
7.       The Bank/IDA loans and credits  were fully disbursed and closed in
1985 before either project was fully completed (see para. 16) and with
disbursements still continuing under the cefinanciers' aid programs. Indi-
cations at the time of PCR preparation (end 1986-early 1987) were that
actual costs, then running at US$ 359.1 m, would be considerably lower than
the US$489.1 m estimated at appraisal.    The  cost underruns in US$ can be
accounted for partly by revaluation of the US dollar during implementation,
and by lower than estimated costs of drainage equipment, PVC pipe factories
and PVC resin. In addition, local contract prices for civil works were
also lower than expected.
Pre-implementation Processinx
8.       The projects  were  appraised  respectively  in  November 1975 and
November 1976; approved by the Board in June 1976 and May 1977; and became
effective in January 1977 and April 1978.
9.       Target setting and  scheduling  for  civil works, especially field
drain inatallation (see para. 6 above) during appraisal appears to have
Seea undertaken in an atmosphere of high optimism which was in marked con-
trast with the physical achievements being recorded in the two earlier
drainage projects  still  ongoing  at  that  time.    Actual field drainage
attainments in UED I and NDD I in 1975 were only 35,000 and 80,000 feddans
respectively.   A  December  1975  supervision  report  for  these projects
reported slow progress in drainage programs, with NDD I four years behind



-3-
schedule due to procurement delays, cement shortage, poor performance on
the part of local contractors, and managerial weaknesses. Such optimism by
the appraisal mission apparently reflected considerable faith in the super-
ior performance expected from  foreign  contractors  using the proposed PVC
pipe technology.
10.      At negotiation for UED II,  GOE representatives agreed to interna-
tional competitive bidding (ICB) for field drainage contracts. The ICB
provision was repeated in the Project Agreement for NDD II.
11.      Both projects were generally well  received by the Board, but dur-
ing the presentation of NDD II a Board member remarked that UED II, presen-
ted only 12 months earlier, had encountered long delay before effective-
ness, and wondered at the prospects for the present project. In reply,
Bank staff explained that the situation had improved and that NDD II would
most likely be effective by October 1977 (in actuality, NDD II was not
declared effective until April, 1978).   Bank staff added that while previ-
ous projects had suffered from management problems, inadequate staffing and
insufficient local currency between 1972-75, the problems had been reme-
died.
II. PROJECTS' IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOME
ManaRement
12.      The Egyptian Public Agency for Drainage Projects (EPADP) had prim-
ary responsibility for both projects. It suffered from an inadequate orga-
nizational set-up and frequent changes in leadership in the early implemen-
tation years, but organizational improvements effected in the early 1980's
and stability in leadership since 1981 have led to noticeable improvements.
A shortage of engineers and frequent changes in technical staff due to low
wages is a continual problem which particularly affected design, construc-
tion planning and contract supervision (UED II PCR, paras. 5.1-5.6 and NDD
II PCR, paras. 5.1-5.6).
13.      The bilharsia control components  were  carried out efficiently by
the senior staff of the Department of Endemic Diseases, Ministry of Health,
and the health directorates of the concerned governorates.
Start-up
14.      Both projects  experienced  slow  start-ups  due  primarily to the
heavy backlog of civil works to which EPADP was already committed under the
ongoing NDD I and UED I projects, end to the limited capacity of EPADP to
design and supervise additional works.
15.      The late commissioning of the  PVC pipe manufacturing plants was a
further cause of serious delay in UED II. GOE acceptance of cofinancing



4-
from USAID was only obtained a month or two before Bank/GOE negotiations
took place, which gave insufficient time for the cofinancier to finalize
arrangements with GOE, conduct engineering feasibility and complete plant
procurement in conformity with the appraisal schedule.
Sequence
16.      Implementation of drainage works  ran  far behind schedule in both
projects. Delays occurred in all three main components, i.e. pumping sta-
tions, open drains and, particularly, the field drains. Although UED II
and NDD II loans/credits were closed respectiv y in June and December 1985
residual civil works related to both projects were still on-going at time
of audit in December 1987. Indications are that when finally completed UED
II will have taken at least 12 years for completion instead of an estimated
five, while NDD II took nine years instead of five without including the
still outstanding work on the pumping stations (UED II PCR, paras. 3.7-3.15
and NDD II PCR, paras. 3.8-3.14).
17.      In general, the bilharzia control components in both projects were
implemented more or less according to plan (UED II PCR, paras. 3.16-3.17
and NDD II PCR, paras. 3.15-3.16).
Procurement
18.      Procurement of equipment,  materials  and  civil works was carried
out without any special problems, except that no foreign bidders were succ-
essful in the case of field drainage tenders (UED II PCR, paras. 3.18-3.20
and NDD II PCR, paras. 3.17-3.19), which dealt a severe blow to the apprai-
sal case for accelerating the implementation rate of field drainage through
use of foreign contractors.
Reporting
19.      Both projects were supervised regularly and effectively, and quar-
terly reports indicating mainly physical progress were submitted routinely
by EPADP. The introduction of a cost accounting system proved more diffi-
cult than expected, and further improvement is necessary to make it an
effective tool for financial control purposes by project management. Annu-
al audit reports were satisfactory, though usually presented later than
agreed (UED II PCR, paras. 3.21-3.26 and NDD II PCR, paras. 3.20-3.25).
Outcomes
20.      Performance by the  public  sector  civil works contractors, which
were awarded the bulk of the drainage contracts, was a source of continual
concern to Bank supervision staff throughout the implementation period on
account of both quality of workmanship and speed of accomplishment (UED II
PCR, paras. 4.1-4.8 and NDD II PCR, paras. 4.1-4.9). Supervision reports
catalogue a wide variety of construction faults and deficiencies, most of



- 5 -
which persisted throughout the implementation period simply because EPADP
staff in many instances appear to have been inhibited from imposine ade-
quate performance standards on  the  contractors.   Nevertheless, the works
were eventually completed to a passable standard and to the satisfaction of
most farmer beneficiaries, to judge from the small cross section of farmers
interviewed during field audit and from local hearsay. Unfortunately,
statistically reliable evidence in support of this contention is difficult
to come by, in spite of considerable time and effort given to monitoring
and evaluation (UED II PCR, paras. 4.12-4.25 and NDD II PCR, paras.
4.14-4.27).
21.      The bilharzia program showed excellent progress in controlling the
disease in Middle and Upper Egypt, to an extent that in many parts of these
areas bilharzia has ceased to be a public health problem. An independent
evaluation undertaken in 1985 has shown the prevalence to have been reduced
from 30 to 8X, but what is equally important the incidence of serious cases
of the disease has become rare.lI
Economic Performance
22.      Despite the uncertainties of crop yield response to drainage works
'n the absence of reliable data from monitoring and evaluation (see para.
22 above), economic rates of return (ERRs) have been re-estimated in the
PCRs, using slightly different and more conservative assumptions of the
effect of project ..orks on yields than were used at appraisal (UED II PCR,
paras. 6.1-6.6). While accepting the validity of the re-estimated ERR of
14X as against an appraisal estimate of 29Z for the UED II project and
23.6Z as against 231 for NDD II, the audit strongly endorses the recommen-
dation in the UED II PCR (para. 6.5) for a strengthened monitoring and ex-
post evaluation program to be undertaken in the ongoing fifth drainage
project. Such a program should provide more accurate data on the basis of
which more reliable ERRs could be reestimated for future drainage projects.
23.      The 1985 evaluation has  shown  that  the  cost of control for the
bilharzia control program was reasonable and that the program was well
managed.
Sustainability
24.      The physical sustainability  of  the  drainage projects is heavily
dependent on the effectiveness of the operation and maintenance services
provided by EPADP and its maintenance contractors. A Bank assisted Channel
Maintenance Project, which was approved by the Board in June, 1986 is
expected to make a useful contribution in this area.

Control Proxram in Eavpt. 1985.    Transactions  of the Poyal Society of
Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (1987). Vol. 81 Supplement, pp. 1-57.



- 6 -
25.      The 1985 evaluation report on the bilharzia program emphasized the
importance of maintenance and reinforcement of control in Middle and Upper
Egypt, with some modification in techniques.
Environmental Effects
26.      The overall  impact  of  the  drainage  components  in eliminating
waterlogging and reducing salinity levels in project area soils, and of the
bilharzia program in reducing the incidence of bilharzia, was entirely
beneficial in environmental terms.
Human Resource Development
27.      According to the PCRa  (UED  II  PCR,  paras. 3.34-3.35 and NDD II
PCR, paras. 3.33-3.34), training courses provided by EPADP were judged too
short and their success limited, but overseas training in operation and
maintenance  of  equipment  provided   by  suppliers  was  considered  more
effective. Training provided under the project was supplemented by Dutch
bilateral assistance, which was judged to be very successful.
28.      The engagement of foreign  consultants  to advise and assist local
engineers in the design and use of PVC drainage systems, agreed at
negotiation, became a controversial issue during implementation when EPADP
proved unwilling to accept such services (para. 32, and UED II PCR, para.
3.33 and NDD II PCR, para. 3.32).
III. FINDINGS AND ISSUES
Overview
29.      The projects were both successful in spite of long delays in exec-
ution and a wide variety  of  problems.    However, they showed evidence of
having been inadequately prepared and appraised in some haste, with the
result that several aspects crucial to smooth implementation were insuffic-
iently explored prior  to  implementation.    The inadequacy of preparation
(para. 31), the much delayed start-up (para. 14-15), and the unrealistic
implementation goals (paras. 34-35), leads the audit to conclude that the
projects were appraised prematurely.
Related Experience
30.      The projects were very similar to two earlier projetts in the same
regions, with which they  overlapped.    They were equally successful while
sharing many of the same problems.   A Drainage V project covering parts of
both Upper Egypt and the Delta, which became effective in 1987, is benefit-
ing from the experiences of the earlier projects in several ways.



-7-
Issues Arising
A. Inadeauate Preparation
31.      Both projects show evidence of  inadequate preparation.  This took
the form of inadequate justification for selection of the project areas,
reflecting a lack of information on soils, groundwater levels and salinity
status at preparation (Overview, para. 6).    As a result 125,000 feddan or
25Z of the UED II area, and 70,000 feddan or 181 of the NDD II area had to
be changed in the course of implementation (Overview, para. 17). The same
deficiency in preparation was also inherent to the first two drainage proj-
ects, but the lessons of experience from these earlier projects only became
fully apparent when their PPARs were completed, in 1982 and 1984, several
years after UED II and NDD II had been appraised, and too late to be taken
into account in their planning. However, by the time the Drainage V proj-
ect came to be prepared in 1984 the Importance of adequate preparation was
better understood, and adequate predrainage investigations based on appro-
priate technical criteria were carried out to identify areas in need of
drainage prior to appraisal, and thereby to permit more accurate planning
and cost estimating at appraisal.
B. Consultant Services
32.      Under NDD I, GOE  had  agreed  at  negotiation,  but only with the
greatest reluctance, to a Bank proposal to engage foreign consultants
financed from the credit, to assist EPADP with the management and execution
of the project. In the event the consultant team, as reported in the NDD I
PPAR, were isolated and  had  little  influence on the project, apparently,
reflecting EPADP's reluctance to make use of them.21 In spite of this less
than satisfactory experience the Bank persisted in its view that addittional
resident expertise was needed to help organize and manage the follow-on UED
I, UED II and NDD II projects.  Funds were accordingly provided for 15 man-
years of long and short-term consultant services under the UED I credit
agreement, but were never used owing to continued reluctance on the part of
EPADP manegement. The EPADP view was that adequate technical assistance in
design and management was (and continues to be) provided under a Dutch
technical assistance program that supports a high-level Dutch-Egyptian
advisory panel which meets once or twice a year and also provides resident
experts. For this reason EPADP management held the view that additional
technical or management expertise deemed necessary by the Bank should have
been contributed by the Bank in the course of regular supervision rather
than financed from loanlcredit funds.
33.      It is the view of the audit that the impasse which resulted undou-
btedly prevented the timely mobilization of appropriate consultant exper-
tise in certain  crucial  areas  during  the  course  of project execution.

Given the willingness of many bilateral donors and international aid
institutions to provide technical assistance on s grant basis, and the
reluctance of GOE to accept loan or credit finance from the Bank/IDA for
that purpose, the audit is surprisad that greater efforts were not made
during appraisal of UED II or NDD II to regularize the technical assistance
deemed necessary through a co-financing arrangement with either the Dutch
aid authorities or other bilateral or international donors.
C. Unrealistic Implementation Expectations
34.      The civil works construction taLgets  and schedules set at apprai-
sal for both drainage projects were far in excess of actual attainments for
a variety of reasons (Drainage Projects Overview, paras. 18-25). Many of
the reasons advanced to explain the difference (inadequate construction
planning and management by EPADP; time consuming procurement procedures;
cumbersome and rigid contract administration; and shortages of local funds
and cement) had been recognized as constraints during supervisiov -f the
earlier projects (NDD I and UED I) which were running well behiud their
appraisal expectattons3/ and are outside the area of responsibility of any
contractor, local or foreign.    The  audit  is  therefore led to setiously
question the judgement of the appraisal missions for UED II and NDD II in
their estimates of the accelerated construction rates for field drainage
expected from foreign contractors using PVC pipe technology.
35.      Unfortunately, as no  foreign  bidders  were  able to underbid the
established local public contractors, the superior performance capability
expected of the former remains unproven. Given the circumstances prevail-
ing in the mid-1970s, including the knowledge that local public contractors
lacked normal commercial incentives in meeting construction standards and
schedules, and EPADP's limited ability to supervise construction and
enforce conditions of contract, the appraisal missions would have been well
advised to have been much more conservative in their targeting and schedul-
ing of civil works. Also, they could have paid more attention to prequali-
fication and tender evaluation procedures and to improving the terms of
contract in ways which gave due recognition to civil works quality, and to
adequacy of remuneration for timely contract completion, whether for ICB or
LCB, rather than placing such heavy reliance on the expedient of changing
the tender process to ICB from ICB.
D. Bilharzia Control Program
36.      Bilharzia, also known as schistosomiasis, a parasitic worm infect-
ion common in irrigated areas, which is one of the most important public
health problems of tropical and sub-tropical regions, has long been the
most prevalent serious disease in  Egypt.   Prevalence of the disease began

to decline in the early 1960s when relatively intensive chemotherapy of
infected persons began to be practiced throughout the country. But rein-
fection remained a problem in the absence of integrated control programs
combining systematic ureatment of infected pacsons with adequate measures
to control the snail intermediate host and thereby effectively reduce
transmission. The first such program, carried out in Fayoum Governorate
under a bilateral assistance agreement between tne Federal Republic of
Germany and the GOE, was successfully completed in 1968, and became the
prototype for subsequent Bank-assisted extensions in Middle and Upper Egypt
supported under UED I (900,000 feddan), UED II (154,000 feddan) and NDD II
(1,200,000 feddan).
37.      The  very  successful  bilharzia  control  components,  which were
implemented separately, are overshadowed by the larger drainage components
in the PCRs and Overview, but deserve highlighting for the reason that they
were appraised and supervised independently by one consultant with minimal
Bank staff involvement. The audit was particularly impressed with the high
level of understanding and trust which prevailed between the consultant,
senior MOH officials and Bank staff througho-it the preparation and imple-
mentation phases. The fact that the consultant involved was a professional
of high repute, and that he was able to provide continuity of advisory
services to the program commencing with the appraisal of UED I in 1972
right through to the final supervision of UED II and NDD II in 1986, are
particularly noteworthy features of this project experience.

ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
UPPER EGYPT II AND NILE DELTA II DRAINAGE PROJECTS
(Loan 1285/Credit 637-EGT and Loan 1439-40/Credit 719-EGT)
IBRD Overview of Project Completion Reports
1. DiTRODUCTION
General
1.       The Upper Egypt II (Ln. 1285/Cr. 637-EGT) and Nile Delta II
(Ln. 1439-40/Cr. 719-EGT) were the third and fourth large-scale drainage
projects financed by IDA and the Bank in Egypt. The attached PCRs for these
projects--called in this overview Drainage III and Drainage IV,
- respectively--were prepared by FAO/CP in collaboration with EPADP, the
implementing agency. Each PCR provides a comprehensive description of the
project origin and implementation, and covers adequately the results achieved
to date and expected to be achieved at full developmant. The overview
memorandum, based on these PCRs, comments on a number of points which require
elaboration, compares actual developments with appraisal estimates and
highlights the principal achievements and lessons learned. This overview has
been prepared by the staff of Agriculture I Division, EMENA Projects
Department.
2.       Agriculture continues to be an extremely important sector in the
Egyptian economy, although its share of GDP has declined by about 10% since
the appraisal of the Drainage III and IV projects. It employs about 37% of
the active working population, generates about 20% of the GDP and provides a
base for a large part of the industrial and services sectors of the economy.
Most of Egypt's agricultural production comes from about 6.2 million-feddans
(M fed) of land cropped annually under irrigation from the Nile River,
utilizing the bulk of renewable water resources available to the country.
This area represents about 3S of the land area of the country; the rest Is
mainly arid desert.  The arable area includes: 5.3 M fed of the more fertile
"old lands" that lie in the Delta and along the Nile Valley (Upper Egypt) and
generate some 942 of the nation's total agricultural production; and 0.9 M fed
of "old-new lands" that tiave been reclaimed since 1953 from the desert and
marshy lands and contribute only about 4-5% to the total output.
3.       Despite limited arable land and equally limited opportunities for
expansion, the potential for improving the performance of the agricultural
sector is great and the rapidly widening gap between food production and
consumption can be reduced. This potential relates to the well-documented
capacity for significantly increasing agricultural productivity on the old
lands. However, in the absence of adequate drainage facilities to complement
perennial irrigation, agricultural production in these lands has been facing
the twin menace of waterlogging and salinity. The completion of the High
Aswan Dam in 1968 enabled double cropping throughout the "old lands".  Thus,
the drainage problems were further aggravated by the much higher yearly water.
applications and the low efficiency of irrigation at the subsystem level.
Since then the Government has given increasingly high priority to improving
the drainage conditions in the "old lands" to sustain and improve their



- 12 -
productivity. The method selected to drain these lands was by buried pipes,
an effective but laborious operation. Drainage will eventually be needed on
most of irrigated lands in Egypt to permic not only continuation of high
production but also introduction of new farming technologies which otherwise
would not be possible, or profitable.
MDA/Bank lnvolvement in Drainage
4.       Works for providing efficient drainage systems in old lands were
started by the Ministry of Irrigation (MlOI) in 1958 and have been supported by
IDA and the Bank since 1970. The urgency to improve drainage conditions was
so great that it was felt that the preparation of an integrated, master plan
was not needed prior to undertaking drainage works in individual areas.
Projects were prepared and implemented virtually on a piece-meal basis. To
date, a total of five projects costing US$876 M have been supported by Bank
Group financing totalling US$243 M, covering a total area of 2.6 M feti, of
which about 2.0 M fed have so far been tile-drained. Bank Group's
participation in Government of Egypt's (GOE's) drainage program has helped
attract support of several other donors (para. 15).
S.       IDA first supported GOE's drainage program through Credit 181-UAR
which was approved by the Board on March 24, 1970 in the sum of USS26 .',
signed on April 17, 1970 and declared effective on December 22, 1970. This
Nile Delta I (Grainage I) Project was to cover 950,000 fed, or about
one-quarter of the area of the Delta. The project was implemented as planned
but was delayed by four years. The Credit closing date, originally December
31, 1976, was extended three times to December 31, 1980. Credit 393-UAR for
US$36 M, the second in the drainage subsector, was to improve drainage
conditions on 300,000 fed in Upper Egypt. Drainage II was approved by the
Board on May 17, 1973, signed on June 8, 1973 and became effective on November
28, 1973. The Drainage II Project completion took 3-1/2 years longer than the
originally agreed period of about 6 years, and eventually completed in July
1981. One of the reasons for delay in implementing these projects was thie
1973 war and its inevitable influence on the allocation of manpower, and on
financial resources and priorities. There were also serious organizational
and management problems. While EPADP was unable to manage the program
rigorously enough, the delays related largely t-o the management weakness of
the public sector contracting organizations. They lacked, and still lack,
normal coumercial incentives to meet construction schedules, and EPADP has no
effective means of enforcing the conditions of contracts. The PPAR No. 3993
for Drainage I and No. 5146 for Drainage II were issued idi June 1982 and June
1984, respectively. These reports highlighted the difficulties encountered in
the installation of tile drains which proved critical to the completion of
both projects. At the time of appraisal of Drainage III and rV Projects, tile
drains were to be installed on 346,000 fed under Drainage I and 215,000 fed
under Drainage II.
E. PROCESSNG OF PROJECTS
Avvraisal and Description
6.       Ln. 1285/Cr. 637-EGT for a total of US$50 M for Drainage III, and
Ln. 1439-40/Cr. 719-EGT amounting to US$66 M for Drainage IV represented a
continuation of Bank Group lending operations in Egypt's vital drainage
subsector. Appraisal of both projects was based upon a review of the basic
assumptions made in the feasibility reports prepared by EPADP which were short



-13-
on some essential data and lacked economic evaluation. In particular,
justification for selection of the project areas was inadequate. Thus, like
the first twc proje-ts, the areas  -.-!_ded in :raina;e :'' and :V.' " r-fects
appeared to have been selected on practical considerations supported by
inadequate information on soils, groundwater levels and salinity status.
Furthermore, the implementatLon schedules proposed for the prolects were over
optimistic in terms of the extent of _:AZc's demions:rated capatili:y to
implement drainage works under the Drainage I and II Projects (para. 5).
7.       The two projects, appraised in December 1975 and October 1976,
followed closely the design of the first two drainage projects and consisted
mainly of drainage infrastructure. No technical assistance component was
provided because of EPADP's determined resistance to the use of consultants.
While the appraisal reports presented a clear picture of the engineering
features, procurement aspects, cost estimates, crop yields with and without
project(s) and cost recovery, the institutional points were insufficiently
emphasized. Unlike under Drainage I and II, EPADP agreed with the appraisal
mission's recommendations to award contracts for field drainage on the basis
of Int3rnational Competitive Bidding (ICB). This was a major issue during the
appraisal of the first two projects and, in the end, it was agreed to let all
construction contracts under Local Competitive Bidding (LCB). As recommended
by the appraisal mission.:, EPADP also agreed to use in Drainage IrI and IV
projects PVC slotted corrugated pipes rather than cement pipes for lateral
drains and pipe laying machines for installing both collector and lateral
drains. In restrospect, it appears that Egyptian authorities agreement to let
field drainage go to ICB was made on the presumption that local contractors,
who had gained substantial experience during the implementation of the first
two projects, were favorably placed to compete and win contracts under ICB
procedures. It also appears t.4at their agreement to introduce other technical
improvements was based upon the need for accelerating the drainage program and
for upgrading the quality of subsurface drains.
8.       Following the appraisal mission, the scope, timing and period of
implementation of each project were intensely debated in the Bank. While
Dreinale III had a relatively smooth passage through the Bank's review
process, Drainage IV was subjected to severe scrutiny because the Drainage I
and II Projects were far behind schedule (para. 5). The Government's proposal
to provide field draitnage on 1.0 M fed was much too ambitious. With the
uncertainty which prevailed after the past experience of drainage projects in
Egypt, and in view of the fact that no field drainage was expected .util 1980
under Drainage IV, a quescion was raised whether the protect's scope and
timing were based on realistic assumptions.  Other majoz issues were shortage
of local funds exper1anced by previous projects and whether or not EPADP would
be over-extended in undertaking an expanded program. Based on these factors
and slow performance in implementing drainagc works, it was debated as to
whether or not the Drainage IV Project should not be deferred until 1978.
Alternative solutions of reducing or even eliminating tile drains from
Drainage IV were exten3ively discussed and, in the end, it was decided to
accept the project scope as finalized by the appraisal mission to include: the
rEmodelling of 1,565 km of open drains serving 810,000 fed; the installation
--of field tile drains on 400,000 fed; and the construction of four new and the
rehabilitation of two existing pumping stations. Also, included were a
Bilharzia control component to support the program in Upper Egypt, and a
component to cover part of foreign expenditures for a UNDP project designed to
draw up a "Master ilan for Water Resources and Development and Use" in Egypt.



- 14 -
9.       Tlie project scope for Drainage III was accepted more or less as
proposed by Government, i.e. the remodelling and constrtction of 1,572 km of
open drains covering 300,000 fed, the installation of field tile drains on
this area, the construction of one pumping station and cne reclama:ion of
12,000 fed of saline soils. It was a'so decided to include in this project a
component to cover the cost overrun of the Bilharzia Control ?rogram
established over 9CC,3CQ fed u-der Dra--age II and to extend ::- s ;rogran to a
further 120,000 fed.
10.      The areas to be tile-drained under Drainage III and IV Projects and
periods of implementation in each case were determined on the assumption that
the annual rate of tile drainage would be increased progressively from 200,000
fed in 1976 to 370,000 fed in 1979 1/, and then maintained at that level for
several years. The achievement of this target was considered feasible
provided plastic pipes and foreign contractors were used in the implementation
of field drainage. Installation of tiie drains under Drainage III was
estimated to proceed as follows: 10,000 fed in 1977, 70,000 fed in 1978 and
140,000 fed annually in the succeeding three years, and accordingly scheduled
to be completed at che end of 1981.  These assumptions were intended to enable
tile drainage to begin in the Draina,e IV Project area in 1980 and to complete
the same at the end of 1982 by maintaining an implementation rate of 140,000
fed/year. This implementation program in general and for Drainage III and :V
in particular proved later to be unrealistically optimistic--based more on
hope than fact.
Negotiations
11.      Drainage III was negotiated in Washington during the period May 7-11,
1976, and Drainage IV from April 4-7, 1977. During these negotiations,
agreement was reached on the scope of each project described above (paras. 8
and 9). Satisfactory assurances were also obtained on all terms and
conditions of the Credit(s) and Loan(s), as approved by the Loan Committee,
except for the recommendation on the review of cost recovery charges. Of the
issues on which agreement was reached, the most important were: tendering of
field drainage works through ICB (para. 7); setting up of an appropriate cost
accounting system by EPADP; and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of the effect
of drainage works.
12.      In order to avoid the problem of shortage of local funds experienced
under Drainage I and II, the Ministry of Finance was asked to establish a
"special fund", thereby to help ensure timely allocations of local funds for
the IDA/Bank-financed drainage projects. The Government's preliminary
reaction to the idea of the special fund was distinctly unenthusiastic. At
the time of appraisal of Drainage IV, it was felt that the overall situation
was unlikely to improve much in the immediate future. Therefore, during
Drainage IV negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government that:
(i) local funds required for the fiscal year 1977/78 for the three prior
projects were included in EPADP's budget of this year; and (ii) local funds
required in future for the IDA/Bank-financed drainage projects were included
in the GOE Medium-Term Development Plan. The Egyptian delegation also agreed
1/ Based on these rates, Drainage I was expected to be completed at the end of
1979 and Drainage II in 1980.



- 15 -
to the establishment of a "special fund" designed to help overcome
difficulties experienced in the past regarding availability of local funds,
and that the special fund was to be applied for all the oneoing
IDA/Bank-financed drainage projects.
13.      As governed by Irrigatior, and Drainage Law No. 7 of October 9, 1971,
Drainage III and the two preceding projects provided for recovery only of
investments in field tile drains, plus a 10% administrative charge, in annual
installments over 20 years.  Accore ng to the same law, such recovery was to
begin one year after completion of field drainage. The maintenance cost of
field tile drains was to be recovered through land tax, which was to be
reassessed within two years of the completion of drainage works. Such
incremental tax payments were considered an appropriate vehicle .or the
recovery of maintenance costs because they are directly linked to increased
productivity arising from field drainage.
14.      As regards Drainage IV Project, it was proposed to obtain an
assurance at negotiations that recovery charges would cover all costs of field
tile drains, to be reviewed every four years ensuring that costs were fully
recovered in real terms and reflected other factors such as farmers'
incentives and ability to pay. Cost recovery was thus the maior issue to be
resolved at negotiations, not only for Drainage IV but also for the three
preceding projects. The Egyptian delegation did not agree to such an
undertaking because it was to contravene the provisions of the law governing
cost recovery (para. 13). They explained that the recovery of all costs from
farmers was not even financially feasible because of the artificially
depressed prices for many agricultural products. The delegation, however,
agreed to complete, by December 31, 1978, a study of beneficiaries' ability to
pay for the costs of field drainage. Bank finally agreed to accept this
compromise.
Other Donors' Role
15.      At appraisal and/or negotiations, the Bank was informed that the
Government had requested assistance from USAID and KfW to finance equipment,
materials and other foreign exchange costs for local production of PVC pipes
for Drainage III and IV, respectively. During negotiations, the execution of
USAID agreement was made a condition of effc;ctiveness for Ln. 1285/Cr.
637-EGT, and that of KfW a default under Ln. 1439-40/Cr. 719-EGT if it did not
become effective by December 31, 1977 or by another date to be agreed upon
between the Government and IDA/Bank. The agreement with USAID for cofinancing
Drainage III with US$30 M was signed in July 1976 and with KfW for cofinancing
Drainage IV with DM 100 M on July 30, 1979. According to the agreement
between Government and KfW, the amount of DM 44.4 M was allocated for the
production of PVC pipes while the remaining amount of DM 55.6 M was allocated
for financing local costs.
ffU JMPLEMENTATION
Agreements and Effectiveness
16.      The Loan Agreement, the Development Credit Agreement and the Project



- 16 -
Agreement were signed for Drainage III on June 11, 1976 and for Drainage IV on
July 15, 1977.  Four drainage subsector or project-specific side letters
signed with the Drainage III Agreements concerned implementation of drainage
program, project implementation schedule, cost recovery study and collection
of field drainage costs. The two specific conditions of effectiveness for Ln.
1285/Cr. 637-EGT and one for Ln. 1439-40/Cr. 719-EGT were met with soon after
signing of the agreements in each case. However, they became effective cn
January 13, 1977 and April 17, 1978, about 7-1/2 and 9 months after signature
date, respectively. These delays occurred mainly because the process o.
translating, clearance through various committees, tabling documencs for
ratification and approval by the legislature was slow. Given the procedural
requirements of the system, similar delays in loan effectiveness are still
common in Egypt (para. 17).
Chances After Appraisal
17.      No changes in the scope, objectives, and basic design were made
during the implementation of either of the projects . However, like Drainage
I and II, the original selection of the areas had to be amended from time to
time, excluding or reducing some and substituting equivalent new areas. Such
changes involved a total of 125,000 fed or 252 of the Drainage III area, and
70,000 fed or about 18Z of the Drainage IV area. All these changes in the
project areas became necessary due to inadequate proJect preparation and more
specifically because no detailed investigations were carried out prior to the
selection of field drainage areas (para. 6). While it is believed that these
revisions helped to ensure that the drains were laid in areas in which the
more severe drainage problems were emerging, it is not certain that this nas
always been the case, particularly in Upper Egypt. Because of the lessons
learned from these projects, predrainage investigations about soils,
groundwater and salinity status were carried out to select areas for the
Drainage V Project (Ln. 2562-EGT), which was signed on March 14, 1986 and
declared effective on February 20, 1987.
Implementation of DrainaKe Works
18.      Construction-delays were the most serious problem of project
execution and resulted in time overruns of 140% for Drainage III and 802 for
Drainage IV over the expected five year periods of implementation. There were
many factors that accounted for these serious delays, the principal ones
being: unrealistic appraisal schedule(s), an initial delay of about two years
in making arrangements for the production of PVC pipes for each project,
inadequate construction planning and management by EPADP, time consuming
procurement procedures, cumbersome and rigid contract administration, sub-par
performance by public sector contractors and, during start-up period, shortage
of local funds and cement. Most of these problems have been highlighted in
the PCRs; however, it should be pointed out that, as was anticipated by the
Egyptians (para. 7), all contracts for field drainage and pumping stations
awarded through ICB were won by public sector contractors and, following their
award, poor performance by every contractor was the single most serious cause
for delay.
19.      Of. the three main components viz open drains, tile drains and pumping
stations, the second and third presented the most serious problems and caused
major delays in completion of the projects. Installation of tile drains



- 17 -
started almost three and two and a half years later than appraisal schedules
under Drainage IUI and Drainage 1V, respectively.  In each case, the main
reasons for this serious delav were: the .wo vear delav in arranging
cofinancing or procurement thereunder (paras. 15 and 18) and similar delays in
the awaid of contracts by EPADP; a year or more spent by contractors in
importing custom made pipe laying machines; and delay in contractors'
mobilization.
20.      The field drair.a7e wcrks sere built mw.0tly throl;&. se.e_ mna`or
contracts for Drainage III and five for Drainage IV none of which was carried
out on schedule. Because of the factors mentioned above, little progress was
made in field drainage installation during the first three years of each
project.  But even subsequently, the rate of field drainage insta?:ation was
very slow. For the five full years of activities, the average annual output
was 52,000 fed for Drainage III and 76,000 fed for Drainage IV which was much
below the appraisal estimate of 140,000 fed for each project (para. 10).
Although the use of PVC pipes and pipe laying machines made the whole
operation of installing tile drains easier, the contractors did not take
advantage of this because of their managerial weaknesses.  II)  dct, the
contractors' performance showed a poor utilization of resources made available
to them.  For example, the utilization of pipe laying machines was *ar below
accepted standards. On average, the collector machines were utilized 1i8 days
a year and the lateral machines 162 days a year. Even on a work day of
normally 7 hours, the output-by a machine was seldom above 60% of its rated
capability. Had the contractors increased machine utilization rate by 50%
over actual, which is considered normal, the area tile-drained in a year would
have been more than 1OG,OvO fed for each project.
21.      The construction of four new pumping stations under the Drainage IV
Project was scheduled to be completed prior to the installation of tile drains
in their service areas. This requirement was not met with because of the
extremely poor performance by a public sector contractor and the failure of
EPADP to enforce conditions of contract. While the contract for these pumping
stations was awarded in February 1980, civil works on three started in March
1981 and on the fourth in May 1983. The equipment for all pumping stations
arrived in June 1981. As of March 31, 1987, two pumping stations were
cofmmissioned; EPADP expected to complete the third in June 1987, and the
fourth in December 1988. In summary, due to the combined inefficiency of the
contractqr and a lack of energetic action by EPADP, the four new pumping
stations instead of being completed by the end of 1979, as it was estimated at
appraisal, will be completed by the end of 1988, i.e., nine years later. The
case of the fourth pumping station at Abu Hommos is very unfortunate because
in the area served by this station, field drainage provided ii some 36,000 fed
is not functioning properly because of high water levels in the main open
drain. The completion of the pumping station built under Drainage III, was
achieved in May 1987-some eight years after the award of contract and five
year behind appraisal schedule. Tile systems that are subjected to long
submergence tend to develop sediment blockages; and when drain tiles are used,
misalignment problems develop. Sediment problems can be corrected by
jet-cleaning equipment, but misalignment problems can contribuce to system
inefficiency and less than optimum effectiveness for the life of a project.
However, misalignment problems are not as likely to occur with corrugated PVC
pipes as they are with rigid drain tile.

22.      The reasons for public sector contractors' poor performance are
rooted in the structure of the construction industry itself. Since its
nationalization in the 1960s, the industry has been basically :entro11ed yv
the Government. It has developed and operated without well defined rules and
regulations; the Government has served as client, contractor and material
distributor. Excessive Government dominance limits self-management and
productivity. The blurring of func:icns results in payment arrears,
inadequate project supervision, and unfulfilled contractual obligations.
Experience with public sector contractors involved in the IDA,'Bank-flnanced
drainage projects showed that poor contracting practices, shortage of skilled
workers, organizational inadequacies, inefficiencies in construction
management, and lack of financing had adversely affected their performance.
The costs to the economy, resulting from the lengthy construction period of
development projects, have been exceedingly high. Cognizant of the above
problems in the sector, the Government, with Bank assistance, intends to
initiate corrective actions in an effort to improve performance by public
sector contractors.
23.      Drainage III is not expected to be completed before June 1989; this
project, as of larch 31, 1987, required installation of field drainage in
125,000 fed or one-fourth of the project area. On the original completion
date of June 30, 1982, 100 of civil works for the pumping staticn, 78f for
open drains and 182 for field drainage had been completed.  All works under
the Drainage IV project were completed at the end of 1986 excepting the
Delingat Extension and Abu Romos pumping stations which are scheduled to be
comissioned in Junt 1987 and in December 1988, respectively. This shows how
unrealistic were the assumptions made about implementation of each project at
appraisal. Both projects were administered by EPADP and drainage works were
built by the same set of contractors; however, the performance of Drainage TV
was relatively much better than Drainage III, the difference explained mainly
by the difficulties involved in managing logistics from Cairo over long
distances in Upper Egypt and, compared to the Delta, lesser availability of
skilled labor in this region.
24.      The options available to the Bank staff to improve rate of
implementation were limited because the Bank had little leverage over the
working of the contractors. Control over project activities and decisions had
to be the responsibility of EPADP, and Bank staff influence could at best be
indirect through advice and persuasion. When opportunities presented
themselves, the Bank always acted promptly. For instance, when it became
obvious that there would be a long delay in the local production of PVC pipes
with USAID financing in Upper Egypt and KfW financing in the Delta, Bank
agreed to import from the proceeds of the Credit(s)/Loan(s): 200,000 m of
ready made PVC pipes for Drainage III; and three mobile PVC pipe making units
and PVC powder for Drainage IV. Likewise, when shortage of cement and iron
bars emrged, Bank agreed to finance such imports. Also, when shortage of
local funds proved to be a significart delaying factor, the Bank stressed the
need for adequate funding to the Government. Finally, the Bank showed
flexibility in accepting EPADP's proposals for the amendment of the field
drainage artas in order to facilitate the implementation program (para. 17).
25.      In summary, it can be said that the appraisal time schedule for each
project was over optimistic. Progress in implementing Drainage III was very
slow since it will take almost seven years longer to complete the major



- 19 -
components than the originally agreed period of five years. Drainage IV
execution also ran far behind schedule and completion cock nine years, ^ot the
expected five.  The field drainage implementation rate of 140,000 fed/year for
each project proved to be unattainable with the use of local contractors. And
the construction period assumed at appraisal for the pumping stations proved
to be too short.
Implementation of BDharzia Control Program
26.      In general, Bilharzia control components of the Drainage III and IV
Projects were implemented more or less according to plan. Some problems faced.
earlier with the snail control operations because of logistic difficulties
were resolved. An international evaluation mission visiced Egypt during
1984/85 to evaluate the entire program, and its findings are incorporated in
the PCRs. While this mission appreciated the very substantial progress made
in reducing the prevalence rate of infection and controlling disease over a
very large area inhabited by 10.2 M people--mostly poor farmers--a clear need
was identified to maintain and reinforce control in Upper Egypt with some
modifications in techniques. As this program is vital to the health and
well-beirg of the inhabitants of the area and agricultural productivity,
priority needs to be given to the maintenance and/or improvement of this
program and the protection of the large investments aiready made. At present,
the program continues with Government's own resources but whether or not the
achievements under the program could be sustained or improved is not known.
27.      The major weakness of the program has been and continues to be that
health education activities were neither targetted to srecific grouos--school
children, farmers--nor timed and coordinated with Bilharzia control
activities. The use of mollusciciding and the importance of full treatment
courses were not effectively and convincingly communicated to the people.
Also, the school children were not sufficiently exposed to the problems of
Bilharzia. The television, radio and other media were not used to full
advantage to stimulate community participation in the control program.
Procurement
28.      Procurement of goods and works presented no major problems because
EPADP handled this task always in accordance with the required procedures.
However, delays in tender evaluation, award approvals and licens_ng impeded
project implementation. Despite the efforts of IDA/Bank supervision missions
to shorten the delays, EPADP was unable to accelerate the process, given the
procedural requirements of the Egyptian system.
29.      Civil works not financed by the Bank for open drains and for small
buildings were procured through LCB in accordance with the normal procedures
of Government. The civil works of the pumping statiors and the supply and
erection of pump units were combined in one contract and procured through
ICB. The construction of all field drainage was carried out under contracts
with local firms. These contracts were advertised according to the Bank
procedures for ICB but no foreign firm made a successful bid. The low price
levels offered by local contractors made it infeasible for foreign firms to
compete for these contracts. All major items of equipment and imported goods
were procured by ICB, and such imports were made generally through local
representatives of foreign suppliers.



- 20 -
30.      For Drainage I and II, EPADP basically followed a policy of limiting
the size of field drainage contracts to about 15,000 fed in order to reduce
the risk of non-comoliance. The size of contracts for Drainage III and .V
varied from 50,000 to 90,000 fed to attract foreIgn CQL6LLfiLULS.  With no
prequalification pcocedures having been followed, the main disadvantage of
these contracts turned out to be that: local private contractors did not
participate in bidding beca,es  of a lack cf capacity to deal with lar,e size
contracts; the required rav: cf inpl ementation proved beyond the capability of
successful pub'lic sector contractors; and £?A?P -as u-nabDe to oance!
non-performing contracts.
QuaUty of Design and Construction
31.      Both PCRs provide comprehensive discussion about quality of design
and construction of field tile drains.  The design procedures initially
adopted for the Drainage III and IV Projects were the same as those used in
the first two projects.  Two main features were controversial viz the spacing
of lateral drains and the use of gravel envelop around them. Through
persistent efforts made by the supervision missions the first was resolved in
July 1983 when EPADP agreed to design spacing of laterals on site-specific
conditions. While the new approach was a substantial improvement over vast
attitudes, EPADP applied it only to the areas designed after this date. As
far as the use of gravel envelop is concerned, EPADP continued to follow the
criteria laid down by the Dutch-Egyptian Experts Panel to omit the envelope in
cohesive clayey soils which had a clay content of 40% or more. EPADP,
therefore, limited its use to laterals with a spacing of 60 m or more and, on
insistence by the Bank supervision missions, for lesser drain spacings where
needed due to the presence of unstable soils at drain depth. The above
criteria cannot be transferred to other situations because many arid soils
with clay contents of over 40% require gravel envelopes due to dispersion
caused by the salts. The clay content is thus a good indicator, but the real
Zactor is soil cohesiveness.  On several occasions, Bank supervision missions
reported sub-standard quality of field drainage works and lack of adequate
supervision. Although in recent years standards of construction improved
considerably, the Bank missions maintained pressure on EPADP officials to
bring about further improvements.
Revised Costs Versus Appraisal Estimates
32.     , The FAO/CP mission made a re-estimate of full costs of each project,
taking into account total project expenditure till July 1986 and likely
expenditures on the completion of project works outstanding on this date. For
Drainage III, total project costs are expected to reach EE 155.9 M or
US$166.9 M compared to EE 110.2 M or US$282.0 at appraisal-an increase of
about 41% in EE terms and being only about 59% of the appraisal estimate in
dollar terms. The full costs for Drainage IV would amount to EE 187.5 M which
is about 36% above the appraisal estimate of EE 138.0 M. In dollar terms, the
re-estimated cost amounts to US$192.2 M or about 93% of the appraisal estimate
of US$207.0 M.
33.      Cost analysis in each PCR is based on information provided by EPADP
and from the Bank's disbursement records. In spite of some shortcomings in
EPADP's bookkeeping at the central office, the FAO/CP mission has done a good
job in re-estimating likely costs of these projects. In dollar terms, the



- 21 -
considerable reduction in the costs of the Drainage III Project can be
explained by several factors in addition to revaluation of the US dollar over
a period of about eight years. The first of these is that the Egyptian
contractors offered very low prices for the installation of field tile drains
and that the adjustments made in their contracts for local inflation were
inadequate. Compared with US$440/fed at appraisal, the total estimated cost
amounts to US$316/fed representing a reduction of about 30% in ';S dollar
terms. The second factor was the lower than estimated costs of drainage
equipment due to keen international competition and considerab.- streng:h of
the US dollar. A third factor responsible for reduction was the lower than
expected foreign exchange cost of PVC pipe making factories and PVC resin. As
far as the Drainage IV Project is concerned, the minor reduction in US dollar
cost was due to the third factor.
Disbursements
34,      For both projects, actual pace of disbursements fell far short of
appraisal expectations and the two year delay in closing is reflected in the
extended disbursement period. The PCRs present a comparison of actual
disbursements versus appraisal estimates on a half yearly basis for the full
term of the projects as well as by categories. Only about 722 and 62% of the
Loan and Credit for the Drainage III and IV Projects were disbursed 'y the
original closing dates of June 30, 1993 and December 31, 1983, respectively.
Drainage III and IV Loan/Credit accounts were fully disbursed on February 1,
1986 and August 22, 1986, respectively.
Maintenance of Completed Works
35. *    Partly due ta the Bank's request, EPADP took over from the MOI's
Irrigation Sector responsibility for maintaining all tile drains in 1977, and
for the open drains receiving effluent from tile drains, in 1979. The Bank
has also had a role in establishing EPADP's centrally controlled well
structured maintenance organization, with lines of responsibility in
accordance with geographical units. It is difficult to appreciate fully the
quality of field drainage maintenance; monitoring of the system based on
complaints by farmers is not up to expected standard. The existing system
should be supported by more direct monitoring of drain performance. In
addition, more efforts need to be made to educate and motivate the farmers
without whose cooperation the maintenance task becomes unmanageable.
36.      The efficiency of a tile drain system in the basin of a collector
open drain relies upon the water levels in it. In the past, maintenance of
open drains in Egypt has not been of a satisfactory standard because of rapid
and profuse growth of weeds. EPADP's efforts to improve cleaning of open
drains have been only partially successful and will therefore need
strengthening 'n order to utilize the investment in drainage works at maximum
potential. The Bank Channel Maintenance Project l/, approved in 1986, is
designed to provide improved maintenance of open drains.
IV. COMPLLANCE WrIH COVENANTS
37.      At one time or another during the course of the projects, EPADP was
in default on one or more of the following covenants. Repeatedly, the Bank
drew actention to unfulfilled conditions and set deadlines by which such
1i Appraisal Report No. 6044-EGT.



_ 22 -
conditions should be complied with, and the EPADP in turn took some action,
though seldom to the extent and within the time frame agreed to.
Accountine. Auditins and Reportiny
38.      EPADP was to design and install'by July 31, 1977 a cost accounts
system satisfactory to the 3ank.  $ns;ead, it took two years to appcint an
Egyptian firm of chartered accountants to design the system according to the
terms of reference prepared with the Bank's assistance. The new system,
implemented during 1980-81, is a typical government single entry system kept
on a cash basis. The relevant agreements had to be amended several times to
accommodate the delay.  The new system was reviewed by a Bank mission in April
1982 and found to be generally adequate. The shortcomings noted in the PCRs
regarding compilation of accounts at the central level will need to be
rectified for the ongoing Drainage V Project.
39.      Auditing of EPADP's accounts including those of the projects was
carried out by the Central Audit Organization, an independent state agency, on
a continuous basis. EPADP furnished the Bank regularly, though usually later
than agrecd, with the annual audit reports prepared by this organization which
were satisfactory to the Bank. These audit reports also contained comparison
of actual with budget figures, and the accounts formed part of the MO1's
consolidated annual report presented by the Central Audit Orgaization to the
*National Assembly.
40.      EPADP furnished the Bank regularly with quarterly progress reports
for each project, usually on time. These reports indicated mainly physical
progress in the construction of open drp'ns, field tile drains and pumping
stations.  For the Drainage V Project, the PCRs suggest to expand the
reporting format to include -        on proqureaent, equipment utilization by
contractors and summarized financial data. This would increase the usefulness
of quarterly reports.
Monitoring and Evaluation
41.      The M&E covenants with respect to the impact of field drainage were
revised several times. It appears that, because EPADP officials and Project
staff were uncertain about the methodology to be used, such changes were made
to improve the content of the program.  Thus, the covenant under Drainage IV
amended the one under Drainage III, which had earlier replaced the Drainage II
stipulation. When the MOI's Drainage Research Institute (DRI) started a new
MLg program, with Dutch technical assistance in March 1979, the Drainage IV
covenant was modified, based on the expected output of this program.
42.      The DRI's two-year crash program for M&E was completed in 1982 and
hPADP's ex-post evaluation program continued throughout the course of the
Drainage III and rV Projects. Each program and its results are discussed in
sufficient detail in the PCRs. Therefore, only a critical analysis of t:;_
results achieved is presented here.  The objective of the crash program was to
follow yield differences in three sets of twin villages-one with and one
without drainage in the Nile Delta, by measuring them over a period of six
crop seasons. Besides the fact that three sets of twin villages constituted
too small a sample to yield more than a rough estimate, the results, for
several reasons, did not show a consistent trend. The aim of EPADP's



-23-
evaluation, contrary to the crash program, was to compare yields before and
after drainage in areas with and without drainage. The crop yields were
aggregated at the level of sub-areas over a n-umber of years.  On average, the
data shows a modest improvement in yields, but the range of data is very wide
from one sub-area to the other, and also over a period of time within one
sub-area. As no variables other than yields were measured, :he approach
followed could not pinpoint the causes of yie:d differences cbserved.  The
experience with these programs highlights the need for direct monitoring of
tile drain performance, based on systematic collection of groundwacer and soil
salinity data. The lessons learned were incorporated in the design of M&E
system for the Drainage V Project.
Cost Recovery
43.      EPADP took a long time to prepare a study of the ability of the
beneficiaries of the drainage works to pay for the costs of investment,
operation and maintenance. According to the Drainage III side letter No. 3,
this study was to be completed within a year of effectiveness of this
project. This date was extended to June 30, 1978 by Section 2.07 of the
Drainage IV Project Agreement and, through further arendments, till June
1981. A first study was presented to the Bank in August 1980 which the Bank
review indicated was incomplete. Ultimately, in agreement with the Bank
supervision missions, EPADP contracted the Agriculture Economic Institute of
the Ministry of Agriculture, in 1982 to prepare a more substantive study.
This institute prepared two studies, one for Upper Egypt and one for the
Delta, which were made available to the Bank in 1984. These studies concluded
that, given the relatively high implicit taxation on agriculture due to low,
controlled prices of farm produce, and the relative poverty of most
beneficiaries, GOE's cost recovery rules are satisfactory, despite the element
of subsidy in the interest free recovery pattern (para. 13).
44.      Cost recovery covenants, however, have not been fully enforced
because the mechanism is complex and slow-moving. Three agencies are
involved-EPADP, which prepares the statement of actual costs; the Survey
Authority of the MOI, which verifies the areas held by each beneficiary; and
the Land Tax Directorate of the Ministry of Finance, which prepares bills.
Consequently, repayments are behind schedule, and records of what has been
spent, what has been recovered, and what is due, are often confusing. GOE haa
recently revised the cost recovery procedures and introduced an incentive
system. This has improved the annual rate of cost recovery from nominal
amounts to about 252 of the total due. Nevertheless, progress needs to be
made in the areas of cadastral surveys to identify beneficiaries and tax
collections at the village level. The Government has agreed under Drainage V
to furnish the Bank with an action plan, by June 30, 1987, outlining measures
and procedures to be adopted to improve collection of field drainage costs,
indicating an estimate of the expected annual collection.
V. JNSrITUtIONAI  PERFORMANCE
Performance of the Implementiug Acencv
45.      EPADP, a quasi-independent unit of MOt, was the executing agency for
both projects. With IDA's agreement, EPADP was created by a Presidential
Decree, issued in February 1973, which gave the new organization authority to



_ 24 -
undertake all drainage works in E;ypt. The sppraisal missions clearly
expected that EPADP would be able to manage a greatly expanded drainage
program. As it turned out, this was not the case. The appraisal repozts
discussed at some length the origin, functions and organization of EUALP but
there was no thorough analysis of its capability to impl'ement the projects.
The tDA/Bank supervision missions generaily blamed the delays in
implementation on poor managempnt 'Dy EP..DP.  A more objective view, based -nr
developments under the ptojte.ts, indicates that this was not altogether true,
as there were many delays which were beyond reasonable control of EPADP. Its
performance, therefore, should be judged against the reality of the situatica
as the projects evolved and not against the optimistic assumptions made at
appraisal.
46.      At the time of appraisal, EPADP was in its formative years and
efficiency at that stage, as indicated by performance of the Drainage I and II
Projects, was low.  In retrospect, therefore, it appears unjustified and
perhaps counter-productive to have assumed that the EPADP management and
effectiveness would drastically change in a short time, given the
institutional and bureaucratic constraints in Egypt.  With identical design,
almost equal scope and the same work environment, each project faced similar
problems from the outset. An initial delay of two years occurred in
establishing PVC pipe making factories which, to a great extent, was outside
project control. When the delays became apparent, EPADP, with Bank
concurrence, postponed the issue of ICB tenders for installing the field
drains. At the time this appeared to be a prudent decision. The installation
contracts were thus awarded in February 1980 for Drainage III and October 1980
for Drainage IV, almost two years behind schedule. No foreign firms submitted
successful bids, negating the main assumpti- i made at appraisal of the
projects that the rate of field drains ins.e.lation would be increased. The
successful local firms took more than a year to import pipe laying machines,
despite the mobilization advances provided to import the equipment. Further
delays occurred because of problems with commissioning of the machines by the
suppliers, hence the construction of tile drains did not begin until the end
of 1981. Following full mobilization the local contractors moved much more
slowly than the expectation of EPADP, the Bank or the Cofinanciers. It
should, however, be mentioned that, between 1982 and 1986, the EPADP Chairman
made sustained efforts to improve contractors' performance, including
procurement of additional pipe laying machines; provision of funds and
facilities for the import of spare parts by contractors; accepting a modest
-adjustment of old contracts unit prices due to inflation; institution of a
large-scale program, with assistance from Dutch experts, for on-the-job
training of engineers and machine operators of EPADP and the contractors; and
monthly review of progress and problem with the Cbairmen of the contracting
companies and EPADP's field Directors. However, these measures did not result
in any dramatic improvement in implementation rates.
47.      EPADP had continuous difficulty in obtaining from MOX or in
recruiting qualified civil engineers and technicians due to the low wage
structure, a feature which adversely reflected on efficiency.  The special
allowances paid to the staff since 1977 on request from the Bank proved
insufficient incentive to attract and/or retain qualified staff in the remote
project areas. This understandably affected both the quality of staff as well
as the intensity of construction supervision. Shortage in civil engineers was
particularly felt in construction planning and control. Frequent changes by
[OI in middle-management staff disturbed continuity in construction
management. These staffing problems were also mostly outside EPADP's control.



- 25 -
48.      There is no doubt, however, that EPADP had its own share of
responsibility for the poor performance of the projects. There was no
adeq'.ate planning an' su^er-'^iicn of dra-nage ;_rks, and E?ALP -roved to have
no means of enforcing the conditions of its contracts. Its field staff was
generally unable to foresee problems and take timely steps to resolve them.
Ttie PCRs mention that the situation could have been different had EPAZP made
use of three resident co,is-uta=:s, as provided in CraInage 'I, t  ad-:ise on
overall planning and coordination of works and on technical matters related to
works. Whether this aooroacn would have been successfui is oy no means
cer-.-ir :hat s certain, however, is that, based on experience of Drainage I,
reside,it consaltants would not have been acceptable by EPADP in a construction
management functio.i.
_  It is general'y recognized that the planning and implementacion of
the Drainage III and IV Projects had a strong influence in the early
development of EPADP. '1any of the procedures and methodology, which becaae
standards for drainage and MOI's other projects, emerged from the operations
and problems confronted on these projects. Many of the staff members who
later assumed more responsible positions in MOI received their practical
training while working in ErADP.
Performance of the Bank
50.      In Egypt, investment in improving the drainage conditions of arable
lands is a sound long-term investment and a necessary condition for attaining
high levels of agricultural-production. The Bank, therefore, was right in
selecting drainage for its priority lending activity in the agricultural
sector. However, given the poor performance of the Drainage I and II
Projects, the Bank was not justified in assuming that a greatly expanded
drainage program would be implemented rapidly or efficiently. At appraisal,
the Bank placed too much confidence in the managerial capabilities of EPADP
and underestimated the time required to implement each project. Nevertheless,
the flexibility adopted by the Bank in various aspects, during the
implementation of the projects, proved to be correct and beneficial for the
projects (paras. 17 and 24).
51.      Bank supervision of the projects was timely and adequate as 21
missions visited the projects, starting in April 1977 for Drainage III and
April 1978 for Drainage rv, with'the last mission in 1986. Continuity of
staffing on these missions should be considered adequate. One member of the
Bank staff was associated with the projects for a long period in the later
stages and played a significant role in supervision. This has led to an
improvement in. the Bank's general understanding of procedures and constraints
of MOI in general, and EPADP in particular that is reflected in the appraisal
of Drainage V, the latest drainage project in the series.
52.      Throughout the implementation period, the Bank's supervision missions
managed to maintain a harmonious relationship with the Egyptian officials.
The missions were instrumental in drawing early attention to potential
problems and in assisting EPADP in finding appropriate solutions. Bank staff
repeatedly reminded the Government and EPADP of their obligations and
encouraged them to improve the performance of the projects. However, it
proved difficult to correct all the deficiencies which had not been addressed
adequately at appraisal. Early supervision reports were sufficiently critical



- 26 -
of the weaknesses of EPADP but invariably ended on an optimistic note,
implying that by the time of the next misshcn, things would have improved.
Often, this optimism proved to be unjustified. However, the supervisicn
missions worked closely with EPADP and succeeded in arranging EPAPD's
agreement on some contentious issues leading to several qualitative
improvements to the program. Such improvements included the new design
principles for field tile drains, the better. organizaticn of maintenance
service for drainage works, the upgrading of quality control on the production
and installation of slotted PVC pipes and the Aintroduczion oi private
contractors in bidding for substituted areas. Of these improvements, the
first was a major issue under the Drainage I and II Projects.
53.      As far as the Bilharzia Control Program is concerned, the PCRs cover
the vital role played by the Bank's supervision missions which were valuable
in simulating the necessary organization of control inputs, data collectilon
and evaluation. The main supervision effort was carried out by a consultant
in tropical diseases.
VL ECONOMIC EVALUATION
54.      The economic evaluation of the Drainage III and IV Projects, based on
data currently available, is given in respective PCRs. During appraisal of
both projects, it was assumed that without the projects production would
gradually decrease due to increased waterlogging and salinity by 302 over a
35-year project period. With the projects, yields were estimated to increase
from existing levels by 15% to 35 for Drainage III and 12% to 25% for
Drainage IV. Several consideratiors led the rAO/CP PCR mission to adopt more
conservative assumptions. Over the said 35-year period, yield declines
without improved drainage conditions are now estimated to be on average about
51 in Drainage III area and 102 for all crops and 52 for rice in Drainage IV
area. 1Icremental yields with drainage range from 71 to 151 for Drainage III
and 5X to 151 for Drainage IV.
55.      In calculating the ERR, the authors of the PCRs have shadow priced
domestic costs at 170 of financial costs.  It appears, however, that foreign
exchange has not been shadow priced; by 1985/86, the market exchange rate was
closer to US$0.5 a EE 1 than US$0.83 = EE 1. Shadow pricing of foreign
exchange would somewhat increase the total costs given in the PCRs. Project
benefits appear to have been calculated on the basis of increased production
multiplied by domestic prices. To the extent that these prices have been held
below world border price equivalent (especially value'A at the shadow price of
foreign exchange), the benefits will'also have been understated. On balance,
the conservative technical assumptions in the PCRs, combined with the
offsetting nature of the possible corrections noted above, mean that the
rovised rates of return given in the PCRs can be taken to be realistic. As
shown in the PCRs, these rates of return are reasonably robust under changes
in the assumptions.
56.      As a result of the new assumptions, the ERR for Drainage III is
estimated to be 141 versus 201 in the appraisal report, and for Drainage IV
23.61 versus 231. Irn the Drainage IIr Project, lower realized benefits were
compensated for by lower project costs. Switching value analysis indicates
that the ERR would aave remained above 121 unless benefits fell 11.61 below
those estimated for Drainage III or 412 below estimated benefits for Drainage
IV.

VYI. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
Proiects Justification
57.      The Bank was undoubtedly right to provide priority support to
drainage of agricultural lands in Egypt, this being a necessary condition :;
allow additional investments in development of the agricultural sector. On
the whole, both projects are making valuable contribucions towards increased
agricultural production on large areas by controlling depth to water table and
by lowering soil salinity. In spite of long implementation delays, ex-post
ERR of 142 for Drainage III and 232 for Drainage IV are sufficient to justify
investments made.
Appraisal SchedUlng
58.      It could be concluded that the proJects were appraised too early by
the Bank. At the time of appraisal of Drainage III and IV projects, field
drainage under prior projects was to be installed in 215,000 fed in Upper
Egypt and 346,000 fed in the Delta. Thus, the concurrent implementation of
four projects for a period of more than three years over-extended the
management capacity of EPADP and the construction capability of local
contractors.
Lack of Construction Management Capablity
60.      EPADP, the  implementing agency lacked an effective construction
planning and monitoring system. This resulted in the lack of coordination
between various agencies and interacting elements, resultinig in undue delays
in project execution. The other main difficulty which affected the progress
of drainage works was the EPADP's inability to enforce conditions of contracts
and to terminate the poorly performing contracts.
Selection of Contractors
61.      Most of the problems in project implementation arose from
contractor-related issues and difficulties. The contractors ran into
financial difficulties, had management problems, or faced shortage of
materials and skilled workers for construction. Therefore, management and
financial capabilities of contractors should be evaluated through a
prequalification process or, in the Egyptian context, be given proper weight
in bid evaluation.
Chanzes After AvDraisal
62.      The flexibility shown by the Government and the Bank in accommodating
drainage needs, as they were identified during implementation, and not rigidly
keeping to the areas defined in the projects documents was most appropriate.
Lessons Learned
63.      Many of the lessons "learned" from these projects, as fron other
similar projects, may be valid only in the Egyptian context. However, it
seems the following are fairly evident and should be taken into account in the
formulation of future projects, as have been done in recent projects appraised
in Egypt:



- 28 -
(a)   Drainage projects require careful preparation; failure to provide
realistic estimates of the time required for completion and the
absence of predrainage surveys before appraisal can result in
delays and may jeopardize the project's economic justification.
(b)   Appraisal missions should be particularly careful to ensure that
the executing agency selected has the ability to implement :h
project within the agreed time.
(c)   Provision of counterpart funds is basic to timely implementation;
failure to provide such funds should trigger effective action oy
the Bank.
(d)   Long delays in project implementation may result from premature
appraisal, leading also to a high degree of uncertainty in regard
to cofinancing, technical issues, etc.
(e)   Inadequate understanding of the capability of potential
contractors allowed to bid and win contracts awarded through ICB
can cause serious implementation problems.
(f)   A detailed design of M&E of project impact snou.d be made during
preparation and appraisal to ensure a meaningful measure of
project impact.
(g)   Besides crop yield statistics, it is necessary to directly
monitor the performance of field tile drains, through systematic
collection of groundwater and soil salinity data.
(h)   Efforts should be made to educate and motivate the farmer
beneficiaries to ensure their cooperation in the maintenance of
field drainage.

ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT - UPPER EGYPT DRAINAGE II PROJECT
(CREDIT 637, LOAN 1285-EGT)
I. INTRODUCTION
General
*  1.1   This completion report for Upper Egypt Drainage II Project, gives a
further opportunity to record and evaluate the performance on the third
project  in the largest multi-stage field drainage programme ever undertaken
in the world. The project provided the substantive financial assistance to
the Government of Egypt's (GOE) policy of providing improved drainage
throughout most of the approximately 5.7 million feddans 1/ of the
historically  irrigated area ('the old lands") in the Delta and Upper Egypt.
The project aimed to provide field drainage to some 9% of this area and,
following the pattern set by the previous projects. The Bank extended its
previous participation in the drainage programme .(Nile Delta I and Upper
Egypt I drainage projects) by financing this and two further projects (Nile
Delta II and Drainage V projects) involving five IDA credits and three World
Bank loans totalling US$ 246 million. The project and its successors has
also attracted significant amounts of aid from-other donors including USAID,
KfW, the African Development Fund and Bank in the form of co-financing
(three credit/loans totalling US$ 82 million). The World Food Programme has
also *participated in the first drainage projects and the Netherlands
Government is supporting the drainage programme with technical assistance.
The five projects together cover improvement of surface drains in about 2.84
million feddans and installation of subsurface drainage in about 2.60
million feddans (about 46% of the old lands irrigated areas). Annex 1
presents salient features and stiatus of each of the repeater proje'ts. g/
le2      This loan/credit, the  third  in  the  vital  agricultural  sector,
represented a continuation of Bank Group lending operations in Egypt. Credit
637-EGT and loan 1285-EGT for USS 50.0 million %are signed on November 6,
1976 and became effective on January 31. 1977. The Closing Date, originally
June 30, 1983, was extended twice to June 30, 1985. The final disbursement
from the credit/loan was made on February 1, 1986 bringing the total amount
disbursed to the original USS 50.0 million. On this date, the installation
of field drainage, an activity critical to full completion of the project,
was accomplished in 315,000 feddans out of the 500,000 feddans originally
planned. Existing open drains were remodelled ard new drains excavated on
the 500,000 feddans as planned. Co-financing of USS 30.0 million was
obtained from USAID to cover installation of three PVC pipe factories and
foreign production costs of PVC-pipes. The loan was subsequently reduced to
20.0 million and disbursements to date are USS 19.03 million.
]1/ Or 2.4 million ha (1 feddan * 0.42 ha)
3J EPAPO installed 968,000 feddans with tile drainage independently before
and during the WB projects. Hence the total area instaXTed will be about
63% of the "old lands".

Agricultural Sector
1.3      Egypt's population, soon to reach 50 million, is large and  growing
at an annual rate of 2.5% almost half of this growth is concentrated in the
greater Cairo area. Arid desert land accounts for about 96.5% of the one
million ku2 of surface area, leaving only 35,500 km2 of urban and
agriculturally productive land with a population density of about 1,400/km2.
Almost 50% of the population is rural, its proportion having steadily
declined from 62% in 1960. Average per capita GNP estimate was  US$  644  in
1984/8S.-
1.4      The  high  economic  growth (8%-1O% in real terms) in the 1970s was
chiefly the result of a surge in foreign exchange resources, based mainly
on external factors - concessional capital inflows, primarily from other
Arab countries, earnings from petroleum exports and from the Suez Canal,
tourism receipts and workers' ruuittances. While these resources enabled
Egypt to achieve a high level of growth they also made the economy very
susceptible to outside Influences. The lesser flow of external resources
since 1981 produced a slowdown of economic growth. The downturn was
triggered by a fall in oil prices, exacerbated by a decline in tourism
receipts, remittance  earnings  and  a  slowdown  in  Suez  Canal  earnings
following the general slowdown in the world economy. The prospects for
greater external resources are worsening. Therefore, the challenge that
Egypt now faces Is to make those difficult choices it was able to avoid when
exogenous resources were plentiful. They involve: the mobilization of
resource, raising the efficiency of investments, improving the capability of
the domestic economy to absorb a growing la4our force; and earning foreign
echange. Economic growth will depend on the pace and comprehensiveness of
the pclicy reforms, which should be designed to eliminate the distortions in
the economy.
1.5      Acriculture   in  the  economY. The land-JMase  for  agricultural
production consists of 5.7 million feddans (2.4 million ha) of  mold  lands"
and 0.9 million feddans (0.4 million ha) of reclaimed lands - the so-called
mold-new lands". Only one-half of the latter is considered productive, due
partly to deficiencies in technical design and partly due to inappropriate
management. The per capita cultivated area, which was 0.19 feddans in 1960,
is now only about 0.13 feddans. Theold lands include all of the more
fertile areas in the valley of the Nile and the Delta where about 97% of the
nation's total agricultural production is generated. The old-new lands were
developed from the late 1950s through the early 1970s, primarily on the
marginal soils along the western edge of the Delta. Nearly all Egyptian
agriculture is irrigated and, since completion of the HAD, all irrigation is
perennial.
1.6      The  importance  of  agriculture  in the  Egyptian economy changed
significantly during the 1970s. Historically, agriculture was the dominant
sector, providing the bulk of employment and output, being crucial to
foreign exchange earnings and receiving substantial budgetary support. The
sector's vital role was reinforced by its strong performance during the
1952/70 period. During the 1960s, agricultural production grew at over 3%
annually - an exceptional performance, given the relatively high base level.
1.7      In  the 1970s, the pace of growth declined to around 2%. Given that
the high growth rates of the previous decader included the impact of
controlled releases from the HAD, this does not reflect a significant change
in the underlying growth trend and is still an Impressive performance.
However, other factors accentuated the slowdown in agricultural growth:
first, population continued to grow at over 2.5%; second, per capita income



- 31 -
grew very rapidly; and third, consumer prices for foodstuffs held at
extremely low levels compounded the demand increases generated by the first
two factors.

1.9      AgLricultural constraints.  Aside from the very lim'ted availability
of arable land, several maJor constraints have  prevented  agriculture  from
performing  its  potentially   key  role   in  the  economy  :  (a)  limited
investment in the sector; (b) the problematic situation wlth respect to
waterlogging and soil salinity; (c) institutional weaknesses In agricultural
supporting services; (d) deterioration of the water delivery and drainage
channels due to inadequate maintenance and inadequate water distribution
systems; (e) Government system of regulated cropping patterns and marketing
at low fixed prices; (f) labour shortages at times of peak demand due to
migration both to cities and abroad; and (g) failure to develop and use
technology needed for expanding agricultural production. Another major
constraint to agricultural growth is developing, i.e. water availability in
the Nile System. If land reclamation is allowed on a disproportionately
large-scale and possibly also in uneconomic areas without parallel efforts
in water conservation, re-use and improved management, then water shortages
in s;ummer are expected to become a general problem in many conmand areas of
the Oold lands'.
Land Constraints and Importance of Improved Orainace
1.10     Good land for crop production is scarce in Egypt and development of
desert/saline marshy lands identified by GOE for reclamation is cost
intensive with lengthy gestation periods. Therefore, the main source of
Increases in agricultural production In the short run must be the old lands.
On these lands productivity is still constrained even today by inadequate
drainage in about 1.5 million feddans. The priority thus lies in continuing
drainage programme under which some 3.1 million feddans will have been
equipped with field drains by mid-1987. This is justified since no input
package to Increase production will be fully successful until the drainage
constraint has been removed. While there is little evidence that land is



- 32 -
going  out of production as a result of waterlogging and salinization causJd
by high groundwater levels, it is clear that rising soil salinity in some
areas is causing yields to decline. The reed for drainage arises from the
occurrence of waterlogging and high salinity levels in soil and groundwater
level. The position of the groundwater level is not static        fluswates in
response to irrigation, rainfall, evaporation and (natural) drainage.
1.11     Within the  project  area,  the  drainage  conditions  resulted  in
certain areas from the shift from basin to perennial irrigation that has
been made possible by the commissioning of the Aswan High Dam. Prior to the
harnessing  of  the  Nile,  after  the  flood  period, the water table would
gradually become lower until it reached 2 m or more below the so,l surface.
It would not rise again until the following year's fliod. During the
interim, farmers, except on a few farms  with  wells,  never  watered  their
fields.  However, with perennial irrigation, farmers now irrigate their land
frequently throughout the year. Since the clay soils in much of the project
area generally have low permeability rates, the groundwater levels have been
rising over time especially in places where new outlets have not been
installed. The drainage system in existence in areas with basin irrigation
prior to the changeover to perennial irrigation, has not been able to cope
with   this  additional  quantity  of  water.  Moreover,  seepage  and  deep
percolation from the new irrigation canals have also contributed to a rise
in the groundwater levels in many areas. The net result of the change in
groundwater level has been to create waterlogging conditions which have
serious deleterious effects on root growth and development.
1.12     Aside  from waterlogging, there were indications that soil salinity
had also increased. Before the shift in water regime due to the control of
the Nile floods, the annual inundation of the land would flush out the salts
that built up in the soil profile during the year. The clay soils most
comuonly found in the project area have a high capillary conductivity
potential.
1.13     Before designing and installing the tile drainage  system  detailed
field investigations were made in each catchment area by the Drainage
Authority to establish the constraints and need for drainage on the basis of
four main parameters: depth of shallow groundwater table, soil permeability,
soil salinity and water salinity. Results of detailed investigations were
plotted on detailed maps. Due to the unavailability in the Authority of
clear set of criteria for selection, delineation and priority ranking of
drainage basins, the use of results of detailed investigations have not been
optimal and some doubts have arisen on the ranking and selection of methods
used for certain catchment areas in Upper Egypt.
1.14     The  Government  has been giving high priority to the tile drainage
programs over the past 15 years. During the 10 years  ending  1985/86,  the
capital expenditures on all irrigation activities in Egypt totalled LE 1,883
million. Out of this, drainage alone accounted for LE 661 million or 35%.
Annex Z shows the Ministry of Irrigation's (MOI) recurrent and capital
expenditure. The MOI current planning is to  complete  the  Upper  Egypt  II
field drainage project component and to start with the first phase of the
Drainage V program covering about 0.47 million feddans by 1990. Draining the
remaining 0.86 millio0 feddans of the Drainage V programme is likely to take
at least until 1996.

Bank's Agricultural Lending
1.15     Since  1970,  the Bank has financed 19 projects in the agricultural
sector in Egypt. Initially the Bank's policy was to encourage the Government
to maintain and increase production levels in the "old lands". This was done
through the series of five drainage projects, of which 637/1285 EGT was the
third, and through the Agricultural Development Project (Credit 830-UAR).
Over time there has been further diversification, in particular in agro-
Industries with two projects, fruit and vegetable production and marketing,
land reclamation with the New Lands Development Project. Other agricultural
sector support projects financed by the World Bank concerned cotton ginning
rehabilitation, fertilizer productions, agricultural/industrial imports,
rural electrification, technical assistance respectively to the Ministries
of Irrigation and Land Reclamation, Irrigation and Drainage Pumping Stations
Rehabilitation and recently Channel Maintenance. Details on these projects
are given in Annex 3.
Bilharzia Control
1.16     Bilharzia, a disease known in Egypt since hundreds  of  years,  has
caused immeasurable misery to people, death and most certainly a marked loss
of productivity; since the 1900's many a control scheme has been tried. The
Government of Egypt has, since many years, sponsored Bilharzia control and
tried with pilot and large scale projects, given the respective tools of
each period, to gain control of the disease. But only in the last few years,
with the advent of efficient drugs and molluscicides  as  well  as  improved
strategies and better basic health coverage have control measures succeeded
in producing and sustaining significant results in terms of a reduction of
morbidity and reduction of infection.
1.17     Within Middle and Upper Egypt, particularly in the northern region,
Bilharzia is endemic. In Upper Egypt Drainage I Project, a programme for the
control  of  Bilharzia,  covering 900,000 f'eddans and about 3 million people
has been initiated. It consists of an  integrated  snail  control  programme
coupled with chemotherapy for infected persons. The Bilharzia project
comprised the area controlled by the Ibrahimia and Bahr Yousef canals
commencing at the Dairut Barrage which is downstream of the head regulator
at Asyut on the Nile. About 120,000 feddans between Asyut and Dairut
Barrages were included in the programme to permit the whole area served from
the Asyut barrage to, be treated, thereby reducing the possibility of
reinfecting treated areas. The Upper Egypt II credit and loan also included
provislons for financing the cost overrun of the Bilharzia control component
of Upper Egypt Oralnage I Project.

II. MRWJECT FORMULATION
!S!Slt Ori01n
2.1      The  Idea  of  a  Bank  financed  drainage  project  in  Egypt was
originated by a Bank economic mission which visited the country in July
l9og. This idea was further advanced by a Bank agricultural mission which
visited Egypt in September 1968. The mission proposed, as a first priority,
a project which included installation of field drainage In part of the Nile
Delta together with remodelling and constructio0 of open drains and erection
of the drainage pumping stations required. This project, later called Nile
Delta Drainage I Project, was appraised by the Dank in December 1968 ind the
Credit (181-WUAR) became effective on December 22, 1970.
2.2      In 1972 a request was made by the Goverment of Egypt for financing
by IDA of a second drainage project in Upper Egypt, where waterlogging and
soil salinity incertain areas constituted mjor constraints to maintaining
land  productivity. This secord drainage project, the Upper Egypt Drainge 
Project, was appraised by the Bank in March 1972, and the Credit (393-EST)
beme   effective on November 28, 1973.
2.3      Up  to the end of 1975, construction and remodelling of open drains
and erection of pumping stations had progressed satisfactorily. However,
progress in installing field drainage was slow due to several problems the
tw projects faced. Of these, the most serious were the lack of local funds
and the shortage of engineers due to the 1973 war, the shortage of cement
for the production of concrete pipes, the poor performance of local public
sector contractors and other managerial problems.
2.4      Sy  the  beginning  of  1975  the  Govermnt  had  made sufficient
allocation of funds to the drainage projects and the shorte  of -ngineers
was no  longer  a  problem as most of thin had been released from the army.
Encouraged by these improvmnts, the Ministry  of  Irigation  made  a  new
request to the Bank for financing a third drainage project in Egypt,
covering the rmining areas in Upper Egypt which suffered waterlogging  and
salinity.
Feasibility Report
2.5      EPADP  undertook  the  responsibility  of preparing the feasibility
report for the proposed Upper Egypt Drainage II Project. The project works
included the construction or remodelling of open drains and installation of
field drainage in selected areas totalling 500,000 feddans, all in Upper
Egypt,  the  construction  of  a  new  drainage  pumping  station  and  the
reclaation of about 12,000 feddans of saline soils. The feasibility report
was  receid  by  the Dank a few days before the departure of the appraisal
mission.
2.6      The feasibility report was reasonably comprehensive as far  as  the
description of project works was concerned but, as in previous feasibility
reports prepared by EPAOP, was short on justification for selection of
project  areas. The selection of the areas for field drainage was based on a
soil survey covering about one half of the project area and a semi-detailed
soil survey covering the reaining portion. No detailed field Investigations
(water table depth, hydraulic conductivity of soils etc.) had been conducttd
prior to the selection of the areas. Thus, the areas included in the project
appeared to have been selected on practical considerations seconded by some



- 35 -
field observations. Furthermore, there was a complete absence in the report
of a justification of the project as a whole based on investments and
expected benefits. Finally, the implementation schedule in the report was
over optimistic.
Appraisal
2.7      The appraisal of the project was carried out in Oecember 1975 1/
The appraisal mission reviewed the basic assumptions made in the FeasibTilty
Report and visited many areas proposed for field drainage. Special attention
was given by the mission to the proposed implementation rate of the project
works and to the estimation of project cost. The mission also, in an effort
to make a better estimation of project benefits, collected and reviewed all
the available data on the effect of drainage on crop yields.
2.8      The procurement problem  that  faced  the  previous  Bank  drainage
projects concerning civil works for installation of field drainage was
resolved. EPADP had accepted the appraisal mission's recommendation that
construction of field drainage should go to ICB. Because of the need for
accelerating the drainage implementation program the appraisal mission
proposed and EPADP agreed to use in this project PVC corrugated pipes for
drain laterals. For the installation of concrete pipes for collectors heavy
duty laying machines were recommended.
2.9      Following  the  appraisal mission, the scope of the project and its
period of implementation were debated in the Bank. Because of financial
constraints and uncertainity about cofinancing, the project area was
initially reduced to 350,000 feddans. Later, the Bank decided to increase
its allocation to the project to USS 50 million and USAID indicated its
'ntention to participate in the financing of the proj2ct. In view of this it
was finally decided to accept Government's proposals on the scope of the
project, i.e. the remodelling and construction of open drains on 500,000
feddans, the installation of field drainage on 500,000 feddans, the
construction of one pumping station and the reclamation of 12,000 feddans of
saline soils. It was also decided to include in the project a Bilharzia
control component by which the Bilharzia programme was expanded by 120,000
feddans, between Asyut and Dairut Barrages, and a provision was made for
financing the cost overrun of the Bilharzia component under Upper Egypt
Drainage I Project.
2.10     As   far  as  the  implementation  period  was  concerned,  it  was
considered that (a) with the additional equipment provided under the
project, (b) the use of PVC plastic pipes (instead of concrete pipes used in
the previous projects) and (c) the opening of tenders for field drainage  to
foreign   contractors,   it   would  have  been  possible  to  increase  the
implementation rate of field drainage to 140,000 feddans annually, starting
from the third year. Therefore it was assumed that the project could have
been completed within a five-year period. This proved later to be a very
optimistic assumption.
2.11     The  Bank was informed officially in April 1976 of the intention of,
USAID to participate in the financing of the project. The matter was further
discussed between USAID and the Bank in Washington and it was agreed to
propose to the Government a parallel financing agreement by which USAID

carried out by a Bank Consultant in October 1975.

would finance all foreign costs required for the production of the PVC
plastic pipes  in  Egypt   by  establishing  three  PVC  factories  and  for
procurement of spare parts and PVC raw material. The Government agreed to
this proposal and a separate agreement was later signed between Government
and USAID.
2.12     At  the  time  of  appraisal  some issues became apparent, the most
seric'as being that EPADP had always refused to employ foreign consultants.
M1ission's opinion was that the introduction for the first time in Egypt of
PVC pipes in drainage works and the proposed high rate of implementation of
field drainage, made necessary the use of consultants to advise EPAOP's
officials, on overall planning and management, on technical problems related
to the installation of PVC pipes, on carrying-out field investigations for
design purposes, etc. Other issues noticed were the lack of progress in
monitoring and evaluation of drainage works and their effect on crop yields,
the inadequate accounting system of EPADP, the lack of coordination between
EPADP and Extension Service of the Ministry of Agriculture and the poor
recovery of drainage cost from the beneficiaries. On all these issues the
Government was advised before negotiations that its reipresentatives should
be prepared to reach necessary agreement with the Bank.
Negotiations
2.13     Negotiations took place  between  May  7-11,  1976.  Agreement  was
reached with the Government on most of the issues mentioned above. Thus:
a) Government accepted the Bank's recommenddtion to employ consultants
(3 full time consultants for 3 years);
b) Government accepted the tendering of field drainage works through
ICB;
c) Government undertook the responsibility to carry out and complete
the evaluation of the effect of drainage works;
d) EPADP agreed to establish within six months after the Effective
Oate a cost accounting system;
e) Government agreed to ensure adequate coordinating between EPADP and
Extension Service.
2.14     As   regards,  the  cost  recovery  issue,  the  Borrower  came  to
negotiations prepared to resist on Bank's position that full recovery of
capital and O&M cost of field drainage in real terms should be obtained from
the beneficiaries. They explained that cost recovery of drainage works is
governed  by  Law No. 74 of October 9, 1971 which provides for recovery only
of capital cost for field drainage, plus a  10%  administrative  charge,  in
annual instalments over .20 years. They stressed that because of price,
controls exercised by the Government on the principal crops, farmers make
small  profits  and  it  is  not  fair  to  be charged with additional cost.
Besides, they pointed out that the recovery of O&M cost for drainage is
indirectly obtained through the land taxes which are revised periodically.
The delegation, to show its support to Bank's position agreed to undertake a
study on the ability of farmers to pay recovery charges to cover capital and
O&M cost of field drainage, taking into account inflation. Bank finally
agreed to the Borrowers' position.



- 37 -
2.15     During  negotiations full agreement was reached on the scope of the
project as described below.
The ProJect
2.16     The primary objective of the project approved by the Bank Board  on
June 8, 1976 was to improve drainage on 500,000 feddans in Upper Egypt at a
total cost of USS 282.1 million equivalent, with an IDA credit of US$ 40.0
million and a Bank loan of USS 10.0 million. The project description
incorporated in the Development Credit Agreement is given in Annex 4. The
project included the remodelling of 1,226 km of existing open drains and the
excavation of 346 km of new open drains, the installation of field drainage
on about 500,000 feddans, the construction of one new pumping st.tion and
the reclamation of about 12,000 of saline land. A Bilharzia control
component was included by which the Bilharzia program was expanded by
120,000 feddans in the area between Asyut and Dairut Barrages and a
provision was made for financing the cost overrun of the Bilharzia Component
(about USS 4.22 million) under the Upper Egypt Drainage I Project.
2.17     The agreement between Government  and  USAID  for  cofinancing  the
project with USS 30 million was signed in July 1976. According to this
agreement USAID would finance all foreign costs required for the production
of PVC corrugated pipes in Egypt.

III. IMPLEMENTATION
Prolect Agreement and; Side Letters
3.1      The  Project  Agreement,  the  Development Credit Agreement and the
Loan Agreement were signed on June 11, 1976. On the same date the following
five side letters were also signed:
a) Project Implementation Schedule.
b) Implementation of Drainage Programme.
c) Cost Recovery Study.
d) Cost Recovery.
e) External Debt of ARE.
Effectiveness and Start-up
3.2      In addition to the standard conditions of effectiveness there  were
two specific ones: (a) the Government will enter into a loan agreement with
USAIO for financing the foreign cost for the production of PVC pipes in
Egypt; and (b) the Government will take all measures neccessary to provide
adequate coordination between the Extension Service of the Ministry of
Agriculture and EPADP.
3.3      The  first  specific condition was met with the signature of a loan
greement between Government and USAID in July  1976.  The  second  spee44c4
condition was met when EPADP furnished the Bank with a ministerial decree by
which a Coordination Committee between Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry
of Irrigation was established to coordinate the activities of the Extension
Service and EPADP in the execution of drainage programme and maintenance of
drainage works. The Committee would formulate plans for joint activities and
initiate a programme to  train  extension personnel.  The  credit/loan- was
declared effective on January 31, 1977, 7 1/2 months after signature.
An Overview of Project History
3.4      The  agreed  implementation  schedule  projected  completion of the
drainage component of the project by  end  of  1981. The  closing  date  of
credit/loan  was  set  as  June  30, 1983. No major changes were made on the
project's main objectives during implementation. However, many events
contributed to a considerable delay in project completion. The closing date
was revised twice to accommodate delays in Implementation. The credit/loan
was finally closed on June 30, 1985 but its accounts were kept open for"
making disbursements against commitments made before this date. The entire
mount of the credit/loan of USS 50 million was finally di!bursed.



- 39 -
Revisions
3.5      No changes were made during the project execution in its scope, and
objectives. However, following detailed field investigations, some of the
initially selected areas, totalling about 85,000 feddans, were found not In
need of drainage and have been deleted. Others of the selected areas,
totalling about 30,000 feddans, were found in urgent need of drainage and
were shifted to Upper Egypt Drainage I Project for iimiediate implementation.
An area of about 10,000 feddans was found not in immediate need of drainage
and was shifted to the Drainage V program for later implementation. All
these areas, totalling about 125,000 feddans, were replaced by areas outside
the project, for which investigations showed that they are in need of
drainage. As a result of all these changes the total area in which field
drainage will be ultimately installed has been slightly reduced from 500,000
feddans at appraisal to 493,420 'eddans. Annex 5 presents by catchment unit
the areas at appraisal, those revised during execution of the project and
the areas in which field drainage was installed as of October 31, 1986.
Map 1 (a, b, c) shows the location of these areas.
3.6      It is  believed  that,  in  most  cases,  the  above  changes  were
beneficial for the project, since they gave priority for field drainage
installation to areas with more serious drainage problems and postponed or
cancelled field drainage works in other areas not in immediate need. But in
some cases the changes were simply made to give some flexibility to EPADP in
the  implementation  of  its  overall drainage program. The fact is that all
these chanc2s in the project areas became necessary because of the
inadequate project preparation and more specifically because no detailed
field inyestigations were carried out prior to the selection of the field
drainage areas. It should be said that*for this reason there is still some
lack of confidence as to whether field drainage was really needed in all the
areas that have been provided with it (para. 4.3).
Implementation Schedule of Drainage Works
3.7      In  general  the  implementation  of project drainage works ran far
behind schedule and the project is not expected to be completed before June
1989. This shows how unrealistic were the assumptions made about project
implementation  at  appraisal.  Instead,   of   the   expected   five   year
implementation period the project will take more than twelve years to be
completed. Delays have occurred in all the three main components of drainage
works i.e. pumping station, open drains and field drainage but it is the
third one which caused the major delay for the full completion of the
project. On the original completion date of December 31, 1982, the
completion rate was 100% on civil works for the pumping station (erection of
pumps had only started), 78% for open drains and 18% for field drainage. To
date (October 1986), the field drainage installation had not yet completed.
There are some 160,000 feddans (approximately 1/3 of the project area) to be
implemented in the coming two years (Annex 5).
3.8      Many factors contributed to cause delays in project  implementation
the main ones being the weaknesses in EPAOP's construct1on planning and,
management as well as the low implementation capacity of the public sector
contractors. The specific delaying factors for each drainage component are
examined below:
a) PumPinq station. The contract was awarded in April 1977, i.e.
three months after effectiveness, but construction started In April
1980, i.e. three years later. The reason for this long  deTajy  was
the inefficiency of the local contractor to organize the work and
to carry out the soil investigations required for the design of



- 40 -
civil works. Further delays occurred in the construction of civil
works (it took almost three years), in the construction of the
electrical transmission line, and in the erection and testing of
the pumps. The station becae operational in May 1985  i.e.  almost
five years behind schedule (Annex 7).
b) gDen drains. This activity presented the least problems in project
implementation. Remodelling and construction of open drains started
a few months after effectiveness by using old equipment available
to the contractors. The execution of this component was kept
intentionally slow because the work on open drains was far too
ahead of field drainage Installation and the slower paced progress
helped to achieve, a better balance between these two activities.
The component of open drains was completed by July 1985 i.e. four
and a half years behind schedule (Annex 6).
c) Field draina e. T is is the activity that presented the most
serious problems and caused the major delays In project completion.
The implementation of this componert started In January 1981
instead of September 1977 as expected at appraisal, i.e. more than
three years later. The reasons for this serious delay were: (i) the
two year delay in completion of the PVC pipe factories financed by
USAID   (the   factories  of  Beni  Suef,  Asyut  and  Qena  became
operational in April 1980, July 1980 and January 1981 respectively,
almost two years behind schedule); (ii) the delay of EPADP in the
award of contracts for the execution of field drainage. The award
occurred in February 1980, i.e. two and a half years behind
schedule; (14i) shortages of cement required for structures and
pipe collectors; (iv) delay in the procurement of equipment by the
contractors; (v) it should also be mentioned that during the first
three years of the project some 23,000 feddans of the project area
were provided with field drainage using concrete pipes. Later, with
Bank's agreement, this area was exchanged for an equivalent area of
the  Upper  Egypt  Drainage I Project  not  provided  with   field
drainage. As a result, no field drainage was shown to be installed
during the first three years under the Upper Egypt Drainage II
Project (Annex 5).
3.9      As Is shown above, during the first three years of the project,  no
progress was made in field drainage installation, except a small pilot area
of 3,000 feddans in Beni Suef which was provided with field drainage with
imported ready made PVC pipes. But even later, the installation rate of
field drainage was slow, on average J2,000 feddans annually (maximum 76,000
feddans in the year 1983/84) which was much below the expected 140,000
feddans per year at appraisal. The reason for this slow progress was the
poor performance of the public sector contractors. It is unfortunate that
although the tendering of field drainage works was made through ICB, no
foreign  contractors presented a bid, obviously because they knew in advance
that they did not have a chance to compete with the low prices of the public.
sector contractors. Another conclusion was that, although the use of plastic
PVC pipes and heavy duty laying machines for the collector pipes made easier
the whole operation of installing field drainage, the contractors, because
of their managerial weaknesses, did not take advantage of this. In fact the
contractors' performance showed a poor utilization of the resources made
available to them. For example the utilization of laying machines was far
below accepted standards. On averaga the collector machines were utilized
118 days a year and the lateral machines 152 days  a year.  These  figures
show clearly that the contractors' management of the machines was extremely
Inefficient.  If  the  contractors  could  have   increased   the   machines



- 41 -
utilization rate by 50% (which is considered normal) the average drainage
area constructed in a year wauld have been 80,000 feddans. It has to be said
that to some extent, the farmers' resistance to destroying partially matured
crops (specially sugar cane in Upper Egypt) despite crop compensation
payments, and the heavy watering of the fields, disrupted smooth operations
in installation of field drainage.
3.10     But there is no doubt that EPADP also has a share of responsibility
for the slow performance of contractors. There was no adequate planning and
supervision of drainage works and EPADP proved to have no effective means of
enforcing the conditions of contracts. The situation could have been
different if EPADP had made use of consultants as provided in the appraisal
report,   to  advise  on  overall  planning and coordination of works and on
technical matters related to the drainage works. Despite the efforts rade by
the supervision missions and the Bank to persuade EPADP to hire consultants,
the  refused to do so. They claimed that  strict  Governmental  instructions
did   not  allow  them  to  use  funds  from  the  credit/loan  for  foreign
consultants. EPAD was getting some technical assistance   for  its  drainage
programme  through  a  panel  of Egyptian and Dutch experts sponsored by the
Dutch Bilateral Programme (Annex 8 shows overall implementation rate of
field drainage in Egypt).
3.11     The  work  on amelioration of saline soils has been completed. Some
12,000 feddans have been subsoiled in combination with application of 3 tons
per feddan on average of gypsum. The work was done by the Land Amelioration
Authority of the Ministry of Agriculture. Due to the short time available
between harvesting and sowing crops the implementatibn of this programme was
slow and it took three years instead of two.
3.12     The options available to the Bank s.aff to do anything  about  slow
implementation were limited because the Bank had little leverage for
interference with the working of the public sector contractors. At the
request  of  the  Bank's  supervision  mission  of  May  1984, a meeting was
organized by the Vice Chairman of EPADP in which the Undersecretaries in
charge. and the Chairmen of the main constructing companies involved with
drainage works in Upper Egypt participated . According to the Chairmen of
these companies, the main problems faced by them were the procurement of
spare parts for the pipe laying machines and the old contracts unit prices
that needed adjustment due to inflation, As a result of this meeting some
action was taken by EPADP to improve r-,*urement of spare parts and a modest
price escalation of the old contracts was adopted. However, these measures
did not cause any dramatic improvement in implementation rates in the
following years.
3.13     It  became clear to Bank staff that control over project activities
and decisions had to be the responsibility of EPADP and that Bank staff
influence could at best be indirect through advice and persuasion. When
opportunities presented themselves Bank has taken fast action. For instance
when it became obvious that there would be a long delay in the local
production of PVC pipes, Bank agreed to import from  the   proceeds  of  the
credit/loan  200,000 m  ready  made  PVC  pipes from abroad to implement the
pilot drainage project of Beni Suef. Likewise when shortages of cement and
Iron bars emerged Bank agreed to finance their import from abroad. Also when
shortage of local funds proved to be a significant delaying factor the Bank
stressed the need for adequate funding to the Government and inserted a
covenent into the next drainage project (Nile Delta Drainage II) requiring
the Government to establish a Special Fund from which EPADP could draw
without  restriction  for  implementing  all  IDA/Bank   financed   drainage
projects. Finally the Bank had correctly shown flexibility in accepting
EPAOP's proposals for the amendment of the field drainage areas in order to



- 42 -
facilitate the implementation prcgramme.
3.14     In  summary  it can be saia 0hat the time schedule at appraisal was
over optimistic. The implemerntation rate of 140,000 feddans per year of
field drainage proved to be unattainable with the use of local contractors.
And the construction period assumed at appraisal for the pumping station
proved to be too short.
3.15     Chart 1 presents the time schedule agreed at appraisal for the main
project  activities  and  the  actual  Implementation  schedule   of   these
activities.
Imolementation of Bilharzia Control Prowranmme
3.16     A  Bilharzla  Control Programme covering an area of 900,000 f:ddans
and about 3 million people was initiated in 1976 under the Upper Egypt
Drainage I Project. The programme which was implemented by the Ministry of
Health, consisted of an integrated snail control programme combined with
chemotherapy for Infected people. About 120,000 feddans located between
Asyut and Dairut barrages have been included in the programme under the
Upper Egypt Drainage II Project. Snail control operations in this area
started in March 1977 (intensive phase), and continued for three years. The
consolidation phase followed for another three years. Starting from 1984 the
snail control in this area was limited to local mollusciciding (maintenance
phase). chemotherapy of infected people has been carried out in parallel
since 1978 and continues to be implemented based upon annual re-examination.
3.17     In general the Bilharzia contr)l  component  has  been  implemented
more or less according to plan. Some problems faced earlier with the snail
control operations because of logistic difficulties have been resolved. At
present   the  programme  continues  with  Government's  own  resources.  An
international evaluation mission visited Egypt from October 1984 to April
1985 to evaluate the entire Bilharzia control programme. Annex 19 preserts a
summary of the findings of this mission.
Procurement
3.18     Project equipment for drainage  works  (draglines  and  excavators,
vehicles, workshop equipment, equipment for soil amelioration, flushing
pumps for maintenance, spare parts etc) as welV as materials (cement, steel,
PVC pUipes) were procured through ICB in accordance with Bank guidelines.
Civil works for field drainage were also procured through ICB but all
contracts were awarded to local contractors since no foreign bids were
submitted. Civil works not financed by the Bank for construction and
reodelling  of  open  drains, for soil melioration and for small buildings
were  procured  through  local  tendering  In  accordance  with -the  normal
procurement procedures of Government. The construction of the pumping
station and the supply of pump units were combined in one contract and
procured through ICB.
3.19     Equipment   for  Bilharzia  control(vehicles,  etc.)  was  procured
through ICB. Molluscicide and drugs used in the Bilharzia control programme
are produced by only one manufacturer in West Germany. Their procurement was
made from this manufacturer on the basis of negotiated prices.
3.20     In general the procurement of equipment, materials and civil  works
under the project was carried out with no special problems (except the
delays) and there were no misprocurement cases. Annex 20 shows the project
equipment as appraised and actually procured.

Accountinc. Auditinc and Reporting
3.21     According  to  Section 4.02  of the Project Agreement the Authority
was to have its accounts and financial statements for each fiscal year
audited by 1ndependant auditors acceptable to the Bank and to furnish
certified copies of financial statements and audit reports within a period
of four months after the end of each fiscal year. According to section 4.03
of the Project Agreement, the Authority was to establish within six months
after project effectiveness a cost accounting system to determine relevant
costs of the works carried out by the Authority under the project.
3.22     EPAPD's Finance Department was responsible  for  the  establishment
and maintenance of separate accounts for the project and the Central Audit
Organization (CAO), an independant auditing agency, was responsible for
a-uditing the accounts of EPAPO including those of the project. The CAO has
presented regularly, though usually later than agreed, annual audit reports
which were satisfactory to the Bank. These audit reports also contained a
comparison of actual with budget figures and formed part of the MOI
consolidated report presented to the People's Assembly.
3.23     EPAPO  has  had  considerable  difficulties  in establishing a cost
accounting system. The project agreement had to be amended several times by
substituting the date for its establishment ultimately to June 30, 1981. The
Bank provided assistance to EPAPO by drafting terms of reference for the
design, training of staff, and implementation of the cost accounting system
by a local consulting firm.
3.24     EPAPO recruited in 1977/78 21 accountants who were to form the cost
accounting  unit.  In  May  1979  a  firm  of c hartered atcountants had been
contracted to design the system as well as to. train four accountants of
EPAPO. Their report was submitted in May 1980 and the cost accounting syttem
was operational mid-1981. The cost accounting unit and system were reviewed
by a Bank mission in April 1982 and found generally satisfactory. However,
periodic shortages In accounting staff occurred subsequently.
3.25     While there is now considerable cost-accounting data  available  in
the Regional Offices (Directorates) classified by project, little systematic
compilation by project or by component and subcomponent is available at the
central level. This leads to problems of overlapping accounts between
projects (Mile Delta I and II and Upper Egypt I and II). Efforts should be
made to further improve the existing cosc accounting system in such a way
that it can be used as an effective tool for project management at the
central level in Cairo. The flow of financial Information to the Planning
and Follow-up department in EPAPD 'should also be more systematic and
summarized financial data should be provided in quarterly reports.
3.26     The Authority's Planning and Follow-up department submits regularly
quarterly reports indicating mainly physical progress with field and open
drainage. These quarterly reports should be expanded in the Drainage V
project to contain  also  data  on  procurement,  equipment  available  with.
contractors and summarized financial data.
Proiect Financing - Disbursements
3.27     Actual  withdrawal  of  croceeds of Credit and Loan by category are
shown in a summarized form in Arnnex 9a and annually in Annex 9b. Actual
disbursements on a half yearly basis for the full term of the project are
presented in Annex 10a. Some two years delay in completion of the project is
reflected in the extended disbursement period. As shown in Annex lOa, only
about 72% of the Credit and Loan was disbursed by the original closing date



- 44-
of June 30, 1983. The Credit and Loan was finally fully disbursed on
February 1, 1986. Disbursements of USAID funds are given in Annex 10b. Out
of an original allocation of USS 30.0 million, only USS 19.0 million were
actually disbursed to date and USS 10.0 million were reallocated to other
projects in Egypt. Disbursements of USAID funds were basically lower due to
lower than estimated costs of PVC pipe factories and PVC resin.
Actual Costs Versus ADvraisal Estimate
3.28     The project costs mentioned in this chapter and shown in Annexes 11
and 12 are based on information provided by EPAPO's administration and
finance department and from World Bank disbursement records. As mentioned in
para. 3.25, EPAPO's project accounts do not make it possible to distinguish
local expenditure by sub-component. Furthermore, no systematic compilation
of foreign exchange costs is made according to sub-component (i.e. field
drainage, open drain remodelling etc.) EPAPD also has difficulties in
separating costs of overlapping projects (i.e. Upper Egypt I and II and
Delta DrainaCe I and II). Thus, cost analysis in this report will remain
incomplete.
3.29     Total  project  expenditure  till  July  1986  amounted to LE 124.3
million. This corresponds to a low cost overrun of 13% in terms of Egyptian
Pounds despite the important delays in project execution and slightly higher
inflation than anticipated during the implementation period. Total project
in US dollars amounted to 140.6 million including USAID disbursements of
USS 19.0 million. They are shown in Annex 11. More detailed costs by year
are given in Annex 12. Since the final project local currency disbursements
are not expected to be effected until June 1989, the total project
expenditures  will not be available before late 1989. However, a re-estimate
was made by the mission of the full project costs which are presently
estimated at LE 155.9 million (41% above the appraisal estimate). To date
project costs in US dollar terms 1/ tre -only about 50% of appraisal
estimates despite the fact that most project components have been completed.
Adding expenditure for the 165,000 feddans of field drainage still to be
installed total project costs are expected to reach about USS 166.9 million
which is less than 60% of appraisal estimate in US dollar terms. The main
reasons for such considerable reduction in costs, besides the revaluation of
the US dollar during the project period, are:
i) the very low local contract prices of the Egyptian Public Companies
selected in 1981 and the inadequate adjustments (price escalation)
for local inflation (several public companies have been facing
losses in installation of field drainage);
ii) the  lower  than estimated costs of drainage equipment in US dollar
terms due to fierce international competition;
iii) the  lower  than  expected  foreign  exchange  cost  of  PVC  pipes
factories and PVC resin.

no. 6195-EGT of October 22, 19b6.



- 45 -
3.30     The  lower  overall  project cost is reflected in the comparison of
the average local cost of drainage works per feddan of the actual completed
area under the project with that estimated at appraisal. The total
expenditures as of July 1986, for local cost of field drainage works
covering about 315,000 feddans was LE 41.1 million i.e. LE 130 per feddan.
The total expenditures for local costs of open drainage covering some
500,000 feddans was LE 17.6 million i.e. LE 35 per feddan. Thus the actual
local cost of construction of the drainage facilities was about LE 165 per
feddan, which includes also crop compensation and land lost as a result of
the project works. Foreign exchange cost amounted to LE 52.8 million or
LE 106 per feddan. Thus, the total estimated cost per feddan for drainage
was LE 271 or US$ 316. Compared with USS 440 per feddan at appraisal, the,
overall cost was about 30% lower in US dollar terms (see also Annex 13).
Use of Consultants
3.31     The  appraisal  report  identified  the  need  for  three full-time
consultants each for a period of three years to advise and assist local
engineers in the design and use of PVC drainage pipe systems and for
training purposes. The need for short-term consultants was also stated. No
funds were provided under the Upper Egypt II project for consultant
services, as 15 man-years of consultancy were included already in Upper
Egypt I drainage project but only a fraction of the agreed number of
consultancy years had been used at the time of project appraisal.
3.32     There was further the availability of Dutch bilateral grants which,
however, supplied most of their expertise to the Drainage Research Institute
and through the bi-annual Dutch-Egyptian prainage Panel meetings.
3.33     It is unfortunate that again under this project the opportunity for
foreign advice, training expertise and assistance in supervision of drainage
installation by local contractors, was lost. No doubt that the absence of
foreign assistance was felt in the selection process of priority areas in
EPAPO's field investigation and design office, in the quality of PVC pipe
production, and in the quality of field drainage installation. The Dutch
aid, except for the interventions by RYP staff in planning, training and
monitoring of drainage installation, however excellent, has had mostly an
indirect impact by means of investigations reporting and recommendations
carried out in DRI and submitted to EPAPD. The Drainage Authority on many
occasions has been reluctant in adopting, on a large scale, DRI or panel
recosnendations.
.Tra1ining
3.34     Provision  was  made  at  appraisal  for  training of engineers and
technicians of EPADP in field drainage practices and of operators and
mechanics in the proper operation and maintenance of equipment. A training
program for agricultural staff employed by EPADP was conducted between July
and October 1978. The total number of people trained was 250 divided into,
five groups. The courses Included design, execution and maintenance of-
drainage works, the irrigation and drainage law and field visits. Similar
training programs for about 140 Agricultural Extension district managers and
400 village agents of the Ministry of Agriculture were conducted in all the
Governorates of Nile Delta and Upper Egypt. Other training activities in
EPADP included on-the-job training of design engineers and field supervisors
and the training of new accountants for the Cost Accounting Unit. The
objective of these training courses was the familiarization of the staff
employed by EPADP in the drainage activities. But the training period was



-46-
too  short  and  the  success  was  limited. More effective was the overseas
training of EPADP's mechanical engineers in the operation and maintenance of
equipment, provided by the suppliers.
3.35     An  agreement  was  signed  in  1983  between  EPADP  and the Dutch
Govermnent for training and technical assistance by the Lake Yssel Polders
Development   Authority.   The   training  program  was  under  the  general
supervision of the Egyptian-Dutch Advisory panel. The program, which expired
in December 1985, provided for training EPADP senior staff and instructors
In Holland, for consultants to provide training in design of field drainage
and In other specialized sL3Jects, and also for the Dutch experts' visits to
Egypt for on-the-Job training of EPADP and contractors personnel. A total of
500 staff of various levels, such as engineers, technicians, machine
operators etc., from EPADP and from public sector contractors have been
trained under this program. Subjects covered in the overall program included
field  investigations,  design,  construction   planning   and   management,
maintenance of completed works and machine operation and maintenance. This
training program was very successful and there is no doubt that it helped to
improve the implementation of the drainage program by EPADP. At the time of
the visit of the completion mission in Egypt, EPADP was negotiating with the
Dutch Goverment representatives for the extension of this training program
for another two years.

IV. OPERATION PERFORMANCE
Design of Field Drainage Works
4.1      General.  The design of the drainage systems is the  responsibility
of the FiTeldInvestigation and Oesign Department of EPADP. The design
capacity of this Department is about 250,000 feddans per year. Pre-design
investigations are carried out at gridpoints of 500 m spacing (i.e. one hole
every 60 feddans). The design album, usually prepared for a subproject of
3,000-5,000   feddans,   includes  topographical  survey,  drainage  layout,
longitudinal sections, structural designs and a list of quantities. Once the
design album is handed over to the construction department, the design
engineer has no further involvement in the construction and operation of
works he has designed. Therefore, no systematic performance feedback reaches
the design engineer from the field and no improvement in project design can
be expected.
4.2      Design of Upper Egypt Drainaqe II Project.  Designs for the project
area started in 1979 and was completed in February 1985. Of the total
project  area  of 496,000 feddans, about 414,000 feddans were designed prior
to July 1983, i.e. prior to the establishment by EPADP of the new design
principles for lateral spacing (see para. 4.4). As mentioned in para. 3.7,
there are sttill some 160,000 feddans under the Upper Egypt Drainage II
project, in which field drainage has not been installed. Of this non
implemented area, about 100,000 feddans have  been  designed  with  the  old
design  principles.  It  is  mission's  recommendation  that  this  area  be
redesigned and implemented according to the new design principles.
4.3      Review of the design albums for the remaining area of the  Droect.
The  Project  Completion  mission  had the opportunity *o review somie of the
design albums of areas included in the programme-for-field drainage but not
yet implemented. From the study of the field investigation data it was found
that some of these areas have low water table and consequently they are not
in immediate need of drainage. These areas are:
a) The entire area of El Rawi (approximately 10,000 feddans).
b) Part of the Tobhar Agameen area (approximately 2,000 feddans).
c) Half of the Abu Teeg II area (approximately 7,000 feddans).
For two more areas, namely Masanda South and Kakkab, the mission has some
doubts as to whether field drainage is required in the total remaining area
for implementation. Mission's rac=nendat1on is that before any decision is
made for the installation of field drainage in these areas new field
investigations be carried out to determine the real drainage needs.
4.4      Laterals  spacing. The  appraisal  report  specified  that lateral.
drains spacing should be designed according  to  the  physical  property  of
soils determined by field investigations and that this spacing would vary
between 25 m and 80 m. However, the practice of EPADP was to design field
drainage systems by converting the computed theoretical lateral spacing to
standard spacings of 40, 50 and 60 m. The reason  given  by  EPADP  for  not
following the theoretical design criteria was that the narrower spacing
would entail a higher cost and more pipe-laying machine hours per unit area,
therefore it would reduce the gross area on which field drainage could be
installed. Supervision missions have questioned the rationale of this



- 48 -
approach nd suggested that if full benefit of field drainage were to be
obtained, adjustments in lateral spacing should be limited to not more than
20% of the coputed value and generally less than 10%. The issue was pursued
with the Chairman of EPADP and the Minister of irrigation and by mid-1983
the Chairman of EPAOP agreed that new design criteria would be applied to
designs carried out after July 1, 1983; designs carried out prior to that
date  have  not  been  revised.  This  means that areas for which design was
prepared prior to the above date were built according to the old design
practices. While the new approach of EPADP was a substantial improvement
over past attitudes, the fact is that this improvement will not affect large
areas with design made prior to July 1983. Bank supervision missions made
special efforts to persuade EPADP to redesign all the non implemented areas
using the new design criteria. A letter was sent by the Chairman of EPAOP to
the Bank on May 22, 1983 summarizing the Authority's position on the issue.
In this letter EPADP held some prooise for revising designs of areas
requiring lateral spacings of less than 40 a. This promise was not kept and
to-date  field  drainage in areas with old design is installed with standard
spacing of 40-50 and 60 .  The  Project  CoWpletion  mission  was  able  to
confirm that in areas with new designs (e.g. Der-el-Sanquariya in the Minieh
Governorate) field drainage was installed with minimum lateral spacing of 30
*. It is recommended that efforts should continue to persuade EPAOP to apply
the new design criteria in the remaining areas for field drainage under the
Upper Egypt Drainage II Project by revising the old designs as soon as
-possible.
4.5      Laterals death.  The depth of  laterals  agreed  in  the  appraisal
Report was1.4 m at the upper end of the lateral and 1.8 m at its connection
with the cellector drain. It was considered that this depth combined with
the proper lateral spacing would have been sufficient to provide for a
reduction of the water table to at least 1 m within 48-72 hours following
irigation.  The  depth  of laterals was later neduced wi1th tho app .-   o4
the Nile Delta Drainage II Project to 1.50 m at the connection of the
lateral with the collector drain. But, as mentioned in the previous
paragraph, laterals are placed by EPADP not always at a spacing determined
by the soil investigations. A remedy of the so caused deficiency of the
drainage system would have been to increase the depth of laterals in order
to obtain the same drainage effect. But there were technical and economic
constraints in doing so, the most important being that a deeper field
drainage system would have required deeper open drain collectors and deeper
pumping. However, since the revision of the design criteria. when soil
investigations showed a lateral spacing of less than 30 m, EPADP has adopted
the principle to increase the laterals depth by 10 cm in order to compensate
for the minimum accepted spacing of 30 a.
4.6      Gravel  envelove.  The  appraisal  report  assumed  that  a  gravel
envelope wil1 be placed around all field drains to prevent sedimentation and
to accelerate the entrance of water into the pipes. The size of gravel
reconmended was between 2 and 10 m. It was further specified in the report
that the general application of gravel filter will be revised later in light
of the results from field tests to be carried out during the first  year  of
the project. However, the Egyptian-Dutch Advisory Panel for Land Drainage in
Egypt decidet that gravel envelope could be omitted in soils which had a
clay content greater than 40%. Therefore, contrary to the original intention
to equip all laterals with gravel filter EPADP had limited its use to
laterals with a spacing of 60 m or more. Bank consultants have continued to
advocate the use of gravel envelope around the laterals in all types of
soil. Discussions with EPADP by various Bank staff who argued against
Panel's recommendation were ineffective. The argument of EPADP's experts was
that Egyptian soil conditions are unusual in that the soil sepms to be more
stable than normal arid region soil and therefore gravel filter is not



_ 49 -
required in soils of a high clay content. The Completion Report mission was
informed that a recent ORI study indicated a reduced risk of sedimentation
in corrugated PVC pipes as copared with concrete pipes due to the fact that
with the PVC pipes better quality work can be achieved. Thus, DRI's
recomendatlon Is to adopt a clay content of 30% (instead of 40%) as a limit
above which no cover material for laterals is needed, provided that the soil
is of good structure. The Issue of gravel envelope has not yet been resolved
and results are awaited for the completion of field investigations and
trials, carried out by the Drainage Research Institute. To date results of
these trials are inconclusive. The appraisal report for Drainage V (May
1985) specifies that the use of gravel envelope will be limited to laterals
with a spacing of 60 m or more and for lesser drain spacing where needed due
to the presence of unstable soil at drain depth.
4.7      Manholes.  Over  the years the manholes in their present form (with
a cover above the ground) proved to be a cause of maintenance  problems  for
the  covered drainage systems. Farmers often cut holes in the superstructure
of the manhole to dispose of excess surface water and children drop rubbish,
stones and earth. As a result the pipe collectors often are blocked through
the manholes and the covered drainage systems need frequent flushing and
maintenance. Bank missions several times recommended to EPADP to replace the
present above-the-ground type of manhole with a buried manhole which would
not be easily accessible, thus, abuse could be avoided. To date, no action
was taken by EPADP to modify the manhole design. However, during appraisal
of the Drainage V project it was agreed that the covered drainage systems
will be provided with buried manholes, except where open manholes are
required. The Completion Report mission recommends the revision of the
design of manholes in the remaining area for field drainage under the Upper
Egypt Drainage II Project.
Quality Control of Drainae Works
4.8      On  several  occasions Bank supervision missions have reported poor
quility of drainage works and lack of adequate supervision. Although in
recent years standards of construction have improved, due obviously to the
experience gaired by EPADP and the contractors involved, there are still
construction aspects that need improvement. They are:
a) Quality  of  PVC  olasticipipes.  Defects have been observed in the
past in the PVC pipes produced by the three factories. The problems
relate to the position, size, shape and consistency of slots being
cut in the pipe.  In  the  field  it  was  noticed  that  very  few
defective pipes were rejected. This means that there were cases
where.weak and inefficient pipes have been installed. The Project
Completion  mission  noticed that the situation has Improved and in
general the pipes currently used are of an acceptable standard.
However,  it  should  be  stressed  to  the  Chairman of EPADP that
adequate supervision in the factories and in the field should be
provided at all times in order to avoid production and installation
of inadequate pipes.
b) Allisment and grade control of laterals.  This aspect was sometimes
neglected by the supervisor engineers. The aligmuent and grade of
laterals in general is arranged by the machine drivers through
manual steering via a visual view finder. But no adequate control
was applied by the engineers. In some cases no proper instrument
(level)   was   available  at  the  site  to  check  the  depth  of
installation and grade. In the mission's opinion more attention
should be paid to this in the future. A good solution would have
been the automation of control by the use of laser equipment.



- 50 -
c) Back filling of trenches. Backfilling of trenchers after the pipes
are laid was not always satisfactory. Trenches were filled with
loose  soils,  often  by  the  farmers  themselves,   without   any
compaction. At the first irrigation water enters the pipes at high
velocity through the loose back-filling, carrying silt which is
deposited in the pipes and causes blockage. It is recommended that
the backfill be placed Immediately after the pipe has been laid and
that it should be moderately compacted to avoid settlement.
d) Gravel enveloPe. In spite of all the Bank missions rramarks and
recommendations to EPADP, the quality and quantity of  gravel  used
as  an  envelope  for  the laterals continues to be inadequate. The
excuse often given by the contractors for this is the low price
allowed for gravel in the contract and the fact that well graded
gravel is not easily found ln Egypt. Neither of these excuses are
valid. The price of gravel Is fixed by the contractors themselves
during tendering and at least one huge deposit of excellent quality
gravel was seen by the mission on the east side of the Cairo-
Alexandria desert road, near the south Tahrir area. One supervision
mission (November 1984) suggested to the Chairman of EPADP that a
detailed study be carried out on gravel deposits in the country,
including means and cost of transport and laying methods and that
the conclusions of this study be generally applied on the ongoing
drainage projects. It was also suggested that EPADP should increase
the price allowed for gravel in the old contracts. Special
arrangements should also be made on the pipe laying machine to
provide a complete surround of the lateral at a thickness not less
than 5 cm. To. date no action has been taken by EPADP on these
recommendations. The Project Completion mission recommends that
special attention should be paid by the Bank to this issue and that
continuous pressure should be exercised on EPADP for improvement of
the quality of gravel in the remaining area of the project.
e) Manholes. It is: important that each manhole be provided with a
silt trap of sufficient size by installing the base slab at least
20 to 30 cm, below the invert of the outgoing collector. In field
visits it was often found that the silt trap is much less than 20
cm. Attention should be paid by EPADP's supervision engineers on
this aspect.
f) Wrapping of collectors cement Pipes at the Joints. Another point
that needs attention and Improvement Is the jolnts of the cement
pipe collectors. At the Joints a wrapping of bitumen impregnated
canvas is used. But in many cases the wrapping is placed only on
the upper half of the joint leaving the lower half exposed. This
may cause sedimentation inside the collector pipe. Instructions
should be issued by EPAOP to all supervision engineers to insist on
a complete wrapping of the Joints in all drainage projects.
Operation and Maintenance of Drainage Works
4.9      EPADP is responsible for the OEM of all completed  drainage  works,
both during the implementation period and after completion of the project.
However, during construction and for one year following completion of a
contract unit, the contractor is responsible for the maintenance of the
subsurface drains. He also is required to flush all laterals twice. The
responsibility for O&M of subsurface drains and the associated surface
drains was transferred from the Irrigation Department to the EPAOP in 1979.



-51-
This helped in establishing lines of responsibility in accordance with
geographic units and in structuring and enlarging the O&M organization to
make it more effective. The EPADP's existing organizational structure for
maintaining both surface and subsurface drains is shown in Chart 2 and Annex
14. The Undersecretary for maintenance controls eight field Directorates,
five in the Delta and three in Upper Egypt. Under each Directorate are a
number of centers, each responsible for maintaining drainage works in an
area of about -40,000 to 50,000 feddans. Under the centers are subcentres,
each responsible for about 5,000 feddans of subsurface drains. At present,
there are in Upper Egypt 25 maintenance centres and 89 subcentres. Channel
maintenance, which is performed almost entirely by contract, is handled by
the directorates. The staff of the centres and subcentres are mostly
concerned with maintenance of subsurface drainage which is now performed
exclusively by force account.
4.10     Maintenance of open drains in Egypt have, in the past, not been  of
a satisfactory standard due mainly to extremely difficult environmental
conditions (which result in very rapid weed growth in open drains), staffing
limitations, and technical shortcomings. Whilst EPADP has, in the last few
years, improved maintenance of drains, further improvement is required. The
Bank project, Channel Maintenance Project, appraised in May. 1986 1/ is
designated to provide for improved maintenance of both irrigation canals and
open   drains.   The  project  will  introduce  modern  channel  maintenance
practices, replacing the traditional system of excavation with a balanced
cycle  of  weed  mowing,  herbicide  treatment and desilting. Maintenance of
field drains was until recently done manually. But in view of the shortage
of  labour and to improve the efficiency of field drainage systems, flushing
machines have been purchased and used.
4.11     The  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  pumping  stations,  once
constructed and tested, is the responsibility of the Electrical and
Mechanical Department of the Ministry of Irrigation.
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)
4.12     A reements.  According to  section  2.08  of  the  Upper  Egypt  II
Drainage  Project  Agreement  th,  Authority was, within two years after the
date of loan signature or any other date agreed, to complete the evaluation
of the effect of drainage works under previous Nile Delta I and Upper Egypt
I drainage projects on crop yields and soil properties, and thereafter
continue  to  carry  out or carry out. as the case may be. the evaluation of
such drainage works and those included in Upper Eqypt II drainage project.
Th4is eiifTon  was  amended during negotiations of Nile Delta II project and
EPAPO agreed to complete the above mentioned study for Nile Delta I by June,
1978 and for Upper Egypt I by June 1979 and complete the evaluation of Upper
Egypt II drainage project by June 1982 and of Nile Delta II by June 1984.
EPAPD also agreed to furnish interim reports on evaluation by June 1981 for
Upper Egypt II drainage project and by June 1983 for Nile Oelta II drainage
project and continue evaluation of each of the four projects referred to for
a period of six years from the dates mentioned.
4.13     When it was realized during supervisions that existing  crop  yield
data, collected by cooperatives were not reliable due to the fact that they
did not account for factors other than drainage that affect yields (cultural
practices, inputs, pest problems etc.) it was agreed to initiate a new M&E
V The project is not yet effective.



- 52 -
pvograxie with an improved methodology. The new monitoring system was
started early 1978 supported by Dutch technical assistance and carried out
mainly by DRI staff. It was devided into two distinct parts: (1) a two year
crash programme aimed at providing *rough indications on effectiveness of
drainage* and (1i) a five-year long range programme. The programme was
conducted by a newly created Division of project Appraisal and Evaluation in
DRI with 20 to 25 persons headed by a Dutch consultant, resident in Egypt
during the programme.
4.14     Consequently section  2.08  of  the  project  agreement  was  again
modified in March 1979, through another amendment, in which EPAPD agreed to
furnish by February 1979 an initial report, thereafter semi-annual progress
reports until December 1980 on its on-going crash programme for evaluating
the effects of completed drainagee works, by December 1980 an interim report
and by February 1981 a final report on the findings of the said programme.
Furthermore, EPADP was to submit to the Bank an initial report, progress
reports and a final report by November 1984 on the findings of the long-
range programme for drainage evaluation.
4.15     Institutional  chanQes.  By  decree  415  of  i978   the   Drainage
Authority re-established also the Evaluation Committee of Drainage Works
comprising five members of EPAPO and four members of the Ministry of
Agriculture. Monthly meetings were arranged.-
4.16     In   September   1979   another   Ministerial   decree  created  an
interministerial  OSupreme"  comtittee  to  review  all  on-going   drainage
activities and methodology to investigate the effect of drainage on relevant
soil parameters, water balance and production covered by the programme.
Hoeuevers due to inaction of this co-wittee which mat only in Jure Rn fnr thp
firit time no substantial impact was made on the evaluation program. An
"Executive  Committee"  was  founded  in  1982  to  coordinate  the  various
programmes.
4.17     The  ORI  Crash  Programme.  The  initial  reports  of  the   crash
programme  published mid-1979 covered results of two twin villages, one with
and without drainage, all situated in the Delta I project area and indicated
substantial  yield increases: berseem 18-36%, wheat 5-19% and rice over 50%.
It was then concluded that the major effect of drainage was to reduce.
salinity  and  that  response  can  mainly be expected in salinity sensitive
crops.          -
4.18     The crash programme was expanded late 1979 to include  three  pairs
of twin villages to compare with and without drainage situation. Seventy-
five observations were made for each village. Unlike the procedure followed
in the EPADP ex-post evaluation programme, data on yields were obtained from
crop cuttings made by ORI staff. Moreover, various other data such as input
use, supply of irrigation water, and functioning of the drainage system were
collected. Data collection and analysis were conducted by seven junior
Egyptian engineers, one senior Egyptian scientist, and one Dutch resident
expert.
4.19     Generally the final results painted a moderately  positive  picture
but for at least three reasons they did not show a consistent trend:
- although soil salinity varied in all three sets of twin villages,
it did not present a serious constraint on growth of the five main
crops (cotton, wheat, rice, berseem, maize) in any of them;



- 53 -
- in two of the three drained villages, a large proportion of the
drainage system appeared to be functioning poorly;
- contrary to a common belief that sufficient water is available for
all the farmers in the Delta, and that they are responsible for
high watertables by over-irrigating, it was found that in the
summer season several areas suffer from severe water shortages thus
affecting yields.
Gross value added/feddan increased or decreased compared to non-tile drained
areas for the different crops as follows:
Berseem          -  2to + 40%
Wheat               7 to + 31%
Rice             - 13 to + 80%
Cotton           - 30 to + 51%
Maize            - 14 to - 21%
Yield  has  been  reckoned  the  determining factor for assessment of GVA as
production costs did not differ much. The reasons for onegative values could
be that there were other production constraints or the tile drainage system
was functioning inadequately. Potential benefits from drainage were lost
because in some cases pest control and not drainage was the limiting factor.
In the three drained villages, yields were about 30% higher in the period
1977/80 compared to a 17% increase over the same period in the three
undrained villages. Quite apart from these three factors it should be
emphasized that the three sets of twin villages represent too small a sample
to yield more tan a rough estimate.
4,20     Because of certain methodological controversies doubt arose on  the
usefulness  of  crop yield response evaluation programmes in the MOI and the
Dutch Government decided to stop  financial  contribution  for  the  regular
programme. The Egyptian staff was reassigned and the Dutch resident engineer
left to wwrite-hi.s final report. DRI's evaluation work came to a halt in
1982. Following a recommendation of the Advisory panel at its 12th meeting
early in 1983, a Workshop on Economic Evaluation of Drainage projects was
held in Lelystad (the Netherlands) on 2 September, 1983. The participants
(including the Panel members and a representative of the World Bank) agreed
that the evaluation effort should be continued. This conclusion was endorsed
by the 13th Panel meeting. In light of the experience  gained,  the  renewed
effort should be carried out at a larger scale so as to enhance the
significance of the results. A detailed proposal for M&E was proposed to the
MOI by the Bank and FAO/CP project during the Identification of Drainage V
ProJect but despite initial agreement not enacted and staff of DRI was
reassigned to other activities.
4.21     EPAPO  ex-cost  evaluation  croQramn.  The  evaluation division in
EPAPO's Department of Planning and Follow-up created in 1970 produced a
series of nine reports'covering large areas of Nile Delta I and Upper Egypt
I projects. Yields of four major crops were measured by the Agricultural
Economic. Institute  of  the  Ministry  of Agriculture using random sampling
technique. The aim of the evaluation, contrary to to the crash programme
method, was to compare yields before and after drainage in areas with and
without drainage using the followTng fomula:



- S4 -
o rn  a  (YIn - Ylo  -  YOn - YOo)  x 100

YIn a Yield inside project area n years after drainage installation
YOo - Yield outside project area before drainage installation
YOn * Yield outside project area n years after drainage installation
DYn - percentage yield increase
Results of the data analysis carried out by EPAPO are given in the table
below and indicate relatively modest positive crop response five to ten
years after installation. Various reasons can be put forward to explain the
significant differences between the invariably substantial increases found
in pilot areas (the latest being the Mashtul pilot area report, 1986) and
those from EPAPOs ex-post evaluation programme and also to explain the very
wide scatter of data from one area 1/ or sub-area to another and from season
to season. The main reasons are: maTntenance problems with open drains, due
to heavy weed growth giving rise to high watter levels in open drains,
delayed  construction  in  drainage   pumping   stations,   field   drainage
construction problems, etc. World Bank supervision missions frequently urged
EPAPO to link yield results with depth of watertable.

4.22     No data so far is available for the Upper Egypt II and  Nile  Delta
II projects and a considerable backlog of data analyses is developing in the
unit for yield evaluation. Now that considerable efforts are made by EPAPO'
to   strengthen  monitoring  of  soil  and  water  salinity  watertable  a:d
permeability factors new initiatives in the evaluation of crop response
should be taken in order to increase the credibility of the drainage
programme. The recommendationos made by various WS supervision missions
j/ Catchment areas varied from 10,000 to 100,000 feddans and sub-areas from
1,000 to 20,000 feddans.

should also be taken into account to improve the program. The results from
the Mashtul project area are again a confirmation of the importance of tile
drainage.
4.23     Other   M&E   activities.  Late  1982  a  soil  research  unit  was
established In EPAPDS's Field Investigation and design division which, in
cooperation with the SWI of MOA and ORI would study the effect of subsurface
drainage on depth of watertable and improvement of soil salinity. Due to the
limited means of the unit,results of this effort so far have been modest. In
the Mashtul pilot project area (260 feddans located in the Eastern Delta),
the OR! is essentially concentrated on testing drainage techniques and
economic aspects under controlled conditions. A routine program was executed
for data collection on water application, groundwater levels and salinity,
farm management, pratices soil salinity and alkalinity, crop yields and
drainage outflows. Very encouraging crop yield response results were
obtained.
4.24     New initiatives.  As agroed during the appraisal of the Drainage  V
Project  (October  1984),  EPAPO  has strengthened its M&E Unit. It has also
recruted, through the Project Planning Department of MOI, a short-term
expatriate consultant to assist in setting up the programme and training of
personnel. The programme is now focussing to investigating and reporting on
the impact of drainage on depth to water table, soil salinity and on such
other aspects as may be appropriate. In addition t* the Director General and
his  deputy,  this  unit  at  present  has  four  civil   ngineers  and five
agricultural engineers. In order to maintain this new momentum it is
proposed to have regular short visits by PPO financed consultants, to
backstop this new unit and to integrate also the work of the yield response
unit  in  this  program_e.  The  Planning  and  follow-up unit has also been
strengthened recently  with  Dutch  assistance  to  inore  effective'   plan,
coordinate  and  monitor  the  activities under the project in ter   of both
targets and budgets. At pr4sent, the unit has nine qualified engineers,
including the General Director and his deputy. The implementation monitoring
plan has been agreed that would include computerized data management for
consolidated reporting, identification of bottle-necks, providing inputs to
improved programme planning and budgeting, and for reporting to the IBRO.
4.25     Conclusions reqardirq Upper EqYPt Drainaqe  II  Project.  From  the
above  it  1s  clear that virtually no crop yield response data, salinity or
watertable measurements concerning the areas Implemented with tile drainage
will be available for this project since ORI has not developed any research
activities in the Mile Valley and is not planning to do so. Further, due to
the backlog of work and under-staffing in EPAPODs crop evaluation unit it is
unlikely that results of MOA Economic Research  Institute   will  be  timely
analysed. Yield response required for economic re-evaluation of this project
can therefore only be based on the results of EPAPO's ex-post evaluation for
Upper Egypt Drainage I project.
Cost Recovery System
4.26     Aqreemert.  The   Development   Credit   Agreement  (Section  3.05)
requires EPAPO to ake arrangements for the recovery from users of irrigated
land of capital costs with interest and O&M costs for field drains capital
costs would be recovered in a maximum of 20 annual instalments. According to
Article  23  of  Law  No.  74 of Irrigation and Drainage, issued in 1971 the
Ministry of Irrigation should prepare a statement of expenditures of
construction  of  the  Field  Drainage,  including  all  costs  born  by the
Ministry, plus 1OX for the administrative expenses; then state the cost  per
feddan  in  the  area  of  the drainage unit. The farmer has to bear all the
costs of constructing the field drainage, whether he is the  owner,  or  the



- 56 -
tenant or the usufructuary. Both the owner and the tenant have to bear the
cost if they are using the land in farming. The assessment mentioned should
be paid either in cash or in instalments, so that-all costs should be paid
in not more than 20 years. The money will be collected start1ng from the
year after execution. Further, according to article 23: (1) statements on
values to be recovered are sent to Treasury which has to Issue a decree
concerning the collection of the assessments and its sheduled time in
connection with the land tax and with the same priority; (ii) a list of
benefic~.ry's  share  of  the  costs will be issued in an Egyptian Daily and
displayed In the Main Office of the Agricultural Cooperation Committee, and
the Notice Board in the Markaz or Police Station; (iii) farmers may object
within a period of 30 days whereafter expenditures become final; (iv) the
Estate Tax Department (ETD-MOF) is responsible for collection of the
assessments according to lists prepared by the Egyptian Public Authority of
Survey Services (EPASS) and Expropriation; (v) lists are thoroughly reviewed
and corrected through the Issuing of decrees.
4.27     SYstem chanqes.  Prior to 1981 costs  were  recovered  through  the
Internal revenue tax collectors. The Council of Ministers decided in April
1981, and order No. 62 was issued in 1981 by the Minister of Agriculture, to
charge tile drainage costs through the Principal Bank for Development and
Credit through its village branches and deduct charge from proceeds from
cooperatively marketed crops. The latter system never fonctioned fully in
practice for many reasons, the two most important being: (i) the objection
from the Central Agency for Auditing to the collection of charges by the
village banks and (ii) the decision that village banks should not be
involved in marketing of basic crops. In November 1983 it was decided to
return the collection operation to the ETD. This was confirmed in Irrigation
and Drainage Law No. 12 issued in 1984. Executive orders.issued in October
1984 restituted the 3% incentives to collect the charges amongst government
agencies as follows: 0.5% to EPAPO, 1.0% for the EPASS and 1.5% for the MTD.
4.28     Results.  The   changes.  of  collection  system  during  the  main
implementatoin period of both Upper Egypt 1I  and  Nile  Delta  II  Drainage
projects has seriously affected the start of cost recovery operations for
both projects in these areas. During the period 1980 to present collection
of charges has been on average below 20% of the amount due. During the
1983/84 financial year only LE 0.05 million was recovered for the four World
Bank financed projects. The situation markedly improved during 1984/85 and
1985/86 with recoveries respectively of LE 0.26 million and LE 1.27 million.
Still, the latter amount recovered was only 18% of the amounts due. EPAPO
was not able to provide records of cost recovery by project which make a
more detailed analysis difficult. As part of the new monitoring and
evaluition effort started under the Drainage V  Project  it  is  recomended
that EPAPO keep systematic records of cost recovery by project and area and
that theese be shown in the quarterly reports to the Bank. EPAPO should also
assess the total arrears by project which by now are considerable. Annex 18
gives a total assessment of costs to be recovered and actual recoveries
during 1980/81 to 1985/86.              ,
4.29     According  to  side Letter No. 3 EPAPO agreed to undertake within a
year a study of (1) the possibilities and ways of recovering capital and O&M
costs of field drainage works, (ii) to adjust these charges periodically and
(iii) the ability of farmers to pay the said charges. A first incomplete
study was presented to the Bank in August 1980. Through successive
_mndments to the Project Agreements the date of completion of the report
was postponed till June 1981. EPAPO agreed to provide the bank with a more
substantive study to be prepared by them in collaboratioon with the
Agricultural Economic Institute of MOA. This report was made available to
the Bank in draft late 1984.

Achievements of the Bilharzia Control Programme 1/
4.30     Very substantial progress has been made in reducing prevalence-rate
of  infection  and controlling disease in the Middle and Upper Egypt. It has
demonstrated over a large area inhabited by some 10.2 million people in 1984
that control by integrated measures of area wide mollusciciding and
selective mass chemotherapy can be delivered and maintained over a time-span
of up to 8 years. The baseline information in 1977, first year of the
control operations, shows a prevalence of about 30% in Middle Egypt. This
has  been  reduced  to  about  7.4%  by  the  end  of 1985. The reduction in
prevalence has been  accompanied  by  a  large  reduction  in  intensity  of
infection  to  low levels, consistent with the presence of low worm burdens.
However, transmission still continues in the project area and significant
reinfections,  particularly   among  schoolchildren  have been taking place.
Thus, continuation of the control measures through the maintenance phase of
the programme is necessary. The table below shows the overall prevalence of
Bilharzia in Middle Egypt.
Year               Prevalence (X)
1977                  29.4
1983                  10.5
1984                   8.5
1985                   7.4
The cost of the Bilharzia programme is surprisingly low. In Middle Egypt the
total cost for the period 1977/84 was  about  LE  26  million.  The  average
populatioi   covered by the programme in this area is abqut 5 million people.
Therefore the average annual cost per person for the intensive and
consolidation  phases  of  the  programme  was  about LE 0.64. The Bilharzia
control cost in 1984 was just over 8% of the budgeted per capita cost of all
Government health services. Annex 1S shows the foreign cost for the
procurement of equlpment and-materials and Annex 16 the local expenditures.

V. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE ANC DEVELOPMENT
EoYDtian Public Authority for Drainage ProJects
5.1      Pi'esent  orqanization  structure.  In  late  1972  the  Nile  Delta
Drainage Authority and the organizatlon responsible for drainage in Upper
Egypt were merged. Accordingly, the Egyptian Public Authority for Drainage
Projects (EPADP) was established by a presidential decree issued in February
1973 with responsibility for executing all drainage works in Egypt. EPADP is
eupowered  to  carry  out  all  field  investigations,   planning,   design.
evaluation, procurement, construction, budgeting and operation of projects
accounts. The present organization structure of EPADP is shown in Chart 2.
5.2      During the caurse of the  project  various  changes  were  made  to
EPADP's organizatio'i. The two posts of Vice-Chairman were merged but six
departments were created, during the period from 1978 to 1980, each headed
by an under-secretary. The mechanical and electrical division was upgraded
to a department and a maintenance department was created. This former is now
responsible for supervising the installation of (new) pumping stations,
transmission-lines, maintenance workshops and mechanical equipment. Under
previous WB drainage projects, operation and maintenance of completed
drainage systems (open and buried) remained the responsibility of the
irrigation departments of the MIO. In 1979, in order to improve the
allocation of funds, supply of equipment and the organization of O&, GOE
rightly transferred responsibility for the O&M of surface and sub-surface
drains in tiled areas to EPADP. So far, EPADP is responsible for 2.0 million
feddans  of  tile  drainage,  the  responsibility of the balance of the tile
drained area still lying with the contractors (about 1.0 million feddans).
The total maintenance budget for 1983/84 was LE 8.0 million of which LE 6.0
million was used for open drain maintenance by the four MOI Public
Excavation Companies. EPADP now has one under-secretary for planning and
follow-up, and two under secretaries for project implementation, one for the
Delta and one for Upper Egypt. The latter are responsible for surveys and
design for channel remodelling and construction of both open drains and
field drainage (supervision of construction). Upper Egypt is divided into
seven directorates, i.e. Beni Suef, which includes Giza and the Fayoum,
Niniya,  Assyut,  Sohaq,  Qena  ahd  Aswan.  In charge of procurement Is the
Administration  and  Finance  Department  of  EPADP.  An  ad hoc   committee
comprising the Chairman, Vice-Chairman and head of the Technical Office of
EPADP approve specifications prepared by the design office.. It also
evaluates bids and makes recommendations for contract awards.
5.3      EPAOP  presently employs at its Cairo Headquarters and directorates
about 3,600 permanent staff, of which 266 civil engineers, 101 mechanical
and 105 agricultural engineers. Casual labourers (mainly in the Delta and
Upper Egypt) number about 2,500 and work particularly in the field of drain
maintenance.   For   design  and  supervision  of  construction,  EPADP  has
strengthened the division and had in 1985 592 employees in four directorates
in the Delta and 1,412 in seven directorates in Upper Egypt. The number of
permanent mechanics and labourers used for construction is Qn average three
times higher in Upper Egypt than in the Delta, but the number of engineers
is practically the same. For maintenance of existing drainage systems the
Authority employs 975 staff, of which 646 are working in the Delta and 284
In Upper Egypt.



-59-
5.4      Performance  of  EPADP.  While  the  Authority  suffered during the
initial stages of the project from an inadequate organizational set-up and
frequent changes in leadership, many positive steps have been taken and
stability and continuity in senior positions since 1981 have led to
noticeable qualitative and quantitative improvements. The relations with
other governmental organizations involved in drainage (DRI, EALIP, MOA) have
improved and the bi-annual meetings of the Dutch/Egyptian drainage panel are
a convenient forum for dialogue, exchange of technical information and
innovations.
5.5      EPADP  has  been  suffering  during  the course of the project from
shortages of engineers and frequent changes in staff due to the low wage
structure in EPAOP in particular, and the MO' in general, and this despite
the special allowances paid to EPADP staff since 1977 on request from the
Bank. Shortages in civil engineers were particularly felt in the areas of
design, construction planning and control and reporting.
5.6      With the support of Dutch bilateral assistance, various  groups  of
senior engineers' in EPADP and the contractors were trained in construction
management, quality control, and operation and maintenance of drainage
machinery by the Lake Yssel Polders Development Authority in Holland. On-
the-job training for junior engineers was also successfully organised by the
same organisation (see para. 3.35).
Contractors
5.7      Actual  instaliation of tile drainage in Upper Egypt was contracted
in 1980 to seven construction companies, of which six public-owned and one
private. Several public companies were attached to the General Authority for
Land Reclamation, since recently integrated in the Ministry of Agriculture.
The nublic companies often use small private enterprises as sub-contractors..
Open drain remodelling was mainly executed by four MOI public excavation
companies.  A  detailed  analysis  of performance of contractors involved in
Upper Egypt II and Delta II Projects is given in the preparation  report  of
Drainage V  Project prepared by FAO/CP. Likewise, an analysis performance of
the four  MOI  companies  in  open  drain  maintenance  and  remodelling  is
available  in  the  channel  maintenance preparation report also prepared by
FAO/CP. Both reports contain a series of recommendations for improvement  of
contractor performance, spare parts management, maintenance and repairs
which could result in a 10% reduction of down-time, an increase of 18% of
productive days per year and an increase of daily productivity by 10%.
Realistic tender prices (price of field drainage installation per feddan)
were urged to enable contractors to pay sufficient labour wages to overcome
'down-time caused by labour shortage..
Ministry of Health
5.8      The Bilharzia programme is carried out through four  administration
levels (i) Ministry of Health - Oepartment of Endemic diseases with the
overall responsibility for the execution of the programme; (ii) the health
di-ectorate of the governorate where the director of Endemic diseases is thee
Executive Director in charge of the Bilharzia control activities; (iii) the
district manager w1,Q is responsible for the activities within the district;
and (iv) the Rural Health Units (RHU). The workload  of  all   concerned  is
considerable and on each level only a percentage of the total work time is
being spent on Bilharzia control.



- 60 -
5.9      The   present   management   system  is  appropriate.  Procurement,
logistics,  storage  and  distribution  of  drugs  and   molluscicides   are
undertaken efficiently. The transport system is in good condition and well
supervised. Personnel management is adequate, most positions are filled. The
present   organizational   structure   is   geared   to   execute  area-wide
mollusciciding, and snail and human prevalence surveys. Chemotherapy is
handled through the RHU. In the future the emphasis will be more on
chemotherapy and less on mollusciciding. These changes of strategy will have
cobsequences on the management structure.

VI.  BENEFITS AND ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
6.1      Benefits  from  oPen  drain  remodelling.  The  remodelling of open
drains on 500,000 feddans is a pre-requisite for a well functioning field
drainage system but has also non-negligible indirect benefits which are
easily overlooked. While widening and deepening existing drains, often
choked with weeds because of the drain maintenance backlog, drains are
automatically deweeded and maintained, which represent a considerable saving
in economic terms on the MOI maintenance budget. The average cost per feddan
for drain maintenance was LE 2,200/km in 1984-85. Hence at 1984-85 unit
costs the saving in drain maintenance on 1,226 km of open and branch drains
was LE 2.7 million. Direct benefits from the 346 km of new open drains and
remodelling of the existing open drains are difficult to quantify but are
considered in conjunction with those of field drainage system. Besides the
evacuation of field drainage discharges deeper open drains also facilitate
direct drainage in a strip of land on both sides of the drain according to
soil permeability parameters.
6.2      Estimated   crop   yield   benefits   from   the   field   drainaqe
system.  Relief of the drainage constraint is  essential  if  a  progressive
declTine   in   yields  is  to  be  arrested  and  significarnt  Increases  in
agricultural production are to be achieved in the future. However, the
direct  impact  on  which  project benefits are calculated has been assessed
only on the basis of the limited changes in yield which are expected without
any change in agricultural practices.
6.3      During  project  appraisal  it was assumed that without the project
production  would  gradually  decline  due  to  increased  waterlogging  and
salinity  by  30%  over  a  35 year project period. With the project, yields
would rise from existing levels by4i6 to 35% (see table overleaf). Four
general considerations lead to more caution on the effect of drainage in
Upper Egypt:
1) the inconclusive results of EPAPO ex-post evaluation of Upper Egypt
I Project shown in para. 4.21;
II) the  unavailability   at  present  of  crop yield response data for
Upper Egypt Drainage II project areas;
iii) the  general  impression  from  observations  of   detailed   field
investigation data, available in EPAPD, Indicating that constraints
in terms of soil salinity, soil permeability, watertable depth,
etc. in certain project drainage basins were less severe than in
Upper Egypt I catchments and than anticipated at project appraisal;
iv) part of the field drainage system is not fully operational due to
certain design-(wide spacing) construction or maintenance problems'
(blocked collectors) not yet resolved.



- 62 -
Considering the above, yield declines without improved open and field
drainage systems are now conservatively esttmated to be on average about  5%
over the said 35 year period and incremental yields with drainage ranging
from 7% to 15%. This conservative assumption is shown below:

The  net  incremental  benefits  of  the  project  resulting  from the above

6.4      Proiect  economic  rate  of  return.  The  re-estimation   of   the.
project's rate of return provides interesting Insights concerning the value
of the drainage program though care should be taken in its interpretation
given uncertainties on crop yield response and local project costs. Local
project costs have been converted to.constant 1986 ecor.nmic values using the
deflators published by WB 1/ to give a total cost in LE of 326 million,
including costs for 160,000 feddans still to be equipped with field drainage
(see Annex 17, table 2). Local costs were increased with an average
accounting factor of 1.7 (see Annex 17, table 3) to reflect subsidies in
energy, cement and other cost items. Calculated over a 30 year project life
the basic ERR is now estimated at 14%. The appraisal estimate was 29%. This
lower ERR ts explained basically by the conservative yield response
estimates.

6.5      Switching  values  have  been  estimated (see Annex 17, table 4) to
indicate that the minimum net benefits that would result in a minimum
acceptable ERR of 12% would be 11.6% below those given in para. 6.3. It is
however likely that benefits will exceed those assumed and a sensitivity
analysis in Annex 17, table 5 indicates that with increases in yields of 20%
and 50% the ERR increases to 17 and 23% respectively . Further, some
indications from aerial photographs taken in 1984/85 show crop response in
certain upper Egypt catchments more rapid than the five years assumed in
this analysis. In conclusion, it would seem that despite the administrative,
management and construction problems associated with this project it has
still 'been a worthwhile investment for the nation. It is recommended that
during the course of the fifth drainage project, EPAPD continues its ex-post
evaluation program and collects technical soil and water parameters which
could improve the present data base and reveal likely a better crop response
than now assumed.

VII. BANK PERFORMANCE
1.1      Supervision of the project by the Bank was timely and satisfactory.
The supervision missions were instrumental in drawing attention to potential
problems and in assisting the Goveriment in finding  appropriate  solutions.
In spite of some contentious subjects (use of consultants, design issues,
monitoring and evaluation, etc.), the Bank staff succeeded in maintaining a
continued good relationship with the Egyptian officials. The flexible
position  taken  by  the  Bank  in  various  aspects,  during  the   project
i1plementation, proved to be correct and beneficial for the project.
7.2      In  evaluating  Bank's performance, it is now obvious that too much
confidence was placed on the managerial capabilities of EPA4P and on the
capacity of the public sector contractors. The proof for this are the long
delays in implementing the project. Efforts made during the course of the
project for accelerating the drainage programme have been unsuccessful.
Equally unsuccessful were the efforts made by the Bank to improve certain
aspects of quality control, to carry out adequate monitoring and evaluation
of drainage works, to establish a good cooperation between Extension Service
and EPADP, and to improve cost recovery. This completion report provides a
good opportunity for the Bank to consider, first, whether remedial actions
should have been taken during project implementation for compliance to
Bank's recommendations, and second what kind of action should be taken in
on-going , and   future  projects.  However,  there  are  cases  where  Bank
supervision missions succeeded in making-improvements. These cases are the
Introduction by EPADP of new design principles for field drainage, the
better  organization  of  maintenance  service  for  drainage   works,   the
Improvement in quality of PVC pipes produced in Egypt, etc.
7.3      There  can  be  no  doubt  that  the  Bank made the right choice in
selecting drainage for its priority lending activity in the agricultural
sector. Investment in drainage is a sound long-term investment and a
necessary condition for attaining high levels of agricultural production.
7.4      As far as  the' Bilharzia  Control  Programme  is  concerned,  Bank
supervision missions have been valuable in stimulating the necessary'
organization  of   control   inputs,   data   collection   and   evaluation.
Consideration should, however, be given to greater direct involvement of
Bank staff for supervisi0 in any future programme of this kind and scale,
since the main supervision effort was carried out by a consultant in
tropical diseases,  and  little  specialist  support  was  provided  by  the
Population, Health and Nutrition Department.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
Project Justification and ObJectives
8.1      There is no doubt that investment to remove the drainage constraint
in large areas of the Nile Valley was both timely and necessary to allow
additional investments in development of the sector. On the whole the
project is making a valuable contribution towards arresting waterlogging and
salinizat1on and towards increased agricultural production. Although field
drainage has not yet been Installed on about one third of the planned area,
all other components have been implemented including a highly successful
Bilharzia control component. Farmers will be asst'red that their agricultural
land will remain highly pr-ductive and furthei yield increases from advanced
technological packages can now be more safely promoted.
8.2      In terms of economic re-evaluation, the project does not appear  to
have performed as estimated at appraisal. This is not due to cost overruns,
but to the more conservative estimation of project benefits because of the
absence of sufficiently convincing crop response data from the project area.
The ERR is nevertheless still 14% sufficient to justify the project
investments.
ProJect Content and Schedulina
8.3      The  general concept of the project was sound and relatively simple
and its implementation took advantage of the experience gained from both
drainage installation and bilharzia control under the previous projects.
However, .experience showved that the estimation of time required to execute
such a large drainage programme was overly optimistic. In fact more than
double ttme will be required to complete the project than--that planned at
appraisal. The insufficient preparation of the project and inadequacy of
technical data to substantiate the selection and delineation of project
drainage basins led subsequently to frequent changes during execution. The
introduction of a new drainage pipe material, a major innovation in Egypt
was delayed for almost 3 years and this was the major cause for late project
completion. Subsequently EPAPO reached an average rate of implementation of
70  to  90,000  feddans  annually which was substantially below the original
target of 140,000 feddans.
Lessons Learned
8.4      ProJect preparation  and  designs.  The  absence  of  a  reasonably
complete feasibility study (prepared with participation of international
drainage specialists) and field investigations (reconnaissance or semi-
detailed level) led to frequent changes in priorities of selected areas
during project implementation. In addition, there is a  feeling  that  there
are areas where drainage was installed without being necessary. What is,
required is that field investigations at a reconnaissance level be carried
out in order to determine the areas where field drainage should be
installed. To this effect  clear  technicaT  selection  criteria  should  be
adopted as a guide in this process.
8.5      Timimn  of  appraisal.  Droject  effectiveness  and oroJect start-
UD. In Egypt, a long time usually elapses between-appraisal and actual full
scale commence of project implementation. for instance the Upper Egypt
Drainage II project was appraised in may 1976 but full scale operations did



- 66 -
not start before 1980, i.e. almost four years later. Bank should keep this
in mind In future projects in Egypt and project implementetion schedules
should be realistically proposed. Allowances should be maue for initial
.delays in Assemby's approval of the project, compliance to conditions of
effectiveness etc. as well as for carrying out preparatory arrangements for
the execution of the project, such as tendering, award of contracts,
mobilization of contractors etc.
8.6      But in spite of the above delays the general conclusion is that the
project was appraised too eirly by the Bank. At the time of appraisal
completion of field drainage under the ongo'ng Upper Egypt Drainage I
project was only 27%. Becuase of the already known limited performance
capability of EPAPD .and contractors, Bank should have awaited at least until
half of the field drainage area  of  Upper  Egypt  Drainage  I project  was
implem_nted  before  proceeding  to  the  appraisal  of the new project. The
argument that time should be allowed for  the  remodelling  of  open  drains
prior  to  the  field  drainage  is  not  valid since experience showed that
remodelling of open drains was implemented fast and well in advance of field
drainage.
8.7      Technoloqical   chanqes.  The   project   proved   that   a   major
technological change I.e. the shift from concrete tiles to locally produced
PVC pipes was feas'ble on a large scale and the drainage systems built with
plastic pipes proved to be safer and more efficient. After initial problems
with cnntract negotiations and insv.ailation of equipment, production of PVC
pipes in terms of quantity was adequate. Some quality problems (mainly pipe
perforations)  have  been  overcome and the three production units will also
supply pipe required for the areas in the Nile Valley included in the
Drainage   V   Project.   Other  technological  successful  change  was  thq
tntroduction of  collector  pipe  laying  machines  by  which  most  of  the
collectors were installed.
8.8      Construction  delays.  Contractors  did  not  perform  as  well  as
expected and contract completion took much longer than anticipated. There is
clearly a need to strengthen the local construction industry and Government
should envisage the participation of the private sector companies. One of
the reasons for the inadequate performance was the inappropriately low unit
price quotations of Public Companies during tendering and subsequently the
insufficient adjustments for price inflation. In future public companies
should be urged to propose more realistic unit prices for contracts in order
to   avoid   financial   problems   and  ultimately  delays  during  project
implementation.  Managerial  problems  (planning  of  work,   down-time   of
machinery, spare parts, etc.) are another cause of slow performance
frequently noticed during WB supervisions ard which  can  be  remedied  with
manag e nt training and support.
8.9      Technical  improvements. The  Drainage  Authority  has  often been
conservatve tn adopting technical innovations proposed by ORI, Bank
missions and/or the Dutch Egyptian drainage panel. Lateral drain spacing was
the major change adopted during the project and this certainly was.
beneficial, but many other changes proposed (drain pipe envelopes, joints,
manholes, etc.) have still not been implemented. EPAPO engineers are
qualified and have the capabilities to try out Improvement quickly on large
areas and should be further encouraged to do so.
8.10     Cost recovery. The annual recovery of capital  and  O&M  costs  of
field drainage works has been on average below 25% of amounts due. The
recovery system Is complex and the transPer of responsibility for collection
of charges from tax collectors to village banks led to insignificant amounts
recovered during 1982/83 and 1983/84. The Ministry of Irrigation has



- 67 -
reversed to the initial system and improved incentives for tax collection
recently and recoveries improved. But there is nevertheless need for an in
depth revision of the system, in order to Increase its efficiency and cost-
effectiveness.
8.11     Other lessons which can be learned from the project are:
1) the need to have adequate maintenance not only of the field
drainage  network  but  also  of  the  open  drainage system and to
establish timely the required infrastructure. In this respect, the
decision  to  give  EPAPO the responsibility for all maintenance of
drains in tile drained areas appears to have been appropriate;
II) to insist on continuity in  international  training  and  technical
support   such   as   the   excellent   Dutch-Egyptian  cooperation
(preferably through grants) in order to enhance the rapid adoption
and use of technical innovations, design, management information
and support systems. EPAPD's senior staff is aware that scope
exists for improvement of planning the methods and has called on
assistance of the Netherlands Government to continue and expand
training,  and   introduce   compouterized   planning,  design  and
management techniques;
iii) to  further  develop  pilot  areas  with   vertical   drainage   in
collaboration   with  the  Groundwater  Research  Institute  as  an
alternative/complement to subsurface drainage in certain areas of
the Nile Valley and in view of reusing drainage water to supplement
irrigation with Nile water;
iv) to encourage EPAPO to participate in integrated soil and water
management   pilot   areas   and  drainage  re-use  and  irrigation
improvement projects.

For the Kiddie Egypt Project in the  intenance phase, the

In the Upper  gt project, the prset timing of the area-wide

ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT - NILE DELTA DRAINAGE II PROJECT
(CREDIT 719, LOANS 1439/1440-EGT)
I.  INTRODUCTION
General
1.1      This  completion report for Nile Delta Drainage II Project, gives a
further opportunity to record and evaluate the performance on the fourth
project  in the largest multi-stage field drainage ;rogramme ever undertaken
in the world. The project provided the substantive financial assistance to
the Government of Egypt's (GOE) policy of providing improved drainage
throughout miost of the approximately 5.7 million feddans I/ of the
historically irrigated area ("the old lands") in the Delta and Upper Egypt.
The project aimed to provide field drainage to some 7% of this area and,
following the pattern set by the previous projects. The Bank extended Its
previous participation in' the di'a1nage programme (Nile Delta I and Upper
Egypt I and II drainage projects) by financing this and one further project
(Orainage V project) involving five IDA credits and three World Bank loans
totalling USS 246 million. The project and its successors has also attracted
significant amounts of aid from other donors including USAID, KfW, the
African Development Fund and Bank. in the form of co-financing (three
credit/loans totalling USS 82 mtilion). The World Food Programme   has  also
participated In 'the first drainage irojects and the Netherlands Government
is supporting the-drainage programme with technical assistance. The five
projects together cover improvement of surface drains in about 2.84 million
feddans and installation of subsurface drainage in about 2.60 miiion
feddans (abiut 46% of the old lands irrigated areas). &nnll_1 presents
salient features and status of each of the repeater projects. 2/
1.2      This loan/credit, the  third  in  the  vital  agricultural  sector,
Aepresented a continuation of Bank Group lending operations in Egypt. Credit
719-EGT and loans 1239/1440-EGT for USS 66.0 million were signed on July
15,  1977  and  became  effective  on  April  17,  1978.  The  Closing Date,
originally December 31, 1983, was extended twice to December 31   1985.  The
final disbursement from the cred't/loan was made on August 22, 1986 bringing
the total amount disbursed to the original USS 66.0 million. On this 'date,
the installation of field drainage, an activity critical to fu l completion
of the project, was accompi'.hed in 391,000 feddans out of the 400,000
feddans originally planned. Existing open drains were remodelled and new
drains excavated on the 810,000 feddans as planned. Co-financing of OM 50.0
million was obtained from KfW to cover installation of two PVC pipe
factories and foreign production costs of PVC-pipes. Disbursements to date
are DM 42.3 million.
/ Or 2.4 million ha (1 feddan a 0.42 ha)
O EPAPO installed 968,000 feddans with tile drainage independently before
and during the WB projects. Hence the total area installed will be about
63% of the "old lands".



-114-
Aoricultural Sector
1.3      Egypt's population, soon to reach 50 million, is large and  growing
at an annual rate of 2.5% almost half of this growth is concentrated in the
greater Cairo area. Arid desert lnd accounts for about 96.5% of the one
million  km2  of  surface  area,  leaving  only  35,500  km2  of  urban  and
agriculturally productive land with a population density of about 1,400/km2.
Almost 50% of the population is rural, its proportion having steadily
declined from 62% in 1960. Average per capita GNP estimate was IJSS 644 in
1984/85.
1.4      The  high  economic  growth (8%-10% in real terms) in the 1970s was
chiefly the result of a surge in foreign exchange resources, based mainly
on external factors - concessional capital inflows, primarily from other
Arab countries, earnings from petroleum exports and from the Suez Canal,
tourism receipts and workers' remittances. While these resources enabled
Egypt to achieve a high level of growth they also made the economy very
susceptible to outside Influences. The lesser flow of external resources
since 1981 produced a slowdown of economic growth. The downturn was
triggered by a fall in oil prices, exacerbated by a decline in tourism
receipts, remittance earnings and a slowdown in Suez Canal earnings
following the saneral slowdown in the world economy. The prospects for
greater external resources are worsening. Therefore, the challenge that
Egypt now faces is to make those difficu't choice, it was able to avoid when
exogenous resources  were  plentiful.  They  involve:  the  mobilization  of
resource, raising the efficiency of investments, improving the capability of
the domestic egonomy to absorb a growing labour force; and earning foreign
exchange. Economic growth will depend on the pace and comprehensiveness of
the policy reforms, which should be designed to eliminate the distortions in
the economy.
1.5     Apricilture   in the  economy.  The  land  base  for  agricultural
production consists of 5.7 million feddans (2.4 million ha) of 'old lands'
nd 0.9 million feddans (0.4 million ha) of reclaimed lands - the so-called
"old-new lands". Only one-half of the latter is considered productive, due
partly to deficienciee in technical design and partly due to inappropriate
managcment. The per capita cultivated area, which was 0.19 feddans in 1960,
is now only about 0.13 feddans. The old lands include all of the more
fertile areas in the valley of the Nile and the Delta where about 97% of the
nation's total agricultural production is generated. The old-new lands were
developed from the late 1950s through the early 1970s, pr'marily on the
marginal soils along the western edge of the Delta. Ne-irly all Egyptian
agriculture is irrigated and, since completion of the HAD, all irrigation is
perennial.
1.6     The  importance  of  agriculture  in the  Egyptian economy changed
significantly during the 1970s. Historically, agriculture was the dominant
sector, providing the bulk of employment and output, being crucial to
foreign exchange earnings and receiving substantial budgetary support. The
sector's vital role was reinforced by its strong performance during the
1952/70 period. During the 1960s, ogricultural production grew at over 3%
annually - an exceptional performance, given the relatively high base level.
1.7     In  the 1970s, the pace of growth declined to around 2%. Given that
the high growth rates of the previous decade Included the impact of
controlled releases from the HAD, this does not reflect a significant change
in the underlying growth trend and is still an Impressive performance.
However, other factors accentuated the slowdown in agricultural growth:
first, population continued to grow at over 2.5%; second, per capita income



- i', -
grew very rapidly; and third, consumer prices for foodstuffs held at
extremely low levels compounded the demand increases generated by the first
two factors.
1.8      The  net  effect of the declining trends is summarized in the table

1.9      Agricultural constraints.  Aside from the very limited availability
of arable land, several major constraints have prevented agriculture from
performing  its  potentially   key  role   in .the  economy  :  (a)  limited
investment in the sector; (b) the problematic situation with respect to
waterlogging and soil salinity; (c) Institutional weaknesses in agricultural
supporting services; (d) deterioration of the water delivery and drainage
channels due to inadequate maintenance and inadequate water distribution
systems; (e) Government system of regulated cropping patterns and marketing
at low fixed prices; (f) labour shortages at times of peak demand due to
migration both to cities and abroad; and (g.) failure to develop and use
technology needed for expanding agricultural production. Another major
constraint to agricultural growth is developing, i.e. water availability in
the Nile System. If land reclamation is allowed on a disproportionately
large-scale and. possibly also In uneconomic areas without parallel efforts
in water conservation, re-use and improved mandgement, then water shortages
in summer are expected to become a general problem 'n many command areas of
the "old lands".
Land Constraints and Importance of Improved Drainage
1.10     Good land for crop production is scarce in Egypt and development of
desert/saline marshy lands identified by GOE for reclamation is cost
intensive with lengthy gestation periods. Therefore, the main source of
increases in agricultural production in the short run must be the old lands.
On these lands productivity is still constrained even today by inadequate
drainage in about 1.5 million feddans. The priority thus lies in continuing
drainage  programme  under which  some  3.1  million feddans will have been
equipped with field drains by mid-1987. This is justified since no input
package to increase production will be fully successful until the drainage
constraint has been removed. While there is little evidence that land is



- 116 -
going out of production as a result of waterlogging and salinization caused
by high groundwater levels, it is clear that rising soil salinity in some
areas is causing yields to decline. The need for drainage arises from the
occurrence of waterlogging and high salinity levels in soil and groundwater
level. The position of the groundwater level is not static but fluctuates in
response to Irrigation, rainfall, evaporation and (natural) drainage.
1.11     In the project area, most of the soils are  non-saline  soils  (EC-
Saturation Extract less than 4 mmhos/cm). However, in the north.ern sector of
the East Delta and in parts of the West Delta there are fairly large and
numerous patches of moderate, strongly and even very strongly saline soils.
In the Central Delta, small parcels of moderately saline soils are found. No
maJor alkali problems were in the project area. The frequent high water
table in the project area was causing waterlogging and prevented leaching of
incoming salts from the root zone. If the productivity of the area was to be
maintained, accumulated salinity had to be removed and the high water table
lowered. The installation of sub-surface field drainage on a massive scale
thus became a prerequisite for preserving this productive area of Egypt.
Field drainage, as proposed for the project, was an appropriate method te
extract excess groundwater and control its level.
1.12     In spite of the fact that  high-yielding  strains  of  main  crops:
cotton, rice wheat and maize had been introduced, fertilizer applications
increased,  disease  and  insect  control  improved  and  support   services
expanded, the yields of rice, wheat and maize have remained constant on.
average over the decade since 1965. Cotton yields, on the other hand,
decreased markedly since 1969. Also, in certain areas yields of all the
major crops have already declined. The major reason for this situation Is
attributed  to  the  constant  deterioration  of the cultivated lands due to
waterlogging and salinity. In the 26 districts, which were scheduled for
field drainage under the project, the 1972-75 avc;age yields on those soils
suffering from waterlogging and salinity show as much as a 46% reduction in
yield for maize, 50% for cotton and wheat and 30% for rice, below the
average yields on soils  in  the  same  district  which  are  not  seriously
affected by waterlogging and salinity. Without adequate drainage facilities,
it was estimated that average crop yields in the project area would decline
by at least 30% over the next 35 years.
1.13     Before  designing  and installing the tile drainage system detailed
field investigations were made in each catchment area by the Drainage
Authority to establish the constraints and need for drainage on the basis of
four main par2meters: depth of shallow groundwater table, soil permeability,
soil salinity and water salinity. Results of detailed investigations were
plotted on detailed maps. Due to the unavailability in the Authority of
clear set of crit3ria for selection, delineation and priority ranking of
drainage basins, the use of results of detailed investigations have not been
optimal and some doubts have arisen on the ranking and selection of methods
used for certain catchment areas in the Delta particularly in areas with
unstable or problem soils.
1.14     The  Government  has been giving high priority to the tile drainage
programme over the past 15 years. During the 10 years ending 1985/86, the
capital expenditures on all irrigation activities in Egypt totalled LE 1,883
million. Out of this, drainage alone accounted for LE 661 million or 35%.
Annex 2 shows the Ministry of Irrigation's (M¢1) recurrent and capital
expenditure. The MOI current planning is to complete the Upper Egypt II
field drainage project component and to start with the fir;t phase of the
Drainage V program covering about 0.47 million feddans by 1990. Draining the
remaining 0.86 million teddans of the Drainage V programme is likely to take
at least until 1996.

Bank's Agricultural Lending
1.15     Since 1970, the Bank has financed 19 projects in  the  agricultural
sector in Egypt. Initially the Bank's policy was to encourage the Government
to maintain and increase production levels in the "old lands". This was done
through the series of five drainage projects, of which 637/1285 EGT was the
third, and through the Agricultural Development Project  (Credit   830-UAR).
Over  time  there  has  been further diversification, in particular In agro-
industries with two projects, fruit and vegetable production and marketing,
land reclamation with the New Lands Development Project. Other agricultural
sector ,upport projects financed by the World Bank concerned cotton  ginning
rehabilitation, fertilizer productions, agricultural/industrial imports,
rural electrification, technical assistance respectively to the Ministries
of Irrigation and Land Reclamation, Irrigation and Drainage Pumping Stations
Rehabilitation and recently Channel Maintenance. Details on these projects
are given in Annex 3.
Bilharzia Control
1.16     Bilharzia,  a  disease  known in Egypt since hundreds of years, has
caused immeasurable misery to people, death and most certainly a marked loss
of productivity; since the 1900's many a control scheme has been tried. The
Government of Egypt has, since many years, sponsored Bilharzia control and
tried with pilot and large scale projects, given the respective tools of
each period, to gain control of the disease. But only in the last few years,
with the advent of efficient drugs and molluscicides as well as improved
strategies and better basic health coverage have control measures succeeded
in producing and sustaining significant results in terms of a reduction of
morbidity and reduction of infection.
1.17     Within Middle and Upper Egypt, particularly in the northern region,
Bilharzia is endemic. In Upper Egypt Drainage I Project, a programme for the.
control of Bilharzia, covering 900,000 feddans and about 3 million people
has been initiated. It consists of an integrated snail control programme
coupled with chemotherapy for Infected persons. The Bilharzia project
comprised the area controlled by the Ibrahimia and Bahr Yousef canals
comiencing at the Dairut Barrage which is downstream of the head reguiator
at Asyut on the Nile. Abouat 120,000 feddans between Asyut and Dairut
Barrages were included in the programme to permit the whole area served from
the Asyut barrage to be treated, thereby reducing the possibility of
reinfecting treated areas. The Upper Egypt II credit and loan also included
provisions for financing the cost overrun of the Bilharzia control component
of Upper Egypt Drainage I Project. Under the Nile Delta II project, the
control componint in Upper EqYvt was to be expanded by 1.2 million feddan
thereby instituting a control programme over the entire cultivated area from
Giza to the Aswan High Dam.

II. PROJECT FORMUIATION
Prolect Orioin
2.1      The  Idea  of  a  Bank  financed  drainage  project  in  Egypt  was
orig4nated by a Bank economic mission which visited the country in July
196%. This idea was further advanced by a Bank agricultural mission which
visited Egypt in September 1968. The mission proposed, as a first priority,
a project which included Installation of field drainage in part of the Nile
Delta together with remodelling and construction of open drains and erection
of the drainage pumping stations required. This project, later called Nile
Delta Drainage I Project, was appraised by the Bank in December 1968 and the
Credit (181-UAR) became effective on December 22, 1970.
2.2      In 1972 a request was made by the Government of Egypt for financing
by IDA of a second drainage project in Upper Egypt, where waterlogging and
soil salinity in certain areas constituted major constraints to maintaining
land productivity. This second drainage project, the Upper Egypt Drainage I
Project, was appraised by the Bank in March 1972, and the Credit (393-EGT)
became effective on November 28, 1973.
2.3      Up  to the end of 1975, construction and remodelling of open drains
and erection of pumping stations had progressed satisfactorily. However,
progress in Installing field drainage was slow due to several problems the
two projects faced. Of these, the most serious were the lack of local funds,
the shortage of engineers due to the 1973 war, toe shortage of cement for
the production of concrete pipes, the poor performance of local public
sector contractors and other managerial problems.
2.4      By  the  beginning  of  1975  the  Government  had  made sufficient
allocation of funds to the drainage projects and the shortage of engineers
was no longer a problem as most of them had been released from the army.
Encouraged by these improvements, the Ministry of Irrigation made a new
request to the Bank for financing a third drainage project, covering the
remaining areas in Upper Egypt which  suffered  waterlogging  and  salinity.
This project, the Upper Egypt Drainage II, was appraised by the Bank in
December 1975 and the Credit/Loan 637/1285-EGT became effective on January
31, 1977.
2.5      The  Government requested further IOA/Bank assistance to assure the
financing of the continuatfon of the  drainage  programme  which  was  still
considered of first priority. The proposed fourth drainage project was
designed to provide In the Nile Delta four new pumping stations, two more to
be rehabilitated, remodelling of open drains over an area of about.800,O00
feddans, and installing field drainage on 1,000,000 feddans.
Feasibility Report
2.6      An FAO/IBRO CP mission visited Egypt in July 1976 to  assist  EPAOP
1n the preparation of the proposed Nile Delta Drainage II Project. The FAO
mission was presented with a short report which was much too general, and
without tables. The mission discussed this report with EPADP and left
detailed guidelines for finalization of project preparation. Subsequently,
EPADP submitted to the Bank the feasibility report in September 1976.



- 119 -
2.7      The  feasibility. report was reasonably comprehensive as far as the
description of project works was concerned but, as in previous feasibility
reports prepared by EPADP, was short on justification for selection of
project areas. The selection of the areas for field drainage was based on a
soil survey covering the Lower Delta, conducted by the Ministry of
Agriculture in 1971. No detailed field investigations (water table depth,
hydraulic conductivity of soils etc.) had been conducted prior to the
selection of the areas. Thus, the areas included in the project appeared to
have been selected on practical considerations seconded by some field
observations. Furthermore, there was a complete absence in the report of a
justification of the project as a whole based on investments and expected
benefits. Finally, the implementation schedule in the report was over
optimistic.
Appraisal
2.8      The  appraisal  of the project wds carried out in October 1976. The
appraisal mission reviewed the basic assumptions made in the Feasibility
Report and visited many areas proposed for field drainage. Special attention
was given by the mission to the proposed implementation rate of the  project
works and to the estimation of project cost. The mission also collected and
reviewed all the available data on the effect of drainage on crop yields in
an effort to make a better estimation of project benefits.
2.9      Following  the  appraisal mission, the scope of the project and its
period of implementat10n were debated in the Bank. It was considered that
the  project  scope,  as originally proposed by the Government, was much too
ambitious. Taking into account the implementation capacity of EPAOP and  the
financial  constraints,  it  was  decided  to  iiclude  in  the  project the
construction of four new pumping stations  and  the  rehabilitation  of  two
-more,  the  remodelling-of open drains on an area of 810,000 feddans and the
installation of field drainage on  400,000  feddans  (instead  of  1,000,000
feddans proposed by the Government). It was also decided to include in the
project a Bilharzia control component to cover the area between Asyut and
Aswan  in  Upper  Egypt.  Finally,  it  was  decided  to  cover  part of the
expenditures  for  the  UNOP  Master  Plan  for  Water  Resources   Project,
represertitng Government's foreign exchange contribution.
2.10     As   far  as  the  implementation  period  was  concerned,  it  was
considered  that  (a) with  the  additional  equipment  provided  under  the
project, (b) the use of PVC plastic pipes (instead of concrete pipes used In
the previous projects) and (c) the opening of tenders for field drainage to
foreign contractors, it would have been possible to reach an implementation
rate of field drainage of 140,000 feddans annually, starting from the third
year. Therefore it was accepted that the project could have been completed
within a five-year period. This proved later to be a very optimistic
assumption.
2.11     Tht. Bank was informed In January 1976 of the intention of KfW 1/ to
participate in the financing of the proje-t. The matter was further
discussed between KfW and the Bank in Washington and it was agreed to
propose to the Government a parallel financing agreement by which KfW would
finance all foreign costs required for the production of the PVC plastic
1/ Kreditanstalt fOr Wiederaufbau of the Federal Republic of Germany.

pipes in Egypt as well as part of local costs for the installation of field
drainage. A separate agreement was later signed between Government and KfW
on this subject.
2.12     At  the  time of appraisal, three issues became apparent. The first
was related to the recovery of field drainage -cost including maintenance
from the beneficiaries, the second to the establishment of a special fund to
help  overcome  difficulties  experienced  in  the  past   regarding   ready
availability of local funds, and the third to the evaluation of drainage
works and their effect on crops. On these issues, the Government was advised
before negotiations that its representatives should be prepared to reach
necessary agreement with the Bank.
Negotiations
2.13     Negotiations took place in Washington during the period April 4  to
8, 1977. Agreement was reached on the following main issues:
a) Cost recovery: In order to overcome the issue related to the
recovery of maintenance costs of field drainage, EPADP undertook
the responsibility to furnish to the Bank not later than June 30,
1978 a report on the ability of farmers to pay for drainage works,
including maintenance cost.
b) Special fund: The delegation agreed to the establishment of a
Special Fund designed to help overcome difficulties experienced in
the past retarding ready availability of local funds.
c) Evaluation of drainaqe works: The delegation agreed to complete
evaluation of drainage works alreajy completed in areas under Nile
Delta I Project on June 30, 1978, complete such evaluation in areas
under  Upper  Egypt I  Project  on  June 30,  1979,  and   complete
evaluation in areas under Upper Egypt II and Nile Delta II Project
on -June 30, 1982 and June 30, 1984 respectively.
2.14     Ouring  negotiations full agreement wes reached on the scope of the
project as described below.
The ProJect
2.15     The primary objective of the project approved by the Bank Board  on
May 31. 1977 was to improve drainage on 1,000,000 feddans in Nile Delta at a
total cost of USS 207 million equivalent. An IDA credit of USS 27.0 million,
a Bank loan of USS 27.0 million and a "third window" loan of USS 12.0
million were allocated to cover foreign expenses of the project. The project
description incorporated in the Development Credit Agreement is given in
Annex 4. The project included the remodelling of 1,565 km of existing open
drains covering an area of 810,000 feddans, the installation of field
drainage on about 400,000 teddans and the construction of four new pumping
stations and the rehabilitation of two more. A Bilharzia control component
was included by which the Bilharzia programme was expanded by 1,200,000
feddans in the area between Asyut barrage and Aswan dam, and a provision was
made for financing part of the foreign cost for a UNDP-financed project
designed to draw up a Master Plan for Water Resources Development and Use,
for which the Bank was the executing agency.

2.16     The  agreement  between  Government  and  KfW  for  cofinancing the
project with OM 100 million was signed on July 30, 1979. According to this
agreement, the amount of OM 44.43 million was allocated for the production
of PVC pipes for the project while the remaining amount of OM 55.57 million
was allocated for financing local cost.

III.  IMPLEMENTATTON
ProJect Aareement
3.1      The Project Agreement, the Development  Credit  Agreement  and  the
Loan Agreements were signed on July 15, 1977. At the same date was also
signed the side letter on External Debt of ARE.
Effectiveness and Start-up
3.2      In addition to the standard conditions of effectiveness  there  was
one specific condition: that the Government will establish a "special fund"
for the previous and proposed IDA/Bank-financed drainage projects for timely
allocation of local funds. This specific condition was met when assurances
had  been  obtained  that  the  Special  Fund  had  been  established.   The
credit/loans were declared effective on April 17, 1978, about 9 montns after
the signature date.
3.3      As far as the cofinancer's loan was concerned, a specific condition
was included in the Development Credit Agreement that "the failure of the
agreement with KfW becoming effective by December 31, 1977 or by another
date to be agreed upon between tne Government and IDA/Bank will be a
condition of default unless the  Government  will  be  able  to  secure  the
additional funds required from other sources."
An Overview of ProJect History
3.4      The  agreed  implementat"'"   schedule  arojected  completion of the
drainage component of the project by end of 1982. The closing date of
credit/loan was set as December 31. 1983. Many events contributed to a
considerable delay in project completion. The drainage works were completed
on September 30, 1986, i.e. almost four years behind schedule. There are
three pumping stations not yet completed of which one, included in the
project in 1983, is expected to become operational in September 1989. The
closing date was revised twice to accommodate delays in implementation. The
credit/loans were finally closed on December 31, 1985 but the accounts were
kept open for making disbursements against commitments made before this
date. The entire amount of the credit/loans of USS 66 million was finally
disbursed.
Revisions
3.5      No major changes were made during  the  project  execution  in  its
"ope, and objectives. However, some changes were made in the areas of field
orainage and in pumping stations. Thus, an area of 41,000 feddans (Bahr Saft
Ext.) was excluded from the project and shifted to the Dutch-financed
drainage project and an area of 20,000 feddans (Belbis) was implemented
under the Mile Pelta I project. Another area of 15,000 feddans (Darawa) was
excluded   because   of   special   soil   problems   requiring   additional
Investigations. In exchange, areas totalling 70,000 feddans that originally
were planned to be executed with Government's own resources, were included
in the project. Annex 5 presents by catchment unit the areas at appraisal
and the areas actually implemented. Changes also occurred in the pumping
stations. The pumping station of Darwa was substituted by the larger one of
Bilad-El-Ayed and one more station, El Arin, was added in 1983. Annex 7
shows the changes in the pumping stations and their status of completion.
Most of the above changes were beneficial to the project and gave some



- 123 -
flexibility   to  EPADP  in  the  implementation  of  its  overall  drainage
programme.
3.6      Amendments were also made  to  projects  agreements  by  which  the
original dates for the submission to the Bank by EPAOP of the study on the
evaluation effect of drainage works and the study of the ability of farmers
to pay were postponed. Also amendments were made on the date for the
establishment of the cost accounting system and on the training programme.
3.7      Revisions  made  during  the  execution  of  the  project  on   the
allocations of project funds by category are shown in Annex 9(a).
ImPlementation Schedule of Drainage Works
3.8      In  general  the- implementation  of project drainage works run far
behind schedule and these works were completed in September 1986. This shows
how unrealistic were the assumptions made about project implementation at
appraisal. Instead of the expected five-year implementation period, the
project took nine years to be completed (without completion of pumping
stations). Oelays have occurred in all the three main components of drainage
works i.e. pumping stations, open drains and field drainage. On the original
target completion date of December 31, 1982, the achievements were 40% on
civil works for the pumping stations (erection of pump units had not
started), 72% for open drains.and 20% for field drainage.
3.9      Many factors contributed to cause delays in project implementation.
The specific delaying factors for each drainage component are examined
below:
a) Pumvinq stations. This is the activity, that presented serious
problems and caused the major delays in project completion. The
contract for the rehabilitation of the two pumping stations was
awarded in November 1979 and for the construction of the four new
stations in February 1980 (almost two years after effectiveness).
The equipment for all pumping stations arrived in June 1981. Civil
works on three of the new pumping stations started in March 1981
and on the fourth one in May 1983. This shows the inefficiency of
the local contractor in mobilizing and in organizing the work.  The
fifth new pumping station (added in early 1983) was tendered in
May 1983 but the contract was awarded in October 1984 because of
some disputes over terms of payment. The rehabilitatton of the two
stations was completed in December 1984 (five years after the award
of the contract) while erection of puFOs started in three of the
new stations in early 1985. To date (Octooer 1986) two new stations
(Bilad-El-Ayed and Mehala-El-Kobra) are completed, one is expected
to be completed in April 1987 (Dellngat Extension), and the fourth
one (Abu Hommos) in December 1988. The contract for civil works for
the fifth station (El Arin) was cancelled and now EPAOP is in the
process of retendering. This station is not expected to be ready
before September 1989. In sumary, due to the combined inefficiency
of  contractors and slow performance of EPAOP, the four new pumping
stations instead to be completed by the end  of  1979,  as  it  was
estimated at appraisal, will be completed by the end of 1988, i.e.
nine years later. The case of the station of  Abu  Hommos  is  very
unfortunate because in the area served by this station, some 36,000
feddans  have  been  already  provided  with  field  drainage   not
functioning properly because of the high water level in the main
open collector (Annex 7).



- 124 -
b) Open drains. This activity presented the least problems in project
implementat1on. Remodelling and construction of open drains started
a few months after effectiveness by using old equipment available
to the contractors. The execution of this component was kept
intentionally slow because the work on open drains was too far
ahead of field drainage installation and the slower paced progress
helped to achieve a better balance between these two activities.
The component of open drains was completed by June 1985 i.e. three
and a half years behind scnedule (Annex 6).
c) field drailnage. This activity also presented problems and caused
delays in project completion. The implementation of field  drainage
started with a small contract of 10,000 feddans in January 1981.
The major contracts for the execution of work were awarded in
October 1980 but work started by the end of 1981, i.e. two years
later than appraisal estimate. The reasons for this delay were:
(1) the long time elapsed between effectiveness and the signature
of the agreement with the cofinancer KfW as well as the delay for
making arrangements for the production of PVC pipes for the
project; (ii) the delay of EPADP in the award of contracts for the
execution of field drainage; (the award occurred in October 1980,
i.e. two years behind schedule); (iii) delay in the procurement of
equipment   by  the  contractors  and  (iv) delay  in  contractors'
mobilization. But even later, the annual installation rate of field
drainage was slow, on average for the five years of full activities.
76,000 feddans (maximum 91,000 feddan, in the. year 1984/85)
compared to appraisal estimate of 130,000-140,000 feddans. The
reasons for this slow progress was the poor performance of the
public sector contractors. It is unfortunate that although the
tendering of field drainage works was made through ICB, no foreign
contractors presented a bid, obviously because they knew in advance
that they did not have a chance to compete with the low prices of
the   public  sector  contractors.  Another  conclusion  was  that,
although the use of plastic PVC pipes and heavy duty laying
machines for the collector pipes made easier the whole operation of
installing field drainage, the contractors, because of their
managerial weaknesses, did not take advantage of this. In fact the
contractors' performance showed a poor utilization of the resources
made available to them. For example the utilization of laying
machines was far below accepted standards. On average the collector
machines were utilized 118 days a year and the lateral machines 162
days a year. These figures show clearly that the contractors
management of the machines was extremely inefficient. If the
contractors could have increased their utilization rate by 50%
(which is considered normal) the drainage area constructed in a
year would have been more than 100,000 feddans. It has to be
mentioned that, to some extent, there were operational difficulties
in areas planted with rice.
3.10     But there is no doubt that EPADP also has a share of responsibility
for the slow performance of contractors. There was no adequate planning and
supervision of drainage works and EPADP proved to have no effective means of
enforcing the conditions of contracts. The situation could have been
different If EPADP had made use of consultants as provided in the appraisal
report, to advise on overall planning  and  coordination  of  works  and  on
technical matters related to the drainage works. Despite the efforts made by
the supervision missions and the Bank to persuade EPADP to hire consultants,
they refused to do so. They claimed that strict governmental instructions
did  not  allow  them  to  use  funds  from  the  credit/'oan  for   foteign



- 125 -
consultants. EPAO was getting some technical advices for its drainage
programme through a panel of Egyptian and Outch experts, sponsored by the
Dutch Bilateral Programme. Annex 8 shows the overall implementation rate of
field drainage for all projects.
3.11     The options available to the Bank staff to do anything  about  slow
implementation were limited because the Bank had little leverage for
interference with the working of the public sector contractors. At the
request of the Bank's supervision mission of May 1984, : meeting was
organized by the Vice Chairman of EPA')P in which the Undersecretaries in
charge and t!!e Chairmen of the main constructing companies involved with
drainage works participated. According to the Chairmen of these companies,
the main problems faced by them were the procurement of spare parts for the
pipe laying machines and the old contract unit prices that needed adjustment
due to inflation. As a result of this meeting some action was taken by EPAOP
to improve procurement of spare parts and a modest price escalation of the
old contracts was adopted. However, these measures did not cause any
aramatic improvement in implementation rates in the following years.
3.12     It became clear to Bank staff that control over project  activities
and decisions had to be the responsIbility of EPADP and that Bank staff
influence could at best be indirect through advice and persuasion. When
oppertunities presented themselves Bank has taken fast action. For instance
when it became obvious that there would be a long delay in the local
production of PVC pipes, Bank agreed to import from the proceeds of the
credit/loan three mobile PVC pipe factories and PVC powder. (Two of the
factories and certain quantities of powder were purchased under Upper Egypt
II Drainage Project). Likewise, when shortages of cement and iron bars
emerged Bank agreed to finance their import from abroad. Also when shortage
of local funds,proved to.be a significant delaying factor the Bank stressed
the  need  for  adequate  funding  to  the Government. Finally, the Bank had
correctly shown flexibility in accepting EPADP's proposals for the amendment
of the field drainage areas in order to facilitate the implementation
programme.
3.13     In summary, it can be said that the time schedule at appraisal  was
over optimistic. The implementation rate of 140,000 feddans per year of
field drainage proved to be unattainable with the use of local contractors.
And the construction period assumed at appraisal for the pumping stations
proved to be too short.
3.14     Chart I presents the time schedule agreed at appraisal for the main
project   activities   and  the  actual  implementation  schedule  of  these
activities.
Imnlementation of Bilharzia Control Programme
3.15     A Bilharzia Control Programme covering an area of  900,000  feddans
was initiated in 1976 under the Upper Egypt Orainage I Project. The
programme, which was implemented by the Ministry of Health, consisted of an
integrated snail contro:l programme combined with chemotherapy for infected
people. About 120,000 feddans located between Asyut and Oariut barrages have
been included in the programme under the Upper Egypt Drainage II Project.
This programme was further extended under the Nile Delta Drainage II Project
to cover an additional area of 1,200,000 feddans between Asyut and the Aswan
High Dam, with a total population of about 5 million people. Chemotherapy
and snail control operations in this area started in March 1980 (intensive
phase), and continued for three years. The consolidation phase followed for
another three years. Starting from 1986 the snail control in this area is



- 126 -
limited to local mollusciciding (maintenance phase). Chemotherapy of
infected  people  continues  to  be  Implemented  based  upon   annual   re-
examination.
3.16     In  general  the  Bilharzia  control component has been implemented
more or less according to plan. Some problems faced earlier with the snail
control operations because of logistic difficulties have been resolved. At
present  the  programme  continues  with  Government's  own  resources.   An
international  evaluation  mission  visited Egypt from October 1984 to April
1985 to evaluate the entire Bilharzia control programme. Annex 19 presents a
summary of the findings of this mission.
Procurement
3.17     Project  equipment  ^or  drainage  works (draglines and excavators,
vehicles, workshop equipment, flushing pumps for maintenance, spare parts
etc) as well as materials (cement, steel, PVC powder) were procured through
ICB in accordance with Bank guidelines. Civil works for field drainage were
also   procured  through  tCB  but  all  contracts  were  awarded  to  local
contractors since no foreign bids were submitted. Civil works, not financed
by the Bank, for construction and remodelling of open drains, and for small
buildings were procured through local tendering in accordance with the
normal procurement procedures of Government. The construction of the new
Aumping stations and the supply of pump units were combined in one contract
and procured through ICB.
3.18     Equipment  for  Bilharzia  control  (vehicles,  etc.)  was procured
through ICB. Molluscicide and drugs used in the Bilharzia control programme
are produced by only one manufacturer in West Germany. Their procurement was
made from this manufacturer on the basis of negotiated prices.
3.19     In general the procurement of equipment, materials and civil  works
under  the  project  was  carried  out  with no special problems (except the
delays) and there were no misprocurement cases. The list of equipment
procured is given in Annex 20.
Accounting. Auditing and Reporting
3.20     According  to  Section 4.02  of the Project Agreement the Authority
was to have its accounts and financial statements for each fiscal year
audited by independant auditors acceptable to the Bank and to furnish
certified copies of financial statements and audit reports w'thin a period
of six months after the end of each fiscal year. According to section 4.03
of the Project Agreement, the Authority was to maintain a cost accounting
uistem established within six months after effectiveness of the Upper Egypt
II project (31 January 1977) to determine relevant costs of the works
carried out by the Authority under the project.
3.21     EPAPO's  Finance  Department  was responsible for the establishment
and maintenance of separate accounts for the project and the Central Audit
Organization (CAO), an independant auditing agency, was responsible for
auditing the accounts of EPAPO including those of the project. The CAO has
presented regularly, though usually later than agreed, annual audit reports
which were satisfactory tc the Bank. These audit reports also contained a
comparison of actual with budget figures and formed part of the MOI
consolidated report presented to the People's Assembly.



- 127 -
3.22     EPAPO  has  had  considerable  difficulties  in establishing a cost
accounting system. The project agreements of the Upper Egypt II and Nile
Delta II projects had to be amended several times by substituting the date
for the establishment of the system ultimately to June 30, 1981. The Bank
provided assistance to EPAPO by draftinc terms of reference for the design,
training of staff, and implementation of the cost accounting system by a
local consulting firm.
3.23     EPAP" recruited in 1977/78 21 accountants who were to form the cost
accounting unit. In May 1979 a firm of chartered accountants had been
contracted to design the system as well as to train four accountants of
EPAPO. Their report was submitted in May 1980 and the cost accounting system
was operational mid-1981. The cost accounting unit and system were reviewed
by a Bank mission in April 1982 and found generally satisfactory. However,
periodic shortages in accounting staff occurred subsequently.
3.24     While  there  is now considerable cost-accounting data available in
the Regional Offices (Directorates) classified by project, little systematic
compilation by project or by component and subcomponent is available it the
central level. This leads to problems of overlapping accounts 6etween
projects (Nile Delta I and II and Upper Egypt I and II). Efforts should be
made to further improve the existing cost accounting system in such a way
that it can be used as an effective tool for project management at the
central level in Cairo. The flow of financial information to the Planning
and Follow-up department in EPAPO should also be more systematic and
summarized financial data should be provided in quarterly reports.
3.25     The Authority's Planning and Follow-up department submits regularly
quarterly reports indicating maiply physical progress with field and oper
drainage. These quarterly reports should be expanded. in the Drainage V
project to contain also data on procurement, equipment available with
contractors and summarized financial data.
ProJect Financing - Disbursements
3.26     Actual withdrawal of proceeds of Credit and Loan  by  category  are
shown in a summarized form in Annex 9a and annually in Annex 9b. Actual
disbursements on a half yearly basis for the full term of the project are
presented in Annex lOa. Some two years delay in completion of the project is
reflected in the extended disbursement period. As shown in Annex lOa, only
about 62% of the Credit and Loan was disbursed by the original closing date
of December 31, 1983. The Credit and Loan was finally fully disbursed on
August 22, 1986. Disbursements of KfW funds are given in Annex 1Ob. Out of
an original allocation of OM 50.0 million, only 0P' 42.3 million were
actually disbursed to date. Disbursements of KfW funds were basically lower
due to lower than estimated costs of PVC resin and the purchase of one
mobile factory instead of the two factories initially planned.
Actual Costs Versus Appraisal Estimate
3.27     The project costs mentioned in this chapter and shown in Annexes 11
and 12 are based on Information provided by EPAPO's administration 'and
finance department and from World Bank disbursement recoras. As mentioned in
para. 3.24, EPAPO's project accounts do not make it possible to distinguish
local expenditure by sub-component. Furthermore, no systematic compilation
of foreign exchange costs is made according to sub-component (i.e. field
drainage, open drain remodellUfng etc.) EPAPD also has difficulties in
separating costs of overlapping projects (i.e. Upper Egypt I and II and
Delta Drainage I and II). Thus, cost analysis in this report will remain
jprrr *llatr.



- 128 -
3.28     Total project expenditure  till  July  1986  amounted  to  LE 170.4
million. This corresponds to a cost overrun of 23% in terms of Egyptian
Pounds relatively low, given the important delays in project execution and
slightly higher inflation than anticipated during the Implementation period.
Total project in US dollars amounted to 178.1 million including KfW
disbursements of DO 42.3 million. They are shown in Annex 11. More detailed
costs by year are given in Annex 12. Since the final project local currency
disbursements are not expected to be effected until pumping stations are
completed in June 1989, the total project expenditures will not be available
before late 1989. However, a re-estimate was made by the mission of the full
project costs which are presently estimated at LE 187.5 million (36% above
the appraisal estimate). To date project costs in US dollar terms 1/ are
only about 86% of appraisal estimates despite the fact that most project
components have been completed. Adding expenditure for the pumping stations
completed total priject costs are expected to reach about USS 192.2 million
which is only 93% of appraizal estimate in US dollar terms. The main reasons
for such considerable reduction in costs, besides the revaluation of the US
dollar during the project period, " e:
i) the relatively low local contract prices of the Egyptian Public
Companies selected in October 1980 and the inadequate adjustments
(price escalation) for local inflation (several public companies
have been facing losses in installation of field drainage);
ii) the lower than estimated costs of drainage equipment in US dollar
terms due to fierce international competition;
iii) the  lower  than  expected  foreign  exchange  cost  of  PVC  pipes
factories and PVC resin.
3.29     The lower overall project cost is reflected in  the  comparison  of
the  average local cost of drainage works per feddan of the actual completed
area  under  the  project  with  that  estimated  at  appraisal.  The  total
expenditures  as  of  July  1986,  for  local  cost  of field drainage works
covering about 391,000 feddans was LE 46.1 million i.e. LE 117  per  feddan.
The total expenditures for local costs of open drainage covering some
810,000 feddans was LE 17.6 million i.e. LE 25 per feddan. Thus the actual
local cost of construction of the drainage facilities was about LE 142 per
feddan, which includes also crop compensation and land lost as a result of
the project works. Foreign exchange cost amounted to LE 61.9 million or
IE 120 per feddan. Thus, the total estimated cost per f-eddan for drainage
was LE 262 or US$ 271. Compared with USS 156 per feddan at appraisal, the
total cost for field drainage at USS 197 per feddan was about 26% higher in
US dollar terms (see also Annex 13 for detailed costs of field drainage).

Ue of Consultants
3.30     The  appraisal report identified the need for consultants to advise
and assist local engineers in using PVC pipes for field drainage and for
training of local staff in the new techniques involved. No funds were
provided under the Nile Delta II project for consultant services, as 15 man-
years of consultancy were included already in Upper Egypt I drainage project
(effective till 1981), but only a fraction of the agreed number of
consultancy years had been used at the time of project appraisal.
3.31     There was further the availability of Dutch bilateral grants at the
time of appraisal which, however, supplied most of their expertise to the
Drainage   Research  Institute  and  through  the  bi-annual  Dutch-Egyptian
Drainage Panel meetings.
3.32     It is unfortunate that again under this project the opportunity for
foreign advice, training expertise and assistance in supervision of drainage
installation by local contractors, was lost. No doubt that the absence of
foreign assistance was felt in the selection process of pricrity areas in
EPAPO's field investigation and design office, in'the quality of PVC pipe
production, and in the quality of field drainage installation. The Dutch
aid, except the installation of drainage in 40,000 feddans in the Delta for
the interventions by RYP staff in planning, training and monitoring of
drainage installation, however excellent, has had mostly an lndirect impact
by means of investigations reporting and recommendations carried out in DRI
and submitted to EPAPO. The Drainage Authority on many occasions has been
reluctant in adopting, on a large scale, DRI or panel recommendations.
Training
3.33     Provision  was  made  at  appraisal  for  training of engineers and
.technicians of EPAOP in field drainage practices and of operators and
mechanics in the proper operation and maintenance of equipment. A training
programme for agricultural staff employed by EPADP was conducted between
July and October 1978. The total number of people trained was 250 divided
Into five groups. The courses included design, execution and maintenance of
drainage works, the irrigation and drainage law and field visits. Similar
training programs for about 140 Agricultural Extension district managers and
400 village agents of the Ministry of Agriculture were conducted in all the
Governorates of Nile Delta and Upper Egypt. Other training activities in
EPADP included on-the-job training of design engineers and field supervisors
and the training of new accountants for the Cost Accounting Unit. The
objective of these training courses was the familiarization of the staff
employed by EPADP in the drainage activities. But the training period was
too short and the success was limited. More effective was the overseas
training of EPADP's mechanical engineers in the operation and maintenance of
equipment, provided by the suppliers.
3.34     An  agreement  was  signed  in  1983  between  EPAOP  and the Dutch
Government for training and technical assistance by the Lake Yssel Polders
Oevelopment   Authority.  The  training  programme  was  under  the  general
supervision of the Egyptian-Dutch Advisory panel. The programue, which
expired in December 1985, provided for training EPADP senior staff and
instructors in Holland, for consultants to provide training in design of
field drainage and in other specialized subjects, and also for the Dutch
experts' visits to Egypt for on-the-job training of EPADP and contractors
personnel. A total of 500 staff of various levels, such as engineers,
technicians, machine operators etc., from EPADP and from public sector
contractors have been trained under this programme. Subjects covered in the
overall program included field investigations, design, construction planning



- 130 -
and management, maintenance of completed works and machine operation and
maintenance. This training programme was very successful and there is no
doubt that it helped to improve the implementation of the drainage programme
by EPADP. At the time of the visit of the completion mission in Egypt, EPADP
was negotiating with the Dutch Government representatives for the extension
of this training programme for another two years.

IV. OPERATION PERFORMANCE
Design of Field Drainage Works
4.1      General.  The  design of the drainage systems is the responsibility
of the Field Investigation  and  Oesign  Department  of  EPADP.  The  design
capacity of this Department is about 250,000 feddans per year. Pre-design
investigations are car-ied out at gridpoints of 500 w spacing (i.e. one hole
every 60 feddans). The design album, usually prepared for a subproject of
3,000-5,000  feddans,  includes  topographical  survey,   drainage   layout,
longitudinal sections, structural designs and a list of quantities. Once the
design album is handed over to the construction department, the design
engineer has no further involvement in the construction and operation of
works he has designed. Therefore, no systematic performance feedback reaches
the design engineer from the field and no improvement in project design can
be expected. Design for field drainage in the project area started in 1980
and was completed by December 1983. Design preparation was always well ahead
of the installation of field drainage.
4.2      Laterals spacing.  Until July *983 the practice  of  EPADP  was  to
design field drainage systems by converting the computed theoretical lateral
spacing to standard spacings of 40, 50 and 60 m. The reason given by EPADP
for not following the theoretical design criteria was that the narrower
spacing would entail a higher cost and more pipe-laying  machine  hours  per
unit  area, therefore it would reduce the gross area on which field drainage
could be Installed. Supervision m'ssions have questioned the rationale of
this approach and suggested that if full benefit of field drainage were to
be obtained, adjustments in lateral spacing should be limited  to  not  more
that 20% of the computed value and generally less than 10%. The issue was
pursued with the Chairman of EPADP and the Minister of irrigation and by
mid-1983 the Chairman of EPADP agreed that new design criteria would de
applied to designs carried out after July 1, 1983; designs carried out prior
to that date have not been revised. While the new approach of EPADP was a
substantial  improvement  over  past  attitudes,  the  fact  is  that   this
improvement did not affect large areas with designs made prior to July 1983.
Bank supervision missions made special efTorts to persuade EPAOP to redesign
all the non implemented areas by using the new design criteria. The Chairman
of EPADP in his letter of May 22, 1983 held some promise for revising
designs of areas requiring lateral spacings of less than 40 m. This promise
was not kept and as a result large field drainage areas of Nile Delta
Drainage II project were implemented according to the old design criteria
i.e. with minimum lateral spacing of 40 m. Only in three areas (Zarqoon,
Upper No. 1 and Beni Abid) which were designed after July 1983, field
drainage was partially installed with lateral spacing of 30 m (in about
19,000 feddans).
4.3      Laterals  depth.  The  depth  of  laterals  agreed in the appraisal
Report was  . m at the connection of the lateral with the collector  drain.
It was considered that this depth combined with the proper lateral spacing
would have been sufficient to provide for a reduction of the water table to
at least 1 m within 48-72 hours following irrigation. But, as mentioned in
the previous paragraph, laterals were placed by EPADP not always at a
spacing determined by the physical properties of soils. A remedy of the so
caused deficiency of the drainage system would have been to increase the
depth of laterals in order to obtain the same drainage effect. But this was
not done because of technical and economic constraints, the most important



- 132 -
being that a deeper field drainage system would have required jeever open
drain collectors and deeper pumping.
4.4      Gravel  enveloPe.  The  appraisal  report  assumed  that  a  gravel
envelope will be placed around all field drains to prevent sedlmentati3n and
to acceler"te the entrance of water into the pipes. The size of gravel
recommendea was between 2 and 20 m-, It was further specified in the report
that the general application of gravel filter will be revised later in light
of the results from field tests to be carried out during the first year of
the project. However, the Egyptian-Dutch Advisory Panel for Land Drairage in
Egypt reconmnended that gravel envelope could be omitted in soils which had a
clay content greater than 40%. Therefore, contrary to the original intention
to equip all laterals with gravel filter EPADP had limited its use to
laterals with a spacing of 60 m or more. Bank consultants have continued to
advocate the use of gravel envelope around the laterals in all types of
soil. Discussions with EPADP by various Bank staff who argued against
Panel's recommendation were ineffective. The argument of EPADP's expe-:s was
that Egyptian-soil conditions are unusual in that the soil seems to be more
stable than normal arid region soil and therefore gravel filter is not
required in so:ls of a high clay content. The Completion Report mission was
informed that a recent DRI study indicated a reduced risk of sedimentation
in corrugated PVC pipes as compared with concrete pipes due to the fact that
with the PVC pipes better quality work can be achieved. Thus, DRI's
recommendation is to adopt a clay content of 30% (instead of 40%) as a limit
above which no cover material for laterals is neeced, provided that the soil
is of good structure. The issue of gravel envelope has not yet been resolved
and  results  are  awaited  for  the  completion of field investigations and
trials, carried out by the Drainage Research Institute. To date results of
these trials are inconclusive. The appraisal recort for Drainage V (May
1985) specifies that the use of gravel envelope will be limited to laterals
with a spacing of 60 m or more and for lesser drain spacing where needed due
to the presence of unstable soil at drain depth.
4.5      Manholes.  Over the years the manholes in their present form  (with
a cover above the ground) proved to be a cause of maintenance problems for
the covered drainage systems. Farmers often cut holes in the superstructure
of the manhole to dispose of excess surface water and children drop rubbish,
stones and earth. As a result the pipe collectors often are blocked through
the manholes and the covered drainage systems need frequent flushing and
maintenance. Bank missions several times recommended to EPADP to replace the
present above-the-ground type of manhole with a buried manhole which would
not be easily accessible. To date, no action was taken by EPADP to modify
the manhole design. However, during appraisal of the Drainage V project it
was agreed that the covered drainage systems will be provided with buried
manholes, except where open manholes are required.
4.6      Field  drainage  in  rice  areas.  During  the rice growing season,
water management in rice fields is different than in fields with other crops
(cotton or maize). Rice fields need to be kept submerged for most of the
time but the presence of a pipe drainage system causes continuous loss of
water and difficulties in keeping the rice fields flooded. Farmers deal with
the problem by plugging the collectors with straw, clay  etc.  in  order  to
maintain a certain water level in the fields. But if other crops are grown
in the area served by the same collector (which is the normal case) the
crops upstream of the rice fields will have no subsurface drainage at all,
so that damage due to waterlogging will result. If the practice of plugging
the collectors were to be prevented, the amount of water for the rice crop
would have been much higher. This was confirmed recently by results of an
intensive programme of measurements and monitoring by DRI staff at three



- 133 -
experimental stations in the Nile Delta 1/ . Considerable savings of water
(up to 40%) could be achieved if the modified layout is applied on a large
scale. These results explain clearly the farmers rationale in plugging the
drainage system. The conclusion is that rice and other crops should be
served by drainage units that can be operated separately and independently.
4.7      The on-going practice of crop consolidation applied by the Ministry
of Agriculture (in which summer crops are concentrated into fairly large
blocks), facilitates the implementation of a "modified layout" of drainage
system. The system consists in designing subcollectors each one serving a
block of rice or other summer crops. When rice is cultivated in one block
the subcollector serving this block is plugged by using adequate plugs,
while the subcollector serving the other summer crops is left open. With the
crop rotation, the reverse is been done in the following year. It is obvious
that   the   design   of  the  modified  layout  required  additional  field
investigations and full collaboration with the Extension Service of the
Ministry of Agriculture, while the operation of the system requires full
collaboration of the farmers. According to engineers of 3RI, the difference
in capital cost between the conventional and the modified field drainage
system is minus/plus 10%.
4.8      To date, an area of about 5,000 feddans in East  Bahr  Saft  (Dutch
project) has been provided with field drainage with the modified layout.
Another area of 5,000 feddans is under implementation in the Nashart area
with Government's own resources as a pilot area. Finally, a third area of
5,000 feddans in Beheira Governorate is in the design stage. Agreement was
reached during appraisal of the Drainage V project that where large areas of
rice are grown-'and crop consolidation maps have seen prepared by MOA, the
modified  layoyt of field drainage system will be diplied. In the completion
mission's opinion, the general application of the modified layout in rice
areas should be adopted without further delays by EPADP as it is the only
system that allows optimum water management of all summer crops. It should
be added that-due to the appropriate water management, a considerable saving
in water quantities (up to 40%) for irrigation of the rice field can be
achieved.
4.9      Conclusions.  In  summary  it  can be said that the design of field
drainage in the project area was not always adequate. It is estimated that
in about 116,000 feddans the 40 m spacing of laterals installed was wider
than the required; the depth of laterals was not increased to compensate for
the wider spacing; gravel envelope has not been applied in all laterals as
assumed in the appraisal report; above ground manholes have been installed
in all cases, in spite of the maintenance problems that this type of
manhole may cause; and finally the field drainage system applied in rice
grown areas does not allow proper water management.
Quality Control of Drainage Works
4.10     On  several  occasions Bank supervision missions have reported poor
quality of drainage works and lack of adequate supervision. Although in
recent years standards of construction have improved, due obviously to the
experience gained by EPADP and the contractors inviolved, the quality of
certain Items of work still leaves a lot to be desired.
j/  MOI-ORI Technical Report No. 48, February 1986 "Water Management in Rice
Fields under Conventional and Modified Drainage Concepts."



- 134 -
a) Quality of PVC plastic pioes. Defects have been observed in the
PVC pipes produced by the three factories. The problems relate to
the position, size, shape and consistency of slots being cut in the
p1p^. In the field it was noticed that very few defective pipes
were rejected. This means that there were cases where weak and
inefficient pipes have been installed. The Project Completion
mission noticed that the situation has improved and in general the
pipes currently used are of an acceptable standard. However, it
should  be  stressed  to  the  Chairman  of  EPAOP  that   adequate
supervision in the factories and in the field should be provided at
all times in order to avoid productinn and installation of
inadequate pipes.
b) Ali9nment and grade control of laterals. This aspect is sometimes
neglected by the supervisor engineers. The alignment and grade of
laterals in general is arran-ed by the machine drivers through
manual steering via a visual view findet; But non adequate control
is applied by the engineers. In some cases no proper instrument
(level)  was  available  at  the  stte  to  check  the   depth   of
installation and grade. In the mission's opinion more attention
should have been paid to this aspect. A good solution would have
been the automation of control by the use of laser equipment.
c) Back fillino of trenches.  Backfilling of trenchers after the pipes
are laid was not satisfactory. Trenches were filled with loose
soils, often by the farmers themselves, without any compaction. At
the first irrigation water qnters the pipes at high velocity
through the loose back-filling, carrying silt which is deposited in
the pipes and causes blockage. It is recommended that the backfill
be placed immediately after the pipe has been laid and that it
should be moderately compacted to avoid settlement.
d) Gravel enveloPe. In spite of all the Bank missions remarks and
recommendat7ons to EPADP, the quality and qL.antity of gravel used
as an envelope for the laterals was inadequate. The excuse often
given by the contractors for this Is the low price allowed for
gravel in the contract and the fact that well graded gravel is not
easily  found  in  Egypt.  Neither  of these excuses are valid. The
price of gravel was fixed by the contractors themselves during
tendering and at least one huge deposit of excellent quality gravel
was seen by the mission on the east side of tne Cairo-Alexandria
desert road, near the south Tahrir area. One supervision mission
(November 1984) suggested to the Chairman 'of EPAOP including that a
detailed study be carried out on gravel deposits in the country,
means and cost of transport and laying methods and that the
conclusions of this study be generally applied on the ongoing
drainage projects. It was also suggested that EPADP should increase
the price allowed for gravel in the old contracts. To date no
action has been taken by EPADP on these recommendations. Special:
arrangements should have been made on the pipe laying machine to
provide a complete surround of the lateral at a thickness not less
than 5 cm. The Project Completion mission recommends that special
attention should be paid by the Bank to this issue and that
continuous pressure should be exercised on EPADP for improvement of
the quality of gravel in the coming Drainage V project.
e) Manholes. It is important that each manhole be provided with a
silt trap of sufficient size by installin; the base slab at least
20 to 30 cm, below the invert of the outgoing collector. In field



- 135 -
visits it *at often found that the silt trap was much less than 20
cm. Attenticn should be paid by EPADP's supervision engineers on
this aspect in the fiture.
f) WraDDina of collectors cement pipes at the joints. Another point
that needed attention and improvement was the joint of  the  cement
pipe  collectors.  At  the joints a wrapping of bitumen impregnated
canvas was used. But in many cases the wrapping was placed only  on
the  upper  half  of the joint leaving the lower half exposed. This
may cause sedimentation inside the collector pipe. Instructions
should be issued by EPADP to all supervision engineers to insist on
a complete wrapping of the joints in all drainage projects.
Operation and Maintenance of Drainage Works
4.11     EPADP  is  responsible for the O&M of all completed drainage works,
both during the implementation period and after completion of the project.
However, during construction and for one year following completion of a
contract unit, the contractor is responsible for the maintenance of the
subsurface drains. He also is required to flush all laterals twice. The
responsibility for O&M of subsurface drains and the associated surface
drains was transferred from the Irrigation Department to the EPADP in 1979.
This helped in establishing lines of responsibility In accordance with
geographic units and in structuring and enlarging the O&M organization to
make it more effective. The EPADP's existing organizational structure for
maintaining both surface and subsurface drains is shown in Chart 2 and
Annex 14. EPAPO has generally been: complying with Section 2.01 of the
project agreement. However, the transfer of areas frnm contractors to the
Authority is slow. The Undersecretary for maintenance controls eight field
Directorates, five in the Delta and three in Upper Egypt. Under each
Directorate are a number of centers, each responsible for maintaining
drainage works in an area of about 40;000 to 50,000 feddans. Under the
centers are subcentres, each responsible for about 5,000 feddans- of
subsurface drains. At present, there are in Nile Delta 40 maintenance
centres and 183 subcentres. Channel maintenance, which is performed almost
entirely by contract, is handled by the directorates. The staff of the
centres and subcentres are mostly concerned with maintenance of subsurface
drainage which is now performed exclusively by force account.
4.12     Maintenance  of open drains in Egypt have, in the past, not been of
a satisfactory standard due mainly to extremely difficult environmental
conditions (which result in very rapid weed growth in open drains), staffing
limitations, and technical shortcomings. Whilst EPADP has, in he last few
years, improved maintenance of drains, further improvement is required. The
Bank project, Channel Maintenance Project, appraised in May 1986 1/ is
designated to provide for improved maintenance of both irrigation canaTs and
open  drains.  The  project  will  introduce  modern   channel   maintenance
practices, replacing the traditional system of excavation with a balanced
cycle of weed mowing, herbicide treatment and desilting. Maintenance of
field drains was until recently done manually. But in view of the shortage
In labour and to upkeep the efficiency of field drainage systems, flushing
machines have been purchased and used.
1/ The project is not yet effective.



- 136 -
4.13     The  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  pumping  stations,  once
constructed  and  tested,  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Electrical  and
Mechanical Department of the Ministry of Irrigation.
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)
4.14     Aqreements.  According  to  section  2.08  of  the  Upper  Egypt II
Drainage Pro ect Agreement the Authority was, within two years after the
date of loan signature or any other date agreed, to complete the evaluation
of the effect of drainage works under previous Nile Delta I and Upper Egypt
I drainage projects on crop yields and soil properties, and thereafter
continue to carry out or carry out, as the case may be.  the  evaluation  of
such drainage works and those included in Upper Eqyot II drainage Prolect.
This section was amended during negotiations of Nile Delta 11 project and
EPAPO agreed (Section 2.06 of Project Agreement) to complete tae above
mentioned study for Nile Delta I by June, 1978 and for Upper Egypt I by June
1979 and complete the evaluation of Upper Egypt II drainage project by June
1982 and of Nile Delta II by June 1984. EPAPO also agreed to furnish interim
reports on evaluation by June 1981 for Upper Egypt II drainage project and
by June 1983 for Nile Delta II drainage project and continue evaluation of
each of the four projects referred to for a period of six years from the
dates mentioned.
4.15     When it was realized during supervisions that existing  crop  yield
data, collected by cooperatives were not reliable due to the fact that they'
did not account for factors other than drainage that affect yields (cultural
practices,  inputs,  pest problems etc.) it wis agreed to initiate ,a new M&E
programme with an improved methodology. The new monitoring sXstem was
started early 1978 supported by Dutch technical assistance and carried out
mainly by DRI staff. It was devided into two distinct parts: (i) a two year
crash programme aimed at providing "rough indications on effectiveness of
drainageO and (ii) a five-year  long  range  programme.  The  programme  was
conducted .by a newly created Division of project Appraisal and Evaluation in
ORI with 20 to 25 persons headed by a Dutch consultant, resident tn Egypt
during the programme.
4.16     Consequently  section  2.08 of the Upper Egypt II project agreement
was again modified in March 1979, through another amendment, in which EPAPO
agreed to furnish by February 1979 an initial report, thereafter semi-annual
progress reports until December 1980 on its on-going crash programme for
evaluatlng the, effects of completed drainagee works, by December 1980 an
interim report and by February 1981 a final report on the findings of the
said programme. Furthermore, EPADP was to submit to the Bank an initial
report, progress reports and a final report by November 1984 on the findings
of the long-range programme for drainage evaluation.
4.17     Institutional   changes.  By   decree  415  of  1978  the  Drainage
Authority re-established also the Evaluation  Committee  of  Drainage  Works
comprising five members of EPAPO and four members' of the Ministry of
Agriculture. Monthly meetings were arranged.
4.18     In  September  1979   another   Ministerial   decree   created   an
interministerial   "Supreme"  committee  to  review  all  on-going  drainage
activities and methodology to investigate the effect of drainage on relevant
soil parameters, water balance and production covered by the programme.
However, due to inact'on of this committee which met only in June 80 for the
first time no substantial impact was made on the evaluation program. An
"Executive Committee' was founoed in 1982 to coordinate the various
programmes.



- 137 -
4.19     The   DRI  Crash  Proqramme.  The  Initial  reports  of  the  crash
programme published mid-1979 covered results of two twin villages, one  with
and without drainage, all situated in the Delta I oroJect area and indicated
substantial yield increases: berseem 18-36%, wheat 5-19% and rice over 50%.
It  was  then  concluded  that  the  major  effect of drainage was to reduce
salinity and that response can mainly be expected in salinity sensitive
crops.
4.20     The  crash  programme was expanded late 1979 to'include three pairs
of twin villages to compare with and without drainage situation. Seventy-
five observations were made for each village. Unlike the procedure followed
in the EPAOP ex-post evaluation programme, data on yields were obtained from
crop cuttings made by ORI staff. Moreover, various other data such as input
use, supply of irrigation water, and functioning of the drainage system were
collected. Oata collection and analysis were conducted by seven junior
Egyptian engineers, one senior Egyptian scientist, and one Dutch resident
expert.
4.21     Gererally  the  final results painted a moderately positive picture
but for at least three reasons they did not show a consistent trend:
- although soil salinity varied in all three sets of twin villages,
it did not present a serious constraint on growth of the five main
crops (cotton, wheat, rice, berseem, maize) in any of them;
- in two of the three drained villages, a large proportion of the
drainage system appeared to be functi'ning poorly;
- contrary  to a common belief that sufficient water is available for
all the farmers in the Delta, and that they are responsible for
high watertables by over-irrigating, it was found that in the
summer season several areas suffer from severe water shortages thus
affecting yields.
Gross value added/feddan increased or decreased compared to non-tile drained
areas for the different crops as follows:
Berseem           -  2 to + 40%
Wheat             -  7 to + 31%
Rice             - 13 to + 80%
Cotton           - 30 to + 51%
Maize             - 14 to - 21%
Yield has been reckoned the determining factor for assessment of GVA as
production costs did not differ much. The reasons for negative values could
be that there were ccher production constraints or the tile drainage system
was functioning inadequately. Potential benefits from drainage were lost
because in some cases pest control and not drainage was the limiting factor.
In the three drained villages, yields were about 30% higher in the period
1977/80 compared to a 17% increase over the, same period in the three
undrained villages. Quite apart from these three factors it should be
emphasized that the three sets of twin villages represent too small a sample
to yield more than a rough estimate.
4.22     Because  of certairn methodological controversies doubt arose on the
usefulness of crop yield response evaluation programmes in the MOI and the
Dutch Government decided to stop financial contribution for the regular
programme. The Egyptian staff was reassigned and the Dutch resident engineer
left to write his final report. DRI's evaluation work came to a halt in
1982. Following a recommendation of the Advisory panel at its 12th meeting



- 138 -
early in 1983, a Workshop on Economic Evaluation of Drainage projects was
held in Lelystad (the Netherlands) on 2 September, 1983. The participants
(including the Panel members and a representative of the World Bank) agreed
that the evaluation effort should be continued. This conclusion was endorsed
by the 13th Pane, meeting. In light of the experience gained, the renewed
effort should be carried out at a larger scale so as to enhance the
significance of the results. A detailed proposal for M&E was proposed to the
OI by the Bank and FAO/CP project during the Identification of Drainage V
Project but despite initial agreement not enacted and staff of DRI was
reassigned to other activities.
4.23     EPAPO ex-cost evaluation  Programme.  The  evaluation  division  in
EPAPO's Department of Planning and Follow-up created in 1970 produced a
series of nine reports covering large areas of Nile Delta I and Upper Egypt
i projects. Yields of four major crops were measured by the Agricultural
Economic Institute of the Ministry of Agriculture using random sampling
technique. The aim of the evaluation, contrary to to the crash programme
method, was to compare yields before and after drainage in areas with and
withoit drainage using the following formula:
O Yn     (YIn - Ylo  -  YOn - YOo)  x 100
YIo5-          YOo
wwth Ylo - Yield inside project area before drainage installation
YIn = Yield inside project area n years after drainage installation
YOo = Yield outside project area before drainage installation
YOn - Yield outside project area n years after drainage installation
DYn - percentage yield increase
Results  of  the  data  analysis carried out by EPAPO are given i-n the table
below and indicate relatively modest positive crop response five to ten
years after installation. Various reasons can be put forward to explain the
significant differences between the invariably substantial increases found
in pilot areas (tne latest being the Mashtul pilot area report, 1986) and
those from EPAPOs ex-post evaluation programme and also to explain the very
wide scatter of data from one area 1/ or sub-area to another and from season
to season. The main reasons are: maintenance problems with open drains, due
to heavy weed growth givirg rise to high watter levels in open drains,
delayed  construction  in  drainage   pumping   stations,   field   drainage
construction problems, etc. World Bank supervision missions frequently urged
EPAPO to link yield results with depth of watertable.
/ Catchment areas varied from 10,000 to 100,000 feddans and sub-areas from
1,000 to 20,000 feddans.

4.24     No  data  so far is available for the Upper Egypt II and Nile Delta
II projects nd a considerable backlog of data analyses is developing in the
uni   for  yield evaluation. Now that considerable efforts are made by EPAPO
to  strengthen  monitoring  of  soil  and  water  salinity  watertable   and
permeability factors new initiatives in the evaluation of crop response
should be taken in order to increase the credibility of the drainage
programme. The recommendations made by various WS supervision missions
should also be taken into account to improve the program. The  results  from
the Mashtul pr6ject area are again a confirmation of the importance of tile
drainage.
4.25     Other  M&E  activities.  Late  1982  a  soil  research   unit   was
established in EPAPOS's Field Investigation and Design division which, in
cooperation with the SWI of MOA and DRI would study the effect of subsurface
drainage on depth of watertable and improvement of soil salinity. Due to the
limited means of the unit results of this effort so far have been modest. In
the Mashtul pilot project area (260 feddans located in the Eastern Delta),
the DRI activities supported by Dutch technical assistance are essentially
concentrated on testing drainage techniques and economic aspects under
controlled conditions. A routine program was executed for data collection on
water   application,   groundwater  levels  and  salinity,  farm  management
practices soil salinity and alkalinity, crop yields and drainage outflows 1/
Very encouraging crop yield response results were obtained as is shown
overleaf:

Drained Lands at Mashtul Pilot Area", January 1986.

The average soil salinity before  drainage  was  2.0  to  5.0  mmhos/cm  and
decreased after drainage installation to l.0 - 2.0 mmhos/cm.
4.26     New  initiatives.  As agreed du4rng the appraisal of the Drainage V
Project (October 1984), EPAPO has strengthened its M&E  Unit.  It  has  also
recruted, through the Project Plann4ng Department of NOI, a short-term
expatriate consultant to assist in setting up the programme and training  of
personnel. The programme is now focusstigrto 1nvestigating and reporting on
the impact of drainage on depth to water table, soil salinity and on such
other aspects as may be appropriate. In addition to tne General Oirector and
his deputy, this unit at present has four civil engineers and five
agricultural engineers. In order to maintain this new momentum it is
proposed to have regular short visits by PPO financed consultants, to
backstop this new unit and to integrate also the work of the yield response
unit in this programme. The Planning and follow-up unit has also been
strengthened recently with Dutch assistance to more effectively plan,
coordinate and monitor the activities under the project, in terms of both
targets and budgets. At present, the unit has nine qualified engineers,
including the General Director and his deputy. The implementation monitoring
plan has been agreed that would include computerized data management for
consolidated reporting, identification of bottle-necks, providing-inputs to
Improved programme planning and budgeting, and for reporting to the IBRO.
4.27     Conclusions  reqardinq  Nile  Delta  Drainage II ProJect.  From the
above it Ts clear that at present virtually no  crop  yleld  response  data,
salinity or watertable measurements concerning the areas implemented with
tile drainage are available for this project since DRI has not initiated any
large scale M&E activities in Delta II areas. Further, due to the backlog of
work and under-staffing in EPAPO's crop evaluation unit It is unlikely that
results of MOA Economic Research Institute will be timely analysed. Yield
response required for economic re-evaluation of this project can therefore
only be based on the results of EPAPO's ex-post evaluation for Nile Oelta
Drainage I project, ihe results of the ORI crash-programme and some o.her
research studies.
Cost Recovern System
4.28     According  to  Article 23 of Law No. 74 of Irrigation and Drainage,
issued in 1971 the Ministry of Irrigation should prepare a statement of
expenditures of construction of the Field Drainage, Including all costs born
by the Ministry, plus 10% for the administrative expenses; then state the
cost per feddan in the area of the drainage unit. This was essentially
agreed to be applied under Section 3.05 of the Development Credit Agreement.
The farmer has to bear all the costs of constructing the field drainage,
whether he is the owner, or the tenant or the usufructuary. Both the owner
and the tenant have to bear the cost if they are using the land in farming.
The assessment mentioned should be paid either in cash or in instalments, so
that all costs should be pa1d in not more than 20 years. The money will be
collected start'ng from the year  after  execution.  Further,  according  to



- 141 -
article 23: (1) statements on values to be recovered are sent to Treasury
which has to issue a decree concerning the collection of the assessments and
its sheduled time in connection with the land tax and with the same
poriority; (ii) a list of beneficiary's share of the costs will be issued-in
an  Egyptian  Daily  and  displayed  in  the Main Office of the Agricultural
Cooperation Comm1ttee, and the Notice Board in the Markaz or Police Station;
(iii) farmers may object within a period of 30 days whereafter expenditures
become final; (iv) the Estate Tax Oepartment (ETD-MOF) Is responsible for
collection of the assessments according to lists prepared by the Egyptian
Public Authority of Survey Services (.PASS) and Expropriation; (v) lists are
thoroughly reviewed and corrected through the issuing of decrees.
4.29     System  changes.  Prior  to  1981  costs were recovered through the
internal revenue tax collectors. The Council of Ministers decided in April
1981, and order No. 62 was issued in 1981 by the Minister of Agriculture, to
charge tile drainage costs through the Main Bank for Development and Credit
through   its   village  branches  and  deduct  charge  from  proceeds  from
cooperatively marketed crops. The latter system never fonctioned fully in
practice for many reasons, the two most important being: (i) the objection
from the Central Agency for Auditing to the collection of charges by the
village banks and (ii) the decision that village banks should not be
involved in marketing of basic crops. In November 1983 it was decided to
return the collection operation to the ETO. This was confirmed in Irrigation
and Drainage Law No. 12 issued in 1984. Executive o-ders issued in October
1984 restituted the 3% incentives to collect the charges amongst government
agencies as follows: 0.5% to EPAPD, 1.0% for the EPASS and 1.5% for the ETD.
4.30     Results.  The  changes  of  collection  system  during   the   main
implementation  period  of  both  Upper  Egypt II and Wile Delta II Drainage
projects has seriously affected the start of cost recovery operations for
both projects in these areas. During the 1983/84 financial year only LE 0.05
millioti was recovered for the four World Bank financed proJects. The
situation markedly improved during 1984/85 and 1985/86 with recoveries
respectively of LE 0.26 million and LE 1.27 million. Still, the latter
amount recovered was only 18% of the amouots due. EPAPO was not able to
provide records of cost recovery by  project  w.iich  make  a  more  detailed
analysis difficult. As part of the new monioring and evaluation effort
started under the Drainage V Project  it  is  recummended  that  EPAPO  keep
systematic  records  of  cost recovery by project and area and that these be
'shown in the quarterly reports to the Bank. EPAPO  should  also  assess  the
total arrears (which by now are considerable) by project. Annex 18 gives a
total assessment of costs to  be  recovered  and  actual  recoveries  during
1980/81 to 1985/86.
4.31     Study of the ability of beneficiaries to nay-off investment and O&M
costs. According to side Letter No. 3 to the Project Agreement of Upper
Egypt II project EPAPD agreed to undertake within a year a study of (i) the
possibilities and ways of recovering capital and O&M costs of field drainage
works, (ii) to adjust these charges periodically and (iii) the ability of
farmers to pay the said charges. During appraisal of Nile Delta Drainage II
project it was agreed (Section 2.07 of the project agreement): (i) to
promptly complete the study for Upper Egypt Drainage II project and expand
its scope to include beneficiaries of Nile Delta Drainage II project, and
(0i) to furnish the bank a report of the study before June 30, 1978 or any
other date agreed between GOE and the Bank. A first incomplete study was
presented to the Bank in August 1980. Through successive amendments to the
Project Agreements the date of completion of the report was postponed till
June 1981. EPAPO agreed to providi the bank with a more substantive study to
be prepared by them in collaboratioon with the Agricultural Economic
Institute of MOA. This report was made available to the Bank in draft late
1984.

Achievements of the Bilharzia Control Programme 1/
4.32     Very substantial progress has been made in reducing prevalence-rate
of infection and controlling disease in the Middle and Upper Egypt. It has
been demonstrated over a large area inhabited by some 10.2 million people in
1984 that control by integrated measures of area wide mollusciciding and
selective mass chemotherapy can be delivered and maintained over a time-span
of up to 8 years. The baseline information in 1980, first year of the
control operations, shows a prevalence of about 23.3% in Upper Egypt. This
has been reduced to about 13.7% in the year 1983 and 11.0% by the end of
1985. The reduction in prevalence has been accompanied by a large  reduction
in Intensity of infection to low levels, consistent with the presence of low
worm burdens. However, transmission still continues in the project area and
significant  reinfections,  particularly   among  schoolchildren  have  been
taking place. Thus, continuation of the control measures through the
maintenance phase of the programme is necessary. The cost of the Bilharzia
programme Is surprisingly low. The average annual cost per person for the
intensive and consolidation phases of the programme was about LE 0.64. The
Bilharzia control cost in 1984 was just over 8% of the budgeted per capita
cost of all Government health services. Annex 15 shows the foreign cost for
the  procurement  of  equipment  and  materials  and  Annex  16  the   local
expenditures.

Bilharzia Control Prcgramme in Egypt in Annex 19.

V. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
EgYPtian Public Authority for Drainage Projects
5.1      Present  orqanization  structure.  In  late  1972  the  Nile  Delta
Drainage Authority and the organization responsible for drainage in Upper
Egypt were merged. Accordingly, the Egyptian Public Authority for Drainage
Projects (EPADP) was established by a presidential decree issued in February
1973 with responsibility for executing all drainage works in Egypt. EPADP is
empowered  to  carry  out  all  field  investigations,   planning,   design,
evaluation, procurement, construction, budgeting and operation of projects
accounts. The present organization structure of EPAOP is shown in Chart 2.
5.2      During the course of the  project  various  changes  were  made  to
EP40P's organization. The two posts of Vice-Chairman were merged but six
departments were created, during the period from 1978 to 1980, each headed
by an under-secretary. The mechanical and electrical division was upgraded
to a department and a maintenance department was created. This former is now
responsible for supervising the installation of (new) pumping stations,
transmission lines, maintenance workshops and mechanical equipment. Under
previous WB drainage projects, operation and maintenance of completed
drainage systems (open and buried) remained the responsibility of the
irrigation departments of the MOI. In 1979, in order to improve the
allocation of funds, supply of equipment and the organization of O&M, GOE
rightly  transferred  responsibility  for the O&M of surface and sub-surface
drains in tiled areas to EPADP. So far, EPADP is responsible for 2.0 million
feddans of tile drainage, the responsibility of the balance of the tile
drained area still lying with the contractors (about 1.0 million feddans).
The total maintenance budget for 1983/84 was LE 8.0 mi'lion of which LE 6.0
million was used for open drain maintenance by tile four MOI Public
Excavation Companies. EPADP now has one under-secretery for planning and
follow-up, and two under-secretaries for project implementation, one for the
Delta and one for Upper Egypt. The latter are responsible for surveys and
design for channel remodelling and construction of both open drains and
field drainage (supervision of construction). The Delta is divided into five
directorates i.e. North-East and South-East Oelta, North-Middle and South-
Middle Delta and West Delta. In charge of procurement is the Administration
and Finance Department of EPADP. An ad hoc committee comprising the
Chairman, Vice-Chairman and head of the Technical Office of EPADP approve
specifications prepared by the design office. It also evaluates bids and
makes recommendations for contract awards.
5.3      EPADP  presently employs at its Cairo Headquarters and directorates
about 3,600 permanent staff, of which 266 civil engineers, 101 mechanical
and 105 agricultural engineers. Casual labourers (mainly in the Delta and
Upper Egypt) number about 2,500 and work particularly in the field of drain
maintenance.   For   design  and  supervisicn  of  construction,  EPADP  has
strengthened the division and had in 1HUB 592 employees in four directorates
in the Delta and 1,412 in seven di-ectorates in Upper Egypt. The number of
permanent mechanics and labourers used for construction is on average three
times higher in Upper Egypt than in the Delta, but the number of engineers
is practically the same. For maintenance of existing drainage systems the
Authority  employs  975 staff_of which 646 are working in the Delta and 284
in Upper Egypt.             -



- 144 -
5.4      Performance  of  EPADP.  While  the  Authority  suffered during the
initial stages of the project from an inadequate organizational set-up and
frequent changes in leadership, many positive ,teps have been taKen and
stability and  continuity  in  senior  positAons  since  1981  have  led  to
noticeable qualitative and quantitative improvements. The relations with
other governmental organizations involved in drainage (DRI, EALIP, MOA) have
Improved and the bi-annual meetings of tbe Outch/Egyptian drainage panel are
a convenient forum for dialogue, exchange of technical information and
innovations.
5.5      EPADP  has  been  suffering  during  the course of the project from
shortages of engineers and frequent changes in staff due to the low wage
structure in EPAOP in particular, and the MOI in general, and this despite
the special allowances paid to EPADP staff since 1977 on request from the
Bank. Shortages in civil engineers were particularly felt in the areas of
design, construction planning and control and reporting.
5.6      With the support of Dutch bilateral assistance, various  groups  of
senior engineers in EPADP and the contractors were trained in construction
management, quality control, and operation and maintenance of drainage
machinery by the Lake Yssel Polders nevelopment Authority in Holland. On-
the-job training for junior engineors was also successfully organised by the
same organisation (see para. 3.34).
Contractors for Field Drainage and Open Drain Remodelling
5.7      Actual  installation  of 300,000 feddans tile drainage in the Delta
was contracted in October 1980 to four construction companies, all public-
owned (General Company for Land Reclamation, El-Nasr Co., El-Abd Co., El
Arabia Co.). Four other Companies of which two private obtained field
drainage installation contracts. Several public companies were attached to
the General Authority for Land Reclamation, since recently integrated in the
Ministry of Agriculture. The public companies often use small private
enterprises as sub-contractors. Open drain remodelling was mainly executed.
by four MOI public excavation companies. A detailed analysis of performance
of contractors involved in Upper Egypt II-and Delta II Projects is given in
the preparation report of Drainage V Project prepared by FAO/CP. Likewise,
an analysis performance of the four MOI companies in open drain maintenance
and remodelling is available In the channel maintenance preparation report
also prepared by FAO/CP. Both reports contain a series of recommendations
for   improvement   of   contractor  performance,  spare  parts  management,
maintenance and repairs which could result in a 10% reduction of down-time,
an increase of 18% of productive days per year and an increase of daily
productivity by 10%. Realistic tender prices (price of field drainage
installation  per feddan) were urged to enable contractors tc, nay sufficient
labour wages to overcome down-time caused by lebour shortage.
Ministry of Health
5.8      The Bilharzia programme is carried out through four  administration
levels (i) Ministry of Health - Department of Endemic diseases with the
overall responsibility for the execution of the programme; (ii) the health
directorate of the governorate where the director of Endemic diseases is the
Executive Director in charge of the Bilharzia control activities; (III) the
district manager who Is responsible for the activities within the district;
and (iv) the Rural Health Units (RHU). The workload  of  all   concerned  is
considerable and on each level only a percentage of the total work time is
being spent on Bi-harzia control.



- 145 -
5.9      This  management  system  proved  to  be  appropriate. Procurement,
logistics,  storage  and  distribution  of  drugs  and  molluscicides   were
undertaken efficiently, although some delays had occurred. The transport
system faced minor problems. Personnel management was adequate, and most
positions were filled. The organizational structure was geared to execute
area-wide  mollusciciding,  and  snail   and   human   prevalence   surveys.
Chenotherapy was handled through the RHU. Currently the emphasis is more on
chemotherapy and less on mollusciciding. These changes of strategy will need
adjustment on the management structure.

VI. BENEFITS ANO ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
A. Assumptions of SAR and PCR
6.1      At  project  appraisal  (SAR)  three types of project benefits were
identified:
a) Prevention of 30% yield decline over 35 years and increases in
yields In the area of 400,000 feddans installed with field
drainage. Only for the main crops (cotton, rice, maize, wheat)
covering 55% of the cropped area were yield declines and increases
taken into account;
b) prevention of 30% yield decline for the main crops over 35 years in
600,000 feddans where only open drains are remodelled and pumping
stations installed;
c) increases in yields for the main crops in land strips along the
remodelled open drains (30,000 feddans).
In this Project Completi'on Report (PCR) the following slightly different and
more conservative assumptions were adopted:
a) reduction in costs of open-drain maintenance as a result of open-
drain remodelling on 810,000 feddans;
b) prevention of 10% yield decline (5% on rice) over 35 years and more
modest yields increases in.the area of 400,000 feddans installed
for field drainage. Contrary to  SAR  assumptions  all  crops  were
considered.
c) prevention of 10% yield decline (5% for rice) over 35 years in
600,000 feddans where open drains are remodelled and pumping
stations installed.
B. Re-estimated ProJect Benefits
6.2      Savinqs  in  drain  maintenance due to open driin remodellina.  The
remodelling of open drains on 810,000 feddans is a pre-requisite for a well
functioning field drainage system but has also non-negligible indirect
benefits which a-e easily overlooked. While widening and deepening existing
drains,  often  cne.3d  with weeds because of the drain maintenance backlog,
drains  are  automatically  deweeded  and  maintained,  which  represent   a
considerable saving in economic terms on the MOI maintenance budget. The
average cost per feddan for drain maintenance was LE 2,200/km in 1984-85.
Hence at 1984-85 unit costs the saving in drain maintenance on 1,565 km of
open and branch drains was LE 3.4 million. Direct benefits from the 346 km
of new open drains and remodelling of the existing open drains are difficult
to quantify but are considered in conjunction with those of field drainage
system. Besides the evacuation of field drainage discharges deeper open
drains also facilitate direct drainage in a strip of land on both sides of
the drain accordinq to soil permeability parameters.



- 147 -
6.3      Estimated  crop  Yield  benefits  from the field drainage system on
400,000 feddans. Relief of the drainage constraint is essential if fa
progressive decline in yields is to be arrested and significant increases in
agricultural production are to be achieved in the future. However, the
direct  impact  on  which  project benefits are calculated has been assessed
only on the basis of the limited changes in yield which are expected without
any change in agricultural practices.
6.4      During  project  appraisal  it was assumed that without the project
productior  would  gradually  decline  due  to  increased  waterlogging  and
salinity  by  30%  over  a  35 year project period. With the project, yields
would rise from existing levels by 12%  to  25%  (see  table  below).  Three
general considerations lead to more caution on the effect of drainage in
Nile Delta II Project areas:
i) the results of EPAPO ex-post evaluation and ORI crash programme of
Nile Delta I Project shown in para. 4.23;
ii) the unavailability at present of crop yield response data for Nile
Delta Drainage II project areas;
iii) part of the field drainage system is not fully operational due to
certain design (wide spacing) construction or maintenance problems
(blocked collectors) not yet resolved.
Considering the above, yield declines without improved open and field
drainage systems are now conservatively estimated to be on average about 10%
(5% for rice) over the said 35 year period and incremental yields with
drainage ranging from 5% to 15%. Increases of yields are now assumed to
build up over a five year period, while at appraisal it was as follows: 40%
in the first year, 30% In the second and 30% in the third year. This
conservative assumption is shown below:

6.5      ProJect  economic rate of return.  The re-estimation of the rate of
return of the drainage component provides interesting insights concerning
the value of the drainage programme though care should be taken In its
interpretation given uncertainties on crop yield response and local project
costs. Local project costs have been converted to constant 1986 economic
values using the deflators published by WB j/ to give a total cost in LE of
233.7 million, including costs for 9.000 feddins still to be equipped with
field drainage (see Annex 17, table 2). Local costs were increased with an
average accounting factor of 1.7 (see Annex 17, table 3) to reflect
subsidies in energy, cement and other cost items. Calculated over a 30 year
project life the basic ERR is now estimated at 23.6%. The appraisal estimate
was 23.0%. Thq effect of lower and delayed project benefits were generally
offset by lower and delayed project costs, hence the almost identical ERR.
6.6      Switching  values  have  been  estimated (see Annex 17, table 4) to
indicate that the minimum net benefits that would result in a minimum
acceptable ERR of 12% would be 41% below those given in para. 6.3. It is
however likely that benefits will exceed those assumed and a sensitivity
analysis In Annex 17, table 5 indicates that with increases in yields of 20%
and 50% the ERR increases to 30% and 42% respectively. In conclusion, it
would seem that despite the administrative, management and construction
problems associated with this project it has still been a worthwhile
investment for the nation. It is recommended that during the course of the
fifth  drainage  project,  EPAPD  continues  and  intensifies  its   ex-post
evaluation programme and collects technical soil and water parameters which
could improve the present data base and reveal likely a better crop response
than now assumed. It should be emphasised that the project benefits assumed
above are only valid if the drainage network is kept continuously in good
working condition. This is subject to a dependable maintenance service by
EPAPD.

VII. BANK PERFORMANCE
7.1      The  frequency  of  field visits was adequate, but the average time
spent on each mission only 7 days. Supervision of the project by the Bank
was generally timely and satisfactory. The supervision missions were
instrumental in drawing attention to potential problems and in assisting the
Government in finding appropriate solutions. In spite of some contentious
subjects (use of consultants, design issues, monitoring and evaluation,
etc.), the Bank staff succeeded in maintaining a continued good relationship
with the Egyptian officials. The flexible position taken by the Bank in
various aspects, during the project implementation, proved to be correct and
beneficial for the project.
7.2      In evaluating Bank's performance, it is now obvious that  too  much
confidence was placed on the managerial capabilities of EPAOP and on the
capacity of the public sector contractors. The proof for this are the long
delays  in  implementing  the project. Efforts made during the course of the
project for accelerating the drainage programme have been unsuccessful.
Equally unsuccessful were the efforts made by the Bank to improve certain
aspects of quality control, to carry out adequate monitoring and evaluation
of drainage works, to establish a good cooperation between Extension Service
and EPADP, and to improve cost recovery. This completion report provides a
good opportunity for the Bank. to consider, first, whether remedial actions
should be taken in the future for compliance to Bank's recommendations, and
second what kind of action should be taken in future projects. However,
there are cases where Bank supervision missions succeeded in making
improvements. These cases are the introduction by EPAOP of new design
principles for field drainage, the better organization of maintenance
service for drainage works, the improvement in quality of PVC pipes produced
in Egypt, etc.
7.3      There can be no doubt that  the  Bank  made  the  right  choice  in
selecting drainage for its priority lending activity in the agricultural
sector. Investment in drainage is a sound long-term investment and a
necessary condition for attaining high levels of agricultural production.
7.4      As  far  as  the  Bllharzia  Control  Programme  is concerned, Bank
supervision missions have been valuable in stimulating the necessary
organization   of   control   inputs,   data   collection   and  evaluation.
Consideration should, however, be given to greater direct involvement of
Bank staff for supervision in any future programme of this kind and scale-,
since the main supervision effort was carried out by a consultant in
tropical diseases, and little specialist support was provided by the
Population. Health and Nutrition Oepartment.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
Project Justification and ObJectives
8.1      rhere is no doubt that investment to remove the drainage constraint
in large areas of the Nile Celta was both timely and necessary to allow
additional investments in development of the sector. On the whole. the
project is making a valuable contribution towards arresting waterlogging and
salinization and towards increased agricultural production. Althouyh two out
of five pumping stations have not yet been installed, all other components
have been implemented including a highly successful Bilharzia control
component. Farmers wl'l be assured that their agricultural land will  remain
highly productive and further yield increases from advanced technological
packages can now be more safely promoted.
8.2      In terms of economic re-evaluation, the  project  appears  to  have
performed   as   estimated  at  appraisal,  despite  the  more  conservative
estimation of project benefits because of the absence of sufficiently
convincing crop response data from the project area. This is due to project
costs which are lower than those estimated at appraisal. The ERR of 23% is
largely sufficient to justify the project investments.
Project Content and Scheduling
8.3      The  grneral concept of the project was sound and relatively simple
and its implementation took advantage of the  experience  gained  from  both
drainage installation and bilharzia control under the previous projects..
However, experience showed again that the estimation of time required to.
execute such a large drainage programme was overly optimistic. In fact more
than double time will be required to complete the project than that planned
at  apraisal. The insufficient preparation of the project and inadequacy of
technical data to substantiate the selection and delineation of priority
project   drainage  basins  led  subsequently  to  frequent  changes  during
execution. The introduction of a new drainage pipe material, a major
innovation in Egypt was delayed for almost 3 years and this was the major
cause for late project completion. Subsequently EPAPO reached an average
rate   of  implementation  of  70  to  90,000  feddans  annually  which  was
substantially Delow the original target of 140,000 feddans.
Lessons Learned
8.4      ProJect greparation  and  desiqns.  The  absence  of  a  reasonably
complete  feasibility  study  (prepared  with participation of international
drainage specialists) and field investigations (reconnaissance or semi-
detailed level) led to frequent. changes in priorities of selected areas
dpring  proJect  implementation.  What   was   required   was   that   field
investigations at a reconnaissance level be carried out in order to
determine the areas where field drainage should be installed as a priority.
To this effect for future projects clear technical selection criteria should
be adopted as a guide in this process.
8.5      Schelulinq of execution.  Not enough consideration has  been  given
to   scheaGTing  of  execution,  resulting  in  delayed  benefits.  This  is
particularly true in three drainage basins where the field drainage system
is unable to function due to the absence of new pumping stations. During the
Drainage V projects care should be taken that no contracts are awarded for



- 151 -
field drainage installation without reasonable assurance on the condition of
the pumping station of the corresponding drainage basin.
8.6      Technological   changes.  The   project   proved   that   a   major
technological change i.e. the shift from concrete tiles to locallj produced
PVC pipes with mobile factories was feasible on a large scale and the
drainage systems built with plastic pipes proved to be safer and more
efficient.  After  initial   problems   with   contract   negotiations   and
installation of equipment, production of PVC pipes in terms of quantity was
adequate. Some quality problems (mainly pipe  perforations)  have  generally
been  overcome and the three production units will also supply pipe required
for  the  areas  included  in  the  Drainage  V  Project.  Other  successful
technological  change was the introduction of collector pipe laying machines
by which most of the collectors were Installed.
8.7      Construction  delays.  Contractors  did  not  perform  as  well  as
expected and contract completion took much longer than anticipated. There is
clearly a need to strengthen the local construction industry and Government
should envisage the participation of the private sector companies. One of
the reasons for the inadequate performance was the iunappropriately low unit
price quotations of Public Companies during tendering and subsequently the
Insufficient adjustments for price inflation. In future, Public Companies
should be urged to propose more realistic unit prices for contracts in order
to  avoid  financial  problems  and   ultimately   delays   during   project
implementation.   Managerial   problems  (platining  of  work,  down-time  of
machinery, spare parts, etc.) are another cause of slow performance
frequently noticed during WB supervisions and which can be remedied with
management training and support.
8.8      Technical improvements.  The  Drainage  Authority  has  often  been
conservative fn adopting technical innovations proposed by DRI, Bank
missions and/or the Dutch Egyptian drainage panel. Lateral drain spacing was
the major change adopted during the project and this certainly was
beneficial, but many other changes proposed (drain pipe envelopes, joints,
manholes, etc.) have still not been implemented. EPAPO engineers are
qualified and have the capabilities to try out improvement quickly on large
areas and should be further encouraged to do so.
8.9      Modified layout in areas cultivated with rice.  The area cultivated
with rice in sumer (106,000 feddans) covered about 27% of the total area
installed with field drainage. Only in a minimal part the modified layout
was used and consequently farmers are plugging the drainage system to
prevent water losses. In future projects. given the emerging general
scarcity of Egyptian water resources, and taking into account recent
research results the modified rice layout should be mandatory. For rice,
crop  consolidation  should  also  be  continued  in  the   Northern   Delta
catchments.
8.10     Cost  recovery.  The  annual  recovery  of capital and O&M costs of
field drainage works has been on average below 25% of amounts due. The
recovery system is complex and the transfer of responsibility for collection
of charges from tax collectors to village banks led to insignificant amounts
recovered during 1982/83 and 1983/84. The Ministry of Irrigation has
reversed to the initial system and improved incentives for tax collection
recently and recoveries improved. But there is nevertheless need for an in
depth revision of the system, in order to increase its efficiency and cost-
effectiveness.



- 152 -
8.11     Other lessons whtch can be learned from the project are:
1) the need to have adequate maintenance not only of the field
drainage network but also of the open drainage system and to
establish timely the required infrastructure. In this respect, the
decision to give EPAPO the responsibility for  all  maintenance  of
drains in tile drained areas appears to have been appropriate;
1i) to insist on continuity in international training and technical
support  such   as   the   excellent   Dutch-Egyptian   cooperation
(preferably through grants) in order to enhance the rapid adoption
and use of technical innovations,  design.  managemen.  information
and support systems. EPAPD's senior staff is aware that scope
exists for improvement of planning the methods and has called on
assistance of the Netherlands Government to continue and expand
training  and  introduce   compouterized   planning,   design   and
management techniques;
1ii) field allowances and houses paid to EPAPO staff were generally
insufficient to attract a sufficient number of young engineers and
to motivate existing staff;
iv) to   further   develop   pilot  areas  with  vertical  drainage  in
collaboration  with  the  Groundwater  Research  Institute  as   an
alternative/complement  to  subsurface drainage in certain areas of
the Nile Valley and in view of reusing drainage water to supplement
irrigation with Nile water;
v) to  encourage  EPAPO  to  participate  in integrated soil and water
management  pilot  areas  and  drainage   re-use   and   irrigation
improvemeht projects.

1.9.1.4 The choice of screening techniques to be adopted au the balance
to be achieved in costrol betveen education, chemotherapy and
inllusciciding.
I1.9.1  Surveillance Procedures
The team rocomn.ds that epidemiological gsawvillwsce data be
presented by defined E4alth ult are&   rather than by
Govermorate. Although ti may seen to be a formidable task. it
ioild not in fact produce an indigestible mass of inforzation,
and it Ls essoetal if tbe necessary flexibility and peed in
applying £itensification and diversific,tion of control effort to
problem villages is to be achievd. The translation of data
trends into rapid and effective executive action desmeds that
Governorate Executive Directors of Bilhruia Control:

bllhasia program4s and any futuce extnsions df them be modified
as Collows:
1.9.3.1 Parasitological Screening Taec)niques
S9ediinetaton. centrifrugation. direct microscopy should be

faecal screeoing in the RIU's sad the necessary training program

Siagle-use staind4 Nyyrel* fllters and syrLages should be used-
for egg-output comt lug in urine, and the necessary training
procedures should be instituted.

L.9.4   Control Stratecies
The teo hba  cecowendations an tbree aspec:4 of future control-
strtegies:
1.9.4.1 The Bole of liforwationlEducation
In order to better the people's understanding of bilbALuia ad
its control. the major reconmeudactos are:
Make- use of TV and Radio broadcasts, using specially produced,
attractive and st4mulating films sad radio tapea.
Address target groups; school children, pregwaut women, farners.
Coordinate comn3nicatiom efforts vitb mollusciciding activities.
StinlLate people to have their urine examined regularly.
Mae people aware that cotplete tretment coplLance is of utocst
importance to improve their health.
l.9.A.2 Snail Coctrol
or the Middle Egypt Project in the maintenance phase, the
prcset once-a-year area-wide  ollusciciding operations ad
back-up spraying af Lnfested water courses should be stopped at
the eand of 1985. A fach more cost-effective strategy of
mollusciciding could then be implemmted in 1986. Ths strategy
entails initial area wide allusciaciding in only the few
rem ining area  whbee there are higb and homogeneous huro
prevalence rates (selective area mollusciciding), *ad also
solluscicidilg in indvivdual villages scattered tbhroughtu
districts with unacceptably hlgh prevalence ratei. Prevalence
rates (especially among school children)  rather thn snail data
sbould be the main initial criterlou of whethat to mallusciciding
a village or groups of villages. Second, the whole
sollusciciding program should slowly e*olve towards focal control
as fewer and fewer 1illages need radius control. Any future
focal molluaciciding should cocentrate in village foci thee.
infected snails are found in or near water contact points.
In the Upper Egypt project, the present timing of the area-wide
mollusciciding operations need to be modified.  tins d of the
first application scheduled to begin La May, it should be moved
forward to early April as was one in previou yeacrs (to prevent
th  first peak of trarJ Udsdou).  lnstead of the secon
apptication to begin Ln Septa ber, it should be tiend to begin La
early August (to prce.nt the second peak of transmission). by
1967 when the maintenance pbase begin., all future mollusciciding
shoulA be drastically reduced, a4 the future strategy sboud
then follow the racomandatios gives a        for the. iddle Eypt.
