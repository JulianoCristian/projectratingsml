development objective of the\n            Anatolia Watershed Rehabilitation Project for Turkey is to\n            support sustainable natural resource management practices in\n            28 micro-catchments in Anatolia and Turkey's Black Sea\n            Region and thereby raise incomes of  communities affected by\n            resource degradation. The proposed project will build and\n            expand on a community-based approach to natural resource\n            management. The project has five components.   Component 1:\n            Rehabilitation of degraded natural resources The\n            component's primary objective is to protect degraded\n            areas from further degradation, erosion and pollution.\n            Rehabilitation interventions are focused around four\n            sub-components 1) The main sub-components are as follows: 1)\n            Rehabilitation of forest land including soil conservation by\n            afforestation, protection and improvement of  poor &\n            degraded soils, gallery plantation, rehabilitation of  oak\n            coppices and of  degraded high forests, participatory\n            replanting and inventory of non-wood forest products; 2)\n            Rangeland rehabilitation, including improved management of\n            forest rangelands and rehabilitation activities on rangeland\n            outside the forest land; 3) Rehabilitation of agricultural\n            land, including: fallow reduction, appropriate use of\n            marginal agricultural land, wild tree grafting, river bank\n            protection, and construction and production on agricultural\n            terraces; and  4) Environment-friendly agricultural\n            practices, including demonstrations of  improved crop\n            production practices, organic farming and integrated pest\n            management and nutrient reduction activities implemented.\n            Component 2 supports Income generating activities designed\n            to provide participating communities with the incentives to\n            undertake conservation efforts.  Component 3 strengthens\n            policy and regulatory capacity towards meeting EU Standards\n            including support for the application of the EU Nitrates\n            Directive, development and promotion of a code of good\n            agricultural practices, and institutional support for\n            organic farming. Component 4 supports awareness raising in\n            micro-catchment development, capacity building and\n            replication strategy. Component 5 supports project\n            management and support services, including a fund for\n            applied research and technology dissemination."}, "docdt": "2004-05-05T00:00:00Z"}
