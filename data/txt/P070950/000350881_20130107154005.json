the Anatolia Watershed\n            Rehabilitation Project for Turkey were as follows: overall\n            outcome was satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was low or negligible, and both the Bank and the Borrower\n            performance were satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: 1. Participatory design is key to promoting\n            ownership. By actively involving target communities in the\n            identification of problems and their solutions, and vesting\n            them with the responsibility for implementing the agreed\n            investments, the project fostered ownership on the part of\n            the local beneficiaries from the very start. It demonstrated\n            that when communities are given the opportunity to be at the\n            center of the decision-making process, they feel a greater\n            sense of responsibility to make things work and succeed. 2.\n            A flexible approach allows timely adaptations to changing\n            needs and circumstances. One reason that the project\n            performed well was the built-in flexibility to allow for\n            rapid adaptations to changing needs and circumstances. 3.\n            Establishing a direct link between natural resource\n            rehabilitation and tangible economic and social benefits is\n            critical for increased uptake of natural resource management\n            activities. 4. Dissemination of information through public\n            awareness programs is crucial for the widespread adoption of\n            new practices and technologies."}, "docdt": "2012-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
