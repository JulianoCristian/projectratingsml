                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Performance in meeting the development objectives, and with respect to project implementation, has been rated Satisfactory as the majority of the key performance indicators have
                         already been achieved or exceeded end-of-project targets. Both the PDO and the GEO will be achieved by project end. At the microcatchment level, project activities are being
                         implemented as outlined in microcatchment plans, which derive from the Beneficiary Centered Problem Census Problem Solving Process (BCPCPS). Microcatchment plans are now
                         completed for all 28 microcatchments and are being implemented in a manner consistent with the overall targets set during appraisal. There are no shortcomings in implementation,
                         and the project model of interagency cooperation and community participation is being held up as a model that could be pursued at a national scale. The project will close June 30,
                         2012 and activities are underway to measure final impact and capture lessons learned. The loan and Grant will almost fully disbursed by project closing.
