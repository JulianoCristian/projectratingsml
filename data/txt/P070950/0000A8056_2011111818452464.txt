                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Performance in meeting the development objectives, and with respect to project implementation, has been rated Satisfactory as many of the key performance indicators have already
                         achieved or exceeded end-of-project targets . At the microcatchment level, project activities are being implemented as outlined in microcatchment plans, which derive from the
                         Beneficiary Centered Problem Census Problem Solving Process (BCPCPS). Microcatchment plans are now completed for all 28 microcatchments and are being implemented in a
                         manner consistent with the overall targets set during appraisal. There are no shortcomings in implementation, and the AWRP model of interagency cooperation and community
                         participation is being held up as a model that could be pursued at a national scale. With approximately 8 months remaining in the project, activities are well on track to be completed
                         by March 2012, which will permit the remaining three months before project closing to be dedicated to completion of monitoring and evaluation activities. Full disbursement is on track
                         for project closing on 30 June 2012. The mission also notes that counterpart funding for the remainder of the project implementation period is available and will not be a constraint to
                         project implementation.
