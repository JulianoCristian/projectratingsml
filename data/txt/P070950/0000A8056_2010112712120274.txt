                         Implementation Status Overview
                           The project's overall development objective is to support sustainable natural resource management practices in 28 microcatchmentsin Anatolia and Turkey's Black Sea Region, and
                         to help raise incomes in communities affected by resource degradation in poor upland catchments. The key global objective is to introduce farming practices which will reduce the
                         discharge of agricultural nutrients into surface and ground water in watersheds draining into the Black Sea in four provinces.

                         At the microcatchment level, project activities are being implemented as outlined in microcatchment plans, which derive from the participatory process called Beneficiary Centered
                         Problem Census Problem Solving Process (BCPCPS). Microcatchment plans are now completed for all 28 microcatchments and are being implemented in a manner consistent with
                         the overall targets set during appraisal. The mission identified no serious shortcomingsin implementation, which is proceeding according to agreements reached. Many specific
                         targets have already been achieved or exceeded within individual microcatchments; activities in some microcatchments have been completed and impact monitoring work has
                         commenced relating to socio-economic outcomes and attitudes towards various project activities and objectives. With approximately 18 months remaining in the project, activities are
                         well on track to be completed by December 2011, which will permit the remaining half year to be dedicated to completion of monitoring and evaluation activities. The project is already
                         starting to generate important insights regarding broader initiatives (e.g., National Watershed Management Strategy).
