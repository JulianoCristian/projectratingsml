                         Implementation Status Overview
                         At the microcatchment level, project activities are being implemented as outlined in microcatchment plans, which derive from the participatory process called Beneficiary Centered
                         Problem Census Problem Solving Process (BCPCPS). Microcatchment plans are now completed for all 28 microcatchments and are being implemented in a manner consistent with
                         the overall targets set during appraisal. The mission identified no serious shortcomingsin implementation, which is proceeding according to agreements reached. Many specific
                         targets have already been achieved or exceeded within individual microcatchments; activities in some microcatchments have been completed and impact monitoring work has
                         commenced relating to socio-economic outcomes and attitudes towards various project activities and objectives. With approximately 12 months remaining in the project, activities are
                         well on track to be completed by December 2011, which will permit the remaining half year to be dedicated to completion of monitoring and evaluation activities. The project is already
                         starting to generate important insights regarding broader initiatives (e.g., National Watershed Management Strategy).
