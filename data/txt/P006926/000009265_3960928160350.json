increase the efficiency of the sector.  Main\n            institutional measures call for scaling down the railway,\n            designing a strategy for the maintenance of cantonal roads,\n            improving port operations and encouraging increased\n            participation of the private sector. Strengthening meausures\n            consist of technical assistance and training for : a)\n            developing a transport plan; b) tariff evaluation, setting\n            and costing; c) implementing a pavement management system;\n            d) improving information management in JAPDEVA; e)\n            implementing a plan to rationalize railway services in\n            INCOFER; and f) mid-level managment training.  The physical\n            components are : 1) rehabilitation and upgrading of trunk\n            roads in the import export corridors; 2) periodic main roads\n            maintenance; 3) replacement of the Puntarenas jetty; 4)\n            equipment and tools for road maintenance and safety,\n            pavement management; 5) information systems in MOPT,\n            INCOFER, INCOP, and JAPDEVA; 6) grain handling operations in\n            the port of Calderas; 7) control of in-transit cargo; 8)\n            rail track maintenance; and 9) engineering and supervision services."}, "docdt": "1990-04-23T00:00:00Z"}
