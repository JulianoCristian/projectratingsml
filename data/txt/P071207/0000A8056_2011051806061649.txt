                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project was restructured in December 2010 to extend the Credit closing date by 12 months, to reallocate Credit proceeds among disbursement categories and to modify the
                         results framework, mostly to delete indicators not attributable to the project and reduce the targets of the road rehabilitation component. The main purpose of the extension was to
                         allow additional time to complete six civil works packages to perform periodic maintenance or rehabilitation on an additional 35.5km of roads and to construct four bridges. These
                         works will complete road sections already rehabilitated by other donors, thus enabling beneficiaries in some 30 villages to access markets and socio-economic services. Since the
                         restructuring, the implementation of these civil works packages has been advancing smoothly. About 40% of the civil works have been completed and all works should be completed
                         before the rainy season begins in July 2011, i.e., five months before the closing date. Capacity building efforts continue with training on the implementation of environmental and
                         social safeguards, road maintenance, and monitoring and evaluation. Community awareness programs also continue with workshops on road safety and HIV/AIDS awareness. Even
                         though the project will not meet its key output indicator of performing periodic maintenance and rehabilitation on 600 km, implementing these six civil works contracts will increase the
                         efficiency of the road network in the project provinces and provide access to services for poor villages.
