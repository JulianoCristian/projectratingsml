                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Some good progress has been made since the restructuring of the project in December 2010, but given the significant delays and challenges seen early in the project, the PDO will
                         not be fully achieved. In total, in the four project, the project has rehabilitated 263.4 km of Secondary National and Provincial Roads, i.e., 88% of its initial target, and 84 km of Rural
                         Roads, i.e., 29% of its initial target. Regular maintenance of the road network has increased from very low levels to more than 700 km annually. As a result, the local communities
                         living along these roads have all-weather access to the road network, with attendant benefits of enhanced connectivity to services, schools and markets.

                         To increase capacity, a total of 460 staff from the Ministry of Public Works and Transportation (MPWT) and 215 staff from the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD) have been
                         trained in areas such as policy design, planning and program management, contract management and monitoring, public involvement methods, social and environmental
                         assessment. Progress has been made but capacity remains weak in some areas. Although progress has been made in the collection of data for and operation of the road
                         maintenance management system, the system is not fully operational and road maintenance plans are still being prepared manually.

                         In terms of developing improved public policies and strategies, he project supported preparation of a draft Road Law and development of a Rural Roads Policy, both of which are
                         presently under government consideration RGC for endorsement and approval. The adoption of these two documents will provide much needed clarity to the roles and
                         responsibilities of these respective ministries for Cambodia's roads.
