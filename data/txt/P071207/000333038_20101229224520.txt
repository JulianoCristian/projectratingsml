Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The development objective is to assist the Kingdom of Cambodia to enhance the livelihood of the peoples
residing in the provinces of Kampong Thom, Oddar Meanchey, Preah Vihear and Siem Reap by providing
sustainable access to markets and essential services through (i) a program of road rehabilitation and
maintenance; (ii) a program of capacity building and training; and (iii) development of improved public
policies and strategies.

                                       RESTRUCTURING PAPER


A.     SUMMARY

1.      The principal change proposed is a 12 month extension of the Credit closing date from December 31,
2010 to December 31, 2011 to complete ongoing activities which will enhance the standard of living of local
communities in the project areas by improving road access to socioeconomic services. In addition, it is
proposed to: (a) make a related re-allocation from the unallocated category; and (b) make some changes to
the indicators.

B.     PROJECT STATUS

2.      The project was approved by the Board on September 11, 2003 with a Credit amount of SDR14.2
million. The Development Credit Agreement was declared effective on March 16, 2004 with an original
Credit closing date of September 30, 2007. SDR1.456 million was cancelled on June 5, 2006 and the current
Credit amount is SDR 12.724 million. The Credit closing date was extended twice: a two-year extension,
from September 1, 2007 to September 30, 2009 to allow the implementation of the remaining work plan. A
second extension was granted from September 30, 2009 to December 31, 2010 to complete the second
annual work program (AWP2) and capacity building activities funded under the Policy and Human
Resources Development Fund.

3.     Project implementation is complete, except for six civil works packages, for a total value of US$5.04
million. Disbursement of the credit up to November 18, 2010 is SDR 8.72 million (68.53% of the total
revised Credit amount). An acceptable Action Plan to complete these six contracts by December 31, 2011
has been discussed with the Borrower.

4.      Quarterly financial reports from the project are current and there are no outstanding audits. The
project is in compliance with all applicable Bank safeguards policies.

C.     PROPOSED CHANGES

5.     Closing Date. An extension of the Credit closing date from December 31, 2010 until December 31,
2011 will enable Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT) and Ministry of Rural Development
(MRD) to complete the six civil works packages discussed above. These six contracts will finance an
additional 35.5 km of periodic maintenance/rehabilitation and four bridges. Rehabilitating these road
sections will enable about 30 villages in the provinces of Siem Reap, Oddar Meanchey, and Preah Vihear to
have access to markets and socio-economic services and will complete those roads already rehabilitated by
other donors. Construction of the four bridges will have a significant impact on the efficiency of the road
network in these provinces. They will also keep the roads passable in the case of evacuation during disasters
such as cyclones.

6.      Reallocation of the Project Proceeds. The proposed reallocation of Credit proceeds involves the
reallocation of SDR 30,000 from the unallocated category (# 7) to the Category 5 (b) to support the
incremental operating costs under the MRD component.



                                                     6
7.      Results Framework. Some of the original outcome indicators cannot be entirely attributed to the
project. It is proposed to retain only those indicators that are directly attributable to the project: (a) transport
costs; (b) road access; (c) capacity building within the transport sector; and (d) road management. In
addition, in order to reflect the changes made to the project scope in the past, two original output indicators
are being revised: (a) the number of kilometers of secondary national and provincial roads to be rehabilitated
has been reduced from 300 km to 250 km; and (b) the number of kilometers of tertiary roads rehabilitated
has been reduced from 300 km to 80 km. The proposed revised results framework is provided in Annex 1.

                                        Extension of Closing Date

1.     The closing date for the Provincial and Rural Infrastructure Project (Credit 3822-KH) will be
extended from December 31, 2010 to December 2011.

2.     Project implementation is complete, except for six civil works packages, for a total value of US$5.04
million. Disbursement of the credit up to November 18, 2010 is SDR 8.72 million (68.53% of the total
revised Credit amount). An acceptable Action Plan to complete these six contracts by December 31, 2011
has been discussed with the Borrower.

3.      An extension of the Credit closing date from December 31, 2010 until December 31, 2011 will
enable MPWT and MRD to complete the six civil works packages discussed above. These six contracts will
finance an additional 35.5 km of periodic maintenance/rehabilitation and four bridges. Rehabilitating these
road sections will enable about 30 villages in the provinces of Siem Reap, Oddar Meanchey, and Preah
Vihear to have access to markets and socio-economic services and will complete those roads already
rehabilitated by other donors. Construction of the four bridges will have a significant impact on the
efficiency of the road network in these provinces. They will also keep the roads passable in the case of
evacuation during disasters such as cyclones.

4.      This will be the third extension of the Credit closing date. The first extension changed the closing
date from September 30, 2007 to September 30, 2009. The second extension changed the closing date from
September 30, 2009 to December 31, 2010.
