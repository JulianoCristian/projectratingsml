in\n            exploiting a sizeable offshore natural gas field in\n            collaboration with the Union Oil Group. It comprises a\n            buried pipeline system and ancillary infrastructure to\n            transport the gas from Union Oil's \"A\"\n            structure, located about 425 km south of Rayong, to an\n            onshore terminal and to distribute it to industrial\n            consumers which, in the initial years, will be chiefly the\n            South Bangkok and Bang Pakong power generating stations. In\n            addition to the consultants' services for project\n            design, engineering and management, the project includes (a)\n            training for PTT staff in natural gas operations and future\n            undertakings, (b) a gas utilization study to identify\n            significant users for gas and related investment needs, (c)\n            a refinery expansion study to determine refinery capacity\n            required and to advise on the mix and pricing of refined\n            products; (d) technical advisory services to assist PTT on\n            refinery expansion decisions and their implementation; and\n            (e) an energy audit study to assess improvements that can be\n            made to energy efficiency in industry. The project will have\n            a major impact on Thailand's energy future. It will\n            help resolve the problem of securing reliable oil supplies\n            for power generation and reduce the threat of rapid\n            increases in oil price."}, "docdt": "1979-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
