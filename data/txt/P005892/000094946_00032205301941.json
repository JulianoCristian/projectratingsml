Several lessons\n            are drawn from the project, in particular, that the\n            sustainability of village infrastructure facilities require\n            not only, the secured beneficiaries' commitment to\n            contribute to capital costs, but to finance operational, and\n            maintenance costs as well. This is reflected in the\n            successful privatization of two village facilities, which\n            initially rented these facilities, to later transfer\n            ownership to the benefiting cooperatives/societies, allowing\n            time to evaluate their own technical, financial, and\n            administrative capacity, prior to a full ownership transfer.\n            Nonetheless, the expansion of fish production, which require\n            a committed improvement in resource management, is\n            endangered by the potential of over-exploitation of fish\n            resources. This factor, if not addressed through better\n            regulatory, and management capabilities, may lead to self\n            defeat. The flexibility, and support from donor cooperation\n            was crucial in, not only guaranteeing the project survival,\n            and eventually its success, but also in responding to\n            changes in project environment, and needs, allowing quick\n            moves from project resources, to more appropriate purposes.\n            However, the reduced autonomy of the Project Unit through\n            the Ministry of Fish Wealth, hindered decision-making, thus\n            delaying completion, and full disbursement."}, "docdt": "2000-03-06T00:00:00Z"}
