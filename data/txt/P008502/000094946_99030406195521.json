project is\n            rated satisfactory. The lessons learned with the\n            implementation of the Structural Adjustment Loan essentially\n            confirm the broader international experience with economic\n            reforms. 1) Transition to a market economy is a highly\n            complex process. The experience of Kazakhstan also\n            illustrates some of the challenges involved in charting and\n            maintaining a feasible course of action, even when the\n            strategic direction is clear. This is among others, because\n            transition economies, even more than others, respond with a\n            time-lag to the application of policy instruments, the\n            length of which is hard to predict; and because for quick\n            results, one cannot overly rely on actions, which require\n            building up new institutional framework. 2) In this context,\n            consistency of purpose on the part of the authorities and\n            flexibility in execution are more important than detailed\n            planning and scheduling in determining the success of\n            transition strategies. Government commitment was certainly\n            one of the hallmarks of the operation."}, "docdt": "1997-04-22T00:00:00Z"}
