Loan Project\n            will facilitate a more rapid and effective restructuring of\n            the enterprise sector -- crucial to both macroeconomic\n            stabilization and recovery in output. The program supported\n            by this loan focuses on steps to eliminate constraints that\n            have been preventing such restructuring. Major measures are:\n            liberalizing exports, dismantling monopoly holdings,\n            facilitating entry of firms through land reform and exit of\n            firms through foreclosure and bankruptcy, accelerating\n            privatization, imposing financial discipline with isolation\n            for 20 large distressed enterprises, and strengthening\n            unemployment benefit policy to facilitate labor adjustment."}, "docdt": "1995-05-09T00:00:00Z"}
