STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT LOAN
(Loan 3900-KZ)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Structural Adjustment Loan
(SAL) to Kazakstan, for which loan 3900-KZ in the amount of US$180 million equivalent was
approved on June 8, 1995 and made effective on July 14, 1995.
The loan was closed on December 31, 1996, as originally anticipated. The first tranche,
released upon effectiveness, was fully disbursed by August 7, 1995; the second tranche was released
on March 20, 1996 and was fully disbursed by April 5, 1996. Cofinancing for the SAL was provided
by the Export-Import Bank of Japan.
The ICR was prepared by Bernard Funck, EC3C1 and reviewed by Kadir T. Yurukoglu,
Chief, EC3C1, and Pervaiz Rashid, Financial Adviser, EC3DR. The ICR is based on material in the
project file. The borrower contributed to preparation of the ICR by preparing its own evaluation of
the project's execution and initial preparation and commenting on the draft ICR.

STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT LOAN
(Loan 3900-KZ)
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
1.    The Structural Adjustment Loan to Kazakstan (SAL-FY95) was the second in a series of
policy-based operations to support the country in its transition to a market economy, a series which
began with the Rehabilitation Loan (FY94). The Loan built upon the findings and recommendations of
a country economic memorandum entitled "Kazakstan: Economic Report" (July 1994). Its
implementation was supported by two FY95 project loans: the Finance and Enterprise Development
Loan and Social Protection Loan. After the SAL, further reform progress was supported by a
Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (FY96) currently being implemented.
Project Objectives
2.     Within the government's overall program to accelerate market reforms and tighten financial
policies, the Structural Adjustment Loan focused on facilitating a more rapid and effective
restructuring of the enterprise sector, which was perceived as a key constraint both in macroeconomic
stabilization and recovery in output. The objective of the Loan was to achieve decisive progress for
enterprise restructuring in three areas: (i) market development; (ii) strengthening the two main agents
of enterprise restructuring, the private and financial sectors; and (iii) strengthening social protection.
These steps toward microeconomic reform were designed to contain enterprise borrowing, thereby
supporting tighter monetary policy. They were also expected to lower the demand for key tradables,
thereby helping to stabilize the external account and the exchange rate.
Implementation Experience and Results
3.    Substantial progress was accomplished in 1995-96 toward achieving the ultimate,
macroeconomic objectives of the SAL program. While on the domestic side, macroeconomic
performance has, by and large, been in line with program expectations, the speed of the external
adjustment has been more of a surprise. Inflation steadily declined to 28 percent annually by the end
of 1996. And after a further drop in 1995, GDP started growing again in 1996. Driven by a surge in
exports, the current account deficit, which had been anticipated to expand, shrank instead. Thanks
also to unexpectedly large inflow of foreign direct investment, the country was able to build higher
foreign reserves than originally anticipated (over 17 weeks of imports at the end of 1996).
4.    These achievements reflect, at the macroeconomic level, the authorities' success in attaining
the intermediary objectives pursued by the SAL, and the effectiveness of the instruments used. The
degree of effectiveness of each of them and the speed at which they made their influence felt differed
on occasion markedly from original expectations.
5.    In its effort to set up an efficient framework for enterprise restructuring, the SAL program
put a high degree of emphasis on developing competitive markets. This is one of the areas where
visible results have come the fastest. Under the program, the export regime was virtually fully



- iii -
liberalized; the vast majority of monopolistic holding companies were dismantled, including the grain
and petroleum products monopolies, the public procurement of grain was limited only to the needs of
public institutions and purchase orders placed competitively; and all price controls on oil were
eventually eliminated. These measures have brought early positive results, including a surge in
exports, and a turnaround in agricultural terms of trade followed by production recovery in 1996.
6.    In addition, the SAL program sought to facilitate the entry and exit of firms. In this
context, the program supported a fundamental overhaul of the land and real estate regime,
culminating with the adoption in December 1995 of a new land code which enshrines private tenure
rights. Whereas the full impact of such momentous changes will take years to mature, it is already
visible in the pick up of commercial real estate transactions. In contrast, the idea of creditor-led
enterp,rise restructuring has not yet materialized in a major way. A bankruptcy law was indeed
adopted at the outset of the program. But the procedures it established for creditors to obtain
satisfaction of their claims, both in- and out-of-courts, have not been widely used. A revised
bankruptcy law containing much more specific implementation provisions, passed in February 1997,
may prove easier to enforce. But it will clearly take some more time than originally envisaged before
bankruptcy becomes a main avenue for enterprise restructuring.
7.     A second objective pursued by the programn was to strengthen the principal agents of
enterprise restructuring: private owners and banks. Progress has been particularly visible on two
evaluation criteria for privatization: (i) speed: in the two years between the start of the privatization
program and the completion of the SAL, two/thirds of the universe of eligible objects were sold in the
under the small-scale privatization program; share packages were offered in essentially all enterprises
eligible for mass privatization; and almost all former state farms had been transferred to private
ownership. The only part of the privatization programn which stalled is the case-by-case program for
the largestfirms, extractive industries, and utilities. In reaction to this blockage, the state resorted to
the expedient of negotiating management contracts with private operators; and (ii) competition: the
prograrn also succeeded in dismantling monopolistic holding companies and putting a stop to the
vertical integration of agro-industries. In contrast, the impact of the mass privatization of medium-
scale enterprises on governance is only beginning to be felt.
8.    Along side the private sector, the financial sector has played a key role in the adjustment of
enterprises by enforcing financial discipline. Debt deflation however (rather than debt restructuring)
emerged as the main vehicle of bank influence over domestic borrowers. Threatened themselves with
liquidation, restrained by more stringent prudential norms, relieved from the role of channeling
directedi credits and increasingly run by private owners, commercial banks became increasingly
reluctant to take on new risks. As a result, bank credit (in tenge) came to a virtual standstill in 1995-
96. In this context, the Rehabilitation Bank of which the SAL supported the creation ended playing a
positive but somewhat more modest role than originally envisaged. It proved its worth mainly as an
instrument for the government to deal with some of the most difficult restructuring cases (e.g.,
company towns, depleted coal mines, emergency liquidity support to a steel mill pending
privatization) within a disciplined framework and a constrained resource envelope.
9.     Finally, the program made good headway toward strengthening the social safety net. As
expected, the program led to a major increase in open unemployment. The reform of the
unemployment benefits helped to bring within the unemployment benefit scheme potential
beneficiaries previously put off by the social stigma associated with the unemployed status. The
Government also largely completed the transfer of selected enterprises' social services (mainly



- iv -
kindergarten and polyclinics) to local budgets, and set out to align their standards of services with
those applicable in comparable state facilities.
10.   Overall, the SAL outcome has been rated "satisfactory." Most of the credit for this goes to
the sheer determination of the senior leadership to see the program through. The performance of the
Bank can be rated highly satisfactory. The SAL program was germane to the challenges the country
faced at the time, and in sync with the senior leadership's strategy to deal with them. During
supervision, the Bank provided regular detailed and systematic feedback to the authorities and adopted
a constructive attitude toward program implementation: firm on the need to meet the development
objectives of the program, but willing to show flexibility as to the practical ways to achieve them.
Summary of Findings, Future Operations, and Key Lessons Learned
11.   In the context of this operation, Kazakstan made a solid start in economic restructuring.
While this process is only beginning, many of the structural achievements of the program can safely
be regarded as irreversible. On the external side, Kazakstan does not appear to be highly exposed to
downside risks. By the closing of the SAL program, the domestic economic situation remained
however more fragile. Key outstanding issues discussed in this Implementation Completion Report
are being addressed under pipeline operations: (i) fiscal adjustment and public resource management
under a proposed Public Resource Management Adjustment Loan; (ii) land and real estate registration
under a namesake project; and (iii) judiciary strengthening under a proposed Legal Reformn Loan.
12.   The lessons learned with the implementation of the SAL essentially confirm the broader
international experience with economic reforms. First, transition to a market economy is a highly
complex process. Not only is the scope of the required changes formidable. The experience of
Kazakstan also illustrates some of the challenges involved in charting and maintaining a feasible
course of action, even when the strategic direction is clear. This is among others, because transition
economies, even more than others, respond with a time-lag to the application of policy instruments,
the length of which is hard to predict; and because for quick results, one cannot overly rely on
actions, which require building up new institutional frameworks. Second, in this context, consistency
of purpose on the part of the authorities and flexibility in execution are more important than detailed
planning and scheduling in determining the success of transition strategies. Government commitment
was certainly one of the hallmarks of the operation reviewed in the present document.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF KAZAKSTAN
STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT LOAN
(Loan 3900-KZ)
PART I. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. Objectives
1.    At the time when the Structural Adjustment Loan began to be prepared in mid-1994, the
economy was in a tailspin. Its industry highly integrated with the Russian one, Kazakstan had
suffered dramatically from the disruption of trading and payment arrangements, which accompanied
first the collapse of the FSU, then the breakdown of the ruble zone. Energy exports and supplies had
become pawns of difficult bilateral relations with Russia. The abrupt deterioration of agriculture's
terms of trade had dealt food production a crushing blow. Confronted with the resulting strains,
Kazakstan's enterprises showed every symptom of failing to adjust: enterprises losses were mounting
but unemployment remained almost non-existent. A desperate attempt in early 1994 at reflating the
economy (by refinancing inter-enterprise arrears) had only succeeded in bringing the economy to the
verge of hyper-inflation and in draining the budget. Inflation peaked at 40 percent a month in June
1994 and GDP declined by about a fifth during that year (see Table 1).
2.    In the summer of 1994, the government adopted a second Anti-Crisis Program (the first one
dated back from early 1993), which the Structural Adjustment Loan came to support. Within the
government's overall program to accelerate market reforms and tighten financial policies, the
Structural Adjustment Loan focused on facilitating a more rapid and effective restructuring of the
enterprise sector, which was perceived as a key constraint both in macroeconomic stabilization and
recovery in output. The objective of the Loan was to achieve decisive progress for enterprise
restructuring in three areas: (i) market development; (ii) strengthening the two main agents of
enterprise restructuring, the private and financial sectors; and (iii) strengthening social protection.
Major measures included: liberalizing exports, dismantling monopoly holdings, facilitating entry of
firms through land reform and exit of firms through foreclosure and bankruptcy, accelerating
privatization, imposing financial discipline with isolation for 20 large distressed enterprises, and
strengthening unemployment benefit policy to facilitate labor adjustment. These steps toward
microeconomic reform were designed to contain enterprise borrowing, thereby supporting tighter
monetary policy. They were also expected to lower the demand for key tradables, thereby helping to
stabilize the external account and the exchange rate.
3.    As subsequent developments would show, this program rose to the occasion. The scope and
complexity of the proposed reforms were admittedly highly ambitious. But so was the country's
senior leadership. The process remained however largely one of "reforms from above." In the
absence of a broad social and/or bureaucratic consensus around the reform agenda, the SAL support
helped the leadership keep the process on track and see the reforms through long after its initial
impulse had worn out.
B. Achievement of Objectives
4.    Substantial progress was accomplished in 1995-96 toward achieving the ultimate,
macroeconomic objectives of the program. Inflation steadily declined to 28 percent annually by the



-2 -
end of 1996. And after a further drop in 1995, GDP started growing again in 1996, reflecting
improved performance in three main sectors of the Kazak economy: agriculture, energy, and metals.
As a ftirther encouraging factor, this recovery was driven by exports. With a growth rate of about 8
percent, in real terms, the latter constituted the most dynamic component of final demand in 1995-96.
The recovery was therefore accompanied by a reduction in the trade deficit from about US$1,200
million in 1994 to US$400 million in 1996. It also allowed for a moderate resumption of private
consumption growth in 1996, interrupting a continued decline since the beginning of the decade.
5.    While on the domestic side, macroeconomic performance has, by and large, been in line with
programn expectations (see Table 1), the speed of the external adjustment has been more of a surprise
(see Tatble 2). The current account deficit, which had been anticipated to expand by about US$150
million between 1994 and 1996, shrank instead by about US$400 million. Capital flows turned out to
be higher also, on account of an unexpectedly large inflow of foreign direct investment. As a result,
the country was able to build higher foreign reserves than originally anticipated, and maintained them
at a healthy level relative to growing imports (over 17 weeks of imports at the end of 1996).
6.    These achievements reflect, at the macroeconomic level, the authorities' success in attaining
the intermediary objectives pursued by the SAL, and the effectiveness of the instruments used. Signs
of the hope for economic restructuring are now everywhere. The former 2,000 state farms are now
25,000 farming entities, incorporated under a variety of private legal forms... Unprofitable coal
mines in the Karaganda basin are being closed down... As firms shed redundant labor, registered
unemployment has climbed to 4 percent of the labor force... With a smaller labor force, industrial
output is picking up in sectors targeted by foreign investments... Such examples could be multiplied.
7.    It is notable, however, that if overall the instrument applied served their purposes, the degree
of effectiveness of each of them and the speed at which they made their influence felt differed on
occasion markedly from original expectations, as will be documented in the following paragraphs.
The Framework for Enterprise Restructuring
8.    The SAL program put a high degree of emphasis on developing competitive markets. This
is one of the areas where visible results have come fastest. Under the program, the export regime
was virtually fully liberalized, through measures ranging from the elimination of quotas, licenses, and
monopolies before first tranche release to the abolition of minimum price controls for selected
agricultural commodities in late 1996.
9.    On the domestic side, the program focused on dismantling monopolistic holding companies.
Of the 81 holding companies, which existed in early 1995, 77 have been identified for reorganization,
and in 61 cases, segmentation decisions have been made and are at various stage of implementation a
year later. Out of a total of about 2,300 holding subsidiaries eligible for privatization, shares in
nearly 900 had been offered at coupon auctions and in over 1,200 at cash auctions (including small-
scale auctions). Two of them, in particular, the grain and petroleum products monopolies, whose
monopolistic influence had previously been keenly felt, had been almost fully segmented and
privatized by 1996.
10.   Further liberalization actions were also taken in these two sectors. From 1995 onwards,
public procurement of grain has been limited only to the needs of public institutions such as the
defense forces, hospitals, schools, and the country's security stock, and purchase orders have been
placed competitively with grain suppliers. In the oil sector, the Govermnent first abolished



-3 -
administrative pricing of crude oil in late 1994, and eventually eliminated the remaining system of
profit margin control in 1995.
11.    The result of these measures has been immediately visible. First, exports surged at an annual
rate of over 20 percent in dollar terms between 1994 and 1996, in part admittedly as previously
under- or unrecorded transactions came back into the open. Second, after reaching abysmal levels in
early 1995, agricultural terms of trade rallied strongly in the following year as producer prices,
particularly for grain, adjusted to world market levels. The 1995 crop was a disaster--even for a
country used for climatic reasons to wide fluctuations in its grain harvest--as the sector struggled
under the combined effect of a profit squeeze and loss of all previous forms of public funding,
particularly directed credits. But by 1996, the impact of relative price changes was clearly felt and
production was on the rebound (+20 percent for grain). Finally, the dismantling of the petroleum
distribution monopoly greatly enhanced market competitiveness, permitting for instance the entry,
starting in 1996, of foreign retail operators.
12.   In addition, the SAL program sought to facilitate the entry and exit of firms. The program
recognized that the small-scale privatization program would be the single most powerful instrument to
promote the entry of new competitive businesses. It also sought to (i) facilitate and secure access to
land and real estate; and (ii) permit the closure of failed ventures. The hopes placed on small scale
privatization were clearly justified (see para. 17), judging how new small private ventures started to
mushroom in 1995-96.
13.    A revolution of major proportion also took place in the land regime; first with the lifting in
1995 of previous ambiguities surrounding the status of firms' lands (which had been a major
impediment to business development), then with the adoption in December 1995 of a new land code,
enshrining private ownership or quasi-ownership rights. The subsequent adoption of laws on
registration and mortgaging completed this legal framework. The full impact of such momentous
changes will take years to materialize. It is already visible at the "small transactions" end of the
market, i.e., that for commercial real estate, where activities have picked up markedly. Larger
transactions on industrial estates and agricultural land are slower to emerge, in part due to the sheer
magnitude of the task of issuing proper deeds, and delays in establishing a land registration system.
14.   By contrast, the idea of creditor-led enterprise restructuring has not yet materialized in a
major way. A bankruptcy law was indeed adopted at the outset of the program. But the procedures
it established for creditors to obtain satisfaction of their claims, both in- and out-of-courts, have not
been widely used. Invalidating previous fears that bankruptcy suits might clog the court system (as
had been the case in some Eastern European countries), the caseload did not amount to more than
about 90 cases for the whole country in 1996. The fact of the matter is that the legal recourses
established by the law are not regarded as genuinely enforceable by creditors. Even senior authorities
more often than not have chosen to deal with troubled debtors on the basis of the ownership rights of
the state rather than on its creditors' right. The Rehabilitation Bank, which had been designed to
centralize and enforce bank and government claims on the largest insolvent industrial debtors, proved
unable to act conclusively on the basis of such rights only, and had to be also transferred the state's
ownership rights over the said debtors. More recently (late 1996), the Central Bank, despairing of
liquidating failed banks through judicial procedures, obtained the right to expropriate their
shareholders. Furthermore, in an increasing number of highly publicized (quasi) liquidations cases
(e.g., Karaganda Metallurgy, Kazak airline), the government itself chose to operate outside of the
framework of the bankruptcy law.



-4 -
15.   One may of course question the quality of the law or the diligence of the courts. More
fundamientally, however, it might be that such creditor rights, even if legally established, are not
socially or politically accepted, or more precisely that the remedies bankruptcy proceedings afford to
creditors are still seen as too exorbitant to be executable in practice. This contrasts, for example,
with the rights of secured creditors over collaterals, which may be much better accepted and therefore
enforceable. A revised bankruptcy law containing much more specific implementation provisions,
passed in February 1997, may prove easier to enforce. Substantial efforts are also underway with the
help of USAID to train judges in such new fields. But clearly, it will take some more time than
originally envisaged before bankruptcy becomes a main avenue for enterprise restructuring.
The Instruments of Enterprise Restructuring
16.    The program envisaged that "private owners and banks [would] be the principal agents of
enterprise restructuring" and that this would require (i) the strengthening of the ongoing rapid
privatization program so that private shareholding reaches a critical mass as soon as practical; and (ii)
a tightening of banking regulations that force financial institutions to discipline their borrowers
(MoP., para. 51). Both intermediary objectives were achieved. But, perhaps unexpectedly, the
second set of measures proved much more effective in the short run than the first in bringing the sort
of discipline the program called for. Whereas the concrete impact of mass privatization, for example,
is just beginning to be felt, that of banking reform is already in plain view.
17.    The MoP had set three criteria for judging the success of privatization efforts supported by
the SAL: speed ("Not only should ownership be transferred quickly..."), competition ("...it should
also enhlance competitiveness in the economy..."), and governance ("...and involve investors who are
able and motivated to guide their firms toward profit objectives.") (MoP, para. 52). On the first
two counts, measurable success has come quickly, but performance against the third criterion has
been slower to materialize, as discussed below:
Speed. During the two years, which elapsed between the launch of the second privatization
program (early 1994) and second tranche release (early 1996), (i) over 11,000 establishments
were sold under the small-scale privatization program, representing two/thirds of the universe
of eligible objects; (ii) share packages were offered in essentially all enterprises eligible for
mass privatization, i.e., about 1,900 joint stock companies (a majority ownership was offered
in about 1,500 of them); and the sales of residual state share packages cash auctions had been
initiated; and (iii) almost all 2,000 former state farms had been transferred to private
ownership. The only part of the privatization program which stalled is the case-by-case
program for the largest firms, extractive industries, and utilities. In reaction to this blockage,
the state resorted to the expedient of negotiating management contracts with private operators,
foreign and local, to reinvigorate financially, manage, and eventually acquire firms eligible
for the CbC program. About 60 such contracts were passed in 1995-96 (only 39 of them
were still effective in early 1997).
Competition. As described in para. 9, the privatization program also succeeded in
dismantling the monopolistic holding companies, which had been created in 1993 to substitute
for former branch ministries. Under the SAL, the government also put a stop to the specific
program for agro-enterprises, which had been fostering the vertical integration of the sector.
Governance. The impact of the program on enterprise governance has, so far, been felt
mainly among small firms on the one hand, and very large ones, on the other, but much less



-5 -
among medium-sized firms. There is little question that firms sold through cash auctions
have acquired "true" capitalist owners. At the other end of the size spectrum, the degree of
success of management contracts has essentially varied with the pace at which such contracts
gave way to actual privatization (as for Karaganda Metallurgy); otherwise, unconcerned by
the long-term asset value of the firm under their control, firm managers have often privileged
access to short-term rents arising from special commercial preferences, asset stripping, etc.
But by the end of 1996, the impact of the mass privatization of medium-scale enterprises was
only beginning to be felt. A core group of 20-30 active investment privatization funds (IPFs)
had emerged (out of the existing 169 which had taken part in coupon auctions), which
controlled 300 to 600 firms and between one half and two thirds of the shares owned by IPFs
(IPFs accounting for between a quarter and a third of all IPFs shares had become dormant).
These core IPFs were beginning to establish control over their enterprises. The difficulties
that they encountered in this task resulted to a large extent from the hurried way in which
mass privatization had been initiated. The main difficulties concerned: (i) conflicts over
enterprise ownership resulting from flaws in the mass incorporation process that preceded
mass privatization; and (ii) cost of secondar transactions - the same flaws also complicated
share registration, and therefore, hampered the process of IPF portfolio consolidation.
Although formal restrictions to such a consolidation had been eliminated under the SAL, the
process remained dominated by informal arrangements based on trust, rather than market
institutions. Furthermore, two factors served to weaken the governance of IPFs themselves:
(i) absence of shareholder control due to a high error rate in coupon recording (20-30
percent), initial IPF shareholder registries still needed to be completed by end-1996; and (ii)
uncertainty as to IPFs' legal status as the temporary status under which they had been created
expired before a consensus could be found on the permanent legal form they would take after
the completion of coupon-privatization. Finally, the question of how IPFs would generate the
necessary financial resources to invest in their companies remained essentially unresolved.
18.   Along side the private sector, the financial sector was also "expected to play a key role in the
adjustment of enterprises by enforcing financial discipline in the economy" (MoP, para. 51). This
role, it has played beyond expectations--although not always through the expected channels. It had
been expected that, using their control over a critical mass of enterprises' stock of debt, banks would
take the leadership in creditor-led enterprise restructuring. It was however recognized that
commercial banks did not "have the capacity and [could] not be expected to force and control the
economic and financial restructuring of all distressed borrowers, especially the largest ones" (MoP,
para. 66). A Rehabilitation Bank was therefore created to relieve banks of these leadership
responsibilities vi-a-vis largest debtors.
19.   In the event, as noted above, debt deflation rather than debt restructuring emerged as the main
vehicle of bank influence over domestic borrowers. Threatened themselves with liquidation,
restrained by more stringent prudential norms, relieved from the role of channeling directed credits
and increasingly run by private owners, commercial banks simply refused to take on new risks. The
result has been clear--new bank credit to the economy stopped on its track. After expanding at paces
measured in hundreds of percent in 1992-94, bank credit (in tenge) came to a virtual standstill in
1995-96. Further intensifying the squeeze on enterprises, the influx of export credits, which during
the first attempts at stabilization had served as a substitute for domestic credit, also dried up from
1994 onwards, when alarmed by a widespread default record the government refused to extend
further sovereign guarantees on such loans. Some of the key actions taken under the program to
bring about this "debt-deflation" are as follows:



-6 -
7hreat of liquidation. As part of its enforcement of stricter prudential policies, more than 100
banks lost their banking licenses in 1994-95, reducing by half the size of the sector (from
over 200 in 1993 to about 100 in late 1996). Furthermore, some of the banks still formally in
business were only the shadows of their former selves. This is the case for instance of
Agroprom Bank, once the largest bank in the country, and now completely marginalized.
Prudential Regime. The prudential framework was complemented by the introduction, in
early 1995, of a compulsory risk classification of assets. The legal basis for prudential
regulation, as well as the central bank's enforcement powers, were also reinforced in 1995 by
the Decree-Laws on the National Bank and on Banking. On this basis, the central bank
started phasing in loan loss provision, forcing banks to emphasize loan collection.
Credit policy. One of the most decisive steps toward financial discipline was taken in late
1994, when the government accepted the responsibility for most of the past and any future
directed lending. This marked the end of government interference with bank credit: directed
credits were eventually eliminated at the outset of the program (February 1995). This
decision also paved the way for the future carving out (1995-96) of most such loans from
bank portfolios and their transfer to various government entities (Agricultural Support Fund,
Rehabilitation Bank, Ministry of Finances). As a result of this policy, the proportion of
conmmercial bank credit backed by central bank resources, which was still as high as 43
percent at the end of 1993, had fallen to 16 percent by the end of 1995. More fundamentally,
this process succeeded in de-linking credit allocation from the political process, and gave
banks a chance to make a fresh start as commercial ventures.
Governance. Substantial progress was also made toward improving commercial bank
governance. First, a Presidential Decree on Banking of August 1995 forbade majority
state-owned enterprises to hold bank shares. Accordingly, such shares were swapped against
state bonds. Second, in December 1995, the Government resolved to sell within months most
of the 63 remaining banks in which it held shares (often as a result of the swap operation
described above). By the end of 1996, the state share packages in all but eight banks had
been offered for privatization.
20.    The maintenance of positive real interest rates during the period helped dampen the demand
for credit. Whether this instrument played a decisive role is hard to determine. At any rate, the
central bank remained careful in its handling of interest rates, maintaining its refinance rate within
three percent of the inflation rate, but promptly adjusting it downwards as inflationary pressures
subsided.
21.   In this context, the Rehabilitation Bank, of which the SAL supported the creation, ended
playingl a positive but somewhat more modest role than originally envisaged. Neither the hopes
placed in it that it would "make a significant contribution to the success of the macroeconomic
stabilization program" by "forcing the restructuring, privatization or liquidation of the most highly
indebted loss-making enterprises" (MoP, para. 67), nor the fears it inspired that it would become a
substantial drain on public resources eventually materialized. Nonetheless, the Rehabilitation Bank
has proven its worth, as an instrument for the government to deal with some of the most difficult
restructuring cases within a disciplined framework and a constrained resource envelope.
22.    After making a slow and somewhat misguided start, the operations of the Rehabilitation Bank
started in earnest in late 1995. In January 1996, it adopted, in consultation with World Bank staff,



-7 -
policy and operational guidelines, inter alia, linking access to the Rehabilitation Bank's resources to
drastic downsizing measures, leading to either liquidation or privatization. By late 1996, it was
supporting the restructuring of 25 firms (16 firms previously assigned to the Rehabilitation Bank were
subsequently released for privatization or management contract). A large part of the Rehabilitation
Bank's clientele, however, was not composed of "most highly indebted firms," but was rather made
of "special cases" (e.g., company towns, depleted coal mines, emergency liquidity support to a steel
mill pending privatization) the restructuring of which posed specific social or local challenges, as
distinct from macroeconomic ones. A main reason for this difference in clientele is that larger firms
maneuvered strenuously to avoid the rigors of the Rehabilitation Bank, while those who stayed with it
had probably nowhere else to turn to. This rigor in turn is explained by the modesty of the funding
available to the Rehabilitation Bank - about 0.5 percent of GDP in 1995 and considerably less in
1996. Even that funding was being released to it only on a case-by-case basis.
The Social Safety Net
23.   As expected, the program led to "a major increase in open unemployment" (MoP., para. 73)
as firms started to layoff redundant staff. Labor statistics bear testimony to a two-fold process: (i) an
increase in actual unemployment (including compulsory leaves without pay, and other forms of hidden
unemployment) from 7.3 percent of the labor force in 1994 to an estimated 13 percent of the labor
force in 1996; and (ii) a parallel increase in the number of unemployed people handled by the official
unemployment scheme from 0.9 percent of the labor force in 1994 to 3.8 percent in 1996. The latter
development is in part a consequence of the reform of the unemployment benefits that the SAL
supported, and which led to a four-fold increase in minimum benefits in real terms between 1994 and
1996. The resulting improvement in the replacement ratio (although to only 19 percent of average
wages) helped to draw within the scheme potential beneficiaries previously put off by the social
stigma associated with the unemployed status. This improvement in benefits was funded by
terminating low priority programs, and extending the coverage of the employer's social security
contributions to the agricultural and government sectors.
24.   The program also sought to "ensure the continued operation of essential social services
currently delivered by enterprises" (MoP, para. 74), primarily kindergartens and polyclinics. With
the support of the World Bank's Social Protection Project, the Government developed a strategy (and
adopted it in 1996) to transfer selected enterprises' social services to local budgets and to restructure
them with a view to unifying their standards of services with those of comparable facilities run by
local authorities. By the end of 1996, this process was largely completed and the authorities had
moved to a new reform phase - the transfer and restructuring of public infrastructure and housing
operated by enterprises. This new phase of reform is being supported by a proposed Public Sector
Resource Management Adjustment Loan, currently under preparation.
C. Major Factors Affecting Implementation
25.   The single most important factor behind the successful implementation of the SAL program
was simply the senior leadership's sheer determination to see it through. Two elements of the
external environment further helped. First, a marked improvement in Kazakstan's relations with
Russia (as evidenced, for instance, by the 1995 agreements on Baikonur, and on debt relief, and on a
customs union) facilitated trade relations between the two countries. It singularly eased the country's
energy supply situation and created a more propitious climate for energy sector reform. Second, the
surge in grain prices on world commodity markets in 1995 created an irresistible "pull" in favor of



-8 -
agricultural marketing reform; and, as world market prices eventually reached farm gates, they
substantially mitigated the income effect of the 1995 crop failure.
26.    Conversely, two other factors complicated the implementation of the program. First, the
rapid erosion of support for coupon-privatization became a source of contention and delay. This
prograim had been designed at a time (1992-93) when, the country's resource situation being more
comfoitable, it could more readily let long-term equity and efficiency considerations dominate its
policy agenda. At that time, the country still benefited from massive transfers of resources from
Russia; it looked set to avoid the "loss of control of the tax base that has been the main source of
fiscal difficulties in other reforming economies" (World Bank: "Kazakstan: Economic Report"
Volume 2, para 1.67, July 1994); and, more generally, it had not yet experienced the worst part of
the recession. With the economic crisis, immediate financial considerations became overwhelming
(for the state as well as for firms), and the sentiment spread that they would be better served by a
cash sales program. As it happened, the eventual shift to such a cash program, after the completion
of the coupon program, was decisive in overcoming some of the prevailing resistance to reforms,
particularly with regard to the dismantling of the grain monopoly and the privatization of its
components. Second, as already noted, creditors' rights proved harder to enforce than was
anticipated, limiting the scope for creditor-led enterprise restructuring in the short run.
D. Sustainability
27.   In the context of this operation, Kazakstan made a solid start in economic restructuring. While
this process is only beginning, many of the structural achievements of the program can safely be
regarded as irreversible. The real challenges will consist in sustaining the effort over the medium
term, either because, with the passage of time, popular patience with economic hardship may wear
thinner, or because the lure of "easy" oil money may soften the authorities' mettle.
28.    On the external side, Kazakstan does not appear to be highly exposed to downside risks. The
current account deficit is closing faster than expected, the country is attracting more foreign
investment than the rest of Central Asia put together, its debt service ratio is low, and foreign
reserves are sufficiently comfortable to allow the country not to purchase under its extended
arrangement with the IMF. On the strength of this performance, Kazakstan recently made a
successful entry on the euromarket with a 3-year, US$200 million euro-note issuance at 3.5 basis
points over US T-bills (rating: Ba3/BB-).
29.   ]3y the closing of the SAL program, the domestic economic situation remained however more
fragile. To start with, enterprise restructuring remained very much the order of the day, with
massive layoffs still in the offing before the remaining hidden unemployment is eliminated. Banking
reform, on the other hand, continued to make considerable headway under a subsequent Financial
Sector Adjustment Loan. But one of the negative side-effects of the stringent credit polices
implemeinted since late 1994 was becoming increasingly painful. As credit dried up, some of the
burden of financing enterprises shifted to the energy sector and to public utilities. Now financially
drained, these sectors were encountering increasingly difficulties in keeping output or services (e.g.,
heat, power); and the resulting attempt by the authorities to privatize public infrastructure and energy
(telecom, airlines, gas, oil, power, railways) at breakneck speed did not appear sustainable in the
absence of supporting regulatory frameworks.
30.    Furthermore, uncertainties remained as to the capacity of the state to play its role in the new
setting. One source of uncertainty concerned the pace at which state institutions (particularly the



-9 -
judiciary) would rise to the task of enforcing the new law and rights formally established under the
reform program. Another one affected the capacity of the state to maintain basic services to the
population in the face of a continued erosion in revenues; the latter dropped from 22 percent of GDP
in 1994 to 16 percent in 1996 (regular budget only). Judiciary reform and public resource
management are now the focus of two operations under preparation (proposed FY98 Legal Reform
Project and proposed FY97 Public Sector Resource Management Adjustment Loan).
E. Bank Performance
31.   The performance of the Bank can be rated highly satisfactory. The SAL program was
germane to the countries at the time, and in sync with the country leadership's strategy. Indeed, the
program fleshed out with a high degree of professionalism on the government's formally stated
intentions. This thorough preparation was reflected in the high level of specificity of the letter of
development policy.
32.   In recognition of the rapidly evolving situation in the country, the SAL was supervised at
close intervals, with four missions in the nine months between Board presentation and second tranche
release. Supervision missions provided detailed and systematic feedback to the authorities on program
implementation. The resident mission also played a crucial role in monitoring developments on a
daily basis.
33.   The Bank adopted a pragmatic attitude toward program implementation: firm on the need to
meet the development objectives of the program, but willing to show flexibility as to the practical
ways to achieve them. This concerns particularly the mass privatization of majority shares in medium
and large enterprises, where the tranche condition was met (i) in a different time frame, and (ii) in
some cases, using different methods than originally envisaged (cash auctions instead of coupon
auctions). The Bank nonetheless judged that the objective, scope, and intent of this particular
condition had been fully met in the following manner. First, majority share packages in about all
eligible enterprises had been offered for privatization through fair, transparent, and efficient methods.
Secondly, the cash auction methods were introduced following the legal expiration of the coupons
program. And finally, coupons and cash auctions were kept separate, thus maintaining the integrity
of the coupon program, as was intended under the SAL conditionality.
34.   The Bank also showed flexibility in releasing the second tranche of the Loan in a situation
where the Kazakstan's drawing rights under its stand-by arrangement with the Fund had been
temporarily suspended, judging that overall macroeconomic performance was satisfactory, a
judgement with which IMF staff concurred.
F. Borrower Performance
35.   Given the breadth of the achievements, Government performance in implementing the SAL is
clearly satisfactory. The detail record will show that implementation actually proceeded through fits
and starts. This should hardly be surprising given that change was essentially imposed from above by
a committed leadership, and was being pursued on an even broader front than covered by the SAL
proper. In this respect, the Loan conditionality played a useful role in keeping a process by nature
unwieldy aimed toward its fundamental development objectives. The Borrower also promptly met
other Loan Covenants.



- 10 -
36.   Two other key ingredients to the program's successful implementation were as follows:
(i) the close monitoring maintained by the Staff of the Cabinet of Ministers, particularly its Economic
Department and its Center for Economic Reforms; and (ii) the capacity of various agencies to make
the best of the available technical assistance, notably from USAID for privatization and
demonopolization, and the legal advice funded under the Technical Assistance Loan from the World
Bank.
G. Assessment of Outcome
37.   Overall, the SAL outcome has been rated "satisfactory." Given the odds, on the one hand,
the record, on the other, this is a conservative assessment.
H. Future Operation
38.   The SAL (FY95) was only one in a series of policy-based operations, which began with the
Rehabilitation Loan (FY94). After the SAL, further reform progress were supported by a Financial
Sector Adjustment Loan (FY96) now being implemented. Key outstanding issues mentioned above
are now being addressed under pipeline operations: (i) fiscal adjustment and public resource
management (see para. 30) under the proposed Public Sector Adjustment Loan (FY97) currently
under preparation; (ii) land and real estate registration (see para. 13) under a namesake project
(FY97); and (iii) judiciary strengthening (see para. 15) under a proposed Legal Reform Loan (FY98).
l. Key Lessons Learned
39.   The lessons learned with the implementation of the SAL essentially confirm the broader
international experience with economic reforms. Transition to a market economy is a highly complex
process. Not only is the scope of the required changes formidable. The experience of Kazakstan also
illustrates some of the challenges involved in charting and maintaining a feasible course of action,
even when the strategic direction is clear. This is among others, because
(a)    Economies respond with a time-lag to the application of economic policy instruments,
the length of which is hard to predict. As documented above, if most actions taken
under the program have drawn the expected response, the timeframe in which this
response came in, as well as its intensity differed sometime markedly from
expectations. Demonopolizing agricultural marketing, for example, which had been
expected to bear fruit only over the medium term, proved immediately effective; and
by contrast the impact of ownership change on enterprise governance, which had been
anticipated to come quickly, is only beginning to be seen.
(b)    Actions which involve eliminating (e.g., export restrictions) or dismantling (e.g.,
holding companies) can be taken quickly and generate quick results. But for quick
results, one should not overly rely on actions, which require building up new
institutional frameworks, be they new rules needing to be enforced (e.g., creditors'
rights) or institutions needing first to be set up, then become operational
(Rehabilitation Bank, Enterprise Restructuring Agency, Investment Privatization
Funds). Such innovations invariably take longer to root in practice than in the best
laid plans.



- 11 -
(c)    Hasty actions taken under the pressure of circumstances do not necessarily yield faster
results; design flaws are more likely to come back to haunt their effectiveness. It is
not clear, for example, that pressing up for an early start of the second privatization
program ended up yielding earlier benefits than would have been obtained had more
time been devoted to building stronger foundations for the process, such as more
careful initial incorporation of state enterprises, registration of state shares, or
recording of IPF shareholding.
40.    Second, in this context, consistency of purpose on the part of the authorities and flexibility in
execution are more important than detailed planning and scheduling in determining the success of
transition strategies. Government commitment was certainly one of the hallmarks of the operation
reviewed in the present document.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF KAZAKSTAN -
STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT LOAN (3900-KZ)
BORROWER'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE ICR
Introduction
1.    A Structural Adjustment Loan in an amount of USD 180 million was allocated by
the World Bank in support of the Kazakstan Government's reform program, described in
the "Letter of Economic Reform Policies" (LERP). The LERP was signed by Deputy
Prime Minister and Chairman of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakstan. The
Government of the Republic of Kazakstan agreed with the World Bank on major actions
to be supported by this Loan, which include: liberalizing exports, dismantling monopoly
holdings, facilitating entry of firms through land reform and exit of firms through
foreclosure and bankruptcy, accelerating privatization, imposing financial discipline with
isolation for 20 large distressed enterprises, and strengthening unemployment benefit
policy to facilitate labor adjustment.
2.    Kazakstan started implementation of a comprehensive structural reform program
aimed at moving toward a market economy in 1993. This program was then supported
by a Rehabilitation Loan from the World Bank of 1994 and Upper Credit Tranche
Standby Arrangement with the IMF.
Evaluation of Project Objectives
Implementation of the Economic Reform Program
3.   In general, the Loan objectives have been achieved due to the Government's
determination to be in line with the reforms policy and open dialogue with the World
Bank. The anti-crisis program was elaborated in the Republic, and implementation of the
program resulted in considerable improvement of the macroeconomic situation. A new
Government team appointed in October 1994 provided a fresh impetus to the
implementation of the reform program. Furthermore, the Government developed a
Medium-term Program of Deepening the Reforms for 1996-1998 and signed EFF
agreement with the IMF. As a result of policies and programs implemented in 1994-
1996, overall production decline was stopped, and first signs of growth appeared in main
sectors of the economy. In 1996, for the first time in the last five years, there is growth in
GDP compared to the previous year. Production growth is a result of stabilization of the
work of the enterprise privatized with participation of foreign capital, agriculture
development, and partially, development of small entrepreneurship. Inflation in 1996
comprised 28.7 percent compared to 60.3 percent in 1995, while average monthly rate
decreased from 4 percent to 2.1 percent. The overall fiscal deficit in 1996 was equivalent
to 3 percent of GDP as compared to 3.9 percent in 1995. Consistent actions on
liberalization of foreign trade contributed to growth of exports in 1996 by 9.6 percent as
compared to 1995, and growth of imports - by 11.4 percent.

Price Reform and Market Development
4.    Analysis of the foreign economic activity allows to reveal a number of positive
results of the economic reforms in the previous years. Export quotas as well as export
monopolies were abolished in the beginning of 1995. The number of items subject to
export licenses was substantially reduced. Export duties on all goods, including wheat,
have been abolished since August 1, 1996. The policy of liberalization and
decentralization of foreign trade contributes to the active integration of the Republic into
the world market. Kazakstan applied for WTO membership in 1996.
5.    Significant work was undertaken by the Government aimed at dismantling
monopolies and development of competitive environment. Reorganization plans for
grain monopoly Astyk and petroleum products distributing company Munai Onimderi, as
well as Pharmatsia, Ken Dala, Otyn have been prepared, and their implementation has
practically been completed. The subsidiaries of the reorganized monopolies were offered
at the mass privatization auctions in accordance with the existing legislation. In grain
sector, system of "state orders" was eliminated, and a competitive system of Government
procurement for public consumption requirements was. Oil and gas extracting
ernterprises, oil refineries were excluded from the list of natural monopolies.
6.    New land legislation establishing private land tenure, protecting land tenants
against arbitrary restrictions on land use, and facilitating the restructuring of the formner
collective farms was adopted in December 1995.
7.   In April 1995, the President of the Republic of Kazakstan issued a Bankruptcy
Law which provided for enforcement of financial discipline and radical restructuring, and
introduction of out-of-court procedures. Bankruptcy legislation was further improved
and its new version was approved by the Parliament in January 1997.
Enterprise Restructuring and Privatization
8.    Actions on enterprise restructuring have noticeably strengthened in 1996. This is
mainly related to the accelerated privatization of objects under case-by-case privatization.
Privatized objects are being sold on a competitive basis to the sound investors capable to
help enterprises overcome the crisis in a quite short time. Coupon privatization was
successfully completed in January 1996, and thereafter, privatization of majority state
shares in medium and large enterprises took place through cash auctions, using Dutch
auction procedures. Small scale privatization was conducted with a monthly average of
at least 500 establishments and over 500 trucks. Privatization process has started in
transport, social sector, and this will help accelerate the speed of the infrastructure
reform.
9.    Resolution on establishment of the State Rehabilitation Bank was adopted in
March 1995 to take over the existing risk exposure of the banking sector on 20 "non-

strategic" firms with the largest amount of arrears. Rehabilitation Bank has received
financing from the budget, prepared restructuring and sanation plans for a number of
enterprises, and initiated bankruptcy procedures against the other ones. The Bank has
also been acting as agent for the Government in 2 cases (Karmet and Ust-Kamenogorsk
Lead and Zinc) in providing emergency financial support to the Government sponsored
restructuring programs. In 1997, with acceleration of the enterprise reform process, the
role and functions of the Rehabilitation Bank will be limited to the work with a number
of large financially distressed enterprises with a substantial state share. Enterprise
Restructuring Agency under State Property Committee will develop a policy to control
financially distressed enterprises and represent the interests of the Government in this
process and to assist in elaboration of restructuring plans.
Social Safety Net
10.   Draft Employment Law improving the policy of providing and determining the
amount of unemployment benefits was prepared and submitted to the Parliament. The
social assets divestiture mechanism from enterprises to the local administration is
developed and being implemented in all oblasts.
Performance of the Bank
11.   The Bank played a key role in elaboration of the Government's reform program,
taking part in the design of this project. The Bank assisted the Government in
implementation of the reform by the allocation of financial aid, e.g. linked to the project
Financial and Enterprise Development Loan and Social Protection Loan.
12.   The Bank took part in development and review of the mass privatization program,
implementation of which was started in July 1993.
13.   The Bank helped in elaboration and implementation of the plan on
demonopolization and restructuring of large state holdings and monopolies in the key
sectors of the economy.
14.   With Bank assistance, a Bankruptcy Law and enterprise liquidation procedures
were developed.
15.   The Bank helped establish and enforce the work of the Rehabilitation Bank to
solve the problems of large insolvent enterprises.
16.   Social assets divestiture mechanism from enterprises to the local budgets was
elaborated with the help of the Bank.
17.  In the process of loan implementation, the Bank, and the World Bank Resident
Mission in Kazakstan in particular, provided prompt assistance with recommendations

anid advice. Bank supervision missions have been making analysis of the reform
implementations, and the results of these analyses were communicated to the Government
in the form of memoranda.
Performance of the Borrower
1 E.   Successful implementation of the reforms was possible due to the Government's
determination to stick to its initial objectives and maintain a considerable dialogue with
the Bank.
19.   The Government elaborated several pieces of legislation in market development
and enterprise restructuring: Bankruptcy Law, Land Law, etc.
20.   The Center for Economic Reforms and Government Apparat successfully
performed overall interministerial coordination during the loan preparation and
implementation process.
21.   Bank disbursement procedures were strictly followed thanks to the existing
experience in World Bank procedures of the staff of the Committee on Utilization of
Foreign Capital under the Ministry of Finance.
