outcome\n            was substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: this approach\n            would help in focusing all energies on the achievement of a\n            single well defined and circumscribed objective taking into\n            account the prevailing technical, economic, financial and\n            implementation capacity constraints. Careful attention\n            should be given to the results framework. In the case of\n            this project, the data on the results' indicators\n            achieved at project closing were available, but not\n            regularly collected prior to writing the Implementation\n            Completion and Results, or ICR. This can leave the\n            impression that there was a lack of focus on the impact and\n            results of the project. In future, it is recommended that\n            indicators linking outputs and outcomes more closely be\n            included as well as designing intermediate results\n            indicators accordingly."}, "docdt": "2014-02-27T00:00:00Z"}
