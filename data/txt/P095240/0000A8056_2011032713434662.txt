                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Since March 2009, the World Bank's program in Madagascar has been guided by its Operational Policy 7.30, "Dealing with de facto governments", designed to deal with situations
                         where a government comes into power by means not provided in the country constitution. Due to the application of this policy, the project has been on hold for the last two years and
                         disbursements under the project are suspended.
