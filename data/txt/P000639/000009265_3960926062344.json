  assisting the Ministry of Education (MOE) in its efforts to\n            restructure basic education by implementing the new\n            curricula, increasing the availability and use of teaching\n            materials, improving classroom management practices,\n            creating new teaching positions, training managers and\n            teachers and expanding physical facilities in rural areas.\n            To accomplish such objectives, the project includes such\n            components as (a) revision, printing and distribution of\n            mathematics, language, social studies and natural science\n            textbooks for all primary school children and training of\n            teachers in the use of these books; (b) improvements in\n            classroom management practices; and (c) appointment of 250\n            new teachers.  Further to this, the project entails (d)\n            assistance to rural communities for the construction and\n            furnishing of about 100 classrooms; and (e) strengthening of\n            the planning and implementation capacity within MOE.  As\n            part of this last component, the project finances studies\n            needed to prepare the 1990-1995 development plan and the\n            corresponding financial plan."}, "docdt": "1987-04-24T00:00:00Z"}
