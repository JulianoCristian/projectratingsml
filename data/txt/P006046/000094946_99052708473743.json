reform program, seeks to support\n            water sector reforms in medium-size cities through the\n            introduction of private sector participation in the\n            operation and management of water utilities, adoption of\n            appropriate regulatory frameworks, and institutionalization\n            of tariff policies and tested investment alternatives to\n            better reach poor consumers. The project consists of three\n            components: 1) Investment component will finance\n            rehabilitation and replacement of pipes, revamping and\n            improvement of water treatment plants and intake facilities,\n            upgrading substandard connections, supply and installation\n            of water meters, repair and replacement of pumping and\n            control equipment, supply of emergency and maintenance\n            equipment, improvement and extension of water and sewerage\n            services to the poor. 2) Institutional component will\n            finance the costs of project management, training of\n            regulators, technical assistance to continue advancing the\n            reform of the sector, establishment of a sectoral\n            information system, and development and implementation of\n            environmental regulations. 3) Environmental component will\n            finance updating of key environmental standards and\n            emergency actions to mitigate negative environmental impacts\n            related to water infrastructure."}, "docdt": "1999-05-10T00:00:00Z"}
