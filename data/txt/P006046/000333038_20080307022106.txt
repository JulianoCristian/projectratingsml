F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project's original objective was to support the reform process in about five medium-
size municipal and provincial utilities through the introduction of private sector
participation in the operation and management of water utilities, adoption of appropriate



                                            ii

regulatory frameworks, and institutionalization of tariff policies and tested investment
alternatives to reach poor consumers better. At the same time, the project also aimed at
creating a Federal backstopping capacity to adress the emerging post-privatization issues
such as weak regulatory regulatory capacity, slow extension of services to the poor, and
conflict resolutions.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
Project restructuring was submitted to the Board in June 2004 and approved. The revised
project objectives include: (a) to support the reform of the water and sanitation sector in
Argentina through the promotion of efficiency in the operation and financing of water
utilities; (b) to support the establishment of sound regulatory frameworks for the water
sector; and (c) to address universal service and environmental issues pertaining to said
sector. The project remains focused on improvements of existing water supply and
sanitation infrastructure in medium-sized cities of between 50,000 and 500,000
inhabitants.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

At the time of appraisal, Argentina's Secretary of Natural Resources confirmed to the Bank that private
sector participation (PSP) continued to underpin the government's strategy to improve the quality and
efficiency of water and sanitation services in urban and rural areas. While demand for privatization
remained strong, recent experiences also demonstrated how complex and difficult a process this was. The
Buenos Aires concession was already under considerable stress, the privatized utility in Corrientes was
experiencing low levels of investments and the Tucumán concession had been terminated. Most
provinces and a large number of municipalities and cooperatives were increasingly requesting from the
Federal Government technical assistance and financial support to open their utilities up to competition,
create regulatory agencies and avoid some of the mistakes of the past.

The Bank's country assistance strategy (CAS) agenda at the time included the privatization of water
utilities and reduction of fiscal transfers to inefficient public utilities (Document No. 14278-AR, with a
discussion update on May 15, 1997 and progress reports in March and November 1998). The 1995
financial crisis in Argentina provoked by the Mexican peso devaluation opened a window of opportunity
for accelerating reforms, supported by the Bank. This included the provision of water supply and
sanitation (WS&S) services in the provinces and municipalities. The project built on the technical
assistance already being offered to subnational governments under a water sector loan (Ln. 3281-AR,
Water Supply II), which was still ongoing, and by the World Bank Institute to carry out the privatization
process and regulate utilities, and provide financial support for initial and urgent rehabilitation/emergency
investments in the privatized utilities and other forms of PSP. At the same time, the program supported
the CAS goal of strengthening basic services and improving welfare by promoting the delivery of
affordable water and sanitation services for the urban poor.

The main sector issues at the time were low service coverage and poor quality WS&S services; low
investments; inadequate revenues, internal cash generation and efficiency; and a weak institutional
framework. The reform issues identified in the project appraisal document (PAD) included a lack of
transparency in the privatization process; weak and expensive regulatory institutions and inefficient tariff
regimes; poor choice of award criteria; lack of clear strategy and feasible models to expand services to the
urban poor in the context of PSP; limited participation of risk capital by private investors in water and
sanitation utilities; and lack of well-defined contracts and regulatory frameworks for existing
cooperatives. In addition, cross-sector issues included a fragmented water resources management system,
a complex framework of environmental institutions and regulations affecting the sector, and the lack of a
policy framework to address poverty issues.

As the first project to directly support the Government's reform agenda, the project was to support the
second generation of PSP arrangements targeting the improvement of efficiency and expansion of WS&S
services in medium-size cities of the country (population between 50,000 and 500,000), and to address the
sector and reform issues outlined above. It reflected the strategic choice already made by the government
and supported by the Bank to move from public ownership and management of water and sanitation to a
privately-led model of operation. While the past privatizations had demonstrated some flaws, the choice
of lending to well-performing public utilities was not considered. The choice instead was to improve on
the private model.

The project was to be executed by the National Agency for Water and Sanitation Works (Ente Nacional
de Obras Hídricas y Sanitarias - ENOHSA), under the supervision of the Secretariat of Natural Resources
and Sustainable Development (SNRSD). Under the terms of the loan, ENOHSA would on-lend project
funds to eligible sub-borrowers such as utilities and municipal and provincial governments meeting


                                                         1

certain PSP and regulatory criteria. Operators selected under acceptable procedures would be free to
procure works and goods under their own terms. The Bank would finance up to 60% of eligible
investments of the first five years of the investment plan. The terms of eligibility are detailed in section
1.5 below.

At project identification, alternative options were considered for Bank support to the WS&S sector such
as:
     a. complete withdrawal in order to allow the market to function and the private sector to assume all
          financing. This approach was discarded because it wrongly assumed that the sector was as
          attractive to the private sector as telecom and power, that price signals were right, that the
          regulatory framework was adequate, and that markets already had the capacity to address all
          sector issues and externalities and generate the incentives for a continuous and efficient
          expansion of services;
     b. a conventional investment lending project. This was discarded because an APL was deemed more
          suitable to support the PSP-oriented reform process;
     c. a technical assistance project. This was discarded because non-recourse financing was not yet
          feasible in the sector;
     d. a guarantee project to provide partial risk guarantees to protect investors against sovereign risk
          and uncertainties associated with the functioning of economic regulation. This was discarded
          because of its stringent requirements and high transaction costs.

A sector reform project was selected to accelerate PSP in the sector, while addressing pending issues of
the reform. The project was to provide limited financing for rehabilitation/emergency investments during
the initial years of PSP, and technical assistance to consolidate the privatization strategy. The
Government of Argentina considered this alternative, combined with the APL mechanism, the most
adequate for the condition of the sector in Argentina at the time. The program would accelerate the
transfer of a large number of utilities to private management while the participation of the Bank was
perceived by the private sector as a key stabilizing factor.

The participation of the Bank was considered justified during a transitional phase estimated to last five to
ten years, to expand and consolidate the reform of water utilities in urban centers with a population
greater than 50,000. During this timeframe, most of the investment responsibilities in this market
segment were expected to shift to the private sector. The PAD listed the following as the value that Bank
support would add in this project:

     · Introduce transparency to the privatization process;
     · Bring privatization experience and intellectual leadership from elsewhere around the world;
     · Bring techniques and experiences in extending water and sanitation services to the urban poor on
          a large scale;
     · Bring management discipline to the project;
     · Bank financing would act as a catalyst for private sector financing;
     · Establish credibility for the sector information system to be developed through the project.

1.2 Original Project Development Objective (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The project's original objective as stated in the PAD was to support the reform process in about five
medium-size municipal and provincial utilities while addressing the pending issues of existing private
utilities, regulatory frameworks, and regulatory agencies.




                                                        2

The project aimed to achieve four specific outcomes: (i) efficiently run utilities under private
management; (ii) private utilities with a clear strategy to expand services to the poor; (iii) cost-effective
regulatory practices; and (iv) reliable financial and operational information of utilities.

This project was conceived as phase 1 of a two-phase adjustable program lending (APL) program. The
overall program sought to support water sector reform in a total of at least 22 medium­size cities with
population of about 50,000 to 500,000. While extending the reforms to these new medium-sized cities,
the program also supported resolving the emerging issues of the earlier reform process in larger cities:
weak economic regulation of utilities, slow expansion of services to the urban poor, and the lack of a
well-defined framework to enforce environmental standards.

It was expected that the project benefits to the first five utilities to be supported under this project would
demonstrate the operational and financial viability of the program and set the stage for replication to other
utilities in the later stages.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
 reasons/justification

Following the macroeconomic crisis that shook Argentina starting in December 2001, the project
underwent a first, unsuccessful attempt at adaptive restructuring in 2002 (see section 2.2 below). A
second project restructuring was proposed at the mid-term review (December 2003) and approved by the
Board in June 2004. This restructuring was both adaptive and corrective in nature, seeking to adjust the
criteria for and destination of sub-loans and grants in response to i) low demand from eligible sub-
borrowers for funds under the project; and ii) urgent needs in areas that had become especially vulnerable
to sanitary risk due to increasing population density combined with deepening poverty. The restructuring
thus allowed efficiently operating utilities other than PSP-led concessions or cooperatives to apply for
project financing, and it allowed for grant funds to be directed to areas with emergency needs due to
poverty and/or environmental conditions. Finally, the restructuring extended the closing date of the
project to permit the adequate use and disbursement of funds.

The loan amendment was countersigned by the Government of Argentina in July 2005. The revised
project objectives were to support: (a) the reform of the water and sanitation sector in Argentina through
the promotion of efficiency in the operation and financing of water utilities; (b) to support the
establishment of sound regulatory frameworks for the water sector; and (c) to address universal service
and environmental issues pertaining to said sector. The project remained focused on improvements of
existing water supply and sanitation infrastructure in medium-sized cities of between 50,000 and 500,000
inhabitants.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,
(original and revised, briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD and as captured in the PDO,
as well as any other individuals and organizations expected to benefit from the project)

Expected benefits were described as program (APL1+APL2), rather than project (APL1 only) benefits
and included the following:

    a. efficiency gains from private sector management of sector operations and a sound and stable
         regulatory framework;
    b. increased and more efficient investments to rehabilitate and expand infrastructure;
    c. fiscal gains through increased tax revenues and reduced public transfers to water utilities.
    d. In the long term, improve the sector's access to private capital markets by providing much needed
         credibility in the regulatory environment and by providing stability and a track record of well-
         designed concession/PSP contracts.
    e. Provide credible and acceptable PSP models to be tested under the project and adapted by other
         utilities in the country.

As described in the PAD, improved operational and investment efficiency would translate into more
reliable water and sanitation services, the elimination of water rationing, reduction of waste due to
increased metering, improved water quality and reduction of water pollution, and better services to the
poor by the establishment of service and coverage targets in poor areas within PSP arrangements and
better sizing, timing and technology choice of sector investments through the incentives guiding private
sector decision-making.

The PAD stated the target population for the entire program rather than just this project. The target
population was 1.7 million, including 200,000 urban poor, as defined by the Headcount Index of Poverty
and the NBI indicator (unsatisfied basic needs) developed by the census and statistics institute (INDEC).

Annex 4 of the PAD included a distributive analysis of costs and benefits of the reform program using a
sub-sample of three sub-projects1 to identify winners and losers. It determined that "the big winner is the
government while also the other stakeholders, such as society and shareholders realize a sizeable share of
the benefits of sector reform." However, the net impact on consumers was less clear: "Consumers stand
to lose from PSP due to the increased efficiency in the operation of the utilities resulting in higher water
and sewerage bills. In return, however, they will benefit from improved services which were not fully
quantified in the analysis.2"

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The project components as described in Annex 2 of the PAD, are presented in the matrix below (Table 3).
The matrix also shows the revised components after project restructuring in June 2004.




1The Misiones sub-project, which was in fact implemented, was among these.

2The analysis assumed that economic benefits were equal to willingness to pay for water and sewerage disposal
services, itself estimated at 5% of household income. Improved hygienic and environmental conditions resulting
from improved WS&S coverage and quality and of temporary job generation during the project were not quantified.

A. Investment component (US$40.6 million). Investments to be financed under the           Part A: Subprojects (US$19.9 million)
project were those which restored the capacity of existing systems, and generated the
highest impact on revenue. Investments eligible for financing under this component
included: rehabilitation and replacement of pipes, revamping and improvement of water
treatment plants and intake facilities, upgrading substandard connections, supply and
installation of water meters, repair and replacement of pumping and control equipment,
supply of emergency and maintenance equipment, improvement and extension of water
and sewerage services to the poor. The component had three parts, as follows:

Part 1. Utilities with PSP arrangements procured through the Bank guidelines ($30         1. (US$14 million) Improvement by Sub-borrowers of their existing water supply and

would be established at ENOHSA and it would be responsible for the supervision of
subprojects. The Secretary of Natural Resources and Sustainable Development would
provide the overall guidance to the project. ENOHSA would also be responsible for
financial management of the project, including sub-loan administration, disbursement,
and reporting and audits. The PMU would be led by a Coordinator financed under the
project. The General Manager would be assisted by three functional teams, comprising
7 professionals, all financed under the project. The functional teams were: a
privatization/regulation team, a project administration team, and a poverty team. To
avoid creating a large PMU, a team of external consultants would be recruited to work
under the supervision of the PMU to assist in monitoring the performance of utilities
and supervising execution of investment subprojects. The PMU would be responsible
for the day-to-day management of project implementation. A detailed description of
PMU is on the Project Operational Manual. Procurement training for ENOHSA and
sub-borrowers under Part B and C of the investment component was also be financed
under this component.

1.6 Revised Components

As mentioned above, after a failed attempt at restructuring in 2002, a second project restructuring was
approved by the Board in July 2004 and ratified by the Government of Argentina in July 2005. The main
changes to the project consisted of (i) modifying the eligibility criteria for the sub-borrowers so that not
only privately held concessions and cooperatives, but any provincial, municipal, concessioned or
cooperative utility operating under determined efficiency criteria would be eligible; and (ii) eliminating
the pilot investment projects for poor areas (which were never executed) and instead making grants
available to eligible utilities for investment activities in poor urban areas. In addition, technical assistance
for PSP strengthening at the provincial/municipal level was eliminated, and a new subcomponent allowed
for the acquisition of goods in support of regulatory capacity at the federal, provincial and/or municipal
level and of operational capacity of the Federal Association of Regulatory Agencies for Water and
Sanitation (AFERAS). Finally, the environmental component was not modified in substance but it was
reduced in size, from US$ 1 million to 0.2 million. As detailed in the loan amendment, the revised
components are presented in Table 3 above.

Finally, the restructuring extended the closing date of the project to permit the adequate use and
disbursement of funds. The closing date of the project was initially set to July 31, 2002. It was extended
several times, due to the deep macroeconomic crisis that shook Argentina in 2001-2002, ensuing delays in
the re-negotiations and price adjustments of works contracts, the restructuring itself and various
procurement and execution delays, as detailed in section 2.2 and in Annex 2. The project ultimately
closed on March 31, 2007.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The Water Sector Reform Project followed the Water Supply and Sewerage Sector Project (Ln. 3181-
AR), which was approved in December 1990 and closed in April 2000, and which received a satisfactory
ICR rating in January 2001. The initial emphasis of that project was on strengthening decentralized
utilities to make them more efficient and financially viable. The 1980 decentralization of water and
sewerage services had been hastily carried out, resulting in weak provincial utilities and declining service
quality and coverage. During the implementation of Ln. 3281 there was an important shift in government
strategy, to make PSP the main tool for achieving efficiency and coverage goals in the delivery of these
services, accompanied by strengthened regulatory functions in the public sector. To reflect this, Ln. 3281
modified its support to provide direct technical and financial assistance to the privatization of public
utilities, while building public sector capacity to formulate policy and regulate privatized utilities. The
Water Sector Reform Project was conceived while the implementation of this strategy was in full swing
and the government sought to spread this approach to the provinces.

The PAD listed numerous lessons learned, along with the ways in which the project would address these.
In particular, measures included:

     · detailed preparatory work to ensure that the project would be front-loaded with a significant
          pipeline of sub-projects at loan effectiveness;
     · requiring that the private operators identify and implement the projects, as the public sector was
          found to have limited capacity to do so;
     · allocating investments in a demand-driven, competitive manner along with an APL design to
          ensure investment efficiency, flexibility and satisfactory development impact;
     · targeting private operators for institutional strengthening rather than public utilities, to improve
          its effectiveness;
     · making private operators rather than provincial governments responsible for counterpart funds, as
          provincial governments had limited capacity to do so;
     · allowing private operators rather than local governments to carry out procurement, in order to
          avoid paralyzing government processes;
     · funding the Project Management Unit (PMU) to ensure effective staffing and capacity.

In addition, the PAD presented lessons learned from recent difficulties experienced by PSP-oriented
reforms in Argentina and elsewhere. These included:

     · the need for strong political commitment to PSP from the top levels of government;
     · the pitfalls of hasty PSP-oriented reform and lack of proper competition in the award of PSP
          contracts;
     · the potential dangers of implementing PSP without a sound regulatory framework and capable
          regulators in place;
     · the advantage of multi-sector regulatory agencies at the provincial level;



                                                       10

     · the need for credible dispute resolution mechanisms in PSP contracts;
     · the need for a gradual approach to privatization combined with targeted subsidies for service
         connections for the poor, when afforded by the existence of a clear government strategy and a
         strong institutional base.

2.1.1 Preparation Activities and Government Commitment.

Preparatory studies were extensive, funded under the previous loan 3281-AR and covering 23 utilities
willing to subscribe to the reform agenda of the Secretary of Natural Resources and Sustainable
Development. Consulting firms prepared the reform programs for each utility, including a PSP strategy, a
regulatory framework of WS&S services, and bidding documents for PSP. The analysis prepared by the
consultants also included a technical evaluation of the service provided by each utility and a diagnosis of
its infrastructure, detailed proposals and estimates for investment and service targets, the economic and
financial evaluation of the viability of the proposed reform program and an inventory of existing
environmental regulations and issues pertaining to WS&S services in the corresponding locality. Based
on these studies, the provincial and municipal governments engaged in debate to obtain consensus on the
detailed reform model to be adopted. The project preparation team composed of Bank staff and
ENOHSA staff supervised the work of the consultants and further evaluated nine utilities already in an
advanced stage of the reform process, through an economic and financial model and preparation of
simplified line diagrams for all major system components, cost estimates for key investments and a
consistency analysis of investment costs and service targets.

According to interviews conducted for this ICR, government commitment appeared very high during
project preparation, with the Sub-secretary of Water Resources a strong advocate, backed by a solid team
of consultants (themselves funded under the previous loan 3281-AR). The Secretary of Natural
Resources and Sustainable Development (SNRSD) sent a letter from the Ministry of Economy, Public
Works and Services in July 1997 confirming to the Bank that PSP continued to underpin the
government's strategy to improve the quality and efficiency of water and sanitation services in urban and
rural areas. This was confirmed again by the SNRSD in March 1998.

2.1.2 Evaluation of design and preparation activities

Quality at entry (QAE) for this project was assessed at the pre-approval stage (December 1997) and rated
"fully satisfactory." The final QAE report was issued in January 2000, with a "Highly Satisfactory"
rating. The project was considered an example of Best Practice, with top ratings for the areas of (i)
project objectives, concept and approach; (ii) technical and economic aspects; (iii) institutional capactiy
analysis; and (iv) risk assessment and sustainability.

The QAE stated that "Overall, this is a carefully prepared project with a number of best practice features
related to: developing and strengthening the privatization and regulatory agencies; sovereign lending to
segments of the sector that are not suitable for financing by private companies (poor in peri-urban areas of
mid- and smaller-sized cities); sequencing of the reform program and of the investments; good
preparation of sub-projects; solid economic assessment and outstanding features in the financial analysis;
adopting an APL with two phases thereby permitting (if found necessary) adjustments to the program that
is designed to turn around this seriously neglected sector. Indeed, the project offers a good illustration for
the approach advocated in the Sector Board's recent PIP. Several less advanced areas that would require
close attention during the early stages of project implementation are as follows: a) adoption of adequate
provisions for public consultation and disclosure (on environmental aspects); and b) additional measures
to permit the measuring of social outcomes."




                                                      11

However, with the benefit of hindsight, a number of design features merit discussion and provide useful
lessons for future projects. Although the macroeconomic crisis that erupted in December 2001 played an
important role in shaping the ultimate outcome of the project, it also exacerbated pre-existing structural
issues in the project design. Key lessons from the preparatory and design process of this operation
include the following, and are detailed in the following sections:

    · Clearly distinguish between the means (such as increasing PSP) to achieve reform vs. the ends
         (such as greater efficiency and improved services) that are sought;
    · Avoid overly detailed designs for certain sub-components (such as sub-borrowing criteria and
         processes) and insufficiently detailed designs for others (such as poverty and environmental sub-
         components);
    · Assess actual consumer demand for new services - both willingness to pay for new and/or
         improved services, and willingness to connect to those services - using stakeholder consultations
         and other social science tools (surveys, focus groups). This step is key to adequately evaluate
         project benefits, and to adapt project design if it is necessary to incentivize demand;
    · Reflect such estimated consumer demand - both willingness to pay for new and/or improved
         services, and willingness to connect - for services in the economic analysis;
    · Ensure that the economic analysis is tailored to ask the right questions of the project design;
    · Simplify institutional arrangements for project and sub-project execution so that responsibilities
         and accountability are clearly assigned. Ensure that executing agency retains the commitment
         and the mandate to adequately execute the project's components, between the time of appraisal
         and the time of project effectiveness. Monitor these aspects closely during project
         implementation.
    · Carefully assess key risks relating to the macroeconomic environment, the government's
         commitment to the chosen strategy or its ability to adhere to scheduled tariff increases.

2.1.2.1 Means versus ends. The project documents listed PSP-oriented reform as the project and program
objective, rather than as the tool to achieve efficiency and improved service quality and sustainability.
Throughout the 1990s, after disappointing results with various forms of decentralization of public services
among many client countries, the Bank increasingly recommended PSP as the preferred tool to address
operational and financial inefficiencies in the water and sewerage sector. Ten years later and after many
hard-learned lessons, there is something of a consensus that PSP is only one among several tools to
address efficiency issues in this sector, and that it is not a panacea. However, at the time of appraisal,
PSP had become a quasi-shorthand for the achievement of efficiency and better services quality, within
international policy circles and for the Argentine government. This may explain why the PDOs for this
project cited PSP as an objective rather than as a means to reach the desired objective.

2.1.2.2 Detailed design. To avoid errors made in the past with regard to PSP reform, the project design
was very detailed. Thorough guidelines were prepared in the operational manual. One objective of
producing such detailed guidelines and contract templates was to allow the implementation of the reform
program to become more "systematic" at a high level of quality, and to narrow or eliminate the possibility
for errors during implementation. The unintended effect was that the IBRD sub-loan process and
conditions were considered by the executing and sub-executing agencies to be too narrow, rigid and
difficult to follow. They were also difficult to modify and adapt to the changing circumstances.

As a corollary to the point above regarding means vs. ends, the definition of the PDOs led to the
narrowing of eligibility criteria for sub-loans: only utilities with PSP (including cooperatives) could
benefit from investment funds. This had a direct impact on project implementation, as the demand for
sub-loans was ultimately lower than expected. Only two sub-projects, one in the province of Misiones
and one in Buenos Aires Province (Olavarría) were executed under the initial project design, and a third

was added after restructuring in 2004, in the province of Tucumán. In hindsight, it appears that non-PSP-
reformed utilities might have used the investment funds and technical assistance beneficially, had they
had access to those funds earlier on in the project. In 2001, many utilities remained under public
management and the prospects for PSP-oriented reform had substantially dimmed.

Two factors compounded the effect of overly narrow eligibility criteria on the demand for sub-loans: first,
the move away from PSP as a government strategy as the country was entering recession and controversy
around PSP was intensifying; second, the macroeconomic crisis which made utilities (like most other
entities, public or private) reluctant to contract dollar-denominated debt. A more detailed discussion of
the ramifications of the crisis for project implementation is included in section 2.2 below.

On the other hand, certain components may have been under-designed, such as the poverty pilot sub-
component and the environmental component. Three years had elapsed after project effectiveness before
terms of reference and a call for proposals were ready for the studies to design the poverty pilot
investments. However, none of the proposals submitted by prospective consultants were satisfactory, and
this sub-component was later re-shaped under the restructuring to eliminate the poverty focused pilot
projects and replace them with standard type investments targeting poor urban areas. Possible
(combined) reasons for the failure of the original poverty-focused sub-component were (i) the
government had found other means to address poverty through nationwide programs on public services
and employment (PROSAC, and later Agua Más Trabajo and Cloacas Más Trabajo); and (ii) in the midst
of the crisis, the priority of the project team was to save the existing active components of the project.

2.1.2.3 Social Aspects and Participatory Approach. The results on reform programs that emanated
from the preparation studies were intensively discussed at the governmental level. The PAD also states
that consultative meetings were held with stakeholders, including provincial and municipal governments,
provincial and municipal utilities, cooperatives, regulators, private operators, financial institutions and
investors, service-users, NGOs and community-based organizations. UNICEF helped to prepare the
project component relating to extension of WS&S services to low income areas, detailed in the
operational manual. Section E7 presents a table on the participatory approach, listing stakeholders and
the type of input they had: information sharing, consultation, or collaboration. However, there is little
detail provided regarding the substance of those consultations, and in particular whether prospective
service users expressed demand for new sewerage services. We now know that collaboration with various
stakeholders can yield specific outputs and feedback that may help in assessing overall demand for
project benefits.

2.1.2.4 Economic Analysis. The benefits of the project were equated to households' willingness to pay
for improved services, which itself was not evaluated through a survey, but estimated as a percentage (on
average 5%) of household income, based on similar data gathered in other countries. In hindsight, it
appears that it would have been useful to evaluate actual demand for improved services and connections
to new sewerage networks ­ i.e. willingness to connect - in order to better assess project benefits.
Comparing the affordability for households of maintaining existing sanitation systems (mostly septic
tanks) vs. connecting to new sewerage systems, given the projected connection costs and internal
plumbing costs, would have provided a key input to project and policy design. While the PAD made a
mention of these issues in connection with the Misiones sub-project (p.23), the analysis apparently
disregarded internal plumbing costs and assumed that all households newly habilitated to connect to the
sewerage service would in fact connect ­ which did not happen, as will be seen in section 2.2. Demand
for new connections was therefore overestimated, and the full economic benefits of the project may
remain at least partially unrealized due to the non-connection of a significant number of households to
newly available sewerage networks.




                                                       13

A more accurate assessment of households' willingness to connect would have allowed for better follow-
up on the project's stated intent to support the design of a social tariff and subsidy mechanism, along with
targeting mechanisms and price caps on connection charges, which were stipulated in the summary
guidelines for regulatory models and concession contracts. Indeed, in at least two of the sub-projects,
connection charges appear to be prohibitively high. For the future, technical assistance components might
include the design of a coherent social and subsidy strategy for tariffs and connections, as an explicit and
separate activity.

2.1.2.5 Institutional Design. Institutional arrangements were somewhat complex, with a national-level
implementing agency (ENOHSA) overseen by the SNRSD and required to work with the COFESA
(Federal Council for Sanitation) to coordinate with the provinces on matters relating to sector policy and
resources allocation. For each sub-project, a sub-executing agency and sometimes a third agency was
involved (in the case of Posadas, the province was the sub-borrower but the concessionaire was the
executing agency). Added to these strata were the regulatory entities (one per sub-project) and
contractors. As a result, responsibilities may have been too vaguely defined, especially with regard to the
origin of counterpart funds, the oversight of works and importantly, the setting of sector policy.

In spite of the recognition that hasty reforms and the lack of adequate regulatory structures were risk
factors, the timetable for this project was very ambitious (2 years for 5 utilities). Expectations regarding
the speed of reform programs and the establishment of new regulatory frameworks were probably overly
optimistic.

The project was to be managed under the guidance of the SNRSD, which would also carry out policy
formulation and coordination with provincial governments, assisted by ENOHSA, the financial and
implementing agency. The Project Management Unit established in ENOHSA initially was to be staffed
with a coordinator backed up by a team of eight consultants, whose terms of reference were defined in the
POM. Later, however, the PMU was staffed from within the organization rather than with exterior
consultants, a choice that was meant to prolong the benefits of the project's training and technical
assistance within the organization.

ENOHSA's mandate is to implement public works and it has a limited role in setting sector policies and
guidelines, which made it an unnatural partner/manager for reform-oriented technical assistance activities.
Moreover, ENOHSA has become an executing agency for a large portfolio of investments: as a result
there are bottlenecks and the technical departments within ENOHSA are reportedly saturated. Ideally,
such a reform-oriented investment project would be executed by an entity that holds a mandate for both
policy-setting and investment planning. Investments would then be allocated according to a coherent
strategy that would simultaneously consider issues of access to services (including economic access and
affordability), quality of services and efficiency in the delivery of services.

2.1.2.6 Assessment of Risks. The project documents listed a number of risks, many of them rated
substantial, such as limited interest from local and international investors in the WS&S sector in
Argentina, opposition to privatization from the population, politicians and unions, and the failure to
address the culture of non-payment of water. These risks were to be mitigated through the preparation of
well-designed PSP bidding documents and contracts, availability of Bank financing in the first five years
for each utility, marketing and moderate expectations and "adequate mechanisms to address the issue of
the urban poor".

However, it appears that three key risks were either underestimated or not considered: 1) the risk of a
changing macroeconomic environment ­ though the country was entering a recession at the time of
approval; ii) the risk of a change in the government's PSP-focused strategy or commitment to the project
strategy, despite clear signals of mounting public opposition to PSP; and iii) the risk that tariffs would not


                                                       14

be adequately adjusted to changing costs during project execution, despite the lack of experience in
Argentina with tariffs closely following operational costs and the admitted infancy of the regulatory
systems to be established.

Although it acknowledged the possibility that local and international investors might not be interested in
project-supported PSP reform, the project design did not detail the reasons for such risk (such as, for
example "country risk"), and by extension it did not explicitly consider larger macroeconomic risks.
While the PAD recognized that the failure of past privatization efforts had eroded credibility, public
support and investment interest, it regarded this project as the antidote to those criticisms, if well
executed.

2.1.3 Revised Design at Project Restructuring
When the project was restructured in 2004, some of the design issues highlighted above were addressed.
The main change consisted in making the eligibility criteria for the sub-loans more flexible to allow any
provincial, municipal, concessioned or cooperative utility operating under determined efficiency criteria
to be eligible, not just privately held concessions and cooperatives. The objective of this modification
was to make the project funds available to a larger group of utilities in need of investment funds.
Secondly, the pilot investment projects for poor areas had never been designed or executed, and were
therefore replaced by grants available to eligible utilities for investment activities in poor urban areas.
The aim was to achieve a greater impact on poor communities using the loan proceeds. These changes
ultimately enabled one additional investment sub-project to benefit from the loan proceeds.

In other slight modifications, the technical assistance for PSP strengthening at the provincial/municipal
level was eliminated, and the environmental component was not modified in substance but it was reduced
in size, from US$ 1 million to 0.2 million. However, these design changes did not significantly affect the
outcome of these sub-components, as will be seen in section 2.2 below.

2.2 Implementation

The implementation of the project was affected by the following main factors:

    · The shift of government strategy away from PSP-oriented reform of WS&S utilities, leading to
         low level of government interest in the project;
    · The macroeconomic crisis that shook Argentina in late 2001/early 2002
    · Late effective restructuring of the project;
    · Disputes regarding counterpart funds (Misiones) and contract re-determination;
    · Households' lower-than-expected willingness to connect to newly available sewerage services;
    · Procurement delays and overly ambitious timetables for the execution of works, translating into
         untimely execution;

As noted in the previous section, the level of government commitment to the project was judged to be
very high during the project preparation. However, after the loan was approved in May 1999, the
transition to loan effectiveness was slow. The loan was signed and declared effective over one year after
Board approval (i.e., three years after appraisal), after a change of government and a move of the
government's sector policy away from PSP, amid growing public controversy over the Buenos Aires
WS&S concession and others. Although the new government was clearly opposed to the previous
administration's reforms and the new head of ENOHSA was explicitly in disagreement with the PDO, the
Bank's project team, with management support, remained resolute in the advocacy for the proposed
reforms and of the PDOs. The team dedicated much time to convincing the government of the validity of




                                                       15

the project's approach, in order to salvage the reform effort with a view to providing better services to the
70% of the Argentine population then served by private operators.

However, equity in access to services was becoming a major concern of government policy, and judged
by the government to be at odds with PSP-reform as it had played out so far. The loss of government
interest in the project strategy may have translated into the early and sustained understaffing of the PMU
and in the chronic delays to obtain signatures for key project milestone documents, including loan
amendments. In turn, the insufficient staffing of the PMU may have played an important role in the lack
of attention to certain components of the project, such as the poverty pilot investments and the
environmental component.

In December 2001, Argentina's economy collapsed after several years of recession, leading to a default
on external debt service. The crisis led to the end of 1:1 convertibility law between the Argentine peso
and the dollar, and to a rapid devaluation reaching AR$4 per US$1 during the height of the crisis (the
peso has since stabilized at AR$3 per US$1). The devaluation eventually helped to increase exports (and
fiscal revenues from taxes) but it also raised the prices of imports, contributing to a resurgence of
inflation. In turn, this led purchasing power to decline considerably, which affected all levels of the
economy, aggravating existing poverty and plunging many middle-class Argentine households into
poverty. Poverty levels soared from 35% under the poverty line before the crisis to 55% during the crisis.

The crisis had a severe impact on the project in several ways: (i) tariffs for water and sewerage services
were frozen to help consumers cope with declining purchasing power; (ii) utility operators holding dollar-
denominated debt to finance investment programs encountered grave difficulties as the peso was devalued
while revenues declined, due to the tariff freeze and declining bill recovery; and (iii) the uncertainty
around the peso's value and rapid inflation caused works that were in progress in Olavarría to be stopped,
and contracts for works that had been awarded before the crisis (Misiones) to be held at a standstill. Like
for all other projects in Argentina, contracts were subject to a price re-determination process factoring
inflation and other risks. The formula for price redetermination was negotiated between the government
and the Bank and issued only in December 2002, and it took until June 2003 to make the formula fully
operational (a total of 18 months after the height of the crisis).

After the macroeconomic crisis, a first attempt at restructuring the project was made in 2002, in response
to the crisis and in an attempt to assist the government through increased technical assistance to address
urgent regulatory weaknesses and the utilities' debt restructuring needs. This initial restructuring was
approved by the Bank's Board on August 22, 2002 to expand the development objectives as follows: (a)
to support the reform of the water and sanitation sector in Argentina through increased private sector
participation in the operation and financing of water utilities; (b) to support the establishment of sound
regulatory frameworks for the water sector and to address universal service and environmental issues
pertaining to said sector; (c) to support the Borrower's efforts to strengthen the public services regulatory
frameworks weakened as a result of the economic crisis that hit Argentina in early 2002; and (d) to
support the Borrower's efforts to promote voluntary corporate restructuring.

However, the corresponding amendment to the loan was never countersigned by the Government of
Argentina. In hindsight, it appears that maintaining the PSP reform objective may have been unrealistic
given (i) the critical macroeconomic situation and associated low attractiveness of the Argentine WS&S
sector to foreign investors; (ii) the weak position of existing private operators holding debt in foreign
currency; and (iii) the deepening poverty in the country, which diminished prospects for cost-recovery
while a coherent framework of targeted subsidies remained absent and the tariff freeze was still in force.
On the one hand, the project team faced a central government that was clearly lukewarm about both the
initial and revised PDOs. On the other hand, provincial authorities and private operators reportedly
expressed that this project was important as the sole source of technical assistance and investment


                                                      16

financing for sector reform, especially in light of a recent IDB loan cancellation. This rationale probably
underpinned the Bank's decision not to move toward loan cancellation at various stages during the crisis
and the initial period of recovery.

The Quality of Supervision Assessment report issued in September of 2002 noted that the project
restructuring was conducted without an in-depth review of needs, and pointed out that the Bank should
have focused more on addressing the emerging issues of PSP-oriented reform, such as social and poverty
issues and regulatory issues, in addition to convincing the government of the PDOs. It also stated that the
allocation of budget resources for supervision was insufficient to conduct an in-depth review of the
project objectives and design.

The second restructuring was proposed during the mid-term review in December 2003. As seen in
section 1 above, this restructuring sought to re-define and simplify the project objectives while increasing
its chances for successful implementation. Sub-loans were now available to all WS&S utilities
demonstrating good practice toward meeting efficiency indicators in operational and financial
management, not only PSP-reformed utilities. Grants were also made available to less well-performing
utilities that demonstrated urgent needs related to poverty and environmental conditions. Establishing
appropriate regulatory frameworks remained a key PDO, and addressing universal service and
environmental issues in the sector was the third objective. The emphasis on PSP-oriented reform was
dropped.

Despite these substantial modifications, the government took 12 months to ratify the amendment,
signaling its enduring low level of interest in the project. It appears that once funding for the Tucumán
sub-project came into focus, signing the amendment became more of a government priority.

A key difficulty in the case of the Misiones sub-project was in ensuring the availability of counterpart
funds, which were to be paid by the private operator. After the macroeconomic crisis and its
ramifications described above, the concessionaire found it difficult to assemble those funds and the
Province was not in a position to take over that responsibility due to its own fiscal hardships. This
situation contributed to a long-lasting dispute between the operator and the province, later involving the
contractor who faced great uncertainty about payments for the works executed. Eventually, the
concessionaire opted to finance the counterpart commitments rather than to exit the contract, but in the
meantime substantial delays occurred in the execution of the works.

As seen in section 2.1.2.4 above, although the project design assumed that households would connect to
newly available sewerage services as soon as these would become available, in fact this has not happened.
In Misiones, only about 400 households have chosen to connect out of 10,000 to whom the service is now
available. In Olavarria, only 1,030 households have connected out of 15,477 potential beneficiaries. The
main reasons for this appear to be (i) the existence of alternatives for sewerage disposal (septic tanks) that
do not require (ii) a large upfront cash outlay (up to AR$2,000) to pay for internal plumbing
modifications and connection fees. Although the lower-than-expected connection rate has only a modest
financial impact on two of the three the utilities, who charge users for the service once they can access it,
regardless of actual connection3, it has an important economic impact in that it diminishes the actual
economic, health and environmental benefits realized through this project.

Finally, procurement and execution delays occurred in the case of the Tucumán sub-project, which was
included after the project restructuring. The procurement delays were explained as a combination of an
unsatisfactory first round of bids leading to a re-bidding of the contract, and to somewhat slow and

3This was considered best practice at the time of appraisal and remains so today.




                                                         17

complex Bank procurement review processes. The execution delays were attributed to poor weather
conditions, unforeseen construction impediments, and a built-in delay due to an unrealistic timetable for
the execution of the works (6 months rather than 12).

A detailed timeline of the project milestones and institutional context is provided in Annex 2B.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The project was prepared over ten years ago, when no major emphasis was placed on the monitoring and
evaluation design.

ENOHSA through the PMU was charged with supervising and controlling the compliance of sub-project
executors with the operational and financial performance indicators detailed for the project (see section 1)
and to verify their progress towards improved efficiency. The PMU was also to monitor the progress of
the poverty pilot sub-component as measured by the number of new connections made to poor urban
households, and the progress of the regulatory strengthening component as measured by the number of
participants, and the hours of training per participant. The PMU was authorized to take the necessary
preventive and corrective measures to improve the allocation of resources.

The Project Management Unit established in ENOHSA initially was to be staffed with a coordinator
backed up by team of eight consultants, whose terms of reference were defined in the POM. Later,
however, the PMU was staffed from within the organization rather than with exterior consultants, a
choice that was meant to prolong the benefits of the project's training and technical assistance within the
organization. From the outset, however, the PMU consisted of only one staffer with support from
ENOHSA's other divisions, and this structure was probably too light to successfully shepherd the project.
This insufficient staffing further reflected the government's lack of interest in the project, rather than the
unavailability of funds to hire the consultants, as these funds were provided for under the loan but never
used.

The PMU prepared a semi-annual report to the World Bank on the status of the project, on or near the 31
of March and the 30 of September each year. These reports were generally submitted on time and well-
prepared, although they did not systematically track progress on performance indicators for the project.

The Quality of Supervision Assessment (September 2002) gave a satisfactory rating while highlighting a
number of issues of concern. In particular, it judged the project reporting to be weak and observed that
there was no evidence that the M&E system described in the project's operational manual was being used
by the project team, on either the Bank's or the borrower's side. Moreover, it pointed out that the M&E
system as designed was not geared to effectively consult the poor and monitor impacts on the poor, nor
did the project's supervision budget allow sufficient resources to focus on this. The ICR review did not
detect any significant change in these aspects of M&E practices in the 2003-2007 period of
implementation, noting that the project restructuring might have been an opportunity to strengthen M&E
design and practice.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

The project was classified as Environmental Category B. The PAD stated that as most investment
subprojects financed by the project would be rehabilitation of existing water systems, the project would
not have any significant negative environmental impact. In practice, a substantial portion of the works
actually financed consisted in the construction of new sewerage collection infrastructure (Olavarría,
Misiones, and Tucumán) and in the expansion of existing sewerage treatment capacity (Olavarría and
Tucumán). Net environmental benefits are observed in Olavarría and expected in Tucumán.


                                                      18

The project's operational manual included limited guidelines on environmental assessment of sub-
projects to be included in the applications for sub-loans. Staff reviews in 2005 and 2006 by financial and
procurement specialists of the project's financial management and procurement reported that these
activities were conducted satisfactorily. In the case of Tucumán, an unsatisfactory first round of bids was
appropriately thrown out and the process began anew, although this obviously caused unwanted delays.
As stated above, there was some concern about the slowness of procurement review processes within the
Bank.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

There is currently no next phase: the APL 2 has been cancelled in light of the change in government
strategy.

The works contracted for the Olavarría sub-project were completed under the project. In the cases of
Misiones and Tucumán, which had reached 77% and 79% completion respectively at project closing, it is
understood that ENOHSA will provide the necessary funding to the provinces to complete the works.

The works executed in the three sub-components are being operated and maintained by the operators who
oversaw their construction. All three operators show continually improving operational and financial
efficiency. However, as mentioned previously, the main concern is with the rate of connection to new
sewerage networks, given the observed reluctance of potential consumers to incur internal plumbing and
connection costs without substantial subsidies, and in the absence of such subsidies in two out of the three
cases (Olavarría and Misiones) for the time being. In Olavarría (Buenos Aires Province) since the
completion of works in 2005 only 1,030 connections have been made out of 15,477 potential new
connections to the sewerage network. In Posadas (Misiones Province), only approximately 400 (200 legal
and an estimated 200 illegal) out of 10,600 connections have occurred. In both of these sub-projects,
unless an adequate connection subsidy program is established, the investments may be underutilized, with
continuing ramifications for environmental degradation to both surface and subterranean water resources
caused by the inadequate disposal of wastewaters, and associated health impacts. In Tucumán, the rate of
new connections to sewerage service is expected to be higher for 25,000 projected possible connections
once the works are finished. This is at least partly due to the provincial government's proactive subsidy
policy of encouraging new connections to the service, which relies heavily on federal funding through the
Cloacas más Trabajo program. The ultimate outcome and sustainability of the Tucumán sub-project thus
depends on the government's ability to sustain and expand this policy.

Regarding the investment made in updating and expanding the SPIDES database, there is some concern
about the sustainability of the SPIDES system now that project funding has ended. Indeed, ENOHSA has
not appointed any staff to ensure the continued updating and maintenance of the database or the
associated website.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The overall objective of the 2006-2008 CAS is to seek opportunities to build a medium-term investment
partnership to support the transition from crisis recovery to sustained growth with continued poverty
reduction and improved equity. In this context, the Bank's interventions are designed to advance the three
pillars previously established under the 2004 CAS: (1) sustained growth with equity, (2) social inclusion,
and (3) improved governance. Both the initial and revised project objectives were relevant to the current
CAS as they focused on improving the quality and efficiency of water and sanitation services, which are
key in support of economic growth, on expanding access to the services for the poor, and on


                                                     19

strengthening regulatory capacity at the provincial level. The initial project design also required the
beneficiary utilities to contribute substantial counterpart funds and to repay the loan proceeds to the
Borrower (the Argentine Republic), assuming foreign exchange risk. These design features were meant
to increase accountability and governance at the utility and provincial level. As discussed in section 2.1
above, the formulation of the initial objectives, with PSP as a principal goal, became increasingly
dissonant with the changing policy environment and is now at odds with the more neutral approach
reflected in the current CAS. The revised project objectives placed more explicit emphasis on the
utilities' achievement of efficiency and on addressing urgent needs relating to poverty and the
environment, which also reflects the approach of the new CAS.

The project's emphasis on working closely with the Provinces and local utilities to improve local
regulatory capacity and financial self-sufficiency at the utility level remains in line with the approach
recommended in the current CAS.

The eventual decision to have the PMU staffed by permanent ENOHSA personnel is also in line with
current thinking at the Bank, in order to mainstream the improved technical capacity and to protect the
institutional memory of a project rather than have it rest with independent consultants. However, as seen
above, the strategy proved susceptible to insufficient allocation of personnel to the PMU, due to the
government's change in strategic direction since the preparation of the project.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The achievement of objectives should be assessed relative to both the initial PAD objectives and the
revised objectives after project restructuring in 2004. The project's original objectives were to support the
reform process in about five medium-size municipal and provincial utilities through the introduction of
private sector participation (PSP) in the operation and management of water utilities, adoption of
appropriate regulatory frameworks, and institutionalization of tariff policies and tested investment
alternatives to reach poor consumers better. Although three utilities were ultimately supported through
project-financed investments, only two of these had undergone a reform process, which had already
occurred under the previous project, Ln. 3281-AR. None received technical assistance relating to tariff
policies or to investment alternatives to better reach the poor. None of the corresponding provinces
received technical assistance to strengthen their regulatory frameworks. As a result, none of the initial
project development objectives can be considered to have been met.

The revised project objectives included: (a) to support the reform of the water and sanitation sector in
Argentina through the promotion of efficiency in the operation and financing of water utilities; (b) to
support the establishment of sound regulatory frameworks for the water sector; and (c) to address
universal service and environmental issues pertaining to said sector. Of these, only objective (c) was
partially met. Through the investments made, the project did improve the means for three utilities to
provide better services to more people, including a substantial portion of low-income households. As
such, the relevant outcome indicators are: water service coverage, sewerage service coverage, and poor
population benefited. However, the extent to which these achievements were made is a function of the
outcome of each sub-loan within Component A, as described in Annex 2. Objective (b) was only
obliquely addressed through the technical assistance to the SPIDES database, also described in Annex 2.

Both before and after restructuring, the project did contribute to better environmental conditions through
the sub-projects it financed for sewage disposal and treatment. Indeed, the only investments completed
before project restructuring (they were in fact retroactively financed at loan effectiveness) consisted of the
rehabilitation and expansion of the Olavarría sewage treatment plant, resulting in 100% of treatment of
that city's wastewaters (vs. 25% before). However, the percentage of wastewater treated was not an
outcome indicator for the project, either before or after the revision of PDOs.

3.3 Efficiency

The detailed economic analysis is presented in Annex 3.

3.3.1 Summary

    · The initial economic analysis presented in the PAD was sophisticated and informative but
         potentially mis-applied to the justification of this project by focusing on the overall reform
         program rather than on the specific investments and technical assistance proposed under APL1.

    · The questions that are relevant for ICR purposes are different from those that motivated the initial
         economic analysis given that the project did not accomplish reform objectives and did not fund
         T.A. for reform. The main relevant question is now: "Were these investments worthwhile?"

    · The ex-post analysis uses similar parameters but focuses on the economic viability of the
         investments actually implemented. A new model was constructed reflecting incremental costs
         and benefits incurred or to be incurred under the project. Ex-ante and ex-post NPVs are therefore
         not strictly comparable.

    · The ICR identifies key lessons from the project regarding willingness to connect assumptions that
         have ramifications for the estimation of benefits from the project, and in turn for tariff and
         subsidy strategies at the time of project design to permit the full realization of benefits.

    · The estimation of benefits remains tricky and the ex-post analysis modifies initial willingness to
         pay (WTP) assumptions by counting WTP only for those households who actually chose to
         connect, and discounting total WTP to reflect a less-than-100% bill collection rate.

The results of the analysis show that the economic benefit-cost NPV of the Misiones sub-project, which
represented 54% of disbursed loan funds, is (US$ 5,087,105). The EIRR is 4%, which is well below the
desirable threshold of 12%.

In the Olavarría sub-project, which accounted for 8% of the disbursed loan funds, the analysis yields a net
cost of US$ 204,272, with an EIRR of 11.4%.

The analysis for the Tucumán sub-project, which accounted for 37% of total loan disbursements, results
in a net benefit of US$ 1,130,581, with an EIRR of 13.18%.

Please see details on key assumptions, counterfactuals and sensitivity analysis below.

Note that if consumer surplus is omitted from the net benefit calculations (i.e., only revenues are counted
as benefits), results of theses analyses worsen considerably, due in part to low tariff levels (recall the
country-wide tariff freeze from 2002 to early 2007) and to high cost-per-beneficiary ratios

3.3.2 Misiones sub-project

The results of the analysis show that the economic benefit-cost NPV of the Misiones sub-project, which
represented 54% of disbursed loan funds, is (- US$ 5,087,105). The EIRR is 4%, which is well below the
desirable threshold of 12%.

This analysis assumes that i) the project will in fact be completed with provincial and federal funds, by
2008; ii) all of the 12,214 households that will be habilitated to use sewerage services by the project's end
(projected to be in 2008) will in fact be connected by the year 2016. At the time of the ICR review



                                                      21

(April-May 2007) the connection rate was very low with only 400 connections actually made out of
10,000 potential connections. Therefore, for the latter assumption to hold, connections would need to be
strongly incentivized in some way (subsidies, public education, and/or more stringent government
requirements).

Using the counterfactual assumption in which all households habilitated to connect to the newly expanded
sewerage service at the completion of the project actually connect at that time, the NPV improves
markedly to become (-US$ 1,790,496), with an EIRR of 9%. This illustrates clearly the impact that less-
than-full connection rates have on the realization of benefits. However, under the base case assumptions,
net benefits remain negative due in part to a high cost/beneficiary ratio.

Sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine the switch values (values at which NPV becomes
positive) for several important numerical assumptions. The results are summarized in the table below.

3.3.3 Olavarría sub-project

The analysis for this sub-project, which accounted for 8% of the disbursed loan funds, yields a net cost of
US$ 204,272, with an EIRR of 11.4%. The analysis assumes that all of the 15,477 households habilitated
to use sewerage services will in fact be connected by the year 2015. As in the case of Misiones, this
would require a proactive effort on the part of the utility and the government (local and/or federal) to
encourage households to connect. Indeed, at the time of the ICR review, only 1,030 households had
actually connected. Recall that overall benefits are underestimated as the environmental and health
benefits of treating 100% of effluent (instead of 25% before the project) are not fully quantified.

A counterfactual analysis assuming full connection to the service at project completion increases the net
benefit of the project to US$ 409,401, yielding an EIRR of 13%.

A third analysis explores the case in which no additional connections will be made after 2007. This
results in a net cost of $1,765,763 (EIRR is not applicable, as costs always outweigh benefits). Although
extreme, this scenario illustrates what can happen if the public simply will not connect to the service, for
reasons of preference or cost.

3.3.4 Tucumán sub-project

The analysis for this sub-project, which accounted for 37% of total loan disbursements, results in a net
benefit of US$ 1,130,581, with an EIRR of 13.18%. This analysis assumes that 29,0004 users newly
habilitated to receive sewerage services will in fact be connected by the year 2011, if the utility is able to
connect on average 7,000 per year through the Claocas más Trabajo subsidy program, which is supported
by the federal government.

A counterfactual analysis assuming full connection to the service at project completion more than doubles
the net benefit of the project to US$ 2,310,566, yielding an EIRR of 14.63%.

A second counterfactual analyzes the situation in which actual connections occur at a much slower rate
than currently planned, reaching 100% of habilitated users by 2019. In this case, there is a net cost of
US$ 925,180, with an EIRR of 11%. The overall more positive results for this sub-project are due in part
to a larger number of beneficiaries relative to project cost, leading to a lower cost per beneficiary ratio5.
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine the switch values for several important numerical
assumptions. The results are summarized below.




425,000 households (150,000 inhabitants) will be habilitated to receive sewerage service. An additional 4,000
households may opt to connect illegally and would be charged for the service, bringing the total number of
habilitated households to 29,000.

5However, costs may be underestimated due to lack of data on secondary network costs (built through Cloacas más
Trabajo), associated investment costs and incremental O&M costs, which were not provided by the utility and were
hence estimated.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Unsatisfactory

Per ICR guidelines, the assessment of the project outcome is made against both original and revised
objectives, as the average of separate outcome ratings weighted in proportion to the share of the loan
disbursements made in the periods before and after approval of the revision. As seen below, the ratings
did not change enough between the two periods to warrant such a calculation.

A detailed analysis of the outputs by component is presented in Annex 2.

Component 1: Investment Subprojects. (US$23.5 committed before restructuring; US$21.7 committed
after restructuring; US$23.95 disbursed by March 2007). This component is rated unsatisfactory before
project restructuring, due to slow procurement and to the inadequate evaluation of consumer demand for
sewerage connections, which poses a risk that investments will not be fully utilized. In addition, there
was almost no activity on Part C of the component, addressing service improvements for the urban poor.
These factors seriously impeded the component's achievement of project objectives, its efficiency and its
relevance. These effects are somewhat mitigated by the positive environmental impacts of the
rehabilitation and expansion of the wastewater treatment facility in Olavarría, which contributed to a
substantial decrease in contamination in the river Tapalqué6.

After project restructuring, the component's performance improved slightly with the addition of the
Tucumán sub-project, where urgent water and sanitation needs for the urban poor were partially
addressed and connections to the new sewerage disposal capacity will be partly aided by a comprehensive
government subsidy program (un-related to this project). However, substantial problems with counterpart

6Water quality monitoring between 1993 and 2002 by the Municipality of Olavarría and the Facultad de Ingeniería
de la Unicén shows a drastic improvement in water quality downstream of the rehabilitated treatment plant, where
water could now even be made potable using conventional treatment, and several recreational areas along the banks
of the river are safe to use once again.




                                                       24

funds, procurement and execution delays caused both the Misiones and Tucumán sub-projects to reach
project closing without being completed. For this reason, the rating is moderately unsatisfactory to
unsatisfactory. Overall, the component is therefore rated Unsatisfactory.

Component 2: Institutional Strengthening (US$5.2 million committed before restructuring; US$2.8
million committed after restructuring; US$0.28 million disbursed). These activities were mostly neglected
due to the government's shift away from PSP-oriented reform of water and sanitation utilities, and to a
prevailing sentiment within government agencies at the time against hiring consultants for any type of
work instead of using in-house capacity. As a result, there were no national budget allocations made to
these activities, except for SPIDES. This component is rated Unsatisfactory.

Component 3: Environmental Actions. (US$0.8 committed before project restructuring; US$0.2
committed after project restructuring; $0 disbursed). No funds were disbursed for this component. The
government never took interest in this activity, and the PMU was consequently never encouraged to
pursue it. Moreover, the macroeconomic crisis of 2001/2002 and the subsequent project restructuring
further pushed this activity to the back burner as the priority laid with completing the investment sub-
projects. This component is rated Highly unsatisfactory.

Several of the outcome indicators (both before and after project restructuring) were rendered moot by the
fact that the project did not ultimately support the technical assistance activities that would have affected
those indicators, through improved management and regulatory oversight. Any change in those indicators
therefore cannot be attributed to the project. However, any progress in those indicators is of course good
news, as it suggests in some measure the relative sustainability of investments made.

Indicators that remain relevant given the project components that were actually implemented are:
    · Water service coverage (utility-level) ­ see table in section 4 below.
    · Sewerage service coverage (utility-level) - see table in section 4 below.
    · Poor population benefited (program-level): approximately 109,074 have benefited so far from
         service improvements (Tucumán) and new service connections (Misiones, Tucumán and
         Olavarría). A total of 214,132 would benefit if and when all planned connections to new
         sewerage services are actually made.

As a result of the above analysis, the ICR rates the overall outcome for this project as Unsatisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The pro-poor pilot investment sub-component in the initial project was never implemented, but the
revised project allowed for traditional water and sewerage rehabilitation and expansion investments to be
made in poor urban areas. The project has so far benefited approximately 99,300 low-income residents in
Tucumán (of which 4,700 have benefited from new connections to water service), 8,400 in Misiones, and
1,400 in Olavarria for a total of 109,074, which is higher than the 50,000 target included in the program
performance indicators for the end of APL1.

The main concern in terms of poverty impact regards the affordability of new sewerage connections in
Misiones and Olavarría, where the number of actual new connections to the expanded sewerage service is
much lower than the number of possible new connections. In the absence of a coherent subsidy policy to
ensure that households connect to the service, the environmental and social benefits of the project cannot
be fully realized and the poor have less access to the expanded services.



                                                      25

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening)

The project was not ultimately able to directly affect institutional change through new PSP-oriented
reform or otherwise. Limited institutional strengthening occurred through the update and expansion of
the SPIDES database (as detailed in Annex 2). In all three cases, the regulatory entities appear weak, with
limited enforcement powers and continued dependence upon provincial authorities for setting standards
and tariffs.

The project, through the investments it funded, did aid the concessionaires in Misiones (SAMSA) and in
Olavarría (COOPELECTRIC) and the semi-autonomous utility in Tucumán (SAT) to improve services
and expand service coverage in some measure. In that sense, those service providers have purportedly
been able to boost customer confidence and satisfaction, and hence their own credibility with the
provinces, the federal authorities and the public.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

In the case of Misiones, authorities report that there is not a corresponding growing capacity to treat
effluent as more of it is disposed through the new sewerage system into the river Paraná, thus potentially
leading to increased contamination of the river.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

A survey of project beneficiaries has not been conducted as part of this ICR review. Such a survey would
be useful as a demand assessment tool to develop targeted connection subsidy programs combined with
the appropriate incentives to encourage consumers to connect to the new sewerage disposal networks
made available by the project, thus improving project outcome.

Informal consultations were held with representatives of service users in Olavarría and in Misiones as part
of this ICR review. In the case of Olavarría, user representatives expressed high satisfaction with
COOPELECTRIC's service and their principal complaint concerns the fact that COOPELECTRIC does
shut off water services to customers who do not pay their bills. In the case of Misiones, user
representatives expressed satisfaction with the improvements in service levels and their main concern
regards disruptions to city traffic caused by long delays in closing up open streets after repairs are
completed. There is also a clear remnant of mistrust toward SAMSA as a private operator.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Significant

The development outcomes we wish to sustain concern the improved and expanded facilities and
networks produced by works financed in Olavarría, Misiones and Tucumán. As mentioned in Annex 2
and in section 3.4 above, in both Misiones and Tucumán, works were not completed before project
closure, leading to some uncertainty as to the source of additional funds that will be used to complete
these projects. In principle, ENOHSA and the provinces are reaching agreements and the works are
expected to be completed in this calendar year (2007).

However, the realization of the full benefits will depend on (i) the financial sustainability and efficient
operation of each utility; (ii) government ownership and commitment at the provincial and federal level to
make connections to new sewerage services possible for all households for whom the connection has been
made technically possible, through appropriate, well-targeted and coherent subsidy policies; and (iii) a
renewed commitment from provincial and federal government entities to support institutional


                                                      26

strengthening in the sector, especially with regard to regulatory activities and productive partnerships
between the operating utilities and the overseeing authorities.

The financial sustainability appears very good in the case of Olavarría's COOPELECTRIC, but it is in
question in the case of Misiones' SAMSA and of Tucumán's S.A.T. Financial and operational efficiency
indicators for the utilities are summarized in the table below. The government's ownership and
commitment to devise appropriate, well-targeted and coherent subsidy policies in order to increase
connection rates to newly available sewerage networks is unclear. Although there appears to be an
awareness of the problem, there does not appear to be a concerted strategy at the federal level, and at the
provincial, the Province of Tucumán is tackling this problem actively while the province of Misiones is
just beginning to consider it. There is no action on this front at the level of the municipality of Olavarría.
Finally, there is currently no active national strategy to renew efforts to strengthen regulatory capacity at
the provincial level.

In addition to the above considerations, appropriate measures will be necessary to ensure that the
increased capacity for wastewater disposal generated under the project is accompanied by the appropriate
capacity for wastewater treatment to avoid further environmental contamination.

Finally, there are serious concerns about the sustainability of the SPIDES database since there is no team
in place to maintain the database or the website, now that the project is closed and no replacement
funding has been allocated to this activity by ENOHSA.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Bank preparation of the project followed the successful Water Supply II project (Ln. 3281-AR) and
provided support to the Government's PSP-oriented reform strategy at that time. Preparation activities
were extensive, with a clear effort at addressing newly emerging problems with PSP reform. However,
with the benefit of hindsight, certain features of project analysis and design presented shortcomings,
which in turn provide useful lessons, as seen in section 2.1 above. The total preparation budget, at
US$533,881, is considered relatively high.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Project supervision was competent with an effort on the part of the Bank team to be responsive and to
restructure the project to support the government during and after the macroeconomic crisis. Performance
reporting on the project was candid throughout. Over the 10-year life of the project from identification to
closing, the project had a total of three task managers.

A total of 21 supervision missions were conducted over the life of the project, and although considerable
resources were spent to supervise it (over US$580,000), it appears that insufficient resources and staff
were allocated to address the implementation issues of the environmental component (throughout the life
of the project) and the poverty sub-component (in its initial form before the 2004 restructuring). As seen
in section 2.3 above, there was insufficient use of the monitoring and evaluation system designed and
presented in the project operational manual, and the M&E system was deficient in monitoring social and
environmental issues.

The supervision tasks were rendered difficult by the government's early and sustained loss of interest in
the project despite Bank efforts to redirect it. However, the Bank could also have been more responsive
and proactive in the face of clear difficulties in launching the project once it belatedly became effective in
mid-2000. While the government had apparently moved away from PSP-led reform by that time, a
restructuring proposal was not submitted until 2002. The main proposed changes to the project were to (i)
support the Borrower's efforts to strengthen the public services regulatory frameworks weakened as a
result of the economic crisis that hit Argentina in early 2002; and (ii) to support the Borrower's efforts to
promote voluntary corporate restructuring. In hindsight, it appears that these modifications did not
respond enough to the drastically changed policy, macroeconomic and social environment that prevailed
in 2002. An earlier restructuring away from PSP-centered reform, without sacrificing efficiency
objectives, might have led to improved outcomes.

The restructuring that was eventually approved both by the Bank and the Government allowed the project
to ultimately have a much greater impact on the poor by benefiting an additional 99,000 low-income
residents in Tucumán (so far, with an additional 68,150 projected). In addition, most of the funds
committed for investments were eventually disbursed7. However, even after restructuring there was little
or no progress made on the environmental component of the project. The execution of the Tucumán sub-
component was apparently ascribed to an overly optimistic schedule in order to fit into the project
schedule, and in hindsight may have been better executed in smaller packages or as a smaller sub-project
altogether. Procurement processes were reportedly slow on the Bank side as well as the borrower's.

In light of the above, and due to the limited action taken to address the mismatch between sewerage
investments made and the actual coverage expansion, the Bank's supervision is rated moderately
unsatisfactory. This mismatch is attributed to lower-than-expected connection rates by users and to the
stranded works left at project closing despite repeated closing date extensions.




7However, the funds ultimately disbursed achieved a more limited scope of investments than initially anticipated,
partly as a result of contract price adjustments following the resurgence of inflation during and after the
macroeconomic crisis.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The Bank team at preparation worked hard to produce a strategically complex project when PSP-oriented
reform was still considered to be the main tool available to improve utility performance, yet new
problems were emerging such as how to address services for the poor and regulatory difficulties within a
PSP context. Although the macroeconomic crisis that erupted in December 2001 played a key role in
shaping the ultimate outcome of the project, it also exacerbated pre-existing structural issues in the project
design. The successive supervision teams contributed to reaching the modest development outcomes that
were eventually achieved by taking steps to restructure the project after the crisis. However, the
restructuring probably came as too little, too late. Due to the unsatisfactory rating for the project
outcome, and the ratings above for quality at entry and supervision, the overall Bank performance is rated
as moderately unsatisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

There were clearly difficulties in the dialogue between the national government and the Bank in finding
alternative ways to move away from an enhanced PSP reform in the water sector. This was in part in
view of the difficulties the national government has been facing in defining a sustainable strategy for the
sector which was reflected in a passive stance toward the project. This is partly explained by the fact that
the government had much to contend with during and after the crisis. The Bank's reluctance at the time to
move away from PSP as the preferred policy tool to reform the sector certainly compounded this
situation.

The government's stated priority to ensure universal service and improved equity in the delivery of
services could be better supported by a coherent financial and subsidy targeting strategy. After the
restructuring ultimately took place, and despite sustained efforts from the Bank team to help the
government articulate its strategy for the sector, no true strategy emerged that had firm government
backing.

The provincial governments were not able to truly empower the regulatory entities that were established
for the sector. In the case of Misiones, relations between the provincial government and the operator
remain strained despite admitted improvements to the service relative to pre-concession times. The
provincial government has only recently allowed for tariff increases to enable the operator to begin
covering costs.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies' Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

ENOHSA consistently did not allocate the necessary resources to the implementation of this project,
reflecting the government's move away from its development objectives. The structure of the Project
Management Unit proved less than ideal to support the project, and high initial turnover at ENOHSA
made it additionally difficult to get traction. From the outset, the PMU consisted of only one staffer with
support from ENOHSA's financial and technical divisions, and this structure was too light to successfully
shepherd the project. Indeed, in the absence of necessary budget allocations the PMU was not able to



                                                      29

execute the poverty pilot component, the environmental component and most of the technical assistance
activities. It was also unable to engage in beneficiary/stakeholder consultations.

Despite being understaffed and receiving limited support from the organization's upper echelons, the
PMU showed diligence in reporting, especially in later years when the project was finally making modest
progress. The financial management of the project by the PMU was of good quality, and the PMU
reported candidly and honestly about any problems encountered, while proactively seeking solutions. As
seen in section 2.3 above, however, the PMU did not make use of the M&E system established for the
project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The overall performance of the Borrower is rated moderately unsatisfactory because the macroeconomic
crisis that affected the country in 2002-2003 provides mitigating circumstances for its overall largely
unsatisfactory performance. Indeed, the national government and the executing agency knowingly
adopted a passive approach to the project rather than attempting to re-direct it in a proactive manner, in
partnership with the Bank team. This resulted in the inefficient use of time and resources that might have
been put to more beneficial use elsewhere.

6. Lessons Learned

The main lessons learned are the following:

Lesson One: Clearly distinguish between means versus ends in the definition of project objectives.
Lack of clarity regarding the project objectives versus the tool to achieve those objectives had
ramifications for project design. Indeed, with the objective of achieving enhanced efficiency and
improved service quality and sustainability, a wider definition of eligibility criteria for sub-loans/grants
might have generated greater demand for sub-projects and in turn more successful achievement of these
objectives. As a corollary, one should always actively question any policy tool to make sure that adopting
it does not restrict potentially positive outcomes.

Lesson Two: Importance of maintaining open and candid dialogue with the Borrower about changing
sector priorities that may directly affect the project. The dampening of government commitment
towards PSP-oriented reform before loan effectiveness should have been an early indication of the need to
revise the project components. Making the terms of sub-borrowing more flexible, without sacrificing
efficiency objectives, could have helped to support utilities showing progress toward efficiency goals (not
only privately managed utilities) or addressing urgent needs for the poor. The rapidly waning public
support for PSP-oriented reform at the time of project preparation was an additional indication that
political support ­ and hence government support - for this approach was soon to decline.
Lesson Three: Evaluate the actual demand for sewerage connections (or other new service) and
anticipated cost and affordability to consumers. This project highlights the importance of assessing
beneficiary demand and likelihood of connections to new services. The existence of a partially viable
substitute for the new service offered (septic tank disposal) and high connection costs led to much lower
than expected rates of connection to newly expanded sewerage networks in at least two of the three sub-
projects. As a result, realized benefits are also much lower than expected. Using socio-economic
assessment tools such as stakeholder consultations and surveys, combined with refined assumptions in the
ex-ante economic analysis can help address this issue.




                                                      30

Lesson Four: Incentivize demand through appropriate measures in the project to accompany
investments. If estimated private demand for new sewerage connections does not reflect the proposed
new supply along with the estimated health and environmental benefits of better sewerage disposal (due
to lack of awareness, education or means), it is important to ensure that the appropriate subsidy policy is
in place to incentivize demand. The environmental and health benefits to society of improved sewerage
disposal and treatment often justify using targeted connection subsidies to incentivize connections. In the
absence of a financially coherent subsidy policy to ensure that households connect to the service, the
environmental and health benefits of the project cannot be fully realized and the poor have less access to
the expanded services.

Lesson Five: In a recessionary environment, do not underestimate the potential effects of
macroeconomic shocks to the chosen reform approaches (in this case PSP) that are highly dependent
on stable domestic and foreign borrowing capacity. Such risk is admittedly difficult to gauge but taking
it into account at the outset may lead to a more flexible and hence productive project design. At the time
of approval, Argentina had already entered a recession. In light of this fact, putting all of the project's
eggs in the PSP basket now seems overly optimistic. As mentioned above, private utility operators
holding dollar-denominated debt to finance investment programs encountered grave difficulties as the
peso was devalued while revenues declined, due to the tariff freeze and declining bill recovery. Allowing
utilities that were attempting to reform without resorting to PSP to use project funds could have avoided
some of this fallout, and thus improved project outcomes.

Lesson Six. Simplify institutional arrangements for the execution of sub-projects. To do this, reduce
the number of different sub-executors for a given sub-project, and avoid overlapping and inconsistent
definitions of responsibilities to ensure better accountability and more efficient implementation.
Specifically, a streamlined definition of the sub-executor should aim to avoid disputes about who is
responsible for counterpart funds and/or for implementation delays.

Lesson Seven. Ensure that the executing agency and corresponding project management unit have the
government mandate to carry out project goals. Ideally, a reform-oriented investment project would be
executed by an entity that holds a mandate for both policy-setting and investment planning. Investments
would then be allocated according to a coherent strategy that would simultaneously consider issues of
access to services (including economic access and affordability), quality of services and efficiency in the
delivery of services.

Lesson Eight. Work closely with provincial and municipal authorities and different types of operators
to ensure commitment and ownership at the local level. This project shows the value of working
directly with different types of operators (public, private, cooperatives, etc.) and engaging closely with the
provincial and municipal authorities who play key roles in the regulatory oversight of the utilities, in the
representation and defense of users, and in the adaptation and use of national tariff and subsidy policies.
Continuing to engage not only at the national level but also at the provincial and municipal level will
enhance the Bank's involvement in the water sector in Argentina.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

The draft ICR has been presented to the Borrower and written comments have been solicited. However, the
Bank has received no comments on the draft ICR, nor has it received any official Borrower ICR to date.

Comments during the ICR mission from members of the executing agency team and sub-executing
entities included the following:
    · Some Argentina officials felt that the Bank has a heavy bureaucracy and complex processes,
         which slow things down, while also recognizing the government's own shortcomings in this
         department. Officials also suggested that the Bank assign staff in the Bank's Argentina resident
         mission to follow the project, instead of having the task manager based in Washington bear most
         of the decision responsibility.

    · Investment packages were perhaps too large (Misiones, Tucumán)? They might have been more
         easily implemented if broken up into smaller packages.

    · The fact that different entities overlapped and collaborated as sub-executing agencies, combined
         with the lack of a clear delineation of responsibilities, caused conflicts and delays during
         implementation.

    · The World Bank was not realistic regarding the timetable in which the works could be completed
         in the case of Tucumán. It pushed for and obtained a 6-month timetable as a condition for the
         sub-grant, even though no one really believed it was possible. In the future, it would be advisable
         to tailor the size of the project (possibly dividing into or shifting into different, smaller projects)
         to the amount of time and funds available, rather than forcing a large project into a small
         timetable.

    · The components of the program were designed with overly specific objectives and very detailed
         guidelines. As a result, the components were rigid and lacked the necessary flexibility to adapt to
         socioeconomic changes in the country.

    · Despite these socioeconomic changes, the requirement for local counterpart funds was maintained
         for all of the investment sub-projects, which made the execution of the works more difficult.

    · It would be helpful if the Bank would issue its project documents and reports in the language of
         the Borrower.

(b) Cofinanciers
Not Applicable

(c) Other partners and stakeholders

Informal consultations with user groups in Misiones and Olavarría highlighted the following comments:

    · Service levels have improved in Olavarría and Misiones;
    · In Misiones, there is concern about private operators not being able to address the service needs
         of the poor;
    · In Olavarría, there is concern about the utility now shutting off service to users who are
         delinquent on their bills.
    · In Olavarría, some users (who are also shareholders of the cooperative) find it inappropriate that
         the cooperative hold dollar-denominated debt.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Summary of ratings by component:

Component 1. Investment sub-projects:

         Before project restructuring: Unsatisfactory
         After project restructuring: Moderately Unsatisfactory to Unsatisfactory

Component 2. Institutional strengthening: Unsatisfactory

Component 3. Environmental actions: Unsatisfactory

Component 1: Investment Subprojects. (US$23.5 committed before restructuring; US$21.7 committed
after restructuring; US$23.95 disbursed by March 2007.)

This component is rated unsatisfactory before project restructuring, due to slow procurement and to the
inadequate evaluation of consumer demand for sewerage connections, which poses a risk that investments
will not be fully utilized. In addition, there was almost no activity on Part C of the component,
addressing service improvements for the urban poor. These factors seriously impeded the component's
achievement of project objectives, its efficiency and its relevance.

After project restructuring, the component's performance improved slightly with the addition of the
Tucumán sub-project, where urgent water and sanitation needs for the urban poor were addressed and
connections to the new sewerage disposal capacity will be partly aided by a comprehensive government
subsidy program. However, substantial problems with counterpart funds, procurement and execution
delays caused both the Misiones and Tucumán sub-projects to reach project closing without being
completed. For this reason, the rating is moderately satisfactory to unsatisfactory.

Overall, the component is therefore rated Unsatisfactory.

Part A. Sub-project 1: Misiones Concession (SAMSA)
(Grant; US$ 15 million commitment; US$13 million disbursed)

This sub-project was conceived as a grant from the national government to the province as a
compensation for the exacerbated needs for proper sewerage evacuation in the Posadas area created by
the international Yacyreta dam project. The private operator was to contribute the counterpart funds and
oversee the works, which consisted of the expansion of water supply and wastewater networks. The
works were not completed under the project (77% completion at 7/31/06) but are to continue under
funding from the province and national government (negotiations are ongoing as to relative share of
costs). The initial timetable for the works was 18 months and works began on 4/25/03, but were still not
completed by 3/31/07. US$13 million were disbursed out of the US$ 15 million committed loan amount.
The contract price was re-determined six times (including once before signature of the contract), rising
from AR$ 20,949,000 in November 2001 when the Argentina peso was convertible 1:1 to the US dollar,
to AR$ 71,321,236 (= US$23.77 million) in January 2006.

The execution of works suffered very long delays due to (i) delays in decision-making caused by
multiplicity of legal agreements (between ENOHSA and Province, between Province and Concessionaire,
and between Concessionaire and contractor) (ii) disputes between the province and SAMSA regarding
the payment of counterpart funds (initially 40%, then 25% of sub-project amount); (iii) compounded by
the freezing of tariffs in 2002 during the macroeconomic crisis until January 2007. In addition, there is a


                                                     34

sentiment (difficult to document) that there was possible leniency of the government towards the
contractor regarding the enforcement of the timetable, in the interest of ongoing relationships on other
contracts and due to mistrust toward the private operator. Note that contrary to the design specified for
the Water Sector Reform project, the works financed in Posadas under this project were not planned,
requested or designed by the concessionaire, but included in the contract as a pre-existing investment
obligation. No economic analysis is documented for the specific works undertaken in Misiones.

The works have allowed 1,600 new users to connect to water services, and theoretically made it possible
for 10,600 households to connect to the sewerage network. However, only 200 households have
connected legally so far, and an estimated additional 200 have connected illegally (i.e., without paying
connection fees and registering on the cadastre). There are strong concerns about the very low demand
for connections, which is explained mainly by high connection costs and the pre-existence of alternative
sanitation solutions, mainly the use of septic tanks. The connection costs are currently AR$600 per
household (payable to SAMSA), not including internal plumbing cost, which can be as high as $2,500
due to the configuration of lots, existing sanitation facilities and local topography. Furthermore, under an
agreement with the municipality and the province, septic tank maintenance trucks are charged a reduced
dumping fee by agreement with the province, thus enjoying a subsidy that is passed on to consumers in
the form of lower prices. This further reduces consumers' incentives to switch from septic tanks to
sewerage connections. The province is just now launching a program to provide subsidized financing of
internal plumbing costs for sewerage connections up to $1,000 per household (with all households
eligible). However, this scheme may still leave access to the sewerage network out of the reach of many,
especially the poor. Note that the concession contract does not appear to cap the connection charge (or
infrastructure charge), as stipulated in the PSP reform guidelines of the project.

After a lengthy dispute between the province and the concessionaire regarding possible re-negotiation of
the concession contract to compensate for the tariff freeze, and the threat by SAMSA in September 2006
to rescind the contract, the situation has appeased following the Province's recent tariff increase of 48%.
SAMSA therefore continues to provide service in Posadas and Garupa. In addition to the tariff increase,
two additional factors may have affected this turn of events: (i) the expectation by SAMSA that it will not
be responsible for further service expansions (an expectation that is not shared by the province); (ii) if
SAMSA acted on its decision to leave, the province threatened a law-suit over inadequate performance in
connecting users to sewers and ensuring proper treatment of wastewaters; and (iii) the admission by the
province that it does not have the capacity to take over the management of the utility at this time, nor can
it rely on any other management model. Although the concessionaire remains in place, there also remains
a high level of distrust from the provincial government toward SAMSA, and relations appear tense.

SAMSA shows generally improved performance indicators since it began operating in 1999: 83% water
service coverage (up from 50%), 47% sewerage coverage (up from 32%); 83% bill recovery (up from
53.5%) ; 85% metering (up from 22%). There is still no macro metering and thus no measurement of
unaccounted-for-water. There is a consensus (reflected in recent customer surveys) that service has
improved markedly. However, overall customer satisfaction remains mixed due to the disturbance caused
by works that require opening and blocking streets which are then left in disrepair for long periods. The
closing of the streets after the completion of works is the municipality's responsibility, but SAMSA's
image suffers.

Part B. Olavarría (Buenos Aires Province) Cooperative COOPELECTRIC
(sub-loan approved at the outset of the project; US$ 3 million commitment, November 2000; US$ 1.98
million disbursed in total.)

This is the only sub-loan ultimately implemented through the project. The two other sub-projects were
implemented as grants from the federal government. COOPELECTRIC has been operating the Olavarría


                                                       35

water and sanitation services concession since 1997, in addition to electric and funeral services which it
has operated for many years (75 yrs for electric services).

Works consisted of 1) Sewerage Plant improvement and capacity expansion; 2) Construction of the
Colector Cloacales Sur, P.I.O. and Cloaca Máxima de la Ciudad. A third package for the construction of
sewerage collectors on the North end of the city was cancelled and replaced with another project
(extension of sewerage networks to Barrio San Vicente), which ultimately was not implemented due to
insufficient user demand. Works were completed with 48% counterpart funds from the cooperative, 52%
loan proceeds ($1.98 million disbursed).

The first package of works (treatment plant rehabilitation and expansion) was practically finished before
the loan was signed (July 2000) and was funded retroactively. The second package of works was
interrupted for over a year due to the crisis, devaluation and contract price adjustments. After additional
implementation delays relating to interferences with local railways, it was completed in February 2006.

The rehabilitated plant can now treat 100% of wastewaters routed through the sewerage network, up from
25% before the project. Over 15,400 households have been habilitated to connect to the sewerage
network. Environmental contamination and related health problems have greatly diminished, though
these outcomes are not precisely quantified.

However, the sewerage treatment plant is not being used at full capacity (current estimate is 85% of
capacity), as the demand for sewerage connections remains low due to high connection costs (AR$ 400
per connection, not including internal plumbing costs). Only 1,030 sewerage connections have been
made so far out of 15,477 potential connections to the Colector Sur. All expansion is made at full cost to
users for the secondary network and the connection, and users are also charged a "general works" fee to
cover the costs of future treatment plant capacity expansion.

As an example, COOPELECTRIC expanded sewer service to a poor neighborhood with subsidies from
the provincial government to households for the construction of the network, but even then only 11 out of
200 households chose to connect. The other 189 have shallow septic tanks that present environmental
and health risks.

The low demand for sewerage connections also resulted in part of the sub-project (for US$ 1 million)
being cancelled (San Vicente barrio residents were not willing to pay AR$2,500 per household for
investments and connection costs). The prospect of parallel projects with government subsidies may also
have created a disincentive for households to pay for new sewerage connections on their own.

The utility is concerned about having to shoulder burden of social tariffs and subsidies ­ there is currently
no province-level policy in place to assist the utility in facing these costs. The utility's management team
believes that the municipality should shoulder this cost. This issue is compounded by insufficient tariff
increases to meet costs. Water service tariffs increased 2004 by 15 % and 27.4% in 2006. There was a
28% increase in 2005 for sewerage services,. A 3% overall quarterly increase is now underway.

A weak regulator is not a problem when things are going well, but may need shoring up in case of
downturn.

The utility appears to be functioning well: it is financially autonomous (though may benefit from internal
financing of water operations by the electricity operations from time to time, keeping strict record of
cross-divisional debt), and boasts 100% metering, 85% bill recovery, and high reported customer
satisfaction. Moreover, a very effective campaign to save water has been implemented, reducing daily

per capita consumption from 550 liters in 1997 to 220 liters in 2007. Finally, the utility is repaying its
sub-loan to the Federal government (at the old 1:1 exchange rate for the time being).

Part C. Service improvements for the urban poor. No pilot investments to test innovative approaches for
serving the urban poor were ultimately implemented. A set of TOR was prepared and bid for (three years
after date of project approval), but responses were unsatisfactory and the process did not continue, despite
the government's stated concern for the impact of PSP strategies on poverty. Later the government
developed its own pro-poverty programs (PROSAC, Agua más Trabajo, Cloacas más trabajo),
independently from the Bank (In parallel, a request for PPIAF grant funds was turned down).

After project restructuring, the following sub-project was added under the new Part A.3, for
improvements in poor areas:

Tucumán SAT (grant; US$ 11 million commitment, Oct. 2005; US$8.97 million disbursed by 03/31/07):

The sub-project executor has a notable background as a previously failed privately held concession
(Compagnie Générale des Eaux was the main shareholder) until 1998. With support from the Bank under
Ln. 3281-AR, ENOHSA managed the provincial utility before it was converted into its present state in
2004. Sociedad Aguas de Tucumán (SAT) is now an autonomous commercial company with 90% of
shares held by the Provincial government, and 10% held by utility employees. It currently operates under
a temporary concession contract (considered a "concesión precaria" because it is a simplified contract)
while the full-fledged contract is being designed. The contract covers service in the entire province
except for 5-8% of population, served by small operators in rural areas.

The province of Tucumán has 1,4 million inhabitants, of which 800,000 live in San Miguel de Tucumán,
the capital. Over the past few years, immigration into the capital has increased rapidly, leading to added
pressure on the city's infrastructure. The percentage of households living in poverty is 47% in the project
area, which made it eligible to receive funding under the new Part A.3 of the project, targeting vulnerable
and poor areas.

The state of advancement of this sub-project at project closing was somewhat disappointing given the
amount of time, effort and resources spent for its implementation. The sub-project included 22 small
works packages for water and sewerage rehabilitation, which were completed by July 2006 for a total AR
$4.2 million = US$ 1.4 million, of which 75% or $1.05 million from loan proceeds). However, a large
package of works (expansion and rehabilitation of wastewater collectors, and reconditioning of San Felipe
Treatment Plant) was not completed - it had only reached 79% physical completion by Mar 31, 2007,
despite one last closing date extension to accommodate this sub-project. The works now reportedly
continue under funding from the provincial and federal governments.

The second package of works suffered delays at every stage of start-up and execution, due to a
combination of factors: the slow Argentine bureaucracy, procurement planning difficulties, uncertainty
regarding loan extension, heavy rains and field interferences. The Tucumán sub-project was incorporated
into the project beginning in 2004, but only in July 2005 was the amendment signed, allowing the sub-
project to go forward. Some time was lost initially because of back and forth within the Bank and
between the Bank and the government about the type of procurement to follow, ICB or LCB. The project
was subject to ICB, at first in 4 packages. In October 2005, only 2 companies made offers but did not
qualify to do the work in the short period of time allotted for execution, and their financial proposals were
too high, suggesting possible collusion between the bidders. The project was resubmitted under ICB, this
time in 5 packages, allowing domestic firms to bid. A Spanish firm won the bid, promising to complete
the work in 6 months. According to SAT, it was widely understood that 12 months was more realistic to
do 23 km of network pipes. But to comply with project timeline requirements (with a closing date on


                                                     37

July 30, 2006), the timetable had to be 6 months. On July 30th 2006, ENOHSA and SAT were informed
that the Bank had agreed to extend the loan to March 31st 2007 for the Tucumán subproject only, to allow
it to be completed.

The agreed works schedule of 6 months starting from May 2006 (late start due partly to delays in the
review of procurement at the Bank) was probably overly optimistic and was impeded by three factors: (i)
the heavy rains that began in November 2006 and lasted until February 2007; (ii) unforeseen interferences
in construction, e.g. passage through railways, obtaining of special permits, etc; and (iii) delays in
obtaining the large diameter pipes, because vendors were saturated with demand nationwide. The works
currently continue, at a slower rhythm because of the interferences, but SAT maintains that the
construction firm has not diminished its pace. The objective is to finish the entire project by 30 August
2007. If they are able to stick to that schedule, the total length of the project will have been 15 months,
and SAT considers that the delays were fully justified in the current Argentine context.

According to S.A.T. 250,000 inhabitants currently served will benefit directly from the improved
sewerage collector system, once completed. They are already charged for water and sewerage services in
their bill. In addition. approximately 10,075 residents currently benefit from new connections to the
water service as a result of the project, and a total of 145,000 are potential new beneficiaries of sewerage
services. Under the government's current PROMEBI program to improve existing housing, there is a
component to add sewerage connections internally, which will help people to connect and use the new
system. Thus the potential problem of low demand for sewerage connections will be at least partially
avoided, depending on the eligibility criteria for the PROMEBI program. We can hope for a positive
poverty impact from the Tucumán component, in part due to strong government support to enabling
connections to the newly constructed sewerage collectors. SAT also has a AR$20 million budget transfer
from ENOHSA to implement the "Cloacas más Trabajo" program to expand and improve sewerage
networks. They expect to have sewerage coverage for the entire city by 2009.

However, SAT is apparently prevented from billing approximately 30,000 users who are deemed unable
to pay for their water service. This represents a significant cost burden for the utility, which is not
reimbursed by the province for what it calls an "indirect subsidy." At the prospect of low-cost recovery
among low-income residents, SAT's incentive to connect additional poor households may be lower than
if a financially sustainable arrangement with the Province were in place. This issue appears to be of great
concern to the utility's management team.

SAT considers that the health benefits of the improved sewerage systems are already observable in the
decrease of water-related diseases in the Greater San Miguel de Tucumán area8.

Component 2: Institutional Strengthening (US$5.2 million committed before restructuring; US$2.8
million committed after restructuring; US$0.34 million disbursed)

These activities, as seen below, were mostly neglected due to the government's shift away from PSP-
oriented reform of water and sanitation utilities, and to a prevailing sentiment within government agencies
at the time against hiring consultants for any type of work rather than using in-house capacity. As a
result, there were no national budget allocations made to these activities, except for SPIDES.

This component is rated Unsatisfactory.
A. Provision of technical assistance in support of the operation of the PMU.

                                                        38

No funds were disbursed for this sub-component.

The Project Management Unit established in ENOHSA initially was to be staffed with a coordinator
backed up by team of eight consultants, whose terms of reference were defined in the POM. Later,
however, the PMU was staffed from within the organization rather than with exterior consultants, a
choice that was meant to prolong the benefits of the project's training and technical assistance within the
organization. From the outset, however, the PMU consisted of only one staffer with support from
ENOHSA's other divisions, and this structure was probably too light to successfully shepherd the project.
This insufficient staffing further reflected the government's lack of interest in the project, rather than
unavailability of funds to hire the consultants, as these funds were provided for under the loan but never
used.

Despite the understaffing, the PMU managed the project adequately from a financial, reporting and
procurement standpoint. Indeed, the amount of work was more limited due to the reduced number of
provinces participating as result of the first the ENOHSA paralysis under de la Rua administration and
then to the inability to use dollars with the devaluation.

B. Regulatory and sector training.

No funds were disbursed for this sub-component.
Since no new regulators came on board (the reform had been stopped), there was not much need to train
them since most of the existing regulators had participated in the UADE/WBI trainings in Buenos Aires
and Florida. In regard to operators training, if the utilities had to cut on something during the crisis (they
did not have money even for chlorine...) training could not be defended much. However, note that
SAMSA independently conducted a successful training program for its personnel as part of their take
over.

C. Technical Assistance to support sector reform.

No funds were disbursed for this sub-component. (see section 2 of main text, regarding the government's
move away from the PSP-oriented reform strategy and consequent lack of interest in this activity.)

D. Sectoral Information System . This sub-component was revised and expanded during project
restructuring, to cover provision of technical assistance to ENOHSA to develop and update the
information systems (known as SPIDES ­ Sistema Permanente de Información de Saneamiento) for the
water and sanitation sector and the utilities operating therein, including the acquisition and utilization of
goods required to update and develop said systems.

This activity was successfully conducted in collaboration with the Federal Association of Regulatory
Agencies for Water and Sanitation (AFERAS), which has separately established a benchmarking database
for utilities serving towns of more than 2,000 inhabitants across the nation. The work consisted in (i)
surveying in (2004) and updating (2005-2006) a total of 513 service providers (80.41% of total providers
sampled) to obtain data on their operations, commercial and financial performance; (ii) deriving a series
of performance indicators at the provincial and national level, which also aggregate results according to
the category of service provider (public, private, municipal, provincial, cooperative etc.); (iii) developing
a communications strategy for regulatory activities in the WS&S sector in Argentina using SPIDES; and
(iv) establishing a web-site and public communications interface to provide public access to SPIDES data.

US$0.34 million was disbursed for this activity. However, there are serious concerns about the
sustainability of the database, as ENOHSA has not maintained a team in place to maintain the database or
the website, since the project was closed.

New sub-component after project restructuring:

E. Acquisition and utilization of goods for purposes of strengthening: (a) the regulatory capacity of water
sector regulatory agencies (at the federal, provincial and/or municipal level) to be selected by the
Borrower in accordance with criteria acceptable to the Bank; and (b) the operational capacity of
AFERAS.
No funds were disbursed for this sub-component.

Component 3: Environmental Actions. (US$0.8 committed before project restructuring; US$0.2
committed after project restructuring; $0 disbursed).

No funds were disbursed for this component. The government never took interest in this activity, which
was also not championed by the environmental staff on the Bank side, despite efforts by the TTL to spur
movement on this activity. The PMU was consequently never encouraged to pursue it. Moreover, the
macroeconomic crisis of 2001/2002 and the subsequent project restructuring further pushed this activity
to the back burner as the priority laid with completing the investment sub-projects.
This component is rated Highly Unsatisfactory.

Annex 3: Economic Analysis

Summary

    · The initial economic analysis presented in the PAD was sophisticated and informative but
         potentially mis-applied to the justification of this project by focusing on the overall
         reform program rather than on the specific investments and technical assistance proposed
         under APL1.

    · The questions that are relevant for ICR purposes are different from those that motivated
         the initial economic analysis given that the project did not accomplish reform objectives
         and did not fund T.A. for reform. The main relevant question is now: "Were these
         investments worthwhile?"

    · The ex-post analysis uses similar parameters but focuses on the economic viability of the
         investments actually implemented. A new model was constructed reflecting incremental
         costs and benefits incurred or to be incurred under the project. Ex-ante and ex-post NPVs
         are therefore not strictly comparable.

    · The ICR identifies key lessons from the project regarding willingness to connect
         assumptions that have ramifications for the estimation of benefits from the project, and in
         turn for tariff and subsidy strategies at the time of project design to permit the full
         realization of benefits.

    · The estimation of benefits remains tricky and the ex-post analysis modifies initial
         willingness to pay (WTP) assumptions by counting WTP only for those households who
         actually chose to connect, and discounting total WTP to reflect a less-than-100%
         collections rate.

The results of the analysis show that the economic benefit-cost NPV of the Misiones sub-project,
which represented 54% of disbursed loan funds, is ( US$ 5,087,105). The EIRR is 4%, which is
well below the desirable threshold of 12%.

In the Olavarría the sub-project, which accounted for 8% of the disbursed loan funds, the analysis
yields a net cost of US$ 204,272, with an EIRR of 11.4%.

The analysis for the Tucumán sub-project, which accounted for 37% of total loan disbursements,
results in a net benefit of US$ 1,130,581, with an EIRR of 13.18%.

Please see details on key assumptions, counterfactuals and sensitivity analyses below.

Note that if consumer surplus is omitted from the net benefit calculations (i.e., only revenues are
counted as benefits), results of theses analyses worsen considerably, due in part to low tariff
levels (recall the country-wide tariff freeze from 2002-2007) and to high cost per beneficiary
ratios.
                                                   ***

In the initial economic analysis performed for this project, a two-step approach was adopted: first,
a simplified cost-benefit analysis was used on a sub-sample of nine (9) sub-projects to evaluate
the viability of the 5-year and 30-year investments programs that might be partly funded under




                                                    42

the operation, as outlined in the draft concession contracts9. Second, a "reform-oriented cost-
benefit analysis" on a sub-sample of three (3) sub-projects was used to evaluate whether or not
utility reform was desirable, assuming the establishment of a properly functioning regulatory
framework and taking into account the transaction costs of utility reform. One of the sub-projects
evaluated in detail was for the Posadas, Misiones concession.

This thorough analysis included an incremental analysis comparing outcomes with reform and
associated improved performance indicators and 30-year investment program, vs. without reform
assuming the status quo for performance indicators and service coverage. It also examined the
outcomes for different stakeholder groups (government, consumers, society, shareholders). It
thus shed considerable light on the potential gains of reform and its possible distributional
impacts10.

However, the simplified or conventional CB analysis performed for nine sub-projects did not
focus specifically on the prospective investments to be supported by the Bank under APL 1 -
rather, it examined the 5-year and 30-year investment programs that would be partly supported by
the Bank.11

In the reform-oriented analysis, the NPV calculation performed for each utility answered the
question "Should we reform or not?" rather than "To whom should we target investment and
T.A. support and do these investments make sense?". To justify this design and the APL 1
investment/T.A. packages, two things should have been demonstrated: 1) why it made sense to
direct funds to PSP-reformed utilities only, as opposed to a larger selection of utilities fulfilling
desired efficiency criteria; and 2) whether the investment of these funds would lead to
economically and financially viable benefits.

Strategy for ex-post analysis: future returns to incurred and future costs

As seen in section 3 and in Annex 2, the project did not achieve most of its reform objectives. In
the end, the only technical assistance that occurred under the project was in support of the
updating and management of a nation-wide database on WS&S utilities, SPIDES, which was to
assist regulatory agencies. No other funds were disbursed for T.A. towards regulatory
strengthening, training, elaboration of new PSP transactions, or any other activities in support of
sector reform. Therefore, the project's support to utility reform only occurred in the sense that
investment funds were initially channeled to utilities that had previously chosen to reform and



9 These analyses and results were not available for this ICR review. In particular, it was not possible to
obtain the simplified cost-benefit analysis corresponding to the Misiones sub-project broadly planned at the
time, nor was any economic analysis available regarding the Misiones sub-project that was eventually
executed.

10In fact, the analysis concluded that consumers stood to lose from the reform process. However, benefits
such as improved service reliability, avoided environmental costs and improved health conditions were not
quantified and would potentially improve the real outcome for consumers, though we don't know to what
extent.

11The PAD's Annex 4 is not explicit about the results of the 5-year program analysis, which was not made
available for this ICR review. Though the main text provides a figure of US$223 million for the nine sub-
projects, results are not disaggregated nor are they detailed in the annex. These investment programs
would include works not funded with Bank loan proceeds.

adopt a concession or PSP model. The transition to concessions itself did not occur under the
project, nor did the strengthening of regulatory frameworks.

From an ex-post perspective it would then be spurious to adopt a "reform-oriented" analysis
given that the project was not able to ultimately initiate or actively support the reforms that were
initially prescribed. The question being posed is no longer, "to reform or not to reform." The
relevant question is now: "Were these investments worthwhile?" Indeed, it seems more
appropriate to assess the economic viability of the investments that were in fact undertaken and
completed, given the conditions that were ultimately present during implementation and that are
foreseen to exist over the life of these investments, and given the total costs incurred and still to
be incurred.

A priori, it appears that only the simplified ex-ante economic analysis would be comparable with
the ex-post analysis. However, even the simplified analysis examines a 5 year and 30 year
investment program, rather than specific bank-funded investments. Thus, comparing the ex-post
NPV of investments actually implemented with the ex-ante NPV of the 5-year and 30-year
investment programs would be like comparing apples to oranges. The new NPV figure will thus
need to be considered on its own.

A number of transaction costs occurred during the implementation of the project that related to
the disputes and negotiations between provinces and concessionaires regarding tariffs, shares of
counterpart funds, availability of counterpart funds, extent of investment programs, etc. These
costs occurred in order to allow the planned investments to move forward. Whether or not these
costs were warranted or efficiently managed, the fact that they occurred means that they would
indeed be counted as economic costs incurred as part of these investments. Although these costs
are difficult to quantify, it is possible to estimate ­ based on utility executives' and provincial
officials' responses ­ the proportion of time spent on these activities.

Estimating benefits

Willingness to connect

An important issue with estimating benefits relates to the lower-than-expected rate of connection
to the expanded sewerage networks. Because the connection to sewerage services may not be
subsidized (as in Olavarría and Misiones, to date) and households may incur substantial internal
plumbing costs to retrofit their systems to new sewerage services (as high as $2,000 in Misiones),
households may opt out of the new sewerage service offered. The economic analysis at appraisal
did not reflect the high internal plumbing costs that households face if they choose to connect to
new sewerage disposal services. Since many of the utilities charge customers who have access to
the sewerage service regardless of whether they choose to connect, the revenues from sewer
service tariffs may still come in (at the observed collection rate, which is less than 100%). The
increased revenues will therefore count directly toward financial benefits. However, from an
economic standpoint the benefits will be much smaller, since benefits will be unrealized for those
households who choose not to connect ­ a significant number so far in the cases of Posadas and
Olavarría. Moreover, in Posadas and in Tucumán, households who are habilitated but do not
connect will incur tariff charges for the sewer services but will not forgo the costs of maintaining
their septic tanks. Their monthly sewerage service charges therefore represent a cost to the
project. We may hope that the connection rate will remain stable or will increase slightly as the
government and the utility put in place belated measures to incentivise connections. This is
reportedly the case in Tucumán, where connection rates are projected to be fairly high, but may
end up quite low if provincial and federal subsidy programs weaken or disappear.

Willingness to pay

Ex-post, we are able to observe actual payment for services through the rate of tariff collection
The benefits of the investment operations relate to improved wastewater treatment capacity
(Olavarria), expanded coverage of water and wastewater networks (Misiones, Olavarria and
Tucumán), and rehabilitated infrastructure and treatment plants (Misiones and Tucumán). In the
ex-ante analysis, project benefits were assumed to be equal to the current and future customers'
willingness to pay for services. However, in the absence of a survey to estimate WTP in any of
the sub-project settings, the ex-ante analysis assumed that WTP was equal to approximately 3%
of household income for water services, 1% for sewerage services. In addition, the analysis
assumed that households would be willing to pay approximately 1% of their income for
environmental benefits generated by the projects. These assumptions were based on estimations
of WTP for services and environmental benefits in neighboring countries. Thus the total benefits
were assumed to be equivalent to 6% of consumers' household income, with a caveat that
benefits might be higher due to greater social benefits not quantified, such as environmental and
health improvements, increases in productivity and increased employment during construction.

achieved by the utilities that benefited from sub-projects. The fact that collection rates are less
than 100% of billing may show that among at least some consumers willingness to pay (for the
current level of service) is lower than their current bill amount. However, in other consumer
segments, WTP may actually be higher than their current bill amount, as tariffs were frozen for
several years after the macroeconomic crisis (in this case, there may be a consumer surplus)12.

For these reasons, the total realized and expected revenues from tariffs after the sub-projects are
completed cannot be equated either to consumers' WTP for project benefits, nor to the full
economic value of the benefits of the project. Additional benefits are partially captured by a
calculation of the consumer surplus, i.e. the difference between the amount that consumers are
willing to pay and what they actually pay. Note that if consumer surplus is omitted from the net
benefit calculations (i.e., only revenues are counted as benefits), results of the analyses presented
below worsen considerably, due in part to low tariff levels and to high cost per beneficiary ratios.

For the purpose of consistency, and in the absence of new empirical data regarding willingness to
pay for water and sewerage services, this analysis starts from similar WTP numerical assumptions
as those used for the PAD. However, in order to estimate benefits more accurately, the ex-post
analysis (recall it will not be strictly comparable to the ex-ante analysis) modifies the initial WTP
assumption according to the above considerations: (a) assume a 50% lower level of WTP for
consumers who do not pay their WSS bills; (b) only count WTP of consumers who actually chose
to connect to the new services; and (c) count the net new costs incurred by users who pay the new
sewerage fee but still use their septic tanks instead of connecting to the system.




12Another useful partial proxy for benefits ­ which was not used here - is the amount of costs to establish
and maintain septic tanks that were avoided by those who chose to connect to the new sewer system. These
households paid for connection costs and pay a fee each month but now no longer pay for regular visits
from the camión atmosférico. The difference between those costs may represent the net economic benefit
to consumers, though it does not fully reflect the social and environmental benefits of the sewer system.

Misiones sub-project:

The results of the analysis show that the economic benefit-cost NPV of the Misiones sub-project,
which represented 54% of disbursed loan funds, is (US$ 5,087,105). The EIRR is 4%, which is
well below the desirable threshold of 12%.

This analysis assumes that: i) the project will in fact be completed with provincial and federal
funds, by 2008; ii) all of the 12,214 households that will be habilitated to use sewerage services
by the project's end (projected to be in 2008) will in fact be connected by the year 2016. At the
time of the ICR review (April-May 2007) the connection rate was very low with only 400
connections actually made out of 10,000 potential connections. Therefore, for the latter
assumption to hold, connections would need to be strongly incentivized in some way (subsidies,
public education, and/or more stringent government requirements). Using the counterfactual
assumption in which all households habilitated to connect to the newly expanded sewerage
service at the completion of the project actually connect at that time, the NPV improves markedly
to become (-US$ 1,790,496), with an EIRR of 9%. This illustrates clearly the impact that less-
than-full connection rates have on the realization of benefits. However, under the base case
assumptions, net benefits remain negative due in part to a high cost/beneficiary ratio.

Sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine the switch values (values at which NPV
becomes positive) for several important numerical assumptions. The results are summarized in
the table below.

Olavarría sub-project

The analysis for this sub-project, which accounted for 8% of the disbursed loan funds, yields a
net cost of US$ 204,272, with an EIRR of 11.4%. The analysis assumes that all of the 15,477
households habilitated to use sewerage services will in fact be connected by the year 2015. As in
the case of Misiones, this would require a proactive effort on the part of the utility and the
government (local and/or federal) to encourage households to connect. Indeed, at the time of the
ICR review, only 1,030 households had actually connected. Recall that overall benefits are
underestimated as the environmental and health benefits of treating 100% of effluent (instead of
25% before the project) are not fully quantified.

A counterfactual analysis assuming full connection to the service at project completion increases
the net benefit of the project to US$ 409,401, yielding an EIRR of 13%.

A third analysis explores the case in which no additional connections will be made after 2007.
This results in a net cost of $1,765,763 (EIRR is not applicable, as costs always outweigh
benefits). Although extreme, this scenario illustrates what can happen if the public simply will
not connect to the service, for reasons of preference or cost.

Sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine the switch values for several important
numerical assumptions. The results are summarized below.

Tucumán sub-project

The analysis for this sub-project, which accounted for 37% of total loan disbursements, results in
a net benefit of US$ 1,130,581, with an EIRR of 13.18%. This analysis assumes that 29,00013
users newly habilitated to receive sewerage services will in fact be connected by the year 2011, if
the utility is able to connect on average 7,000 per year through the Claocas más Trabajo subsidy
program, which is supported by the federal government.

A counterfactual analysis assuming full connection to the service at project completion more than
doubles the net benefit of the project to US$ 2,310,566, yielding an EIRR of 14.63%.

A second counterfactual analyzes the situation in which actual connections occur at a much
slower rate than currently planned, reaching 100% of habilitated users by 2019 instead of 2011.
In this case, there is a net cost of US$ 925,180, with an EIRR of 11%.


1325,000 households (150,000 inhabitants) will be habilitated to receive sewerage service. An additional
4,000 households may opt to connect illegally and would be charged for the service, bringing the total
number of habilitated households to 29,000.

The overall more positive results for this sub-project are due in part to a larger number of
beneficiaries relative to project cost, leading to a lower cost per beneficiary ratio14.

Sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine the switch values for several important

Overall Assumptions Used

All costs and benefits are those incremental to this project.

The real discount rate used is 12%.

Streams of costs and benefits were adjusted to constant 2000 prices.

Real income growth rate is estimated at 4% based on historical income growth rates and WB
1991-2004 data on real growth of household expenditures in Argentina. Although real incomes
may continue to rise faster among the poor than among the non-poor (as has been the case
throughout the country's recovery), a single rate is used in order to keep the assumption
conservative.

Average household income is derived from INDEC (Instituto National de Estadísticas y Censo,
Argentine Statistics and Census Institute), EPH (Encuesta Permanente de Hogares ­ Permanent
Household Survey) data for major urban centers in Argentina.

Consumer surplus, if any, is the difference between consumers' WTP (applied only to the
percentage of households who are actually connected and who pay their bills) and actual tariff
revenues.


14However, costs may be underestimated due to lack of data on secondary network costs (built through
Cloacas más Trabajo), associated investment costs and incremental O&M costs, which were not provided
by the utility and were hence estimated.

As in the ex-ante analysis, the following benefits are not fully quantified due to the lack of
adequate data:
    · Avoided environmental costs of surface and subterranean water contamination
    · Improved health conditions and positive public health externalities
    · Improved productivity due to time savings resulting from better accessibility to water
        services
    · Increased labor during construction

Additional Assumptions Used (Misiones)

Streams of costs and benefits were discounted back to 2000, when investments costs began to be
incurred.

Costs:
    · Investment costs
    · Associated investment costs
    · Incremental costs for O&M: Labor, Chemicals, Energy, Administration
    · Project preparation and supervision costs. Supervision costs of Misiones sub-project are
        assumed to be 54% of total project supervision costs, in proportion of Misiones
        investments to total investment costs.
    · Transaction costs related to disputes re: counterpart funds and execution of works.
        Transaction costs of Federal and provincial authorities are 50% of utility's transaction
        costs.
    · Secondary network costs incurred by certain consumers
    · Infrastructure (connection) costs paid by consumers to utility
    · Additional costs of connection (internal installation) incurred by consumers. Internal
        plumbing costs are conservatively assumed to be AR$1,250 per household on average
        (reportedly, they can be above AR$2,000). They are high in this area due to Posadas'
        topography and situation of existing facilities.
    · Costs of clandestine connection to illegal users
    · Net costs incurred by users who pay the new sewerage fee but still use their septic tanks
        instead of connecting to the system.

The environmental cost of non-treatment of additional sewerage disposal is not quantified due to
lack of data.

Benefits:
    · Revenues from tariffs, as a function of:
        a) Average tariff level per cubic meter
        b) Number of residential connections to water service




                                                49

         c) Number of sewerage connections made available (and for which service is charged,
         regardless of actual connection)
         d) Average water consumption levels per household are assumed to remain constant.
         Indeed, price elasticity of demand is assumed equal to 0 as consumption levels are
         already low in 2007 at 23.1 m3 average per household, or 192.5 /l.cap/day, which was
         threshold used for ex-ante analysis for elasticity to revert to 0.
         e) Bill collection rates for residential accounts.

Numbers on residential connections to sewerage service are differentiated between:
         Number of households to whom sewerage service was made available
         Actual connections, which are much lower
         Actual connections made legally (for which consumers pay higher connection costs)
         Actual connections made informally (lower connection costs); informal connections are
         assumed to decrease as a proportion of total real connections over time.

New sewerage connections are assumed to increase at a rate of 50% per year, provided that the
Province of Misiones enables a connection incentive program.

Additional Assumptions Used (Olavarria)

Streams of costs and benefits were discounted back to 2000, when project disbursements began.

Costs:
    · Investment costs;
    · Associated investment costs;
    · Estimated transaction costs for dispute resolution and contract re-negotiation were not
         provided;
    · Incremental costs for O&M was provided as an aggregate number, and applies only to the
         treatment plant; these costs may therefore be underestimated;
    · Project preparation and supervision costs;
    · Infrastructure (connection) costs paid by consumers to utility;
    · Additional costs of connection (internal installations) incurred by consumers;
    · Net costs incurred by users who pay the new sewerage fee but still use their septic tanks
         instead of connecting to the system.

We assume that there is little or no environmental cost for additional sewerage disposal, because
the treatment plant that was improved and expanded under the project has the capacity to treat it.

Benefits:
    · Revenues from tariffs, as a function of:
         a) Average monthly sewerage surcharge
         c) Number of sewerage connections made available (and for which service is charged,
         regardless of actual connection)
         e) Bill collection rates for residential accounts

    · Consumer surplus, if any, is the difference between consumers' WTP (applied only to the
         percentage of households who pay their bills) and actual tariff revenues.
         Assumptions regarding the level of WTP are the same as those in the model used for the
         PAD, and for Misiones sub-project above.




                                                    50

Numbers on residential connections to sewerage service are differentiated between:
         Number of households to whom sewerage service was made available
         Actual connections, which are much lower (note that there are reportedly no illegal
         connections).

New sewerage connections are assumed to increase at a rate of 10% per year, as neither the
municipal, the provincial nor the federal government enable a connection incentive program in
the city of Olavarría at this time. Utility officials lament that there are currently no explicit plans
for this.

Additional Assumptions Used (Tucumán)

Streams of costs and benefits were discounted back to 2003, when sub-project preparation costs
began to be incurred.

Costs:
    · Investment costs
    · Associated investment costs.
    · Incremental costs for O&M: Labor, Chemicals, Energy, Administration.
    · Project preparation and supervision costs. Supervision costs of Tucumán sub-project are
         assumed to be 50% of project supervision costs between 2003 and 2007.
    · Secondary network costs.
    · Infrastructure (connection) costs paid by consumers to utility.
    · Additional costs of connection (internal installation) incurred by consumers. Internal
         plumbing costs are conservatively assumed to be AR$350 per household on average.
    · Costs of clandestine connection to illegal users
    · Net costs incurred by users who pay the new sewerage fee but still use their septic tanks
         instead of connecting to the system.

Benefits:
    · Revenues from tariffs, as a function of:
         a) Average tariff level per cubic meter
         b) Number of residential connections to water service
         c) Number of sewerage connections made available (and for which service is charged,
         regardless of actual connection)
         d) Average water consumption levels per household are assumed to steadily decrease
         until they reach 30 m3 per household per month, due to price elasticity of demand and
         conservation promotion.

Numbers on residential connections to sewerage service are differentiated between:

         Number of households to whom sewerage service was made available
         Actual connections
         Actual connections made legally (for which consumers pay higher connection costs)
         Actual connections made informally (lower connection costs).

Annex 5: Beneficiary Survey Results

A survey of project beneficiaries has not yet been conducted. Such a survey would be useful as a
demand assessment tool to develop targeted connection subsidy programs combined with the
appropriate incentives to encourage consumers to connect to the new sewerage disposal networks
made available by the project, thus improving project outcome.

Annex 6: Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

Informal consultations were held with representatives of service users in Olavarría and in
Misiones as part of this ICR review. In the case of Olavarría, user representatives expressed high
satisfaction with COOPELECTRIC's service and the principal complaint concerns the fact that
COOPELECTRIC does shut off water services to customers who do not pay their bills. In the
case of Misiones, user representatives expressed satisfaction with the improvements in service
levels and the main concern regards disruptions to city traffic caused by long delays in closing up
open streets after repairs are completed. There is also a clear remnant of mistrust toward SAMSA
as a private operator.

Annex 7: Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The draft ICR has been presented to the Borrower and written comments have been solicited.
However, the Bank has received no comments on the draft ICR, nor has it received any official
Borrower ICR to date.

Comments during the ICR mission from members of the executing agency team and sub-
executing entities included the following:

   · Some Argentina officials felt that the Bank has a heavy bureaucracy and complex
       processes, which slow things down, while also recognizing the government's own
       shortcomings in this department. Officials also suggested that the Bank assign staff in
       the Bank's Argentina resident mission to follow the project, instead of having the task
       manager based in Washington bear most of the decision responsibility.

   · Investment packages were perhaps too large (Misiones, Tucumán)? They might have
       been more easily implemented if broken up into smaller packages.

   · The fact that different entities overlapped and collaborated as sub-executing agencies,
       combined with the lack of a clear delineation of responsibilities, caused conflicts and
       delays during implementation.

   · The World Bank was not realistic regarding the timetable in which the works could be
       completed in the case of Tucumán. It pushed for and obtained a 6-month timetable as a
       condition for the sub-grant, even though no one really believed it was possible. In the
       future, it would be advisable to tailor the size of the project (possibly dividing into or
       shifting into different, smaller projects) to the amount of time and funds available, rather
       than forcing a large project into a small timetable.

   · The components of the program were designed with overly specific objectives and very
       detailed guidelines. As a result, the components were rigid and lacked the necessary
       flexibility to adapt to socioeconomic changes in the country.

   · Despite these socioeconomic changes, the requirement for local counterpart funds was
       maintained for all of the investment sub-projects, which made the execution of the works
       more difficult.

   · It would be helpful if the Bank would issue its project documents and reports in the
       language of the Borrower.

Annex 8: Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

Informal consultations with service user groups in Misiones and Olavarría highlighted the
following comments:


    · Service levels have improved in Olavarría and Misiones;

    · In Misiones, there is concern about private operators not being able to address the service
       needs of the poor;

    · In Olavarría, there is concern about the utility now shutting off service to users who are
       delinquent on their bills.

    · In Olavarría, some users (who are also shareholders of the cooperative) find it
       inappropriate that the cooperative hold dollar-denominated debt.
