the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: clearly\n            distinguish between means versus ends in the definition of\n            project objectives. Lack of clarity regarding the project\n            objectives versus the tool to achieve those objectives had\n            ramifications for project design. Indeed, with the objective\n            of achieving enhanced efficiency and improved service\n            quality and sustainability, a wider definition of\n            eligibility criteria for sub-loans/grants might have\n            generated greater demand for sub-projects and in turn more\n            successful achievement of these objectives. As a corollary,\n            one should always actively question any policy tool to make\n            sure that adopting it does not restrict potentially positive\n            outcomes. Evaluate the actual demand for sewerage\n            connections (or other new service) and anticipated cost and\n            affordability to consumers. This project highlights the\n            importance of assessing beneficiary demand and likelihood of\n            connections to new services. The existence of a partially\n            viable substitute for the new service offered (septic tank\n            disposal) and high connection costs led to much lower than\n            expected rates of connection to newly expanded sewerage\n            networks in at least two of the three subprojects. As a\n            result, realized benefits are also much lower than expected.\n            Using socio-economic assessment tools such as stakeholder\n            consultations and surveys, combined with refined assumptions\n            in the ex-ante economic analysis can help address this\n            issue. The project supports the reform of the water and\n            sanitation sector in Argentina through the promotion of\n            efficiency in the operation and financing of water utilities."}, "docdt": "2007-10-03T00:00:00Z"}
