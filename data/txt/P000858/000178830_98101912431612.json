strengthening the management effectiveness and the\n            efficiency of GRC's operations and maintenance through\n            provision of 478 man-months of technical assistance and\n            staff training; (b) track rehabilitation and maintenance on\n            the Western line (Takoradi-Kumasi) which carries a major\n            portion of freight traffic; (c) rehabilitation and\n            maintenance of 37 diesel locomotives and 240 freight cars;\n            (d) renovation of the existing workshop facility and\n            equipment for effective repair and maintenance of diesel\n            locomotives and rolling stock; (e) new telecommunications\n            and signalling facilities on the Western line; and (f)\n            consultant studies for further development of the railway.\n            In addition, the project would provide about 100 man-months\n            of technical assistance to strengthen Ghana's overall\n            transport planning and coordination capacity."}, "docdt": "1981-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
