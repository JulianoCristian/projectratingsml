proposed loan would help finance the\n            construction of a plant in Phulpur, Uttar Pradesh, to\n            produce 900 metric tons per day (TPD) of ammonia and 1,500\n            TPD of urea. The project, which is expected to start\n            commercial production in September 1978, would add about\n            230,000 tons per year (TPY) of nitrogen to India's\n            fertilizer capacity. It would include all necessary\n            off-sites such as railroad sidings, oil and coal storage and\n            handling, ash disposal, water and effluent treatment,\n            product storage and shipping, maintenance shops, offices and\n            personnel facilities. About 170 of the 200 ha of land needed\n            for the project are being provided by the Uttar Pradesh\n            Government, and 40 ha of contiguous land are being provided\n            by a public trust. Final action necessary for the purchase\n            of the land is expected to be completed shortly. Possession\n            by IFFCO of the necessary land is a condition of effectiveness."}, "docdt": "1974-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
