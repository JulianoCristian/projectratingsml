efficient and financially viable national credit delivery\n            system that will benefit a significantly greater number of\n            smallholders than at present.  The project provides funds\n            for seasonal and medium term credit.  It also provides for\n            additional staff, staff training, technical assistance,\n            vehicles, equipment and other facilities to transform the\n            existing credit unit of the Agricultural Department of\n            Ministry of Agriculture into a Smallholder Credit\n            Administration, with departmental status.  The new credit\n            administration has responsibility for management at a\n            national level of smallholder credit funds.  Moreover, the\n            project provides for a pilot credit scheme for the rural\n            poor, which will attempt to adapt to Malawian conditions, a\n            system of group credit for non-land based economic\n            activities similar to the successful IFAD-funded Grameen\n            Bank project in Bangladesh."}, "docdt": "1987-10-09T00:00:00Z"}
