Loan\n            (DAL) will support the Government of Mexico in bringing\n            market-driven order and accountability to the country's\n            rapidly moving decentralization process. In particular, the\n            DAL will support four immediate policy objectives - imposing\n            hard budget constraints on federal resources, provided to\n            states and municipalities; reducing moral hazard in\n            sub-national borrowing; increasing transparency and public\n            accountability of sub-national fiscal, and financial\n            management; and, setting pilot mechanisms to enhance\n            efficiency in decentralized expenditures, with an emphasis\n            on health, and environment related issues. The DAL will be\n            disbursed in two tranches, and implemented within the\n            context of an ongoing International Monetary Fund Stand-by\n            operation, and parallel financing from the Inter-American\n            Development Bank. However, several risks may hinder success,\n            given the difficulties in obtaining consensus for the\n            necessary reforms, following the upcoming elections,\n            including the possibility of refusal, from some\n            states/municipalities, in adopting what may be viewed, as\n            imposition. But while financial-sector related technical\n            difficulties may also threaten program objectives, the\n            project design placed an emphasis on avoiding the need for\n            legislative action."}, "docdt": "1999-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
