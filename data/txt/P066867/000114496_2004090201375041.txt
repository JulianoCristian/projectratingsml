Dear Lic. Patino Marquez:
               Re:  MEXICO  -  (Loan  No.  3310-ME)
                    Decentralization and  Regional
                    Development Project
     Please refer to the Loan Agreement (Decentralization and
Regional Development Project) between Nacional Financiera, S.N.C.
("the Borrower") and the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development ("the Bank") dated June 26, 1991 and the Guarantee
Agreement (Decentralization and Regional Development Project)
between United Mexican States ("the Guarantor") and the Bank of even
date therewith.  Whenever used in this letter, the terms defined in
the Loan Agreement have the same meaning set forth therein.
     Pursuant to our earlier correspondence and further discussions
between staff of the Borrower, the Guarantor and the Bank, I am
pleased to inform you that in light of the special circumstances of
this Project, on an exceptional basis, the Bank is willing to accept
a broader use of direct contracting than its Guidelines normally
allow and to make certain other changes with respect to the
disbursement of the proceeds of the Loan.  The amendments proposed
below also take into account the change from SEDUE to SEDESOL and
recent revisions of the PNS Manual.
     Consequently, the Bank hereby agrees to amend the Loan
Agreement as follows:
1.   Section 1.02 (m) is amended by deleting subparagraph (i) and
     replacing it by the following:
     "(i) described in Part A of the Project and included in the
     PNS Manual (as hereinafter defined);"
2.   Section 1.02 (II) is deleted and replaced by the following:
     "(II) "SEDESOL" means the Guarantor's Secretariat of Social
     Development, Secretaria de Desarrollo Social;"
3.   The word "and" is deleted at the end of paragraph (tt) of
     Section 1.02, the period is deleted at the end of paragraph
     (uu) of Section 1.02 and the word "and" is added at the end of
     said paragraph (uu) and a new paragraph (vv) is added to
     Section 1.02 to read as follows:
     "(vv) "Escuela Digna Funds" means funds included in the
     "Escuela Digna" budgetary  line item referred to in the PNS
     Manual."
4.   The table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement
     is deleted and replaced by the table set forth in the
     Attachment hereto.
5.   Paragraph 2 (b) of Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement is amended
     by deleting the semi-colon at the end of the sentence and
     adding the following: ", except for expenditures incurred
     under Category (6) of the table in paragraph 1 above."
6.   Part C of Schedule 2 to the Loan Agreement is amended by
Page  2
     replacing "SEDUE" by "SEDESOL" wherever it appears.
7.   Paragraph 4 of Part C ("Other Procurement Procedures") of
     Schedule 4 to the Loan Agreement is deleted and replaced by
     the following:
     "4. With respect to the items in Categories (3), (4), (5), (7)
     and (8) of the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1, the
     following shall apply:

               $6,000 equivalent, and no more than,
               respectively, $19,000 equivalent and $6,000
               equivalent in materials and other goods shall be
               acquired through direct contracting for any
               particular Investment Project under Part B of the
               Project; and
          (ii) direct contracting for goods and services
               (including professional services, support
               services, and unskilled labor) for Part C.4 of
               the Project shall not exceed the amount set forth
               in the Annual Operating Plan approved by the

     (c)  works and services for Part C of the Project (other than

          particular Investment Project does not exceed $25,000
          equivalent; and (ii) it is done according to guidelines
          and a model agreement acceptable to the Bank."
