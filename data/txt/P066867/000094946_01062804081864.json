assessed as highly\n            satisfactory, with all relevant development objectives fully\n            achieved, and no significant shortcomings. Viewed as a\n            whole, a major project acomplishment was greatly to raise\n            the visibility of the decentralization issue, i.e., to\n            elevate the issue on the Mexican political agenda from\n            \"important\" to \"urgent.\" Project\n            sustainability is considered as likely. Both World Bank and\n            Borrower performances are rated as highly satisfactory.\n            Lessons learned include the following: Borrower commitment\n            is critical to project success. Implementing fundamental\n            reform is a long-term process: the lessons of international\n            experience in decentralization showed that it was best to\n            proceed at a judicious pace, and a conscious decision was\n            made to limit the scope of the project and defer additional\n            decentralization actions. Transparency can be critical to\n            institutional development impact. Publication of fiscal and\n            financial information by the states, as part of the credit\n            rating process and as required by the new rules for\n            sub-national borrowing, has increased their public\n            accountability and motivated improvements in fiscal performance."}, "docdt": "2001-06-12T00:00:00Z"}
