Importantly, the project supported analysis and\n            the foundation of key policies and strategies on food\n            security and poverty, and built institutional and technical\n            capacity in these areas. Both World Bank and Borrower\n            performance were satisfactory on the whole. Key lessons\n            included the following: Project simplicity, clear\n            objectives, and flexible design are important, particularly\n            where there are capacity constraints and rapid change.\n            Government ownership is vital. Balancing timely delivery of\n            outputs and in depth research on one hand and ensuring that\n            nationals learn from the experience on the other, depend\n            both on careful supervision and the implementing\n            agency's commitment to capacity building. Capacity\n            building projects should be sustained in order to ensure\n            sustainability of outcome. Short-term and on-the-job\n            training may be more appropriate for government officials\n            than longer-term training abroad (advanced degree programs).\n            The effectiveness of technical assistance programs depends\n            on both the quality of the program and the relationships\n            between the technical advisors and their counterparts,\n            Borrower officials."}, "docdt": "1999-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
