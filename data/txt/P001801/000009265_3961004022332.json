The project has three main\n            components. First, policy development through strengthening\n            capacity for monitoring of poverty and household food\n            security status and strategies and policy analysis within a\n            recently-established Poverty Alleviation Unit of the\n            National Planning Commission. Second, awareness-creation and\n            in-service training through: (a) support for two national\n            food security conferences, a series of workshops and\n            high-level policy seminars to create widespread awareness\n            and debate of food security issues; (b) intensive short-term\n            training courses for managerial/technical central and\n            provincial staff in analysis of food security issues and\n            appropriate responses -- including concepts/methods,\n            marketing, production, planning/management, macroeconomic\n            aspects and household access -- to be offered through Centro\n            de Formacao Agrario (CFA) in Maputo; (c) development of\n            training modules on food security topics for inclusion in\n            training courses for district and provincial staff at\n            CFA's provincial centers to be offered as part of\n            ongoing rural development programs; and (d) curriculum\n            development, pedagogical materials, textbooks and staff\n            development for the inclusion of food\n            security/nutrition-related courses at training institutes in\n            health. Third, strengthening the food security dimension of\n            university-level pre-service training programs through\n            support for development/implementation of research and\n            teaching on smallholder farming and food security issues at\n            the University Faculty of Agriculture, including technical\n            cooperation with overseas universities, faculty exchanges,\n            research funds, computer equipment, books and other\n            pedagogical materials."}, "docdt": "1993-04-01T00:00:00Z"}
