MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATON
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CRED1T TO MOZAMBIQUE
FOR A FOOD SECURITY CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
ptoposed credit to the Republic of Mozambiqu  for SDR 4.6 million (US$6.3 million
equivalent) to help finance a Food Security Capacity Building Project. The proposed credit
would be on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years. Parallel financing for this
project is expected from FAO and Save the Children Fund.
2.    Context. Household level food insecurity/malnutrition is a problem of enormous
proportions in Mozambique, affecting about half of al households in some degree and
severely affecting at least 60% of these in both rural and urban areas. In view of the serious
drought which affected central/southern Mozambique in 1992, this already alarming
proportion of food insecure households has increased dramatically (by about one-third of all
households), affecting especially rural subsistence frmers and, hence, fiuther depressing
domestic agricultural production and increasing reliance on food aid, which last year
accounted for nearly 90% of marketed and relief food supplies. In this context, achievement
of food security in Mozambique in the medium- to long-run will be heavfly dependent on
raising domestic agricultural production, especially smallholder production, as well as
concerted action to improve the access to (and utilization ot) available food, through Jin
gm: increasing cash employment/income-generating opporuies for the poorest households;
strengtening basic social services (especially health, water and sanitation) to reduce disases
which have an interactive relationship with malnutrition/food insecurity; and, transforming
inefficient general subsidies into a targeted safety net to assist the most vulnerable households.
Moreover, to the extent that rapid increases in agricultural output are unlikely given uncertain
climate and the devastation of rural infrastructure due to the war, food aid wil remain an
eenta component of food security in the short- and medium-term, with an attendant need
for efficient distribution and systematic monitoring of its impact on local production and
private trade. As the above suggests, systematic attention to issues of both food
production/availability and consumption wi1l remain critically important if Mozambique is to
achieve sustainable and poverty-reducing growth as It proceeds with reconstruction of the
economy following the recent end to the decade-long war which devastated the country.
3.    A food security strategy statement and action plan which was presented by
Government to the Consultative Group in 1990, contains all of the above elements and was
strongly supported in that forum. Implementation has proceeded in a few areas - notably in
food aid management/accounting, subsidies, food marketing, and in some shifting of resources
towards smaDlholder agriculture and basic social services - and is being undertaken by a
variety of ministries, specialized governmental agencies, donors and NGOs. While this
involvement of a range of agencies is appropriate given the broad scope of food security
needs and limited national institional capacity, coordinatioL among them is also esnta but
vitly impossible within the present institutional environment. Overall, progress in food
security remains donor-driven and slow, reflecting both exogenous constrait such as the
decade-long war and       logistical problems as well as: limited awareness and poor
understanding within Government of the magnitude of food security problems and the
fameworlkpossible actions for addressing them; the absence of an effective institional focal
point to collect/disseminate information on food security status, undera  ongoing policy
aoalysis (especially on inter-sectoral topics) and create awareness of strategies and options,



-2 -
foster collaboration between the various sectors involved, or monitor/evaluate the food
security impact of sectoral initiatives; and, the legacy of past policy emphases which have left
large gaps in the technical knowledge necessary to tailor sectoral policies/activities (e.g., to
assist smallholders) to effectively address food security concerns. These problems were all
highlighted at the onset of the present drought, when it became apparent that domestic
capacity Is grossly insufficient to formulate responses or even identify the seriousness of the
situation in a timely manner.
4.      rlet Objves. Ihe overall objective of this project is to strengthen national
capacity to confront and deter the major causes of food insecurity in Mozambique through the
formulation and implementation of appropriate food security policies and programs. Specific
objectives are to: (a) establish an institutional focal point for food security policy development
and coordination of strategy implementation as a key component of poverty reduction in the
Mozambican context; @) improve understanding of food security issues and responses among
decision-makers and staff of relevant sectoral ministries; and (c) incoWorate research on and
teaching of food security-related issues and smallholder agriculture in university level
pre-service training programs.
5.    hWee. Linked to these objectives, the project would have three main
components. FErst, oly develmnt (US$3.2 million, 39.3%) through strengthening
capacity for monitoring of poverty and household food security stas and strategies and
policy analysis within a recendy-established Poverty Alleviation Unit (PAU), a line
department of the National Planning Commission (CNP). The PAU, which is expected to
combine the main poverty monitoring and policy analysis functions of the former Social
Dimensions of Adjustment (SDA) Unit with substantial work in the closely allied area of
household food security, will be staffed with about five professional Mozambican staff and
two long-term advisers. Principal PAU responsibilities would include ni  j: maintaining a
database of survey and line ministry data relating to poverty and food security stats,
monitoring efficacy of strategies/sectoral programs in reducing poverty and household food
insecurity, undertaking policy studies to inform decision-makers, evaluatg relevant setoral
investment plans, and promote inter-sectoral debate/action on key issues. Funds would be
included for fellowships, policy studies and information dissemination to enable the unit to
effectively address food security issues. Second, &warenesi n and in-servic n
(US$2.5 million, 30%) through: (a) support for two national food security conference, a
series of workshops and high-level policy seminars to create widespread awareness and debate
of food security issues; (b) intensive short-term training courses for managerialnical
central and provincial staff in analysis of food security issues and appropriate responses -
including concepts/methods, marketing, production, planning/management, macroeconomic
aspects and household access - to be offered Stough Centro de Formacao Agaio (CFA) in
Maputo; (c) development of training modules on food security topics for inclusion in training
courSes for district and provincial staff at CFA's provincial centers to be offered as part of
ongoing rural development programs (selection and content of the modules would be tailored
to accord with participants' educational backgrounds and responsibilities); and (d) curriculum
development, pedagogical materias, textbooks and staff development for the inclusion of food
security/nutrition-related courses at medium level training institutes in health. Thlrd,
strengthening the food security dimension of university-level pDr LareiIctrojg. g
(JS$2.5 million, 30.7%) through support for development/implementation of research and
teaching on smallholder fimming and food security issues at the University Faculty of
Agriculture, including technical cooperaion with overseas universities, faculty exchanges,
research fnds, computer equipment, books and other pedagogical mateials.



6.    Project Imlementation. Project management will be coordinated by the PAU,
which will also have direct implementation responsibility for the policy development and
awareness-creation components. In- and pre-service training components will be managed by
the training institutions concerned under explicit contractual arrangements, although
procurement and accounting will be coordinated through the PAU. The PAU Director would
also as act as Project Director with responsibility for overseeing overall project progress and
resolving any substantive Issues which may arise. The Director would chair an advisory
committee comprised of representatives from the training institutions and relevant line
ministries which would meet quarterly to discuss broad policy issues associated with the
project. Project implementation is expected to take about four years starting in about July
1993. The project would be completed by August 1997 and closed by February 28, 1998.
7.    Project Sustainablilty. The project does not involve any civil works or procurement
of major equipment requiring regualar maintenance. Staff of PAU, will be paid at regular
Government salaries and provision has been made to cover their salaries from budgeta&y
sources. Faculty positions in the agricultural economics nucleus to be supported through the
project are already included in the University development plan.
8.    Lessons from IDA Involvement. The experience of other IDA operations in
Mozambique has shown that highly bureaucratic Government procedures for contr g TA
have caused substantial delays. To avoid this problem, standard contracts and simplified
procedures will be introduced upfront and a project launch seminar organized for all agencies
concerned. Earlier projects have also suffered from lack of local commitment. To address
this issue, local Involvement in project design work has been maximized by having each
institution concerned prepare its respective component. Drawing on the experience of the
SDA project in Mozambique which experienced severe start-up delays due to slow recruitment
of staff and consultants, the present project enr;red ta key Mozambican professional staff
were appointed prior to negotiations - immediately upon formal establishment of the PAU as
an entiy within CNP. Moreover, through the FAO parallel-financing arrangement, a key
long-term advisor has already been put in place. Secondly, to avoid delays as a result of
weak project administration, provision has been made to employ a full-time project
administrator prior to credit effectiveness. Thirdly, in a departure from the model adopted
for the SDA Project, day-to-day responsibility for implementation of the training components
of the project would be delegated to the trahning institutions concerned - thus reducing the
risk that PAU could become a bottleneck to overall project progress. Finally, by establishing
PAU as a line unit on par with other departments of the National Directorate of Planning,
PAU can be expected to be more effective than the SDA Unit which was hampered by its
status as an ad kQg, advisory unk, staffed principally by foreign consultants
9.    Ag.d Actons, Prior to credit negotiations Government (a) legally established the
PAU within CNP and appointed to it three professional Mozambican staff; and (b) presented
to IDA draft contracts between 0) the University and CNP, and (ii) CFA and CNP
COnCerning implementation of the respective components. Conditions of credit effectiveness
include: (a) submission of a first detailed PAU workplan with monitorable targets; (b)
appointment of the project administrator; and (c) signing of the above-mentioned contracts
between CFA and CNP and UEM and CNP. Other assurances obtained at negotiatons
include: (a) presentation to IDA of annual workplans for PAU for calendar years 1995-97; (b)
appointment of two additional Mozambican staff to PAU by December 1994; (c) convening of
an itersectora working group for conference planning by December 1993; (d)
Implementation of the two food security conferences by December 1994 and December 1996
respectively; (e) completion of at least six food security training modules by June 1994 and
training of trainers in their use by December 1994; (t) completion of a detiled research



protocol for project-financed University research by June 1994; (g) joint Government/IDA
nmid-term review of project implementation by July 1995.
10.   Rationale For Bank Involvement. Since preparation of a Mozambique Food
Security Study in 1989, the Bank has played a key role in developing an in.egrated action
program to confront Mozambique's enormous food insecurity probiems. The proposed
project, while relatively modest in scope, will complemeit (sometimes scattered) donor-
supported food security activities (e.g., in food aid distrioutionlmanagement, safety-net
establishment, food marketing, smallholder agricultural development and promotion of basic
services) by substantially strengthening government's absorptive capacity to assess
applicability of proposed interventions to the Mozambican context, analyze and coordinate
inter-relaticoships between sector-specific programs/policies and implement the activities
themselves. In this sense, the project should help to enhance the impact and country
relevance or ongoing and future food security-related activities. The project is entirely
consistent with both the Bank's overall poverty alleviation strategy for Mozambique as
discussed with the Board in November 1992 (as part of the country strategy discussion), as
well as with the broader Africa Food Security Strategy. Given the multi-sectoral nature of
food security issues in Mozambioue, as elsewhere, the Bank (by virtue of its involvement in
macro issues as well as virtually all sectors) is uniquely positioned to promote coordination
within Government and among donors in systematically integrating the national food security
strategy/action program with the reconstruction effort.
11.   rogmecive Categories and Environment Status. lhe project falls squarely
within the parameters of IDA's strategy to reduce poverty in Mozambique. Food securiy is
the most basic need of poor Mozambican households and can only be achieved through
sustained national commitment over a long period of time. By putting in place the domestic
capacity to deal with food security policy and technical issues on an ongoing basis, the project
will play an important role in medium- to long-term poverty reduction in Mozambique.
Finally, as is clear from the nature of the project, which is focused on policy development,
awareness-reation and skills development, no adverse environmental impact is anticipated.
12.  TBenefiThe principal benefit of the project will be greatly enhanced national
capacity to analyze the major causes of food insecurity in Mozambique and to design and
implement macro- and sectoral programs so as to maximize their potential for relieving
household food insecurity. In so doing, it should improve implementation of the food secrity
strategy, a crucial element of Mozambique's poverty alleviation, and by implication, overal
development, efforts. Establishment of a single institional entity to coordinate key food
security information, policy and strategic functions will help maintain focus on food security
issues and foster greater coherence among sectoral actions; and, by training civil semrats and
students at a number of levels to gain a better understanding of food security Issues and their
relationship to national development objectives, the project should also help create sustained
commitment to food security, even in the event of senior personnel changes as a result of the
uncertain political situation - a necessary condition given the long-term nature of
Mozambique's food security problems.
13.   B1ha. The project's main risk is the possible dilution of the training and capacity
building objectives as a result of low motivation and professionalism in the civil service - in
turn stemming from low educational levels as well as a weak public sector incentive structure.
This broader issue, is being addressed by the Government with the assistance of the Bank and
other donors through analytic work, the Economic Recovery Credit and a Capacity Buildidg
Project which kW  "lln seek to improve pay scales, promotion strucures etc. throughout the
Mozanbican civil service. Secondly, there are the inevitable risks associated with any project



which attempts to introduce "new" concepts to policy-makers within a relatively fagile
institutional enviropment These are, however, being minimized by designing considerable
flexibility into the project to allow for "course corrections" during implementation, and in
emphasizing the need for monitoring and evaluation in each of the components. In addition, a
mid-term review will be carried out to assess the project's impact and determine if any major
rwisions to project design are warranted.
14.   RMmmendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement and reconunend that the Executive Directors approve it.

Mozembiquets portfolio of IDA-supported projects is relatively young with most proJects being less then three
years oltd. All IDA-supported projects are managed finarciasly by the Central Bank, Baco de Mozambiquw (dS).
Previously, understaffing and the erosion of administrative procedures over the long period of the civil war
contributed to 8drm being the main bottleneck to smooth disbursements.  Steps have now been taken to
decentralize the financial management of projects to the implementing agencies through discussions with Bdrm and
through the conditionality employed under the Economic Recovery Credit. IDA is continuing its efforts to build
up administrative capacity and to put in place workable systems that facilitate project laplementation. To thIs
end, speciffc actions taken include: (i) the stationing of a senior Sank staff member in the field to help
accelerate/facilitate iplementation; (ii) the continued review of ioplementation issues via regular Country
Implementation Revfews (CIRs); (iii) training for local staff in a number of basic inplementation areas and;
fiv) the Judicious use of suspension of disbursements where evidence of non-comptiance is obvious.
