PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SOMALIA
PETROLEUM EXPLORATION PROM1OTION PROJECT
(CREDIT 1043-SO)
PREFACE
1.          This is a Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) on the Petroleum
Exploration Project, involving a IDA credit in the amount of US$6.0 million to
the Democratic Republic of Somalia to promote crude oil exploration investments
by foreign companies. The credit was approved on June 10, 1980. The credit was
entirely used after the closing C te was postponed twice by one year.
2.          The PPAR is based on the Project Completion Report (PCR) prepared by
the Africa regional department and issued on December 8, 1988, Report No. 7533,
the President's Report, the loan documents, and on a study of the project files.
An OED mission visited Somalia in June 1990 and discussed the effectiveness of
Bank's assistance with the Department of Mines and Hydrocarbons.   The kind
cooperation and valuable assistance provided by the Ministry of Mines and Water
Resources (MMWR) in the preparation of this report is gratefully acknowledged.
3.          The PCR provided a comprehensive account of the project experience,
and discussed the performance of the Bank and the project executing agency. The
PPAR elaborates on selected aspects of project implementation, in particular the
institutional building aspects of the project, and the performance of the Bank.
4.          Due to the prevailing circumstances in the country and on the advice
of the relevant country department, no comments were requested.

PROJECT PERfORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SOMALIA
PETROLEUM EXPLORATION PROMOTION PROJECT
(CREDIT 1043-SO)
1. BACKGROUND
1.01        At the, time of project appraisal, after the Second Oil Shock. Somalia
had no energy resources, especially there was no crude oil. The country's energy
balance was a chronic problem which was taxing scarce foreign exchange resources.
Demand for energy was satisfied in a typical manner in this region, mainly by
burning forest wood, secondarily by building dams to tap river flows, and by
importing the remainder. The traditional firewood and charcoal which met 75% of
the needs were in declining supply because of a lack of reforestation effort as
observed elsewhere in Africa. Available hydropower genaeration capacity was 130
MW with limited room for further expansion. Petroleum was entirely imported to
satisfy the demand. The Second Oil Shock had increased the imports bill sharply,
to US$43 million (aftet deduction of the receipts from the refinery's exports)
or 26Z of export re-;enues. There is a refinery near Mogadishu. built with Iraqi
firsncing, which processed then utp to 10,000 b/d of Saudi crude, but half of the
production was of a qual    (heavy fuel) not meeting the demand and was exported.
Half of the consumption . refined oil producto was by the transport sector in
the form of diesel (60%), gasoline (20%) and aviation fuel (20%).
1.02        Despite a chronic lack of succ-  , petroleum exploration had been
undertaken since the 1920s. Shell launched the first significant effort after
World War II. It was followed by a string of companies, few among the "majors"
(BP), but mostly "independent" (i.e., relatively more risk-taker) oil companies
(AGIP, Gulf, CONOCO, Texaco, Elf). Until 1974, extensive trading of acreages.
geological and geophysical surveys and drilling (54 wells) took place.   The
results of past exploration did not establish, however, the petroleum potential
of Somalia.  All wells were dry exeopt for one.  Sinclair disc vered gas at
Coriole in 1961, but development was judged not to be economic at current prices.
A hiatus of five years followed because the investment climate was not deemed
favorable by foreign companies. As a result, no exploration was conducted in
1978 and 1979. Project preparation coincided with a resumption of oil companies'
interest when higher oil prices justified higher risk investments such as in
Somalia.
1.03        The absence of activities for several years was detri,.ental to the
authorities because of the loss of institutional memory which ensued. This is
witnessed in the favorable contracts which were negotiated by the foreign
companies in the early 1980s. For example, Atlantic Richfield (ARCO) obtained
the rights to a large 140,000 km2 tract and a geophysical firm was able to
convince the Government to finance 60% of a seismic survey offshore. The IDA
project reconnaissance mission correctly pointed out that (a) the ARCO concession
was too large compared to the average block size granted in other cov'ntries, and
(b) the geophysical firm should have paid Somalia for the right to conduct the
survey, not the other way around. These anomalies illustrated the consequences
of lack of energy planning in the country and the need to build up an experienced

of lack of energy planning in the country and the need to build up an experienced
inotitutional counterpart to the oil and related companies ready to start
exploration ventures in Somalia. This provided the main justification for the
IDA project.
1.04        The Ministry of Mines and Water Resources  (MMWR). through its
Department of Mines and Hydrocarbons (DMH). is responsible for carrying out the
petroleum policy of the Government and for negotiating with foreign companies.
Before the IDA project, petroleum activities were governed by the Mining Code of
1970 which called for royalties of 15Z on oil and 12.5% on gas, but had not been
updated after the two Oil Shocks. Staffing and technical equipment were also
insufficient due to the pause in activities and contacts with foreign companies
in the late 1970s. DMH was headed then by a geologist trained in USSR and its
1979 budget was only US$160,000. barely enough to undertake 20 line-km of onshore
seismic survey. Strengthening the broadly-defined institutional framework was
a Government priority endorsed by IDA in its project design.
II.  THE PROJECT
A. Proiect Objectives, Description and Processing
2.01        The project's objectives were straightforward as all exploration
promotion projects processed in the early 1980s.  The goal was to enable the
Government to develop a domestic supply of hydrocarbons by intensifying
exploration investments by foreign oil companies. The structure of the project
was simple as was the characteristic of this type of lending. There were two
pairs of components, one of physical investments, another of technical
assistance: (1) the geophysical survey of one promising region (Afgoy-Coriole),
(2) the assessment of indications of oil shale deposits of Bihendula in the
North, (3) the related technical assistance to monitor foreign companies'
investments, and (4) the formulating of a comprehensive energy plan based on a
sector study.  The project timing was justified by the signature of a large
exploration contract which made more urgent the mobilization of expertise to
assist the authorities in their negotiations with experienced international oil
companies, in preparing seismic data for a promotion conference, and in revising
the outdated legal framework governing oil activities.
2.02        The project was processed in a short time. Only seven months elapsed
between the reconnaissance mission and the completion of loan negotiations (April
1980). No Project Preparation Facility (PPF) was requested, but US$80.000 were
allocated from the technical assistance component of Credit 821-SO to finance
exploration consultants until credit effectiveness.   Initially set at US$5
million, the credit amount was increased by US$1 million during preparation to
cover the entire foreign exchange component of the project following indication
that the Government's share would be difficult to mobilize (PPAR, para. 2.09).
There was no formal loan conditionality. The Government was, however, informed
that an energy policy derived from the planning exercise would have to be adopted
before a follow-up operation could be considered; this condition was not enforced
(PPAR, para. 2.11).



3
B. Prolect Imolementation
2.03        Implementation of the project had started before the Credit became
effective by using a small amount (US$80,000) from another credit (821-SO) to pay
for exploration consultants needed to assist MHWR in its negotiations with
foreign companies. The terms of reference for all consultants to be financed
under the project were confirmed as soon as negotiations with IDA were completed
(April 1980). but various delays postponed project launching. First, the lack
of IDA replenishment funds available for disbursement prevented signing the
Credit soon after Board approval, thus creating a four-month delay. Thereafter,
the delay originated on the Somalian side. The long time in getting the legal
opinion on the credit documents affected effectiveness, declared six months later
than anticipated in April 1981. The first supervision mission reported another
six-month delay in appointing the legal consultant as well as in offering onshore
tracks for competitive bidding as agreed. Nevertheless, between October 1979
(date of the IDA reconnaissance mission) and October 1981, the Government granted
directly five exploration permits, some in the prime prospect areas, without the
benefits of the advice from IDA-funded consultants, in particular the legal
advisors (PPAR. para. 2.12). Similarly, the October 1980 date for appointing a
financial officer in MHWR was met eight months after, too late to assist his
administration in the granting of key permits.
2.04        There was a long delay in appointing the key legal advisors because
negotiations with the Government's first and second choices could not be
concluded.'  While the first selection was made in June 1980,  the final
consultant was eventually hired only sixteen months later.   IDA drew the
authorities' attention to this "harmful delay", but it did not press the issue
beyond sparse communications.2 The absence of a dated covenant for hiring these
consultants was felt in this instance. The Credit was deemed effective once the
consultants were identified which proved to be insufficient (PCR, para. 2.07).
2.05        The seismic survey did not go as smoothly as anticipated. First, the
Somalian Army objected to the use of explosives given the security situation in
the country. Efforts to use alternative techniques to generate the necessary
shock waves were not conclusive. Additional equipment had to be imported only
to revert to explosives thereafter. Additional seismic works (160 line-km or
+25Z) was done in the Afgoy-Coriole area where the gas had been discovered. This
extension delayed the seismic interpretation by five months, but it led to the
preparation of a follow-up project, the Afgoy Delineation Project.
2.06        IDA insisted on compensating farmers for the damages caused to local
farmers by the seismic work. An understanding to that effect was reached with
'/ In the first case, the law firm refused to negotiate because Somalia did
not want to pay for the trip although it would have been incorporated in the fees
and reimbursed by IDA. Negotiations with the second choice were stalled because
the lawyer was unable to meet a Director of the MMWR (Supervision Report, August
14, 1981).

HHWR in exchange for including local costs as eligible for IDA reimbursement
(PPAR, para. 2.09). While 810 line-km w,re shot, no payments were ever made
allegedly because no complaints were received, hence no applications were filled.
The fact that seismic cables were cut indicates otherwise.3 IDA's recourse was
limited.  IDA threatened to postpone the preparation of the second project which
had just been started by a mission (January 1983).  To suspend disbursements
under this project would have been more appropriate, but it was not feasible
since US$1.7 million of invoices were already backlogged in MMWR, thus raising
another issue in itself.  The Government protested IDA's pressure in no unclear
terms: "Somalia will discharge its responsibilities without any outside
direction. "4  While it was correctly a sovereign matter,  it was also the
Government's recorded previous commitment' to compensate farmers in order to
modify the financing plan of the project. IDA bowed to the Government's stand,
but it drew the appropriate lesson from the experience by making a matter of
policy to require agreements in detail beforehand in future projects.
2.07        High expectations had been riding on the surmised oil shale deposits
in the North. One of the four specific objectives of the project was to test the
commerciality  of  these  deposits.    Although  the  field  investigation was
constrained (mainly for local security reasons), it concluded rapidly to the
nonexistence of such deposits. No money was expended under the US$250,000
component and these funds were reallocated to finance additional seismic work.
2.08        The purpose of the main physical component of che project (seismic
survey) was to lead to a promotion meeting with interested oil companies. The
meeting took place in Houston in September 1982 (17 months after credit
effectiveness) and was reasonably successful. Fourteen companies attended (at
a fee of US$2,500), eight purchased the promotion report (at a cost of
US$20,000), and eleven requested the bidding documents.
C. Financing Plan
2.09        Somalia had difficulties  coming up with the counterpart  funds
necessary to finance the local costs of the project, estimated at about US$1.2
million (17% of total cost). An IDA mission visited Somalia to discuss the issue
in January 1981 before the credit was effective.  It recommended to finance the
full cost, including expenditures in Shillings. Eventually this amounted to only
US$63,000 (about 5% of projections). These were savings of dubious value because
it shows that TA was mainly an offshore exercise with limited interaction with
local counterparts (PPAR, para. 2.18). Another reason for this "overestimate"
of local cost financing was the Government's refusal to compensate farmers for
damages caused by the seismic survey (PPAR, para. 2.06). While it was justified
flexibility on the part of IDA to finance local costs to get the project going,
it was less justified to repeat and amplify the approach in the follow-up project
(PPAR, para. 2.11).

D. Disbursements
2.10        Although not exceedingly meaningful given the small loan amount, the
disbursement profile did not meet appraisal projections. The Credit was fully
disbursed, but it took two more years than planned. The first supervision report
filed after effectiveness (August 1981) noted that disbursements reached only 62
of target. This was mainly due to the postponed effectiveness date. As measured
by the date of the promotion conference (18 months after project launch), the
project was rapidly implemented. Yet, the disbursement performance was affected
initially by the various delays in selecting and in appointing the consultants.
The lack of experience of MMWR in processing the consultants' invoices stretched
also the disbursement profile.  The refusal to compensate farmers froze the
US$600,000 which had been earmarked for that purpose. The early abandonment of
the oil shale investigation also curtailed disbursements by another 4% (PPAR,
para. 2.07). By the end of 1982, disbursements reached 51% of target. The pace
picked up in the following year.  Still, a supervision mission recommended a
second year extension seven months before the end of the revised closing date
(December 31, 1984) and although only US$923,000 remained undisbursed.6
Another mission, less than four months later, repeated the same recommendation
while the undisbursed balance amounted then to only US$300,000. Closing the
Credit by the end of 1983 while allowing disbursement requests to be processed
would have been more effective than to appear to legalize project delays.
Actually the double postponement of the closing date was requirtd in part by the
preparation of the follow-up, a task which could have been handled under a PPF
facility.
2.11        Despite the disappointing disbursement performance six months into
this project,  a follow-up project was already being considered by IDA."
Encouraged by the prospect of gas reserves of up to 500 billion cubic feet,
preparation  for  the Afgoy  Delineation  Project  proceeded  forward.    The
impracticability of getting counterpart funds commitment dictated a financing
plan where the Government share (estimated at US$16 million early 1983) would be
financed under the new credit. This implied 15 times more local costs financing
than under this project  for a total cost only  4 times greater.   This
inconsistency with the current project was not justified.  Indeed, if budget
constraints prevented the country to line up only US$1.2 million. it suggested
possible difficulties with the debt-servicing later.   The problem would be
multiplied with US$16 million despite the favorable terms of IDA lending.
Overlapping so rapidly two loans in the same sector without the benefit of
drawing even partial lessons from the first one was to the least financially
imprudent. Even spread over fifty years, IDA loans must indeed be repaid. The
mixed reactions of officials of the MMWR met for this Audit about the benefits
of the latter operation seemed to confirm the drawback of hastiness in lending
twice for risky activities.

E. Performance of Consultants
2.12        The performance of consultants was mixed. Although the legal advisor
was the third choice after negotiatiors with the first two broke down, the
assignments were completed promptly. The model contract between the Government
and oil companies was ready within five months of the consultant's appointment,
after consultations with MMWR and IDA. The proposal for a revised Mining Code
folloved soon. The authorities, however, made "very limited" use of this legal
expertise during negotiations with oil companies" and the new Mining Code was
promulgated only in June 1984, twenty months after the Houston promotion
corference which led to several negotiations for exploration permits.
2.13        Operations staff was critical of the petroleum engineering firm, to
the point of claiming overcharging for the amount of work performed9 and warning
MMWR about the issue.  The report submitted then lacked substantial added value
despite a large bill (US$232,600 of which 57Z for actual time spent). No action
was taken, however. Later, the legal advisor complained that its own work on the
model contract was slowed down by the lack of cooperation by the engineering
firm.    Further,  during  the  key  promotion  conference,  the  consultant's
contribution was assessed as lacking depth.10 The engineering firm also never
prepared a comprehensive training program for MMWR staff." Only shortly before
the end of the project did MMWR decide to switch to another firm.
2.14        The energy sector study was marred by a display of incompetence by
the consultant. IDA assessed early on that the consultant put too much emphasis
on constructing complicated energy balances and identifying non-priority
renewable energy projects for potential investment. Over one year after its
start, the pricing analysis, various subsector issues (e.g.. forestry, gas
utilization, electricity development), and a public sector investment program
were not ready.12  The interim report submitted three months later was judged
by IDA staff of "poor quality" with "methodological flaws" such as using marginal
cost pricing.13  Furthermore, the lack of statistical data although partly
outside the consultant's control made for a weak report. A complete version was
available in November 1982, but it called for substantial changes which had not
been made one year later. IDA notified MMWR in March 1984 (during the first
closing date extension) that payments to this consultant should be withheld until
the agreed comments were incorporated in the final version of the report. The
final report, which was originally programmed for end 1981, was available only

at mid-198S. By then it was concluded that the study was "in any case out of
date"."' This is an exercise which should hav.a been stopped when it became
obvious that its contribution to the sector knowledge and its support for the
necessary energy planning would not materialize.
2.15        While correct in being critical of the under-performing consultants,
IDA was not consistent in the way they were rewarded. The contrast was marked,
for example, between (1) the easiness with which the credit allocation for the
legal advisor was increased threefold to US$450,000 for services already rendered
(since the new Mining Code was promulgated in June 1984) while (2) difficulties
shown in for paying the economic consultant the amount originally agreed. While
the performance of the lawyers was satisfactory in terms of quality and speed.
they drew mainly from existing model contracts and mining codes as well as from
their industry expertise. By comparison, the task of analyzing the energy sector
in Somalia had never been done before and the paucity of statistical data was an
impediment. Even if the difference in consultants' performance was marked, this
did not justify remunerating eventually one consultant almost twice as much as
another.
P. Maturity. Grace Period and Exchanee Risk
2.16        The IDA credit was granted to the Government of Somalia.   The
financial terms were standard for IDA operatlons: interest-free, but with an
administration fee equal to .75Z p.a. The maturity is fifty years including ten
years of grace. Repayments to IDA started in September 1990, well after the end
of the exploration program. If it had been successful, the IDA terms would have
provided Somalia with long-term funding for the development expenditures which
would have followed. As no commercial oil was discovered, horfever, the servicing
of the IDA credit has to be included in the Government's general budget rather
than funded from taxes on the anticipated oil revenues. The fiscal burden on
Somalia has increased above the nominal credit amount because of the exchange
risk on SDR-denominated funds. Only in the first year of debt servicing, the
accumulated exchange rick accrued in the debt outstanding was already 63 times
the amount disbursed in Shilling equivalent.   The first installment alone
(US$75,000) required as many Shillings as had been disbursed over the entire
credit life. While the remaining exchange risk is uncertain over such a long
range, it is reasonable to assume a greater likelihood for the Somalian Shilling
than for the SDR basket of currencies to depreciate over the next 40 years. In
this event, the actual cost of IDA funds would be substantial.
G. Audit and Petroleum Accounting
2.17        The external audit of DMH's project accounts was done by one of the
major international firms. This effort, required by the Credit Agreement, was
duplicated by the Government's Auditor General as required by law.  Despite
limited staffing, the Auditor General is doing a commendable job of overseeing
public sector agencies. Yet it failed to question the recycling of promotion
revenues within DMH. This Audit has been able to examine the ledger of DMH's
Special Account set up under the project and concluded that it was not properly

maintained after the closing date. More importantly, it was confirmed that the
proceeds of the promotion effort had not been left with DMH until end-1985 (final
closing date) contrary to what was stipulated by the Credit Agreement. The issue
was raised by one IDA mission in 1985," which requested the authorities to
return the funds earmarked for additional petroleum studies.  It was neither
complied with nor enforced, thus making the sustainability of the project
unfeasible, short of receiving royalties from an oil discovery.
H. Institutional Development
2.18        The project being a technical assistance program hinged on an
important institutional building effort which was crucial for the sustainability
of Somalia's petroleum policy. As no new unit was set up to help implement the
project, actual institution-building was incremental at best. Besides hiring
(with delay) a financial officer with no significant result on oil negotiations,
DMH staffing was not increased further. The limited training which took place
has not translated into improved administrative procedures, reporting or overall
performance at DMH.
2.19        Over two years into the project, MMWR had not provided IDA with any
progress reports. After strong pressures, MMWR sent one report in October 1983
covering the period 1981-mid 1983.  No other reports were submitted in the
following two years. This failure reflected negatively on the organization of
DMH despite the provision of technical assistance under various forms
(consultants, training, IDA missions). Consultants submitted regular progress
reports, however, and the frequency of supervision missions compensated for the
borrower's lax reporting.   The penultimate supervision mission (April 1985)
requested MMWR to submit activity reports for 1983 and 1984, which was more
formal than useful given that eight missions had covered this period. Moreover.
DMH was not geared to producing reports.  DMH's external auditors were assigned
to produce elements of "petroleum accounting" which was essentially a financial
and statistical data base on the activities carried out in Somalia by oil
companies. The main recommendation was to combine financial and technical issues
in one single quarterly report. It was not implemented and monitoring remains
mostly technical.
III. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS
3.01        The objective of the project was primarily to give a new impetus to
exploration which had not been successful. The quality of foreign technical
assistance recruited and the frequency of Bank supervision missions supported a
successful project as measured by the result of the promotion conference in
Houston.    The  authorities  interviewed  for  this  audit  expressed  some
disappointment at the project outcome. No crude oil was discovered during the
project life and oil imports have been curbed by the shortage of foreign
exchange.  The main lesson to be learned from this project is that technical
assistance in petroleum to help restart a country which had a hiatus in its
contacts with foreign oil companies, no local expertise and no substantial

institution was a worthwhile development lending initiative. The fact that the
benefits from the project were lower than expected does not negate the effort.
3.02        By the closing date. exploration efforts financed out of the Credit
had not succeeded. The end of the IDA project did not interrupt them, however.
Three companies have remained moderately active. CONOCO was holding five blocks
in the North by mid-1990 and was planning a US$80 million seismic and drilling
program for 1991. Phillips Petroleum came in early 1990 as a partner with CONOCO
in three blocks, and alone in another block, while pursuing other exploration
activities, mostly limited to interpreting existing data. It is clear that the
IDA credit helped restart the process in the early 1980s.
3.03        The project can be considered sustainable as long as DMH is budgeted
for. This is, however, a necessary but insufficient condition. The core team
of technicians in DMH does not have the capacity nor the capability to handle a
larg2r stream of oil companies visiting Somalia. This Audit observed that the
original equipment imported to carry out the seismic survey is sitting,
unutilized in the MMWR's yard. This cast doubts on the sustainability of the
project once the initial effort has been exhausted.
3.04        The training component. key for the sustainability of a technical
assistance-oriented project such as petroleum promotion was not a prominent
feature. Contrary to the PCR statement (para. 4.01), this Audit found that the
expectations about training local technicians did not materialize because the
foreign experts did not spend sufficient time in Somalia to have enough availtble
for training. The lesson from this type of project is that direct, in-the-field
passing on of expertise is crucial to obtain lasting changes in the way
institutions are run.
3.05        The performance of IDA was positive in the initial years.  It was
vigilant on behalf of MMWR's interests, prompt to point out the consultants'
deficiencies. Even allowing for the fact that in mid project, supervision was
combined with preparation of a follow-up project, the frequency of supervision
was dense. From 1980 to 1985 there was a supervision mission every three months.
Given the scope of outstanding issues, the frequency of missions was above norm
and the cost efficiency of this approach may have been doubtful in regard to the
loan size.
3.06        The high frequency of missions did not prevent excessive delays of
various origins to pile up. Little enforcing pressure was applied when it would
have been justified. The extreme illustration was the sector study. It was
delivered so late by the consultant (six months before the third closing date)
as to become outdated. Aborting components whose completion is more embarrassing
than useful should be an option actively considered by IDA. The return of an
obsolete study cannot but be negative if findings and recommendations are
discredited for lack of current data support.   Furthermore,  as all of the
analysis in this case was conducted outside Somalia, no meaningful institution
building ensued.   The lesson from this project is that cutting losses on
unsuccessful experiences is as much a priority as encouraging positive ones.

exploration in countries affected by the Second Oil Shock, or to give a new
impetus to it as in the case of Somalia. was a worthwhile contribution by IDA in
the early 19809. Although Somalia had already a history of exploration conducted
over several decades, no oil had been found and foreign investments had ceased
toward the end of the 1970.. The project timing was appropriate as it coincided
with a renewed interest by the international oil industry. The absence of any
oil discovery is unfortunate, but it was an acceptable project risk to take. The
financial risk due to the exchange rate between the US dollar and the Somali
shilling has, however, been omitted from the picture.   Although petroleum
exploration was admittedly a risky project, the exchange risk associated with its
financing plan has already proven more risky. As debt servicing is spread over
fifty years for an IDA credit, it is recommended that as much attention (if not
ten times more) be paid to the period following the closing date as to the five
years of implementation preceding it. If the financial risk outweighs the pure
project risk, design modifications are in order or adequate warning to the
borrower must be made beforehand.
