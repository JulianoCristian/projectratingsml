Government's efforts to develop a domestic supply of\n            hydrocarbons and improve its planning of the energy sector.\n            The Project includes: (a) technical assistance to Department\n            of Mines and Hydrocarbons (DMH) (56 man-months) to compile\n            and evaluate geophysical and geological data and assist DMH\n            in updating the legal framework for promoting Somalia's\n            petroleum potential and negotiating with petroleum\n            companies. This component provides training for DMH staff,\n            office and field equipment as well as special studies; (b) a\n            geophysical survey of the Coriole-Afgoi prospects; (c) an\n            assessment of the oil-shale deposits in Northern Somalia;\n            (d) assistance in energy planning (23 man-months). There is\n            no special risk attached to the technical assistance\n            component. The risk associated with the geophysical survey\n            is that the quality of the data acquired may not be\n            sufficient enough to provide conclusive evidence on the\n            Afgoi and Coriole prospects. The supervision by DMH\n            consultants should reduce, if not eliminate, this risk."}, "docdt": "1980-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
