       Nepal aims to strengthen the institutional capacity of a\n            decentralized local governance system in its planning and\n            managing capabilities to improve the quality, efficiency,\n            and sustainability of rural roads in selected districts with\n            active participation of project beneficiaries. There are\n            four project components. The first component supports\n            routine maintenance, periodic maintenance, rehabilitation\n            and spot improvement of existing district roads/trails and\n            other rural infrastructure in eight selected districts. The\n            second component provides supervision and design of civil\n            works. The third component procures basic equipment for\n            logistical support including four-wheel drive pickups,\n            motorcycles, and computers and photocopiers. The fourth\n            component funds consultancy services to help the\n            institutional capacity of development departments and\n            entities at the local and national levels, trains staff and\n            contractors, funds project monitoring and evaluation,\n            including a community-based performance monitoring system."}, "docdt": "1999-05-12T00:00:00Z"}
