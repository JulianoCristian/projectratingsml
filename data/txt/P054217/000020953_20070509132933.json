Rather than waiting for the perfect environment and\n            for all the elements to be in place, the Bank and the\n            Government of Algeria went forward. One restructuring and\n            one extension later, this proved to be the right decision;\n            2) The downgrading of the project to\n            \"unsatisfactory\" at mid-term review was a good\n            decision to create a momentum and get the project back on\n            track; 3) The personal involvement of the Governor of the\n            Central bank to mobilize relevant people inside the Central\n            Bank and outside demonstrated the importance of a\n            \"Champion\" in the success of a project; 4) The\n            choice of shifting to a more efficient and cheaper\n            technology for the Telecom infrastructure was not easy but\n            at the end was definitely the right one; 5) Lack of\n            specialized staff at the Bank, Algeria-Telecom and the PIU\n            regarding the new technology in Telecom infrastructure\n            caused some delays in the procurement process; 6) The\n            information systems of commercial banks were outside the\n            scope of the project. This is preventing them from fully\n            benefiting from the Real Time Gross Settlement System; 7)\n            Security issues regarding the telecom network should have\n            been addressed at the inception of the project as part of\n            development objectives; and 8) Training issues regarding the\n            new technology used could have been better managed during\n            the implementation of the project."}, "docdt": "2007-03-19T00:00:00Z"}
