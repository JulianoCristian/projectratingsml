place an enabling infrastructure for basic financial\n            services, primarily by modernizing the inter-bank payments\n            system for large-value transactions, and, by developing\n            norms, and standards for low-value payments systems. Key\n            components address: 1) the development of a modernized\n            inter-bank payments system, allowing to process electronic\n            fund transfers, and facilitate secure, rapid transfers. A\n            Real Time Gross Settlements System (RTGS) will be\n            established, to be managed, and operated by the Bank of\n            Algeria (BA). For this purpose, procedures will be\n            incorporated to control credit risk, fraud, and maintain\n            integral, confidential transactions. Subcomponents include:\n            computerization, technical assistance and training, and,\n            studies to identify interface standards for clearing banking\n            activity payments; 2) the information systems of the BA,\n            which will include the technical infrastructure for the RTGS\n            system, computer hardware, and software, supported by\n            technical assistance (TA), and training for both the RTGS\n            system, and information systems in general; 3)\n            telecommunications infrastructure support, involving a high\n            capacity telecommunications optical ring network in Algiers,\n            with links around the country; telecommunications hardware,\n            and software installation; TA, and training for\n            telecommunications engineering, and security audits; and, 4)\n            project management support, which includes, inter alia, TA,\n            and training to strengthen the project management unit capacity."}, "docdt": "2001-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
