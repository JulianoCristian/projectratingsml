This refocus is linked to a reduction of the\n            loan amount to reflect this change, and cost savings that\n            occurred due to technological improvements under the other\n            components (the Real Time Gross Settlement System -RTGS -\n            and the telecommunications components). The Algerian\n            authorities have also requested an extension of the project\n            closing date to allow them fulfill the project's\n            development objectives. It is important to note that the\n            statements and policies of the Government and of the Bank of\n            Algeria in support of global payments systems reform, proves\n            (and ensures) the commitment to see the project objectives\n            achieved, and to further engage in additional payments\n            systems reform which would help strengthen the financial\n            infrastructure, and would support the sector's role in\n            economic and private sector growth. The restructuring\n            satisfactorily complies with the Articles of Agreement of\n            the Association and the Bank, and it is recommended that\n            project restructuring be approved."}, "docdt": "2005-07-21T00:00:00Z"}
