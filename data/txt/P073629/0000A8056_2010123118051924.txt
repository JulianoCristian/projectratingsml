                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The Community Development Program Support Project (PAPNDP) is the first phase of the program. Its objective is to assist the Government of Cameroon in
                         setting up and implementing a decentralized financing mechanism to ensure participatory community development in rural areas. It would (i) establish a system
                         for channeling funds to rural communities to finance prioritized collective infrastructures, (ii) strengthen the capacity of communities and local governments to
                         plan and manage their own development, and (iii) improve the legal and regulatory framework for decentralized rural development. Communities and communes
                         would be engaged in a participatory appraisal of their needs, culminating in the implementation of subprojects cofinanced by the project. Efforts would be made
                         to clarify procedures and build local governance capacity for communes so that resources and local development responsibilities could be transferred to them.
                         Special efforts will be undertaken for enable marginalized people (indigenous communities, nomads, women, etc.) to participate in the project.

                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The global environmental objective of the proposed project is to enhance the sustainable land and natural resource management components of the PAPNDP
                         project by complementing the local and national benefits of SLM with key global benefits such as: 1. Conservation of globally significant above and
                         belowground biodiversity. 2. Reduction of carbon emissions via improved land management activities, rehabilitated degraded lands, and increased carbon
                         sequestration. 3. Stabilizing riparian zones and reduction of sediment discharge into critical trans-boundary water bodies such as Lake Chad and the Gulf of
                         Guinea. The global objective will be accomplished by the following components (see Annex 4 for a detailed description and Annex 5 for a detailed cost
                         breakdown): 1. Enhancing integration of SLM into local development activities. Assist communes and communities in identifying key land management
                         constraints and opportunities for improved productivity, ecosystem services, and global environmental benefits. Implement priority microprojects to stop and
                         reverse land degradation and thus enhance the conservation of globally significant biodiversity including agro-biodiversity . 2. Institutional support for SLM.
                         Reinforce institutional collaboration at the national level, and strengthen the capacities of beneficiaries to better integrate SLM best practices in their local
                         development plans. Implement and improve conflict resolution frameworks and mechanisms in collaboration with traditional chiefs to effectively mitigate
                         tensions among farmers, cattle herders, protected area and other natural resource users. 3. Project management, coordination, monitoring and evaluation, and
                         communication. Ensure proper project management, coordination, monitoring and evaluation, communication, and dissemination of lessons learned.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The current ISR has been updated based on findings of meetings held October 15 with the project coordination unit (PCU), the incoming TTL, and other Bank team members.

                         1. The project became effective on October 04, 2004. Overall, the performance of the project is rated moderately satisfactory (MS). Significant progress has been made towards
                         achievement of Project Development Objectives (PDO) since the mid-term review (MTR) that was carried out June 2010. One out of the two outcome indicators has been fully
                         achieved, and the second is reached at 53 percent.
                         2. The disbursement rate is 71 percent, compared to 45 percent recorded in May 2010.
                         3. A total of 190 SLM micro-projects have been financed and implemented, compared to the end-of-project target of 240, including 10 communal micro-projects and 180 community

                         micro-projects. In addition, (i) 20 agreements have been signed with communities and are being financed, and (ii) 5 landscape use and management plans have been prepared and
                         submitted for approval prior to implementation.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         During the meetings held on October 15, the following decisions were taken:

                         1. The next supervision mission will be implemented from December 03-22, 2010.
                         2. The project will be restructured to reallocate the grant proceeds and extend the closing date for 12 months until March 2012. Restructuring is needed to adequately finance key
                         activities and to provide enough time ensure successful achievement of the PDO.
                         3. A study tour will be organized in 2011 to allow selected PCU staff and community delegates will visit projects in Burkina Faso and Niger with significant experience in SLM.
                         4. Efforts will be made to start implementation of the 30 pending communal micro-projects before the end of 2010.
