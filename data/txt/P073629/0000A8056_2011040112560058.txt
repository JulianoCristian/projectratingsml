                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The Community Development Program Support Project (PAPNDP) is the first phase of the program. Its objective is to assist the Government of Cameroon in
                         setting up and implementing a decentralized financing mechanism to ensure participatory community development in rural areas. It would (i) establish a system
                         for channeling funds to rural communities to finance prioritized collective infrastructures, (ii) strengthen the capacity of communities and local governments to
                         plan and manage their own development, and (iii) improve the legal and regulatory framework for decentralized rural development. Communities and communes
                         would be engaged in a participatory appraisal of their needs, culminating in the implementation of subprojects cofinanced by the project. Efforts would be made
                         to clarify procedures and build local governance capacity for communes so that resources and local development responsibilities could be transferred to them.
                         Special efforts will be undertaken for enable marginalized people (indigenous communities, nomads, women, etc.) to participate in the project.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR has been prepared based on findings of the supervision mission carried out from December 3 to 23, 2010. Due to a continuing problem with the ISR electronic filing system,
                         it has not been possible to update the Results and Risks sections. To avoid further delays, the ISR is being filed with a file attached containing the updated Results Framework (RF).
                         1. The project became effective on October 4, 2004. The Mid-Term Review (MTR), carried out in October 2009, proposed changes to the PDO Indicators (PDOIs) and Intermediate
                         Outcome Indicators (IOIs), but those changes were never formally implemented. Project results therefore must be assessed against the indicators contained in the original RF.
                         2. Implementation suffered important delays, justifying the extension of the project closing date from March 2011 to March 2012.
                         3. Overall, the performance of the Project is still rated moderately satisfactory (MS). Since the last ISR was filed in December 2010, significant progress has been realized toward the
                         achievement of the Project Development Objectives (PDO). One of the two PDO Indicator targets has been achieved, and the second is not yet measured. With regard to the two
                         Global Environmental Objective Indicators (GEOIs), one has been achieved at a level of 21 percent, and the second is not yet measured. The mission proposed measures, to be
                         implemented by end of March, that will ensure collection of all data needed to inform the RF and the project.
                         4. A total of 230 SLM micro-projects have been financed and implemented (190 in October 2010), compared to the end-of-project target of 240, including 19 communal micro-projects
                         and 211 community micro-projects. In addition, 5 landscape use and management plans have been prepared.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The mission agreed with the Government (GoC) on the following decisions:
                         1. The Project Coordination Unit (PCU) will prepare an action plan to collect all data needed to populate the Results Framework (RF).
                         2. The PCU will focus the 2011 work plan and budget on the core activities linked to the RF that are not yet started/completed.
                         3. The PCU will sign conventions with decentralized public sectoral services to ensure full implementation of the project.
                         4. The Bank will closely monitor the approval by the Ministry of Environment (MINEP) of the new legislation governing the functioning of the Commission Nationale Consultative pour
                         l'Environnement et Developpement Durable (CNCEDD). CNCEDD is responsible for promoting policies and strategies for SLM development.
                         5. The PCU will give priority to the agreed action plan for the implementation of recommendations and key measures identified.
