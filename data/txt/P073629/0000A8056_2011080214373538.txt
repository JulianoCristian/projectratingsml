                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The Community Development Program Support Project (PAPNDP) is the first phase of the program. Its objective is to assist the Government of Cameroon in
                         setting up and implementing a decentralized financing mechanism to ensure participatory community development in rural areas. It would (i) establish a system
                         for channeling funds to rural communities to finance prioritized collective infrastructures, (ii) strengthen the capacity of communities and local governments to
                         plan and manage their own development, and (iii) improve the legal and regulatory framework for decentralized rural development. Communities and communes
                         would be engaged in a participatory appraisal of their needs, culminating in the implementation of subprojects cofinanced by the project. Efforts would be made
                         to clarify procedures and build local governance capacity for communes so that resources and local development responsibilities could be transferred to them.
                         Special efforts will be undertaken for enable marginalized people (indigenous communities, nomads, women, etc.) to participate in the project.

                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The global environmental objective of the proposed project is to enhance the sustainable land and natural resource management components of the PAPNDP
                         project by complementing the local and national benefits of SLM with key global benefits such as: 1. Conservation of globally significant above and
                         belowground biodiversity. 2. Reduction of carbon emissions via improved land management activities, rehabilitated degraded lands, and increased carbon
                         sequestration. 3. Stabilizing riparian zones and reduction of sediment discharge into critical trans-boundary water bodies such as Lake Chad and the Gulf of
                         Guinea. The global objective will be accomplished by the following components (see Annex 4 for a detailed description and Annex 5 for a detailed cost
                         breakdown): 1. Enhancing integration of SLM into local development activities. Assist communes and communities in identifying key land management
                         constraints and opportunities for improved productivity, ecosystem services, and global environmental benefits. Implement priority microprojects to stop and
                         reverse land degradation and thus enhance the conservation of globally significant biodiversity including agro-biodiversity . 2. Institutional support for SLM.
                         Reinforce institutional collaboration at the national level, and strengthen the capacities of beneficiaries to better integrate SLM best practices in their local
                         development plans. Implement and improve conflict resolution frameworks and mechanisms in collaboration with traditional chiefs to effectively mitigate
                         tensions among farmers, cattle herders, protected area and other natural resource users. 3. Project management, coordination, monitoring and evaluation, and
                         communication. Ensure proper project management, coordination, monitoring and evaluation, communication, and dissemination of lessons learned.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR has been updated based on findings of (i) semi-monthly meetings involving the Bank task team and the Project Coordination Unit (PCU), held beginning in December 2011,
                         to assess implementation progress, and (ii) the June 2011 progress report prepared by the PCU.

                         1. The project became effective on October 4, 2004. The Mid-Term Review (MTR), carried out in October 2009, proposed changes to some of the performance indicators, but those
                         changes were never formally implemented, so performance must be assessed against the indicators contained in the original RF. (Note: The RF appearing in this and other ISRs,
                         which is system-generated, contains indicators for the GEF project, but also indicators for the parent IDA project, which was closed in November 2009. Since the two projects have
                         separate PADs and separate RFs, this is a bit confusing.)

                         2. Implementation suffered important delays, justifying the extension of the project closing date from March 2011 to March 2012.

                         3. Overall, the performance of the Project is rated satisfactory (S). As of June 2011, the disbursement rate stood at 79 percent. Since the December 2010 mission, significant
                         progress has been realized toward the achievement of the PDO. One of the two PDO Indicator targets has been achieved, and the second is not yet measured. With regard to the
                         two Global Environmental Objective Indicators (GEOIs), one has been achieved at a level of 53 percent, and the second is not yet measured. The action plan agreed between Bank
                         team and PCU to ensure successful completion of long-delayed core activities is being implemented according to schedule. Information needed to asses performance has improved,
                         thanks to the implementation of the revised/upgraded methodology agreed between the Bank team and PCU for collection of all data needed to inform the RF and the project.

                         4. 277 SLM micro-projects have been financed and implemented, compared to the end-of-project target of 240, including 60 communal micro-projects and 326 community micro-
                         projects.
