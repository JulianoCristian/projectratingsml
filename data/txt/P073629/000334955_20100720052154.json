the risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: communities with limited technical\n            capacities and weak control mechanisms, financial\n            decentralization should follow a phased approach, which\n            fully capitalizes on past experience. The first phase of the\n            project successfully tested a mechanism for channeling\n            resources to communes and communities. This success gave\n            sufficient confidence to the Government, which enacted a\n            decision to transfer areas of competence and associated\n            resources for nine ministries to the communes, one of the\n            greatest achievements of the project was to create a new\n            environment for local development planning, financing and\n            management, leading to a greater command of the local\n            development process by communities, and to an improved\n            delivery of basic social services, simplicity in the process\n            of preparing local and communal development plans would\n            strengthen ownership and improve implementation efficiency.\n            A shortcoming of the project was the lack of a mechanism to\n            monitor communal development plans, as well as the absence\n            of expertise to provide operational content to the strategic\n            elements of the plans, a systematic use of simplified guides\n            and procedural manuals is critical for quality insurance and\n            greater fiduciary compliance at local level, sectoral\n            ministries have a critical role to play in ensuring quality\n            control of infrastructure realized through the local\n            development process; situations of conflict of interest are\n            to be avoided, financing communal agents is a smart\n            investment for increasing communal fiscal space and tax\n            revenues, using in-kind contributions of beneficiaries\n            provides a greater flexibility in financing local\n            development; however, this mode of financing is also source\n            of quality issues and implementation difficulties."}, "docdt": "2010-05-25T00:00:00Z"}
