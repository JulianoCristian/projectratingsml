Using\n            International Development Association (IDA) resources and\n            expertise, Cameroon has accelerated its fiscal\n            decentralization strategy by empowering rural communes and\n            communities to identify, plan, implement, and manage\n            priority activities defined in their development plans,\n            including construction of economic and social infrastructure\n            and provision of health, education, and agricultural\n            extension services. For the first time in Cameroon, the\n            financial resources were directly transferred to local\n            governments and community-based organizations to plan and\n            manage their own development. These achievements were only\n            possible because of the project\u2019s critical role in improving\n            the legal and regulatory framework for strengthened local\n            governance and empowering decentralized authorities with the\n            legal authority to manage local development. Finally, the\n            successful test of the mechanism for channeling resources to\n            the local level encouraged the Government to transfer\n            selected areas of competence and associated resources of\n            nine ministries to local governments in 2010."}, "docdt": "2010-09-20T06:56:00Z"}
