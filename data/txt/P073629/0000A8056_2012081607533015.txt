                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The Community Development Program Support Project (PAPNDP) is the first phase of the program. Its objective is to assist the Government of Cameroon in setting up
                         and implementing a decentralized financing mechanism to ensure participatory community development in rural areas. It would (i) establish a system for channeling
                         funds to rural communities to finance prioritized collective infrastructures, (ii) strengthen the capacity of communities and local governments to plan and manage their
                         own development, and (iii) improve the legal and regulatory framework for decentralized rural development. Communities and communes would be engaged in a
                         participatory appraisal of their needs, culminating in the implementation of subprojects cofinanced by the project. Efforts would be made to clarify procedures and build
                         local governance capacity for communes so that resources and local development responsibilities could be transferred to them. Special efforts will be undertaken for
                         enable marginalized people (indigenous communities, nomads, women, etc.) to participate in the project.

                         complementing the local and national benefits of SLM with key global benefits such as: 1. Conservation of globally significant above and belowground biodiversity. 2.
                         Reduction of carbon emissions via improved land management activities, rehabilitated degraded lands, and increased carbon sequestration. 3. Stabilizing riparian
                         zones and reduction of sediment discharge into critical trans-boundary water bodies such as Lake Chad and the Gulf of Guinea. The global objective will be
                         accomplished by the following components (see Annex 4 for a detailed description and Annex 5 for a detailed cost breakdown): 1. Enhancing integration of SLM into
                         local development activities. Assist communes and communities in identifying key land management constraints and opportunities for improved productivity,
                         ecosystem services, and global environmental benefits. Implement priority microprojects to stop and reverse land degradation and thus enhance the conservation of
                         globally significant biodiversity including agro-biodiversity . 2. Institutional support for SLM. Reinforce institutional collaboration at the national level, and strengthen
                         the capacities of beneficiaries to better integrate SLM best practices in their local development plans. Implement and improve conflict resolution frameworks and
                         mechanisms in collaboration with traditional chiefs to effectively mitigate tensions among farmers, cattle herders, protected area and other natural resource users. 3.
                         Project management, coordination, monitoring and evaluation, and communication. Ensure proper project management, coordination, monitoring and evaluation,
                         communication, and dissemination of lessons learned.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Note: We tried several times unsuccessfully to submit the ISR seq.No 16 through the GEF Project (P089289). This problem was due to the fact that the GEF project was blended with
                         the Community Development Program Support Project (P073629) which was closed on November 30, 2009. To solve the problem, the 32121 advised us to submit the ISR through
                         the parent project (P073629) and not through the GEF project. Therefore, the ISR seq. No. 16 was submitted through the parent project (PAPNDP) instead of the GEF-SLM project.

                         This ISR, which is system-generated, relates to the GEF Project but also to the parent IDA Project, which closed in November 2009. Since the two projects have separate PADs,
                         different numbers of components, and separate results frameworks (RFs), this can beconfusing. Moreover, components 2 and 3 displayed in the ISR are related to the sub-
                         components 2.1 and 2.2 of Component 2 of the GEF Project.

                         This ISR has been updated based on findings of (i) semi-monthly meetings involving the Bank task team and the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) that are regularly held to assess

                         implementation progress, (ii) the government implementation completion report prepared by the PCU, and (iii) the implementation completion mission that was conducted from April
                         16 to 27, 2012.

                         1. The Project became effective on October 4, 2004. The Mid-Term Review (MTR), carried out in October 2009, proposed changes to some of the performance indicators, but those
                         changes were never formally implemented, so performance must be assessed against the indicators contained in the original results framework (RF).

                         2. Implementation suffered important delays, justifying the extension of the Project closing date from March 2011 to March 2012.

                         3. Overall, the performance of the Project is rated moderately satisfactory (MS). The two PDO indicators have been substantially achieved according to data contained in the
                         government's Implementation Completion Report (ICR). With regard to the Global Environmental Objective (GEO), the two GEO indicators have been achieved at 80 and 185
                         percent, respectively. Out of 23 total indicators, 22 were measured at the Project closing date. Of the 22 indicators measured, three have recorded an achievement rate of 25 to 49

                         achieved, notably, the indicator relating to the reinforcement of land use rights policies through the adoption/revision, and/or implementation of legal texts or decrees on land tenure
                         (and land use rights) and the indicator related to the functioning of CNCEDD (''Commission Nationale Consultative pour l’Environnement et le Développement Durable'') and CIE
                         (''Comité Interministériel de l'Environnement'') in promoting sound SLM policies, decrees and programs.

                         4. Component 1 on enhancing the integration of SLM into local development is rated Satisfactory (S). The main objectives of the component have been substantially achieved. Apart
                         from the indicator related to the numbers of micro-projects financed, which was completed at 98 percent, all six of the other Intermediate Outcome Indicators (IOIs) have been fully
                         achieved: (i) out of 210 micro-projects to be financed and implemented by the end of the Project, 206 micro projects have been financed and implemented (98 percent); (ii) seven (7)
                         community forests were protected or put in place, against three originally planned (one communal forest at Yoko, one at Santchou, two at Bangangté, one at Magba, and two at
                         Kouoptamo); (iii) in total 9,574 ha (against 5,000 ha planned) of protected areas boundaries, buffer zones, and riparian zones were rehabilitated through SLM practices in the
                         Project's intervention area; (iv) in the North and Adamaoua regions (provinces), an average maize yield of between 3 to 5 tons per hectare (t/ha) was achieved (against a target of 1.5
                         to 2.5 t/ha), and in the Central and West regions (provinces), the average yield obtained varies from 2.4 to 4.8 t/ha (against 2.5 to 3.5 t/ha originally planned); (v) the rate of adoption
                         of agro-pastoral systems increased from 65% to 80% in the North/Adamaoua regions (provinces); (vi) ITK best practices were fully incorporated into disseminated SLM best
                         practices. However, at the closing date of the Project, 52 micro-projects are still under implementation. The indicator relating to improving land fertility by the end of Project was not
                         measured, because of its complexity, which was also identified during the mid-term review of the Project.

                         5. Component 2 relating to institutional support for SLM is rated Moderately Satisfactory (MS). At local level, five landscape use and management plans have been approved and are
                         under implementation. A total of 402 communities-based organizations (against 100 originally planned) have gained improved knowledge of SLM and environmental issues and are
                         able to properly implement biodiversity and environmentally-friendly SLM practices; (ii) 8,000 households have adopted the SLM practices out of 10,000 households initially planned
                         (85 percent); and (iii) 21 conflict resolution frameworks (against 10 planned) have been revitalized and are effectively operational at the communal level, through land tenure and
                         land-use conflict litigation commissions. The situation in the regions is as follows: North region: four communal and seven local conflict resolution frameworks implemented,
                         Adamaoua region: five communal conflict resolution frameworks implemented, West region: three communal conflict resolution frameworks implemented and, Center region: two
                         communal conflict resolution frameworks implemented. Two indicators at the institutional or national level were not fully achieved, notably, the indicator relating to the reinforcement
                         of land use rights policies through the adoption/revision, and/or implementation of legal texts or decrees on land tenure (and land use rights), and the indicator related to the
                         functioning of CNCEDD (''Commission Nationale Consultative pour l’Environnement et le Développement Durable'') and CIE (''Comité Interministériel de l'Environnement''). However,
                         the Project has participated in the preparation of a decree concerning a corridor for animals in the Northern region and to the review of legal texts related to the creation and
                         functioning of the two committees (CNCEDD and CIE).

                         6. Component 3 relating to Project management, coordination, monitoring and evaluation, and communication is rated Satisfactory (S). Five Intermediate Outcome Indicators (IOIs)
                         have been fully achieved. Baseline studies were done at the beginning of Project implementation, M&E mechanisms under PAPNDP were adapted to the GEF project and used, the
                         GIS database on land and natural resources was updated and used, progress reports (financial/technical) were regularly issued, and 14 SLM best practices and lessons were
                         identified in a participatory manner (against 10 initially planned). A compendium of good practices has been published. The safeguard policies have been implemented satisfactorily.
                         The financial management function is rated moderately satisfactory due to the fact that (i) external auditor recommendations on internal controls were not implemented fully, and (ii)
                         there were delays in the financial reporting process between the Communes, the Regional coordination Units and project Coordination Unit. Procurement activities are almost
                         completed. A Sustainable Land Use Management Plan methodology has been established and will be mainstreamed into the Community Development Program Support Project -

                         Phase II (P113027). This will help to better inform the Community Development Plans. Information on Project performance has improved, thanks to the implementation of the revised/
                         upgraded methodology agreed between the Bank team and PCU for collection of all data needed to inform the RF and the project.

                         7. On June 11, 2012, the disbursement rate stood at 90 percent. This does not include other eligible expenses that were incurred before the closing date of March 1, 2012. The
                         disbursement rate may reach 100 percent when these expenses have been paid.

                         8. The Project has had significant impacts on the ground, including: (i) a high rate of adoption of SLM practices, (ii) a significant improvement in soil fertility, shown by the increases in
                         maize crop yield, (iii) an improvement of ecosystems due to afforestation and ��the reappearance of new plant and animal species in the Project areas, (iv) a good ownership by the
                         beneficiaries of on-farm technologies introduced by the Project in the North and Adamaoua regions (provinces), (v) a reduction of transhumance and thus a settling of nomadic

                         The World Bank team agreed with the PCU on the following actions:

                         1. The PCU will prepare the list of eligible expenses incurred before the closing date of March 1, 2012, disaggregated by region, and submit the list to the World Bank for payment

                         2. The PCU should continue to ensure close monitoring of the 52 micro-projects (communal and and community micro-projects) that are still under implementation.
