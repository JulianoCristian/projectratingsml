SUMMARY
i.        The Nigerian Government has made a request to Bank/IDA for an IDA
development credit to assist in financing the capital cost of certain edu-
cation projects of high priority.
ii.       A preliminary Bank mission to Nigeria prepared a tentative list
of educational projects which was later passed to the Regions for their
comments as to whether they would accept the list, with possible amendments,
as constituting their request to the Bank.   The list was accepted and there-
after constituted the application submitted by Nigeria.
iii.      An education appraisal mission was in Nigeria from November 13 to
December 21, 1963, and visited all Regions to study the education system and
the items of the project in the application.
iv.       The items of the project identified for possible financing pertain
to the construction and equipment of new teacher training and technical
schools, the expansion of existing grammar and technical schools, the pro-
vision of facilities for science teaching and of workshops for manual training
in secondary schools which have so far been too academic.
v.        The proposed project will increase pupil enrolment b   11,000 in
secondary schools690 in teacher training and 5,000 in trade trainming.     Al
the proposed projects should be complete  during--te-perrodI1962Z-T9'69;.'.-.
vi.       In appraising the proposed project, items considered unessential
for the proper functioning of schools have been excised.    Proposed space
accommodation wias contested wherever necessary and reduced to acceptable
limits.   Dormitory accommodation was accepted but only to the essential
limit after the need was conclusively established.   Staff housing has been
reduced to the barest essential required for the proper supervision of boarding
institutions and for the need of new expatriate staff who, without the pro-
vision of housing, cannot be attracted to Nigeria.
vii.      The additional teaching and instructional staff required for the
new facilities will be found from many sources, such as the new advanced
teacher training colleges, university expansion programs, an I.L.0. workshop
instructor training course and a proposed national technical teacher training
college.   Considerable reliance on expatriate teachers and instructors must
continue for some time to come; but it is considered that the need will be
matched by the effort and that sufficient teachers will be found to staff the
proposed expansion in facilities.
viii.     The estimated cost of the proposed project is about $30 million
equivalent, of which about $2.11 million is for the Federal Territory projects,
$2.89 million for Western, $1.57 million for Mid-Western, $3.96 million for
Eastern, and $19.47 million for Northern Nigeria.    These figures include



- ii -
consultant fees and contingencies which together amount to about 15% of the
original costs.   This distribution reflects only the Regions' urgent needs
and is in no way related to the proportion of the population or to any other
consideration.   The foreign exchange component amounts to about $11 million,
which is about 37% of the total cost of the proposed project.
ix.       In view of Nigeria's need for external aid and the evident
necessity for financial assistance to implement the items of the project
which have been identified as of the highest priority in the education
sector, the proposed IDA development credit of about $20 million would cover
two-thirds of the total cost of the project.
x.        The balance of the total cost of the project, not covered by the
proposed IDA credit, should be provided by the Regional Governments and the
Federal Territory of Lagos.   An undertaking to this effect has already been
given.
xi.       The additional annual recurrent costs which the proposed project
will create are estimated to be: Federal $328,000; Western $927,000;
Mid-Western $566,000; Eastern $922,000; Northern $4.62 million; a total of
$7.36 million.   Provision of these sums is within the capacity of the
Federal and Regional Governments.
xii.      There is no shortage of private architects, engineers or contractors
in Nigeria, but technical staff in the Ministries of Public Works is being
constantly reduced through resignation and other reasons.    Trained Nigerian
staff is not becoming available in sufficient numbers to fill the gap.   With
this attrition in technical staff, government construction programs cannot
be implemented adequately or supervised.   The Federal and Regional Govern-
ments have therefore agreed that a firm of consultants should be engaged to
supervise the preparation of tenders, control the award of contracts, super-
vise the work and authorize payment, in addition to checking plans and draw-
ings and, if and when required, assisting in their preparation.



I. INTRODUCTION
Request to the Bank
1.        Arising out of the visit of the Bank Economic Mission to Nigeria in
1963 and in the light of the findings of the 1962 Unesco Educational Invest-
ments Programming Mission to Nigeria, a provisional list of educational pro-
jects of high priority, likely to qualify for consideration for Bank and/or
IDA assistance, was drawn up.   The list was forwarded to the Nigerian Federal
and Regional Governments for their views and it was later agreed that it should
constitute the Government's official request to Bank/IDA.
2.        In conformity with this request, a Bank/IDA education appraisal
mission visited the country between November 13 and December 21, 1963, to
identify projects of high priority for possible financing by Bank and/or IDA.
The mission visited the Federal Territory of Lagos and each of the four
Regions to study the educational situation in general and particularly the
items of the project proposed in the application.    Discussions were held
with officials in the Regional Ministries of Education, of Finance, of
Planning and of Public Works.   Contacts were made with the British High
Commission, U.S. AID, and with embassies whose governments envisage financing
educational projects bi-laterally.   Meetings were also held with managers
of industrial concerns to gauge, to the extent possible, their need for
trained personnel.   Contacts were also made with Voluntary Agencies in all
Regions to discuss their contributions to education and tolearn their future
plans.   Primary, secondary, technical and teacher training schools were
visited.   This report is based on these contacts, discussions, visits and
findings of the mission.
Social and Economic Background
3.        The Federal Republic of Nigeria became an independent sovereign
state in 1960 and is today a Republic within the British Commonwealth.    It
lies in the tropical rain forest and Guinea savannah zones of West Africa.
With an area of 357,000 square miles and, according to the 1963 census, a
population of 56 million, it is the largest state in Africa.    Apart from
cities like Lagos and Ibadan, population density is low and, because they
must serve such a large catchment area, most secondary schools must have
boarding facilities.
4.        Politically, Nigeria is divided into North, East, West and Mid-West
which, together with Lagos, fzrm a Federation in which each enjoys a wide
measure of autonomy.   Each has its own house of representatives with a
responsible cabinet and controls its own budget.   At the Federal level, the
Regions participate in the Federal House of Representatives, each in pro-
portion to its population.   The country, despite occasional political and
party strife, enjoys a degree of stability not always encountered in emerging
countries.
5.        The largest region is the North which is peopled mainly by Moslem
Hausa, Fulani and Kanuri tribes who have retained much of their original
culture.   The three southern regions have been much more exposed to foreign
influences.   The East is the most densely populated, largely by Ibos;



- 2 -
the WJest is mostly peopled by town-dwelling Yorubas; and the new Mid-West
contains the former minority groups of the West - Edos, Urhobos and Ibos.
After the M4oslems in the North, the Christians - Catholics and Protestants -
in the southern regions form the next largest group.   Pagans, still large
in number, form the third group.
6.        Regionalism and tribalism remain potent factors, affecting politics,
administration and employment.   In politics, parties and party alignments
are based on regional and tribal loyalties.   In administration, regionalism
sometimes   causes    opposition to Federal decisions and directives.   It
reduces co-ordination between the Federal and Regional administrations and
thereby affects efficiency and economy.   In general, however, the Nigerian
Civil Service appears to work hard and efficiently.   In regard to employment,
the North, with a shortage of teachers, will not offer employment to teachers
from the West, where there is a surplus, and Mid-Westerners are not welcome
in the West.   Tribal links also influence employment.    Hence, there is
limited mobility of labor throughout Nigeria as a whole and training programs
must be geared to regional needs.    Strong family ties also exist and compel
support for indigent kinsmen, thus disguising to some extent unemployment and
underemployment.
7.        The economy is based mainly on agriculture.    The land, though
varying in productivity, has tremendous potentialities for development.
Agriculture provides about one-half of the GDP, supports some three-quarters
of the population and supplies 80% of the country's exports.    How best to
exploit these agricultural resources is not yet fully known; production
techniques and productivity need improvement to take fuller advantage of the
potential for increased output.   Agriculture is fairly well diversified
nationally but less so regionally, with palm products in the East and West,
timber and rubber in the Mid-West, cotton and groundnuts in the North and
cocoa in the West.   Mineral resources are also available, but the country's
agricultural and natural resources have yet to be fully exploited and so the
per-capita income is still about $84.   Industry is in its infancy but progress
is gradually becoming felt as evidenced by the establishment during the last
four years of 130 new industrial undertakings.   Prospects for further indus-
trialization are good as Nigeria does not lack minerals, oil or agricultural
raw materials.   It has a large population for providing the necessary man-
power and an extensive domestic market.    The labor force is industrious,
intelligent and adaptable, but trained manpower at all levels is scarce.
Aside from the shortage of funds, this scarcity of trained manpower may be
considered as the most serious bottleneck in the economic development of Nigeria.
8.        The Bank/IDA educational appraisal mission was not the first to study
the educational needs of Nigeria.   The Ashby Mission (1960) though primarily
concerned with Nigeria's future need for high-level manpower, touched on other
levels of education and made many valuable recommendations.    Later, a Unesco
Educational Investment Programming Mission (1962) examined the situation further
and included a study of educational projects and their state of readiness for
financing by external sources.   Reports by other commissions on regional
problems of education or technical education are also available, including a
recent survey by the Nigerian National Manpower Board.



- 3 -
9.        The National Manpower Board (NOMB) was formed in 1962 to assess
present and future needs for high-level manpower in the public and private
sectors, to facilitate planning by Federal and Regional Governments as
well as by private employers and to assist in planning courses and enrol-
ment at universities, technical institutes and trade centers.    Its most
recent survey covers the period 1963 - 1968.   Based on returns from all
private and Government employment, it covers persons from the highest
professional qualifications to craftsmen, i.e., all those needing specialized
training.   The report has used a full-employment objective as a basis for
forecasting future manpower requirements, arguing that
(i) the National Development Plan takes account only of the
public sector;
(ii) the returns from the private sector are too conservative;
(iii) unemployment levels must not wvorsen.
These arguments indicate that forecasts may be optimistic rather than real-
istic.   They estimate a three-fold increase in high and intermediate level
categories and a five-fold increase in other categories.    These figures,
it is considered, are unlikely to be attained by 1968.    However, the in-
creased output of trained manpower arising from the proposed project falls
so far short of the NMB forecasts that no lack of employment opportunities
is anticipated for those who will complete courses in the new and expanded
facilities proposed in this report.
10.       The Nigerian educational system is already receiving assistance
from a number of governments, foundations and church groups in the form of
capital aid for schools and equipment, research workers and teachers. Donors
include the governments of the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada;
also Unesco, ILO, FAO and the Ford Foundation.   Sweden has also indicated
an interest.

II. THE EDUCATION SYSTEM
General
11.        Education in Nigeria presents varying degrees of achievement.
It is provided by the Federal and Regional Governments, local education
authorities and various missionary bodies and other voluntary agencies.
While Western Nigeria, including the present Mid-Wlest, the Easterm and
the Federal Territory of Lagos show enrolment as a high percentage of the
appropriate age group, Northern Nigeria continues to lag considerably
behind. The exclusion of missionary activities is one reason, the other is
that the Northern Region has always been less well endowed financially.
The missionaries, mostly of British origin, introduced an education system
patterned along English lines with English as the medium of instruction and
more inclined to arts than to sciences and still less to technical training.
Ministries of Education have reduced the imbalance by opening technical
schools at various levels and by attempting to emphasize the sciences.
(a) Organization and administration
12.        The pattern is a broad base of primary education (Annex I,Charts
1-4) followed by secondary education for the few, which leads into higher
education either at university or technical college level as shown below.

1962        2,835,120         185,790   Not available       3,744
13.       The Federal Ministry of Education provides primary, secondary and
technical education and teacher training within its own territory, and
secondly, although it has no jurisdiction over regional educational systems,
irfluences and co-ordinates federal and regional educational activities so
as to maintain standards and secure some degree of uniformity. The Federal
Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary are political appointees. The
Chief Administrative Officer, the Permanent Secretary, who is also the
Federal Adviser on Education, is assisted by senior officers in charge of
divisions of operations and budget, development and planning, organization
and inspection and scholastic services (Annex II). The DeIputy Permanent
Secretary for Finance and Establishment deals with estimates and budgets
and maintains close liaison with the Federal Mlinistry of Finance. Chief
Education Officers head the Development Section which deals with forward
planning and projection, statistics and school buildings and the Professional
Division which deals with organization and inspection. In the latter



Division are the advisers on teacher training and on secondary, technical,
higher and adult education.   A Scholastic Services Division supervises
school libraries, visual aids, examinations, student counselling, welfare
and scholarships.   The Bureau for External Aid for Education co-ordinates
natters concerning overseas aid.   Regional Ministries of Education have
full jurisdiction over all branches of their educational systems even
though partly financed by the central Treasury.    They are similar in organi-
zation to those of the Federal Ministry.   The Mid-West, created in August,
1963, has a governmental machinery which is still in embryo.    In all Regions
inspection of schools is undertaken by officers of the Inspectorate at
Ministry headquarters and also by provincial inspectors responsible for schools
within their area.
14.       With the exception of the North, which still has many expatriate
officers at Ministry headquarters, the Federal and the other Regional
Ministries of Education are staffed by Nigerians who appear both competent
and hardworking.   However, need exists for greater co-ordination between
Regional Ministries of Education and Public Works; and also between
Ministries of Education, Economic Development or Planning, Finance and
the National Manpower Board.
15.       Voluntary Agencies.  During the latter half of the 19th Century
Protestants and Roman Catholics established missions in many parts, usually
erecting the first schools.   For their first 50 years they had to rely almost
entirely on overseas funds, but government later provided grants-in-aid which
permitted considerable expansion.   During this latter period, other types of
schools were founded by local communities and by enterprising educationists
and business men.   Voluntary Agencies' primary and secondary schools and
teacher training colleges exist in some profusion in the West, Mid-West and
East but are fewer in the North where Moslems barred the mass entry of
Christian missions for many years and where they have multiplied only re-
cently.   Local education authorities are appointed by provincial authorities
to build and oversee primary and secondary schools, deriving funds from local
rates and receiving grants-in-aid under the same conditions of financial
assistance as Voluntary Agencies' schools.    It should be added that the
various governments propose as a long-range objective to reduce Voluntary
Agencies' participation in education and to increase the number of schools
operated by local authorities.
(b) Primary Education
16.       After independence, the East and West governments committed them-
selves to a policy of universal primary education.   The West went even farther
in making elementary education free for all.    A high percentage of the
regional recurrent total budget, over 40%, is now spent on education with
almost 65%, of that appropriation for primary education.    Little money is left
for the higher levels of schooling, but primary education in Western Nigeria
has now been reduced from eight to six years.
17.       The length of primary education varies between the Regions.    The
North seems to have settled on seven years; the West, Mid-West and the East



- 6 -
now have six years. The Federal Territory adheres temporarily to the eight-
year system but may soon adopt six years. Figures of school enrolment, not
usually available until one or two years after the closing of the relevant
year, are quoted below for 1962:
(No. of children in all Primary Schools) Percentage of
Region                      Boys       Girls       Total        Girls to Boys
Lagos                     49,817      49,694      99,511          99.8%
North                    262,083      97,851     359,934           37.3%
East                     774,610     491,956   1,266,566           63,5%
West (incl.Mid-West)     656,651     452,458   1,109,109           68.9%
1,743,161   1,091,959   2,835,120           62.6%
The number of girls is always below that of boys in developing countries and
the ratios shown above, with the exception of the North, are considered
satisfactory.
18.       For universal primary education, the number of children of school
age is usually estimated at a minimum of 2.5% of the total population for
every year of schooling. On this basis, the total number of children of
primary school age should be 20%, 17.5%, 15% and 15% of the total population
for Lagos, the North, East and West, respectively. Using the most recent
census figures and the percentages just quoted, the following table shows
the degree of universal. primary education so far achieved:

19.       The primary school curriculum is intended to remove illiteracy
permanently and to give a measure of useful general education. English is
the medium of instruction but local dialects receive sufficient attention
without wasteful exaggeration. On completion of his primary education, a
child can read English with tolerable ease and communicate to a reasonable
standard. In arithmetic the subject matter taught leads to a good grounding
in the basic operations. In social studies, children learn about their
environment, their owin and a general view of world history. In sciences,
nature study and agriculture including practical work appear in the curriculum.
Handicrafts and domestic science are also taught and, in a few schools, wood-
work, metalwork and drawing. On the whole, the present curriculum is satis-
factory, but some need for revision is felt including more attention to those
often neglected activities such as gardening and handicrafts.



- 7 -
20.       School attendance in the primary and secondary cycles is satisfactory
and reflects the parents' and children's zeal for education. Repeaters are
few in number; automatic promotion of students is the general rule in all
Regions. The enrolment pyramids (Annex I, Charts 1-4) show what might be
mistaken for excessive "dropping-outt" of students. Reasons for the decrease
in the number of students from one to the next higher class are twofold: the
expansion of schooling facilities which, starting from the lowest class,
takes six years to reach the highest; and the existence of a large number of
schools which stop short of the full cycle. Taking 151 schools where
higher classes have existed for many years, the number of children in
primary grade 1 was found to be 6,500 in 1960. Of these, 6,340 children
appeared in grade 2 in 1961, 6,130 in grade 3 in 1962, and 6,030 in grade 3
in 1963. The "wastage" between grades 1 and 4 is about 7% which is not
excessive. Similarly, by taking 72 other schools, their enrolment in grade
5 was 2,990 children in 1961. For grades 6 and 7 in 1962 and 1963, the number
of children was found to be 2,980 and 2,960, respectively. The wastage
between grades 5 and 7 for this group is less than 1%.
(c) Secondary education
21.       Secondary education in all regions is of 5 years, duration and        V
leads to the West African School Certificate (WASC). A general course is
prescribed for Forms I - III. In Forms IV and V students can elect subjects
for specialization either from the sciences and mathematics groups or from
literary subjects. The curriculum is based on the English system of
secondary education. Sufficient attention is given to English which is
greatly enhanced because other subjects are taught through that medium.
Mathematics include algebra and geometry and reach an acceptable level.
Sciences, biology, physics and chemistry are treated in a general way in the
first three years and more deeoly in the higher classes for those who desire
to specialize. Adequate facilities for science teaching are not available
in all schools with the result that many prepare only for literary subjects.
Social sciences, which comprise history and geography, are general in nature
and cover a wide field.   Candidates for 1.ASCn Q_tte      certain_cmEp_Losry

U.S.A.                68.9
Excluding enrolments in teacher training and technical schools, the following
table shows the progress so far achieved in secondary education:
Secondary education

East                  23,091        4,532        27,623           2.18%

Of the above totals, only 2,554h students are in VIth form.  Nearly all who
pass the final VIth form examination find their way into university. Most
developing countries aim to have total secondary school enrolment at 20% of
the total primary. The last column of the table given above shows that
Nigeria is far below this aim, its shortage of secondary students constituting
one of the bottlenecks in education and in development. Expansion of second-
ary education including the VIth form is, therefore, an urgent need in Nigeria.
23.       Primary pupils are exclusively in day schools;   the overwhelming   v/
majority of secondary school students are in boarding schools because they
are scattered over a wide area, beyond commuting distance from their homes.
Attempts to reduce the number of boarders and increase day-students' facilities
have met with limited success. For a long time to come any expansion of
secondary education must take into account the provision of boarding facilities
24.       Secondary schools, particularly in Northern Nigeria, have so far
been dependent to a great extent on expatriate staff recruited from the
United Kingdom. A considerable number, likely to increase appreciably in the
near future, is now provided by the U.S. Peace Corps. Canada also provides
a small number. But expatriates and volunteers only stay for a short time.
This dependence on foreign staff will continue until Nigerian secondary
school teachers become available in sufficient numbers.
(d) Teachers and teacher training
25.       Teacher training institutions are operated by Governments or by



- 9 -
Voluntary Agencies; local education authorities play only a minor part.
Primary and secondary schools have at oresent non-graduate teachers in
Grades I, II and III. But Grade III teachers and their training colleges
are disappearing because the trainees are recruited immediately after the
primary cycle which does not give them an adequate academic background.
Grade I teachers are in secondary schools, in training colleges and posts of
special responsibility in primary schools. Graduate teachers, trained in
university Departments of Education, are appointed in the grade of Education
Officer. Trade and technical school staffs occupy special grades. Fringe
benefits, also enjoyed by other government employees, include the provision
of furnished housing at uneconomic rents, availability of building loans at
low interest and free medical services.
26.       There is a continuing shortage of trained teachers at all levels.   V'
Many secondary, technical and teacher training schools are below establish-
ment. An acute shortage is for Nigerian teachers of science, mathematics
and trade and technical subjects; but rising enrolment in universities,
increased provision of places in advanced teacher training colleges and the
proposed .National Technical Teacher Training College should provide relief.
Dependence upon expatriate personnel varies between Regions. In the North,
it will continue for some time to come. In the other Regions, Nigerians
occupy nearly all positions of responsibility and give confidence in their
ability.
27.       In teacher training the plan is to give trainees a good background
of general education in addition to the elements of pedagogy, psychology,
methods of teaching and sufficient practical training in teaching. Primary
school staff training is conducted at two levels; Grade IIT teacher trainees
usually recruited after completion of the primary cycle and Grade II recruited
after completion of at least three, or in some cases, five years of secondary
education. Graduates of Grade III teacher training schools may also be
admitted to Grade II schools for further training.   The duration of the
Grade II course is two years, except in the North where it is of three years?
duration. For staffing lower secondary classes, Grade I advanced teacher
training colleges admit trainees after completion of five years of secondary
school. Grade IT teachers are also admitted. The duration of the course is
three years. For higher secondary classes the aim is to employ university
graduates with or without teacher training, but it is not uncommon to find
Grade I teachers in these classes.
28.       Primary school classes contain varying numbers of pupils but 30
students per class is the rule for secondary schools. While this figure
permits efficient teaching, it is considered that a class enrolment of 36 can
still be satisfactory and allow a 20% increase in enrolment with very little
increase in expenditure. Indeed, 40 pupils per class in the lowver secondary
could well be allowed in developing countries.
29.       Teacher training facilities exist in varying degrees in Nigeria.
The number of trainees by Region and level is shown in the following table:

The yearly output of graduates is estimated at 13,500; by no means an insigni-
ficant figure. According to latest statistics (1962), the number of teachers
employed in the whole of Nigeria is 96,965 in the primary and 9,125 in the
secondary. The following tables show their distribution by Region and by

(e) Technical education and vocational training
30.       The Federal Adviser on Technical Education is in charge in the
Federal Territory. He also advises on development throughout Nigeria. Each
Region, except the Mid-West, has an officer at its Ministry of Education
responsible for technical education. A fairly common policy throughout
Nigeria governs the recruitment of students, staffing, curricula and
examinations.
31.       Sub-orofessional or technician training (Annex III-A) is provided
at Yaba College of Technology in the Federal Territory; Kaduna Technical
Institute in the North; Ibadan Technical College in the West; and at Enugu
Technical Institute in the East. All provide full-time 2-year courses in
civil, mechanical and electrical engineering, leading to City and Guilds
of London Institute (C.G.L.I.) Ordinary Certificates. Additionally, Yaba
offers a further 2-year course leading to the C.G.L.I. Higher Certificate,
and has full-time courses in secretarial work, accountancy, art and printing
and part-time day and evening courses in art, printing, laboratory technician's
work, commercial subjects and engineering; Kaduna has part-time courses for
agricultural, veterinary and textiles technicians and in commercial subjects;
Ibadan, now changing from C.G.L.I. syllabuses to internal curricula and quali-
fications, includes a course in town planning; and Enugu adds C.G.L.I. full-
time courses in telecommunications and a number of evening classes. Entrants
are required to hold the West African School Certificate or the British
General Certificate of Education (G.C.E.) with passes in appropriate subjects;
promising students from trade centerS are also accepted and there is now a
sufficient number of applicants for all courses. The majority of students
are sponsored, being attached to a firm or government department when they
commence their studies, have their tuition fees paid, receive pay and vacation
training during the course and have employment waiting on completion.
32.       Trade training (Annex III-B) is available at Yaba Trade Center in
Federal Territory; at Kano, Bukuru and Ilorin in the North; at Ijebu-Ode,
Oshogbo, Owo and Oyo in the West; Sapele in the Mid-West; and at Enugu Trade
Center in the East. All offer 3-year full-time C.G.L.I. courses in four to
twelve of the following trades: agricultural mechanic, blacksmith, bricklayer,
cabinet maker, carpenter, fitter/machinist, electrician, instrument mechanic,
motor body builder, motor mechanic, painter/decorator, plumber, sheetmetal
worker and welder. In some cases, curricula are too long and unsuited to
Nigerian needs, but the National Development Plan for Technical Education is
intended to amend these. There are always many more applicants than places
available, e.g., in 1963, 10,000 applied for 180 places at Yaba. The standard
of work in general is high and employment prospects are satisfactory.
Craft or trade schools give a 2-year general education course followed by a
one-year course in basic manual skills to prepare pupils for entry to trade
centers or for employment as semi-skilled workers.
33.       Instructors number about 480 at present, which represents about
three-quarters of the present required figure of 600. The total requirement
will be about 1,300 by 1970. To meet some of the need, an ILO training
scheme for 25 students is operating at Yaba, shortly to expand to 120 students;
and a National Technical Teacher Training College is proposed, to have an out-



- 12 -
turn of 200 teachers per annum in Phase I, rising to 500 p.a. in Phase II.
A useful reduction in instructor employment could be gained if all Regions
would follow the West in having classes of 18 students, as against 6-12
student groups found in other Regions. Expatriates will be needed for some
years and the system of recruitment and conditions of service need early
overhaul if existing and new vacancies are to be filled without delay.
Liaison with industry is inadequate. Few technical training institutions
have an effective advisory committee and not all Principals seemed fully
acquainted with industrial needs and conditions in the area of their school.
3h.       Training by industry is provided by a few firms and government
departments, notably the United Africa Company with apprentice schools at
Kano, Burutu and Sapele; Shell B.P. Petroleum Development Company at Port
Harcourt and the Union Trading Company, Limited, at Enugu. Nigerian Railways,
Nigerian Ports Authority and the Electricity Corporation of Nigeria have
apprentice training schools and the Ministries of Communications and of Works
train craftsmen and technicians, (Annex V).
(f) Higher Education
35.       Under the Nigerian constitution, higher education may be the dual
responsibility of the Federal and Regional governments and both are permitted
to create universities. The University of Ibadan was founded as a university
college in 19h8 and in special relations hip with the University of London
until independence, receiving full university status in 1963. In the 1962/63
session it had 1,705 students in the faculties of agriculture, arts, economic
and social studies, medicine and science. It also has an Institute of
Education, the Nigerian Institute of Social and Economic Research, and an
Institute of Child Health as well as a teaching hospital. The University of
Nigeria at Nsukka was created by the Easterm Region Government in 1955 and
has faculties of arts, social studies, science, technology and research. There
are 18 component colleges, including colleges of architecture, business adminis-
tration, education (with adepartment of vocational education ),,}engineerring,
finance, secretarial studies,            (with departments of estate management
and land surveying), agricultural and veterinary science. Nsukka differs
from other Nigerian universities in having a strong American background.
Students with IJASC (see para.21) are accepted as undergraduates but are
required to attend for an additional year of study as against those who enter
from the VIth foxm of secondary schools.
36.       Ahmadu Bello University was set up in the North in 1962 and its main
buildings were formerly the Nigerian College of Arts, Science and Technology at
Zaria but it has other sections at Kano for Arabic, Islamic studies, Agri-
cultural Research and Special Services and an Institute of Administration.
It was opened in 1962 with 467 students, in faculties of agriculture and
veterinary science, Arabic and Islamic studies, architecture, arts, engineer-
ing, law and science. The IUniversity of Ife is to have its main buildings
at Ife, but is at present in the Ibadan section of the Nigerian College of
Arts, Science and Technology. It opened in 1962; the enrolment in 1962/63
was 244 students in faculties of agriculture, arts, economics and social
studies, law and science. Faculties of engineering and medicine may be
developed later. The Pharmacy course inherited from the Nigerian College



- 13 -
is being continued. The UJniversity of Lagos was instituted by the Federal
Government in 1962 and includes a Medical School as a completely autonomous
unit within the University. It has also faculties of commerce and business
administration and law. Enrolment in 1962/63 was 101 students.
37.       All these universities are independent and autonomous but national
in outlook, admitting students solely on criteria of academic merit. The
overall national interest is guarded by a National Universities Commission,
a National Manpower Board, and an All-Nigeria Academic Council. The duties
of the National Universities Commission, which held its first meeting in
1962, include advising the government on the financial needs of university
education, assisting in planning the balanced and co-ordinated development
of the universities, receiving annually a block grant from the government and
allocating funds to the universities. The Commission is expected to exercise
a considerable measure of control, mainly financial, in the interests of
economy and cohesion and to avoid any wasteful duplication of faculties.
38.       Entrance qualification, except in the case of the University of
Nigeria at Nsukka, is the Higher School Certificate (H.S.C.) or G.C.E.
(Advanced Level). As a temporary measure, candidates with a Grade I(WASC) or
five credits in G.C.E.(Ordinary Level) are admitted to one year preliminary
course on the results of a Concessional Examination which will be discontinued
as soon as there is a sufficient number of VIth form applicants from secondary
schools. At Nsukka, the basic qualification is the WASC or GCE (Ordinary
Level) but candidates must pass the University entrance examination before
admission. Candidates with HSC or GCE (Advanced Level) are admitted by
direct entry and may earr, credits for HSC and GCE subjects.
39.       Staffing problems confront every university.   In a number of
instances, posts advertised in 1962 remain unfilled. The causes include the
great expansion of university education in the English-speaking world and the
unfavourable conditions of service offered by Nigerian universities as
compared with those offered elsewhere. Bilateral assistance and sponsorship
between Nigerian and United States universities have provided only a small
measure of relief. The University Commission Report, 1963, calls for more
uniform salary scales and conditions of service for all university professors;
a greater effort to train Nigerian graduates for an academic career; and a
reduction in the existing student/staff ratio as high in some instances as
20:1. Present and future estimates of enrolment are shown at Annex VI-A & B.
It is hoped that approximately half of the students in arts, natural sciences
and social studies, or about 2,500 students, will train as teachers for
secondary schools and training colleges.
40.       Adult education has not so far been developed in Nigeria except in
the form of evening classes in technical subjects, organised by certain
technical colleges, and university extra-mural classes. Great scope remains
for the expansion of both these forms of part-time classes and for recreational
and educational classes for adults organised by Ministries of Education.

III.  FINANCING EDUCATION
41.       National Development Plan 1962-1968.   Among the top priorities of
the six-year National Development Plan 1/ is: "(the acceleration) of
education of all kinds and at all levels but primarily the education of
technical and managerial manpower". 2/ The Plan stresses the lack of skilled
labor force in all sectors of the economy and Nigeria's heavy dependence for
professional staff on expatriates and technical assistance. The Plan document
originally envisaged total capital expenditures during the six Plan years of
P1,820 million equivalent, of which 50% was to be financed from domestic
resources. The allocation of 10.8% or $196 million to the education sector
reflected the high priority given to education. In the first two years of the
Plan period, i.e., 1962/63 and 1963/6h, total capital expenditures have amounted
to $390 million equivalent, of which 9% or some $36 million have been allocated
to education. This disappointingly slow rate of progress in the Plan as a
whole is attributed to four major factors: the large volume of projects
carried over from earlier programs, some shortages of skills and experience to
prepare and implement projects, the very slow inflow of external loans and
grants, and the lack of sufficient domestic resources to make good the short-
fall in external assistance. Slowness in decision-taking, especially in the
Federal Government, and the time-consuming processes involved in securing
external loans have also contributed to delays in implementing the Plan.
42.       The outstanding features of the financing of the government programs
in the first two years of the Plan have been the extent to which domestic
resources have been used. Whereas the Plan assumed that 50% of capital
expenditures would be externally financed, only 14% was so financed in 1962/64.
In financing 86% of capital expenditures so far, heavy inroads have been made
into accumulated funds, internal borrowing capacity and the resources of
government agencies.
43.       The Plan targets are now unrealistic of fulfillment in the remaining
Plan years.     Projects originally valued at some $1,820 million are now
valued at some 62,240. Given the expenditures of $390 million in 1962/63 -
1963/64, the Bank estimates that overall expenditures (including foreign aid)
during the whole Plan period are unlikely to exceed $1,500 million. Since
only roughly three-quarters of projects available for financing contain any
sizeable foreign exchange component, the major gap in attainment of the
minimum projected level of expenditure is foreign aid.
1/ - For an appraisal of the Development Plan see "Current Economic Position
and Prospects of Nigeria"., December 31, 1963, Report No.AF-17, particu-
larly Vol. III.
2/ - See National Development Plan, p.21.



- 15 -
44.       While it is possible to arrive at overall estimates of the probable
levels of domestic and foreign financing availabilities of the Plan, it is
not feasible to attempt sectoral allocations of this total.    Qualitative
judgments can, however, be made.   The education sector together with industry
and agriculture is one of the three priority sectors in the Plan.    Given the
original allocation of over 10% of total resources and the known under-
estimation of projects, it seems likely that the education sector may be
expected to require a higher proportional allocation of the scaled-down
estimate of probable expenditures during the Plan period.    However, the
education budgets already consume a high proportion of available domestic
resources and foreign aid is likely to fall short of the expectations of the
National Development Plan.   Wlithout IDA financing of the projects examined
in this report it seems impossible for the education targets of the Plan to
be realized to any effective degree.    IDA financing of these projects will
not only directly assist a priority sector, but will also help to reduce the
foreign aid gap in the context of the whole Plan.    Financing of a considerable
portion of the local currency costs of these projects will serve a dual
purpose: it will enable the education budgets to finance these projects and
reduce pressure on domestic resources needed for the other top priority
sectors of agriculture and industry.
45.       Foreign Assistance for Education.  Foreign aid so far provided has
been mainly limited to assistance in the form of provision of staff, technical
assistance and training and offers of scholarships.    In 1963 assistance in    >
teaching, other than University, amounted to 356 persons, of whom 304 were
Peace Corps, and is expected to increase to about 850 in 1967/68, indicative
of the expected expansion in teaching requirements and of the shortfall in
Nigerian staff.   Various Foundations provide technical experts within the
Ministries of Education.   The Universities seem likely to continue to be the
main recipient, in the education sector, of external assistance.    The nature
of education assistance, i.e., package assistance that includes payment of
recurrent costs, prevents an accurate estimate of specifically capital
assistance from abroad.
46.       Domestic Financing of Education.  The education sector has foremost
priority in the Development Plan; therefore the bulk of education projects
that have not yet been financed can be considered as top priority projects
eligible for financing.   The projects described in this report are not only
those identified as feasible for Bank/IDA financing but also those which have
been selected as of top priority within a priority sector.    Thus, technical,
teacher and science training are preferred to secondary arts and primary
education.   While the Nigerian Government itself stresses the importance of
the education sector, the amount of resources it can reasonably be expected to
allocate to education will be necessarily limited by the overall availability
of domestic resources and the demands on these limited resources from the
other two priority sectors.   Education is primarily a Regional responsibility
and financing of education capital projects must largely be effected out of
savings in the regional budgets.   The Regions are, therefore, faced with the
need to expand and improve specific education facilities in order to meet



- 16 -
their manpower requirements while at the same time taking care that their
total education recurrent expenditures do not eliminate budgetary savings
necessary to partly finance capital expenditure. Education recurrent
expenditure consumed 6% of the total recurrent expenditures in Lagos, 25% in
the North and over 40% in the East and West. During the last 5 years, these
ratios have been on the increase in the North and W4est, almost constant in
Lagos and on the decrease in the East. (See Appendix IX, Tables 7-10). In
addition to their budget resources, the Regions are expected to receive
some grants for education from the Federal Government, and their expenditures
will be supplemented in each Region by contributions from local governments,
Voluntary Agencies and school fees as described in the ensuing paragraphs.
47.       Federal Government Grants for Education.   Under the Development
Plan, the Federal Government is to support education projects amounting to
$40.9 million in the Regions (details are shown on Table 2 of Annex IX).
In 1962/63 no transfers were made; the 1963/64 estimates provided for an
allocation of $1.7 million to the Regions but, at December 1963, no part of
this allocation had been transferred. The sole disbursement to the Regions
for education in the Plan period at December 1963 was a lump sum grant of
$1.26 million to the National UJniversities Commission which was shared
equally between the three regional universities of Ahmadu Bello, Ife
and Nsukka.
48.       Regional Expenditures.   The Regions of Nigeria are financially
autonomous, have independent education policies and are at different stages
of educational development. Expenditure on education (Annex IX, Table 1) in
relation to available resources (assuming that total expenditures reflect the
level of total revenues) and to population, vary enormously. Table 2 illus-
trates the difference in emphasis in sectoral distribution of estimated
expenditures and Tables 3 - 10 (Annex IX) that of past expenditures. Each
Regional Government owns some schools which it constructs and maintains
directly, but this is to a greater or lesser degree a minor expenditure
compared with its grants to Voluntary Agencies and local authorities, who
construct and own the majority of schools in each region (Tables 3-10,
Annex IX). These grants comprise over 80% of education recurrent expenditures
in the East and West, over 50% in the North and 20% in Lagos and have absorbed
over 20% of total education capital expenditures in recent years.
Specific Regional Problems
49.       Northern Nigeria.  Scarcity of development capital for all sectors
of this most underdeveloped region of Nigeria, prevents adequate expansion of
badly needed education facilities. The 1963/64 education allocation was so
far below requirements or targets that stop-gap measures had to be taken to
increase the intake of students for 1964. The postponement of needed capital
works will impose an increasing burden on future capital budgets. Substantial
foreign capital assistance is required to remove a major bottleneck to economic
growth, i.e., scarcity of efficient and trained manpower in every walk of life.
5o.       The Mid-West.  The new Mid-West has so far continued the educational
policies of the West. (The effect on Western revenues and expenditures will
be to reduce them by about one-quarter). Estimated recurrent expenditure
from August 9, 1963 to March 31, 1964, was S8.96 million of which 44% was to



- 17 -
be absorbed by education. Grants-in-aid amounted to nearly 90% of the $3.92
million education recurrent expenditures and formed the whole of the
i104,000 capital expenditure on education.  Only those commitments
inherited from the Western Administration and non-postponable works were
financed out of the limited special capital expenditure of $771,000. It is
as yet too early to forecast the trend or level of Mid-West expenditures.
The expressed policy of the Provisional Mid-West Government to continue
universal free primary education can, however, only be an enormous drain on
limited resources that are urgently needed for more productive projects.
51.       Eastern and Wlestern Nigeria.  In Eastern and Westerm Nigeria the   v
burden of primary education has prevented adequate expansion of other
education facilities and has limited the development of other sectors of the
economy.  This is particularly so in the West where universal free primary
education was introduced in 1955 and where capital expenditures on primary
education absorbed over 40% of total education expenditures in the peak
years of expansion, and where overall education expenditures averaged 30% of
total capital and recurrent expenditures during the period 1955/62. While
the burden of primary education has previously been on the capital budget it
is now squarely on the recurrent side, absorbing about 65% of these expendi-
tures in the West.
52.       The Regional Ministries have all recently taken measures to reduce
or contain the share of primary expenditures in the budgets, by reducing the
number of school years, increasing the number of pupils per class and by
merging of non-viable Voluntary Agencies'schools.These measures, however
useful the savings they produce, cannot resolve the problem of the increasing
burden of primary education. The fundamental issue is how much primary
education Nigeria can afford and the extent to which the Pegional Governments
rather than the local authorities or the private sector should finance it.
In the West, East, and Lagos, primary education leads on a mammoth scale to
migration to the towns and unemployment, disguised only by the extended
family system which obliges relatives to feed and house indefinitely their
less fortunate brethren. Lack of secondary school places for the vast
majority of primary school leavers in southern Nigeria and the minimal
absorption of the remaining primary school leavers into the labor market make
it necessary that the whole question of government expenditure on primary
education be considered. The bottleneck in southern Nigeria today is not
illiteracy but rather semi-literate unemployed on whom have been expended the
resources needed to end the scarcity of technological and technical manpower.
53.       Local authorities.  The administration and accounting procedures
of local governments in Nigeria are, in general, inefficient,and considerable
uncertainty surrounds any estimate of their contributions to education. This
expenditure is a function of the level of local income and therefore varies
with the crop year. Tentatively, the local authorities probably contribute
from their own resources, i.e., excluding grants-in-aid from the Regional
Governments, some $11.2 million in both capital and recurrent expenditures,
compared with over-all government expenditures of about $84 million. The local
authorities contribute about one-third of their total resources (including
grants) to education - with authorities in the WVest contributing about 40%, in
the East about 25% and in the North about 20%.



- 18 -
54.       The local authorities contribute to education from their share of
tax revenues and by acting as tax collector for communities who voluntarily
incur a special levy for school building. While their participation,
financially and administratively, in education is already not insignificant,
the local authorities should be the obvious anm of government to take over
the increasing burden of education. An analysis of local government finance
and their greater incorporation into the development effort is being
undertaken in the North.
55.       The Voluntary Agencies receive about 75% of all recurrent grants-
in-aid paid in Nigeria. No realistic estimate can be made of money expendi-
tures from their own resources because missionaries tend to make indifferent
accountants and because expenditures, depending as they do on rather erratic
sources of financing, are made on an ad hoc basis. However, their contri-
bution - financed from donations from churches overseas and church collections
locally; the contribution by teachers of part of their salaries; and school
fees - is undoubtedly significant. The Voluntary Agencies also subsidize
education expenditures by constructing schools and residential quarters at
lower than standard cost with the voluntary help of local labor; by
recruiting staff at lower than government salaries; remission of fees in
needy cases; and by provision of scholarships for higher education. They also
maintain about 1,000 unaided schools. The disadvantage of a Voluntary Agency
system is that the competition for pupils between different bodies often
leads to schools not being efficient in the sense of maximum utilization, in
choice of location or efficiency of administration. No firm control can be
maintained over expenditures, so that grants-in-aid are often based on average
rather than actual costs, leaving room for profit making. Lastly, since
Voluntary Agencies physically control the majority of schools in Nigeria, they
can, to a certain extent, influence the terms of grants-in-aid.
56.       Grants-in-Aid Regulations.   Grants-in-aid regulations differ in
each Region.  Basically two systems are followed for recurrent grants:
(i)  a direct lump sum grant is made per pupil for a portion or
100f of the assumed average cost to the school of teaching
and maintaining that pupil;
(ii)  another system is that of the assumed local contribution
(A.L.-C.). Under this system a-primary school is provided
by government with a grant covering the salaries of the
approved number of teachers and a contribution of about $22
per recognized class. From this total is deducted the A.L.C.
which ranges from 10 to t17 per primary pupil depending on
his grade. For secondary classes, the school is provided with
a grant covering (a) the salaries, according to the government
salary scale, of the approved number of teachers, (b) allowance
for expatriate staff, (c) special responsibility allowance
for some senior staff and (d) a sum for other expenses amount-
ing to about $8 per secondary pupil. From this total is
deducted the A.L.C. which is about $50 per secondary pupil.
The West has attempted to involve local authorities in the
grants-in-aid system by making them responsible for the



- 19 -
recurrent maintenance costs of primary education (five
shillings per pupil), but the authorities are in arrears
for these payments, amounting to over $280,000 for mid-1961
to end-1962.
57.       Capital grants-in-aid regulations vary considerably between Regions.
For primary schools the East currently makes no grants for capital expendi-
tures; Lagos, on an ad hoc basis, has provided 50% or more of capital costs;
the West and North pa7ya6Tht half the average costs of a classroom. About
half the cost of secondary school construction is reimbursed in the West,
the basis for calculation being average cost of government buildings less
a discount for Voluntary Agencies; the grant depends on approval of the
school, generally after 3 - 5 years.  In the North, reimbursement is almost
total and immediate, based on plans submitted by the Voluntary Agencies, a
system which has enabled additional buildings or staff housing to be built
from the excess of receipts over expenditures.
58.       School Fees.  A comparison of school fees in all regions and for
all sectors of education shows relatively minor differences in level, except
for the higher fees charged in the Federal Territory and accounted for largely
by the higher cost of living, and are universally indicative of the heavy
burden borne by the private sector. Fees in the East (about $70 per annum)
are somewhat higher than those in the West and North ($42-$56 per annum) for
day secondary schools. Primary education is free throughout in the West
and Lagos and in the first two classes in the North and East. It ranges from
$2.8 to $14 per annum in subsequent classes in the North, and $14 to $22 per
annum in subsequent classes in the East. Fees of this order are feasible
against an average per capita income of $84 per annum only through the
extended family system and the willingness of beneficiaries to accept
financial responsibility for others immediately upon becoming a wage earner.
The intense desire of Nigerians for education has in the past partly been
prompted by the high return obtained from investment in education. While
secondary grammar and higher education still bring high returns everywhere,
primary education in southern Nigeria is increasingly leading only to
unemployment. only in the North is the return on investment in primary
education still considerable - raising the beneficiary to an initial money
wage of a minimum of some 41364 per annum.

IV. THE PROJECT
59.       The project proposed for financing by IDA development credit
envisages the expansion of secondary, technical and teacher training schools;
the construction of a r
and metalwork and woodwork shops to a number of existing secondary schools.
Details--afes                                   attacsheRE-tt9 ft. XOftc'ipeuf eal
importance are the c'oWstuc9tTon of (i) an Advanced Teacher Training College
for Northern Nigeria greatly needed to produce Nigerian staff to remedy
the present dependence of secondary schools on expatriates; (ii) a National
Technical Teacher Training College in Lagos to train technical college and
trade center instructors for the whole of Nigeria; and (iii) laboratories
and workshops required to rectify the prevailing strong bias t-oiREas-pul±iy
academ&ic stiies.
60.       The total cost of the project is about $30 million of which about
$I2.11 million is in the Federal Territory of Lagos, $2.89 million in the
Western Nigeria, $1.57 million in the M4id-West, $3.96 million in the East and
$19.47 million in Northern Nigeria.      The figures include consultant fees
and contingencies. About 66% of the total cost of the project is for school
buildings including laboratories and workshops, 18% for staff houses and 15%
for furniture and equipment. The foreign exchange component is approximately
37% of the total cost. Analyzed by type of training, about 8.4% of the total
cost is for teacher training, 32.2% for technical training and 59.h% for
general secondary education and provision of laboratories and workshops
in secondary schools. By far the major part (about 73%) of the amount
proposed for secondary education goes to Northern Nigeria where the need
is most pressing, and the rest is divided among the other Regions and the
Federal Territory according to their need. The additional annual recurrent
costs which the proposed project will create are within the ability of the
Federal and Regional Governments to meet. They are estimated to reach
$328,000 in the Federal Territory of Lagos, $927,000 in the West,
S566,ooo in the Mid-W4est, $922,000 in the East and $4.62 million in the
North; a total of $7.36 million for the whole of Nigeria.
61.       Drawings and/or schedules of accommodation are available for the
various items of the project. They appear reasonable as does the estimate
of costs. Since it is most unlikely that the Ministries of Public Wiorks
would be able to cope with a project of this magnitude, it is proposed to
engage a firm of architectural/engineering consultants to review, and where
necessary, amend the drawings, introduce uniformity to the extent possible,
make a final review of cost for possible saving and supervise the execution of
the project. Additions have been made to the original estimates of cost of
122% for contingencies and 2-1/2% for architectural/engineering consultants'
supervision fees. The following paragraphs give details of the various items
of the project in each region. Annex X lists the proposed items with
estimated costs.



- 21 -
(a) Secondary Education
62.        The proposed project includes expansion of secondary education in
all Regions at an estimated cost of about $17.8 million, including consultant
fees and contingencies.     As shown at para. 22, the proportion of Nigerian
children attending secondary schools is far below that in most other countries
and, unless early steps are taken to increase the number of secondary school
places, there will be considerable shortfall bjthe o.u-turn from Forms V and

The additional teachers needed will come from the Advanced Teacher Training
College at Zaria, Ahmadu Bello University and recruitment of expatriates. The
expansions will use existing standard designs for classrooms, laboratories,
etc.   The cost of the project is estimated at about $12.82 million.

Science laboratories are also to be added to each of the 7se-condiarY modern

The estimated total cost of the project is about $836,000.        Teachers now
training overseas and outstanding trade center students will be available in
sufficient numbers to staff the practical classes.
65.        Mid-Western Nigeria is to expand Edo College in Benin from single-
stream to four-stream plus Sixth forms.      Another site has been acquired and a
new school building planned to raise enrolment from the present 133 to 800 by

been prepared and the cost of the new equipment and buildings, which would
include classrooms, laboratories, workshops, and students' boarding facilities
is estimated at about $0.83 million.
66.      Mid-Western Nigeria has only four secondary schools with Form VI
classes with a total enrolment of only 260 pupils and has urgent nead of
increased numbers to staff new government departments, to meet the needs of
commerce and industry and to provide university entrants. Form VI work is,
therefore, proposed in five more schools and a double-stream Form VI at two
other schools to raise total enrolment by 480.    Sufficient Form VI teachers
will be found from local sources and by Government and Voluntary Agencies re-
cruitment of expatriates.   In addition, manual training is to be introduced
into ten secondary grammar schools.linstructors are to be drawn fr-o-mapele
Trade eCntergrauates---and from industry; but there appears to be need for a
competent inspector in manual training to join the Ministry.    Simple but
effective standard designs are available for laboratories and workshops.
Total cost of this item of the pfro-je-is estimated at about $41Y9,U00
67.      Eastern Nigeria requested aid for the expansion of three grammar
schools to raise enrolment from 1,003 to 1,360 pupils.   Land is available at
each institution and standard designs will be used for dormitories, classrooms,
laboratories and staff quarters.   Work has already started at each of the
three schools but about $0.78 million is requested for IDA financing.    The
Regional Ministry wishes to assist 30 more secondary schools and 20 teacher
training-colleges to expand science teaching facilities so assisting more
students to qualify in science at Form V and Form VI levels and add to the
numbers entering scientific and engineering training.    The training college
expansion is to prepare more teachers for science teaching in primary schools.
Designs for the additional laboratories and the lists of equipment are
acceptable.   Staff will be drawn from the Owerri Advanced Teacher Training
College, Nigerians now training overseas and expatriates.   The estimated cost
of the project is about $1.92 million.
68.      The Federal Territory has a unique institution formerly called the
Emergency Science Center and now the School of Science.    Established in 1958,
it provides only VI Form science work to prepare students for university
entrance.   Enrolment is about 800 students, 450 day and 350 evening.   About
80% come from the regions.   Classes of 200 students attend lectures but divide
into groups of 30 for laboratory work.   Laboratories operate on a production-
line basis; students perform three experiments in each 2A hour period and 240
students pass through the laboratories each day.   Sub-standard boarding is
available for 64 students, most of the remainder living in lodgings in Lagos.
Two houses in Lagos have been hired for girl students. A proportion of students
are in employment and attend part-time day or evening classes. The percentage
figure for "A" level passes is high and most of those who are successful
proceed to university.   The advantages of the school are concentration on VIth
Form work and good utilization of facilities and specialist staff.    Most of
the school occupies temporary wooden buildings erected during World War II.
Maintenance has been minimal and the buildings are in poor condition pending
replacement.   It is proposed to rebuild the school on its existing site
with provision for 1,500 students, 1,000 day and 500 evening.    Based on previous
experience, no lack of entrants is anticipated.    Staff should be available in



- 23 -
sufficient numbers as all Nigerian universities expand their science,
mathematics and education departments. Plans have been completed and costed;
the estimate for Phase I, which excludes students' hostels, staff quarters and
assembly hall is about S934,000.
(b) Technical Education and Vocational Training
69.       The proposed projects also include the construction and equipment of
(i) 3 new trade training centers and the expansion of 6 similar centers;
(ii) 6 new craft or trade schools and the expansion of 10 such schools,
(iii) a national technical teacher training college and (iv) a building to
house a new technical examinations organization. The total cost is about
$9.66 million including consultants, fees and contingencies.
70.       Three of the new technical training schools are located at the
nopulous centers of Kaduna, Makurdi and Maiduguri in Northern Nigeria
where industry continues to expand. They will increase annual enrolment by
432 and follow the present pattern of full-time 3-year courses in trades
required by local employers. Courses for textile mechanics and radio and TV
servicing proposed for the Kaduna school have been deleted because the new
Kaduna Polytechnic is to be equipped for them. To maintain annual enrolment
at 144, the electricians course can be double-streamed and an air-conditioning
and refrigeration course added. Makurdi courses (Annex IV) show a boat
building course; this has strong support from the Northern Development
Corporation. Ertrants will be recruited from craft, comprehensive and
secondary grammar schools; no shortage of applicants is anticipated. Accom-
modation schedules are acceptable and estimated cost is $3.66 million.
71.          Eastern Nigeria also intends to increase enrolment in present
courses and add two new ones in its trade training center at Enugu. Annual
intake will rise from 73 to 154 and total enrolment from 215 to 462.   In
1963, 4,000 applied for 73 Trade Center vacancies and no shortage of applicants
is anticipated after expansion. Increased needs for staff will be met from
the new National Technical Teachers Training College (N.T.T.T.C.) and overseas
recruitment. In September, 1965, the adjacent Government Technical Institute
is to move and the Trade Center will expand into the vacated buildings,
requiring no additions but only modifications and some equipment at an
estimated cost of $159,000.
72.         Westerni Nigerian Government is to expand its four trade centers
at Ijebu-Ode, bihogoo,'Thwo afid Oyo. Present annual intake (Annex IV) is
272 students compared with the National Manpower Boardts figure 1/ of 2,247
yearly enrolment for 1963-1968. Expansion at each center will provide
instruction in nine instead of four or five trades, chosen to meet employers'
needs, and an annual recruitment of 648 students, an increase of 376. No
shortage of applicants will occur because the Region has some 700 secondary
1/ Western and Mid-Western Nigeria. See Annex VII - Manpower Board Survey -
Estimated Future Needs for Teaching Staff, 1963 - 1968. Technical
Institutes and Trade Centers.



modern schools whose students have limited orospects for further education and
employment. Acceptable accommodation schedules have been submitted and cost
is estimated at A2.05 million. It is possible that economies could be
affected by further study of school layout perhaps by the firm of consultants
oroposed to be employed.
73.        Mid-Western Nigeria proposes to increase the nine trade courses at
Sapele Trade Center to 13 (Annex IV) to meet employers' needs; annual intake
will then rise from 135 to 195 and total number of places to 585 students.
Sapele is situated in an industrialized and populous area and the trade center
is the only institution of its kind in the new Region. Entry to the center is
from secondary moderm schools. In 1963, 8,000 applied for 120 vacancies and
no future shortage of candidates is likely. Staff shortages, due to the recall
of all lWlestern Nigerians employed at the Center, will be redressed by recruit-
ment from overseas and from the new N.T.T.T.C. A proposed agricultural
mechanics course was deleted because of likely unemployment; a re-organization
of workshops was agreed that reduced the need for additional workshops from
eight to one. Accommodation schedule is reasonable and estimated cost is
about $325,000 for building and equipment,
74.           Northern and Eastern Nigeria are in process of adopting selective
secondary education which incluces two yr!s of gensuBgtboL4itUbwe'rkshop
instruction) and then allocat-ionto-academic^,-.agricultural, .-te_ipca),
commercial and vocational coursfs. Vocational courses require one year and
are available in comprethensive, trade or craft schools. Northern Nieria
proposes to convert 10 existing craft schools and build another to provide
the more advanced syllabus and the one-year basis training course. These will
then form an important link in the system of technical education by supplying
students to technical training schools and semi-skilled workers to industry.
In due course, this craft school basic training will permit 2-year instead of
3-year trade center courses with a 50% rise in their intake. The 11 schools
will have at first an annual output of 576 pupils, later rising to 720,
most of whom will transfer to technical training schools. No shortage of
applicants is likely. Staffing may present problems unless early steps are
taken to train handicraft teachers. Cost is estimated at $l.35 million.
75.          Eastern Nigeria proposes as a long-term plan to establish 24
trade or craft scnools to provide additional opportunities for primary school
leavers, to reduce the accent on academic secondary education and to provide
artisans for industry and recruits to trade centers. Eleven schools are to
be set up at once. Government will finance the conversion of six and IDA
assistance is requested for five which will be converted from four fonmer
Grade III teacher training col'leges at Ogoja, Nnewi, Orlu and Ogoni and a
former primary school at Nsan. Each school will have 300 pupils in a 3-year
course combining academic and practical subjects in Years I and II and with
workshop subjects increased to 28 periods out of 40 in Year III. The cost
of the conversions is 1940,000.
76.       The Federal Government plans to open a National Technical Teacher
Training College to train for technical institutions in all regions. Existing
technical schools are under-staffed, difficulty is found in recruiting
expatriates and more teachers are needed to meet the proposed expansion.



- 25 -
Estimates indicate that some 1,200 full-time technical teachers are required
by 1970; the majority of them should be skilled not only in their trade but
also in teaching.   At present, this need is partly met by sending at great
cost 20 - 30 Nigerian technical teachers each year to U.K. and by an I.L.0.
instructor training course at Lagos.    Urgent need thus exists for an
institution which will provide pedagogical training for instructors in
technical college, trade centers, craft schools and commercial subjects. The
college, for which a satisfactory accommodation schedule is available, is to
be constructed in two phases. Phase I will provide for the annual training
of 200 teachers and Phase II will raise it to 500 teachers. Pre-service
courses of 8 months plus 2 months' teaching practice and in-service courses of
5 months will be offered; the curriculum combining local needs with the
C.G.L.I. Technical Teachers Certificate syllabus.   Laboratories and workshops
will be equipped to illustrate teaching principles and also for instruction
in modern use of tools and equipment but it is assumed that all trainees will
be qualified and experienced in their trade or profession before enrolment.
An adequate supply of applicants is anticipated because technical teaching
posts pay higher salaries than the lower ranks of industry.    Construction
and equipment costs for Phase I are considered reasonable at $1.08 million
but this figure will require amendment if the bi-lateral aid which is likely
to supply staff is also offered for equipment.
77.      At present all technical institutes and trade center courses are
of two or three years duration and based on C.G.L.I. Craft Certificate
courses, known and accepted throughout the world.   Nevertheless, it is
generally agreed that the curricula in content and in length are not all
suited to the needs of Nigeria.   Transition from C.G.L.I. to Nigerian examina-
tions has commenced; a Nigerian Technical and Commercial Examinations
Committee of the West African Examinations Council is to take over the work
of external examining bodies.   The new Committee will be assisted by local
advisory committees and panels of examiners and for 2 years by two C.G.L.I.
experts.   Nigerian staff are to be attached to C.G.L.I. London offices to
gain experience.   Formation of the new organization is delayed by lack of
accommodation and assistance is requested for an examinations building in
Lagos at an estimated cost of $93,000.
(c) Teacher Training
78.      IDA credit is recommended for an Advanced Teacher Training College
at Zaria, Northern Nigeria, and a Rural Education Center at Umudike, Eastern
Nigeria.   The total cost of these two items including consultants' fees and
contingencies is $1.80 million to which should be added $0.73 million for
science laboratories in 20 teacher training schools.    The Advanced Teacher
Training College at Zaria in Northern Nigeria was started in temporary
buildings in 1962, to train secondary school teachers.    As a joint venture
between U.N. Special Fund (with Unesco as executing agency) and the Federal
and Northern Nigerian Governments, the U.N. Special Fund's allocation amounts
to $1.025 million; the government contribution is $2.050 million. Design is
by the Unesco School Building Center at Khartoum.    The duration of the Special
Fund Project is five years.   The Special Fund allocation provides salaries for
ten international specialists and a Principal, the cost of 129 man-month
fellowships and some equipment. Counterparts are to be trained. The 3-year
course of study includes education principles with practical teaching, English,



- 26 -
arts and physical education, and specialization in two major subjects,
selected from either English, French, Arabic, Hausa, history and geography,
or mathematics, general science, physics, chemistry and biology.
79.       Enrolment was originally intended to be 100 in 1962/63, increase
to 200 in 1963/64, 350 in 1964/65 and from there onward increase by 50
students annually until a maximum of 450 by 1967/68. The project started
with a first entry of 140 students now in their second year and recently 78
more students have been admitted. The present total of 218 trainees includes
30 girls. Lack of accommodation in the present temporary buildings makes it
doubtful if new entries will be allowed next year. Reference has been made
to the need for Nigerian teachers to staff secondary schools in the North
because expatriates are costly and becoming exceedingly difficult to recruit.
It is not possible to implement the much needed expansion in secondary education
without the provision of adequate teacher training facilities. Present
temporary buildings have neither the capacity nor the required teaching and
laboratory facilities and science teaching has not yet been started. The
drawings for the proposed college buildings have been prepared by the Khartoum
Center and are considered suitable. They provide dormitories for girl
students only. Total cost is estimated at $1.64 million.
80.       The Rural Education Center at Umudike in Eastern Nigerie: opened
in 1939, trains agriculture teachers for rural area schools. Only Grade II
teachers are admitted to the course. Married trainees bring their wives to
help in practical work so that they will spread the experience gained at the
Center among the communities in which their husbands will be stationed.
Married trainees are accommodated in modest 2-room flats with kitchen and
bathroom shared by two families. Land adjoining the house is allotted to
each family which husband and wife cultivate to grow essential foodstuffs.
Single teachers live in groups of four in blocks consisting of 4 bedrooms
and a common lounge. Each has his own plot of land for private cultivation.
In addition, each trainee has a small area of land to practice farming. They
practice farming for about 33- hours a day; classroom work is four hours daily.
The curriculum comprises general sciences (chemistry and physics), biology,
insects, soils, plant growth, poultry, elementary surveying, farm management,
hygiene and first aid. The staff comprises a Nigerian Principal and 3
university graduates of whom 2 are Australians and 3 junior teachers. To the
existing 60 acres which now constitute the school farm, 40 acres will soon
be added. The drawings show residential accommodation for 40 additional
trainees, one laboratory and a teaching block consisting of two classrooms.
The total cost is about $155,000.
(d) Staff Housing and Boarding Facilities
81.       As in other African territories, provision has to be made in many
cases for staff housing and for boarding facilities for pupils. Urban
centers are few and schools are placed in or near small towns where there is
rarely surplus housing available for rent by staff. Only a small proportion
of the student body lives in the town and lodging is unavailable for the
remainder.
82.       For most of the institutions of the present project, the Federal



- 27 -
and Regional governments included houses and flats to accommodate all the
staff required, the cost of which totalled $10.7 million and formed an
excessive proportion (34%) of the total cost of the project. It is inadvis-
able to provide housing on this scale and so support an undesirable policy.
In some circumstances, provision of staff housing cannot be avoided as, for
instance, where the institution is located away from any center of
habitation. Again, expatriate teachers must be given accommodation because,
without it, they would not come to Nigeria. Thirdly, boarding schools need
some resident staff, such as wardens of hostels and teachers to oversee
dormitories and feeding arrangements.
83.       To obtain a figure for the number of staff houses which should be
approved as part of a school building project, it was considered that houses
should be provided for all expatriate staff who, for a secondary school
might include the Principal, the Vice Principal (if any), two teachers per
Form VI class, one per Form V class and any housemasters or wardens who must
reside on the school premises. For teacher training colleges and
technical and trade schools where there must be at present a large proportion
of expatriates, housing must be supplied for all senior staff. The effect
of the criteria applied to staff housing reduces the cost of this item from
$10.7 million to e 5.3 million including consultantst fees and contingencies,
or about 18% of the estimated cost of the project.
84.       There exists a wide variation in the standards and costs of pupils,
boarding houses and need exists for more uniformity. Boarding accommodation
requirements also need examination; whether, for instance, an institution
near a large urban center needs to include dormitory accommodation for all
its pupils. In general, the boarding accommodation requested in the project
has been accepted because, for the most part, the institutions included in
the project are regional institutions, recruiting students from a wide area.

V. SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION
85.       Prior to the end of World War II the small amount of formal con-
struction in Nigeria was mainly confined to government projects in Lagos
and regional headquarters.   Ministries of Works provided professional
services and constructed most of their buildings with directly employed
labor.   School construction was mainly in the south and undertaken by
Voluntary Agencies using direct labor.   The building boom which began
around 1950 brought the construction industry to importance, increasing the
number of contracting and professional firms in Lagos and establishing a few
at regional centers; but Ministries of Works expanded little to meet the
additional work.   Some of the new construction in Lagos and the regional
capitals was of prestige building.   Shortly after Independence in 1960 the
boom ended and a recession has continued to this time.
86.       Building contracting firms comprise three general types: branches
of foreign or international firms; large Nigerian firms; and small Nigerian
"jobbing builders".   Larger contractors have a small administrative cadre,
often lacking technical training, who direct the work of a disproportionately
large number of craftsmen and laborers.   Government trade centers train in
the various building crafts but, on the whole, contractors give little
encouragement to technical training; many apparently prefer to recruit semi-
skilled labor and allow a form of training "on-the-job" for unskilled labor
to serve as apprentices.   There appears to be a lack of experienced super-
visors, such as foremen and clerks-of-works.
87.       Professional services: architects, engineers and quantity surveyors,
whether employed by government or private firms are, for the most part,
British trained.   Ministries of Works were formerly staffed almost entirely
with expatriates but, under Nigerianisation, they are being replaced or are
resigning voluntarily and the few experienced officers are unlikely to remain
long.   Recruitment of expatriates is difficult and the numbers of suitable
Nigerian replacements wholly inadequate.    There are at present some 40
qualified Nigerian architects, and more are being trained in Nigeria and
overseas but it will be some time before sufficient numbers become available
and Ministries of Works are expected to be under establishment for some years.
In the meantime, the demands on existing staff and the lack of mid-level
personnel leaves Ministries hardpressed to deal with new and routine work.
Indeed, new construction is almost beyond their capacities.    At the present
time, there is little evidence of the changes necessary if Government is to
set the lead in establishing standards in design, tendering and rules and
regulations for building trades and practices.    Although government has
commissioned outside experts to analyse its problems and suggest solutions,
little action has been taken to date.   A number of private firms of archi-
tects/engineers and quantity surveyors operate in Lagos with lesser numbers
in the Regions.   There are three Nigerian firms and European, United States
and international firms have established branch offices in Nigeria during
the past few years, particularly since Independence.    Very few Nigerians
are available for employment.
88.       Government school building design is the responsibility of the
Federal or Regional M4inistries of Works in consultation with officers of the



- 29 -
Ministry of Education.   There is a lack of sufficient coordination between
Ministries of Works and Education.   Generally on substantial contracts
private firms are employed to prepare designs and final drawings subject to
Ministry approval.   The Federal Ministry of Education employed only private
firms for its school projects until 1962. Standards of design vary con-
siderably - in quality, economy, finishings and space allocations and there
exists need for research, economy and some measure of uniformity of criteria
of space design and material specification.   Tendering and contract awards
purport to follow accepted systems but in practice there is good reason to
suppose that irregularities occur in the receipt and opening of bids and in
placing contracts.   Furthermore, statistics indicate that most government
contracts are awarded through direct negotiation with a contractor without
benefit of competitive tendering.    Construction supervision of buildings,
including the disbursement of funds, is fulfilled by provincial, and at times,
divisional engineers stationed in the field.   The previous comments on
staffing problems apply equally here but obtaining Nigerians for these posts
seems easier though adequate training and experience may be lacking.   Lack
of staff rarely permits architectural supervision or visits to the site.
Maintenance, financed by a government allocation of about 2% of the capital
cost, varies considerably between projects but appeared, in general, to be
barely adequate.
89.       Voluntary Agencies design, supervise and build their schools or,
for larger projects, engage their own architects, engineers and contractors.
Plans must be submitted to the Ministry of Education for approval.    Standards
of design generally show economy with maximum use of space and materials.
Indeed, Voluntary Agencies appear to obtain mcve value for their expenditure
which is, wholly or in part, reimbursed by government.    Contract methods vary
between direct hire and prime contracting.   For the latter, contract pro-
cedures follow normal professional practice, except that the bill of quanti-
ties method is often eliminated.   Maintenance is financed by the Voluntary
Agenciest allocation from government.   Standards could be improved.
90.       Building costs vary throughout the country, from region to region
and between buildings constructed for government and those built for Voluntary
Agencies.   The latter sometimes benefit from donated materials and voluntary
labor but, even after allowing for these factors government costs would still
appear to be high although conforming to current building prices.    It is
thought that they could probably be reduced by closer attention to such
matters as (i) bidding procedures (ii) space standards, and (iii) material
specifications.   With regard to professional services, the proposed project,
involving the construction of 10 new schools and additions to 182 others,
is considered to be beyond the capabilities of the understaffed and over-
worked Federal and Regional Ministries of Works.    There is need, moreover,
for a new approach to school building, if the project is to attain maximum
usefulness at minimum cost.   Greater co-ordination between Regions is re-
quired to achieve more economical and uniform design standards and, as
mentioned above, closer control over bidding and tendering procedures, greater
attention to space standards and material specifications and a higher degree
of on-site contract supervision.   For all these reasons, it is considered
essential that a firm of consultants should be appointed to oversee the
entire project.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECO.NENDATIONS
Secondary education
91.       Despite the progress achieved in expanding school facilities,
secondary school places are inadequate to meet the country's needs for
junior personnel in government service and private enterprise and for
entry to higher education.
92.       The cost of primary education will continue to weigh heavily
in Western and Eastern Nigeria and, since there is a tendency to abolish
school fees, special measures such as a local education rate should be taken
if other branches of education are not to suffer for lack of funds.
93.       CurriculaL_csho iu1dh ev.ised to make them better balanced and more
suitable foor                                                     escience
teachinigand manual training.
94.       EuDLato in rural science and agricultureneeds more _    phsiie
particularly on the practical side. Special teacher training should be
given           e stolmeet 
Teacher training
95.       Nigeria cannot continue to depend upon expatriate teachers.     The
training of teachers for secondary schools in advanced teacher training
colleges and universities should be accelerated.
96.       The training of local instructors for technical colleges, trade
schools and secondary schools workshops also requires acceleration but, in
the meantime, recourse must be had to expatriates for whom conditions of
service should be reviewed.    Additionally, more use should be made of skilled
craftsmen who, though lacking "paper" qualifications, make satisfactory
workshop instructors.
Technical education
97.       Technicians of all kinds are in short supply, as evidenced by
employers' statements and Manpower Board estimates.    In view of the planned
increase in industrialization and development of national resources, an
increase in technical training facilities and the introduction of manual
training into secondary schools are high priorities.
98.       Technical school curricula should not remain geared to City and
Guilds' curricula and examinations which, in their content and length, are
not all suited to the needs of Nigeria.    The establishment of the proposed
Committee on Technical and Commercial Examinations is a move in the right
direction which should remedy the present situation.
99.       In certain trades, the trainee-instructor ratio is too low and more
trainees could be admitted without lowering standards and without overburden-
ing instructors in workshops.



- 31 -
100.      Better use should be made of existing facilities by the expansion
of evening classes and by organizing courses in summer when schools are not
functioning.
101.      There should be closer liaison between industry and technical
schools.   Principals should constantly be in touch with the employment
market to assess the need for trained manpower and the trades that are more
in demand.   All technical training institutions should have advisory com-
mittees representative of local industry.   Government should also encourage
more industries to take apprentices and apprenticeship conditions should be
better regulated.
Boarding and staff housing
102.      For schools beyond the primary cycle, boarding facilities for
students should continue to be provided because of the wide areas which they
have to serve.   Daily transportation to and from these schools to minimize
the need for boarding facilities is costly to maintain in Nigeria because
roads are only available between big towns, excessive distances have to be
covered and the students come from widely scattered areas.    The scale of
boarding facilities wTill, however, be appreciably reduced if those whose
homes are within commuting distances from schools are admitted as day students.
103.      Some staff housing should be provided under the proposed project.
Expatriate teachers, whether recruited by government or provided under
bilateral programs, and essential supervisory staff must be accommodated;
suitable residences for rental are rarely available.   The present arrange-
ment of providing all teaching staff with housing should be discontinued.
Building construction
104.      Co-ordination between Ministries and between Regions is lacking in
planning buildings and selecting equipment.    Sizes of classrooms, laboratories,
dormitories and other facilities differ between Regions as also do building
costs. Voluntary Agencies costs are usually below those paid by government.
All Regions would gain if they could collaborate in bringing about a maximum
possible measure of standardization of buildings and equipment.
105.      Satisfactory procedures exist but are not strictly applied in bidd-
ing and contract awvards for government buildings.  The preparation of draw-
ings, specifications and estimates of costs are delayed and construction
supervision is handicapped by staff shortage in Ministries of Works.
106.      Engineers and architects are available but not in sufficient numbers
for a country of Nigeria's size.   The Ministries of Works are under-
established because many expatriates have left since Independence.    Some
years will elapse before Nigerian engineers and architects become available
in sufficient numbers to fill government vacancies and the requirements of
the building industry.

Recommendations agreed upon during negotiations:
107.      Subject to the conditions set out hereunder, the proposed project,
whose constituent parts are outlined in Chapter IV and Annex X, provides
a suitable basis for an IDA development credit in the amount of US$20 million
(equivalent to IN7.14 million)or about two-thirds of the total cost of the
proposed project including consultants fees and contingencies.    This would
cover all the off-shore component and part of the local currency costs.    In
addition to the usual conditions for an IDA credit, the following matters have
been discussed and agreed upon during negotiations:
(a) The Nigerian Governments have accepted competitive
international bidding wherever practicable for the
construction of buildings and the supply of equipment.
(b) In addition to the usual requirement that the Governments
provide funds necessary to complete the project, the Nigerian
Governments have undertaken
(i) to make available all funds and other resources
required for the operation of the schools in the
project, and
(ii) to maintain adequately the schools and equipment
in the project.
(c) The Nigerian Governments have agreed to engage a firm of
qualified consultants on terms and conditions acceptable
to IDA, to propose criteria and goals for economical school
construction, to co-ordinate school planning and design, to
advise on the employment of qualified architects, engineers and
contractors, to oversee bidding and contract procedures and
awards, and generally to supervise and approve construction
disbursement whether by government, local authorities or
Voluntary Agencies.   It has also been agreed that the same
firm of consultants would be engaged for all the regions to
ensure co-ordination and uniformity to the maximum possible
extent.
(d) It has also been agreed that the Governments should employ
qualified and experienced architects and engineers to assist
in carrying out the project.

v Calculated by converting local currency data to US dollars using the exchange rate of f 1 - $2.30; population data used are as of latest census results.
3/ Expenditures of the Federal Territory, are not strictly comparable to those of the Regions, since part of the Federal Territory expenditures benefit
the Regions directly (by grants) or indirectly (by provision of school places in Lagos for children from the Regions).    Also, the cost of living in
Lagos is considerably higher than in other areas of Nigeria, which partly accounts for the higher level of Federal Territory expenditures.
