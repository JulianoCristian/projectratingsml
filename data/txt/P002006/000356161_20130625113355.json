Over the past\n            three years of so several Banks economic reports have\n            advocated the blending of no-conventional finance with\n            conventional finance for Nigeria, in order to erase the\n            burden of debt service that would otherwise be incurred as\n            Nigeria took more and more loans for its development needs.\n            The IDA credit for education now will help to finance\n            construction of school in each of the regional subdivisions\n            of Nigeria, and in the Federal territory.
