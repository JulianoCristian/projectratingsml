Key lessons address first of all, the\n            need to gauge project design with the existing\n            institutional, and professional capacity in the country,\n            particularly in complex operations such as this one, which\n            could have avoided the slow implementation start of the\n            project, resulting from inadequate professional capacity,\n            and inexperienced management of the various executing\n            agencies involved. Road design underestimated construction\n            costs, a factor which could have been avoided had detailed\n            technical designs been completed prior to construction;\n            moreover, based on experience, much higher financial bids\n            are offered to previously estimated construction costs, when\n            updated road design studies are unavailable at bidding.\n            Furthermore, to ensure design quality, the terrain and\n            climate conditions needs to be reviewed. As such, due to\n            conditions in the Andean Mountains, full rehabilitation\n            where possible, and reduced rehabilitation in critical\n            zones, would have been appropriate. Performance indicators\n            should be in place to monitor implementation, as well as\n            institutional performance, to identify, and solve difficult\n            issues early on. The absence of qualified personnel from\n            executing agencies, calls for specific technical training\n            programs to be developed, or, include experienced\n            international consultants."}, "docdt": "2000-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
