The project will consist of\n            five components, the most important concerning road\n            rehabilitation. Six roads totalling 725 km will be\n            rehabilitated under the project. In addition, this component\n            will include: (i) a bridge program involving the acquisition\n            and recovery of Bailey bridges and the reconstruction of\n            derelict old bridges; (ii) a pilot maintenance program\n            focussing on 620 km of road in a specified corridor; and\n            (iii) a traffic safety program. In parallel, the project\n            will support government efforts to rebuild an institutional\n            structure capable of maintaining the road system. The second\n            component will help to privatize and rehabilitate the\n            railway, by: (i) reducing staff redundancy; (ii)\n            rationalizing railway debt; (iii) closing down or receiving\n            budgetary transfers from the Government for unprofitable\n            services; and (iv) rehabilitating track, telecommunications\n            and locomotives to keep the railway in operating condition\n            while the privatization process is underway. The third\n            component concerns the rehabilitation of Lima's airport\n            runway which is in urgent need of repair, before it becomes\n            in danger to aviation. The fourth component will be a pilot\n            project for non-motorized transport in Lima to test methods\n            of promoting the use of bicycles by low-income residents.\n            The fifth component, technical assistance and training,\n            will; (i) strengthen the institutional capacity for managing\n            roads and bridges, and support the creation and fostering of\n            an autonomous agency responsible for planning, operating,\n            financing, and administering the highway network; (ii) build\n            capacity to manage environmental issues; and (iii) assist\n            the railway in its privatization and improving its management."}, "docdt": "1994-02-17T00:00:00Z"}
