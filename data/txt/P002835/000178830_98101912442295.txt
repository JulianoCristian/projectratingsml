I. SECTORAL CONTEXT
Background
1.01      Togo is located on the Gulf of Guinea and bounded by Ghana, Benin
and Upper Volta. It covers 56,000 km2; population is about 2.4 million
(1977) and is growing at 2.7% per year. In the 1960s the average growth
rate of GDP was about 7% per year in real terms, among the highest in Africa.
Growth during the 1970s has been about 5% per annum in real terms, led by
exports of phosphate rock. World market prices for Togo's agricultural
exports, mainly cocoa and coffee, have been high during the late 1970s and
phosphates, the major export commodity, has enjoyed relatively good prices
after a period of wide fluctuations in 1974 and 1975. Sharp increases in
public investment and current expenditure during the past three years have
led to public finance problems which are now being addressed by a policy
of fiscal austerity. Per capita income was estimated at $300 in 1977,
although rural incomes are only about one-third of this level. Togo's future
growth will depend upon market conditions for its primary commodities, ex-
pected to be favorable for phosphates but mixed in agriculture, and upon the
successful operation of several large industrial projects recently implanted.
Growth of GDP is estimated at about 4% per annum over the next decade.
Agricultural Sector
1.02      Agriculture employs about 75% of the active population and accounted
for about 30% of GDP at factor cost in 1978, a decline from about 45% in 1973.
Although there has been substantial growth in the mining sector (phosphates),
this decline does not reflect any major structural change in the economy,
but rather a stagnation of the agricultural sector. Food crops account for
about 75% of agricultural production, the major staples being maize, sorghum,
yam and cassava, and industrial and export crops, principally cocoa, coffee,
cotton and palm oil, for the remainder. Agricultural production is estimated
to have increased in real terms by about 3.5% per year during the period
1966-70, but since then the marketed production of cocoa, coffee and palm-oil
decreased by about 50%, whereas cotton recovered from a decline in the late
1960s. Food crop production is estimated to have essentially kept up with the
growth of rural population, except for the two low rainfall years of 1976 and
1977.  As a result of production variations and price fluctuations the share
of agriculture in export earnings has varied between 25 and 50% in the 1970s,
with cocoa and coffee making up on average 85% of agricultural exports.
Cocoa and Coffee Subsector
1.03      Cocoa cultivation is concentrated in the Plateau region, in parti-
cular in the Litime and Kloto plains (Map 10536 and para 2.02). It is a
small farmers' crop, generally grown on holdings of between 2 to 5 ha. The
total area under cocoa is estimated at 42,000 ha, of which some 40% are older
than 30 years and require rehabilitation (Project File, Annex II). Very
little cocoa was planted in the 1960s because of low prices and the absence
of a development effort geared to provide farmers with technical assistance,



credit and improved planting material. In 1969, however, Government took
steps to provide support for the cocoa subsector. A capsid pest and swollen
shoot virus disease (SSVD) control was successfully initiated, and in 1971
a cocoa rehabilitation program with FAC (Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation)
financial and technical assistance was started. The first Cocoa-Coffee
Development Project (Credit 503-TO) was a follow-up to this program. Land
tenure problems, shortage of improved planting material, drought, and lack of
incentives for replanting caused a delay in achieving cocoa planting targets
and measures, such as introduction of a landowner-tenant contract, irrigation                à
of seed gardens, and an increase of the cocoa replanting premium, are being
introduced and would be strengthened in the proposed second project to
remove the constraints (para 3.02). Cocoa production has been variable, and
as indicated in the table below, since reaching a peak of 30,000 t in 1970,
has tended to decline.

1.04      Coffee is also planted principally in the Plateau region, essen-
tially in the Akposso and Dayes areas. In spite of favorable growing con-
ditions, coffee production has stagnated (table above), principally because
of two reasons. Firstly, the old coffee plantings are all of the outdated,
low-yielding Niaouli variety and, secondly, for more than a decade producer
prices have been set too low (Table 14) to induce growers to care for their
plantations. Also, Government has failed to provide the technical assistance
and improved robusta planting material needed to increase yields. The coffee



- 3 -
area is estimated at 60,000 ha (Project File, Annex I), although only some
40,000 ha are in production. Under the first project coffee re-plantings
progressed well and are substantially ahead of schedule (para 3.02). Never-
theless, projected production and exports resulting from both the first and
the proposed second projects are expected to be well within Togo's export
quota (para 6.07).
1.05      The significance of cocoa and coffee production and exports to the
Togolese economy is demonstrated by their 50% average share of total exports
during the 1960s and 30% during the current decade (para 7.02, table).
Their relative decline in importance since 1970 has been due both to declining
volumes of cocoa and coffee production and also to a sudden increase in the
value of phosphate exports as a result of the quadrupling of phosphate prices
in 1974. However, despite the expected growth of earnings from the mining and
mineral processing sectors, cocoa and coffee exports are projected to account
for at least 10 percent of total export earnings (goods only) through the
1980s and 1990s. Without the continuation of the replanting program under the
proposed second project, Togo's earnings from agricultural exports would tend
to decline in real terms. At the same time, environment and current levels
of technology preclude rapid agricultural diversification for Togo into
alternatives that are economically more rewarding. In any case, coffee and
cocoa are the only high-value cash crops that are suitable in the project
area.
The Institutional Framework
1.06      Responsibility for the agricultural sector is shared by two minis-
tries which replaced the Ministry of Rural Economy in 1975. The Ministry
of Rural Development (Ministere du Developpement Rural) is essentially con-
cerned with policy formulation and coordination of production activities, and
includes directorates for research, development, cooperatives and credit,
livestock, and training. The Ministry of Rural Equipment (Ministere de
l'Amenagement Rural) is concerned primarily with infrastructural development
and support services, and includes directorates for rural engineering,
pedology, plant protection, veterinary services, forestry and fisheries, and
produce inspection. A rural planning unit, created within the Ministry of
Rural Economy in 1973 to improve project preparation, has been transferred
to the Ministry of Planning and is now being transformed into a project
preparation unit. This unit (Bureau d'Examen des Projets) will eventually
become the Societe Togolaise d' Etudes de Developpement (SOTED), a parastatal
multi-disciplinary consulting bureau.
1.07      Execution of agricultural development projects is generally
entrusted to autonomous public corporations which are product-oriented.
Several corporations were established to deal with problems of specific
export crops, such as SONAPH for oil palm, SRCC for cocoa and coffee (para
1.11), TOGO-FRUIT for fruits and SOTOCO for cotton. Their responsibilities
range from supply of fruits and planting material and provision of extension
services to primary marketing and processing.
1.08      Agricultural credit is the responsibility of the National Bank
for Agricultural Credit (CNCA). Under the first Cocoa-Coffee Project



- 4 -
(Credit 503-TO) it implemented internal organizational and administrative
reforms, improved its operations considerably and stopped non-agricultural
lending. Furthermore, direct lending to farmer groups was successfully
introduced.
1.09      The Ministry of Trade supervises two marketing entities:  OPAT,
responsible for coffee, cocoa, cotton, palm oil and palm kernels, and TOGO-
GRAIN, for fooderops. OPAT's producer price stabilization program for export
crops produces sizeable surpluses for the Government. In the past these
have been used to finance development in general, with only some 6 percent
reinvested in agriculture. TOGOGRAIN is intended to play a stabilizing role
for foodcrops by timely interventions in the market. It has built six silos
since 1975 with a total capacity of 7,000 tons, which were filled for the
first time in 1978.
1.10      Agricultural research is carried out by French commodity-oriented
institutes such as IRAT for foodcrops, IRCT for fiber crops and IFCC for
cocoa and coffee (para. 3.03). Soil studies, classification, mapping and
analytical work are undertaken by ORSTOM (Office de la Recherche Scientifique
et Technique Outre-Mer). Government also created a multidisciplinary research
institute, the Institut Polyvalent de Recherches (IPR), which should eventually
become responsible for overall research coordination, basic research, and
laboratory services.
1.11      The National Cocoa and Coffee Development Agency (Societe Nationale
pour la Renovation et le Developpement de la Cacaoyere et de la Cafeiere
Togolaise, or SRCC) was established in 1971 with FAC assistance; it has
responsibility for development of the cocoa and coffee industries. Previously
this had been handled by the SORAD (regional development agency) of the
Plateau Region whose performance was unsatisfactory. SRCC objectives are
ta rehabilitate and further develop cocoa and coffee cultivation, including
the construction of the necessary infrastructure in the cocoa and coffee
area. SRCC has been responsible for managing the first project, and its
performance and financial control have been good (para 3.02 to 3e06). It is
proposed that in the second project, SRCC continues to be the project execut-
ing agency (para 5.01). As in the first project, it is important that SRCC's
financing be adequate and that it enjoy a sufficient degree of financial
autonomy to effectively carry out its functions. The proposed second project
contains provisions that would ensure sufficient and timely availability of
funds for project implementation.
Agricultural Development Strategy
1.12      The neglect of agriculture had long been an unfavorable feature of
Togo's investment performance. For instance, during the Second Development
Plan (1971-1975), due to preference for large scale projects in the modern
sector, actual investment in agriculture has fallen to about 6% of total as
compared with a planned amount of 15%. In the Third Development Plan (1976-
1980), however, agriculture ranks high in the priority list. With a projected



- 5 -
investment of CFAF 56 billion (US$255 million) or more than 20% of total
planned investment, the primary sector, including livestock, fisheries and
forestry, is expected to expand at an annual rate of about 5.2% within the
overall growth objective of 8%. The main objectives are to: (a) increase
food production,including maintaining food reserves against natural cala-
mities; (b) rehabilitate and increase traditional export crop production;
and (c) diversify into some new products.  Such goals are planned to be
reached while improving the regional distribution of development benefits,
particularly through the creation of regional growth poles based on hydro-
logical or agro-industrial development.
1.13      Foodcrop production is expected to grow at 3% per annum during
the Third Plan, or slightly faster than population.  Investment in foodcrop
development at the small farm level is projected at almost 40% of total
investment in the sector but a substantial share is expected to be provided
by the farmers themselves. There are specific programs for export crops.
It seems, however, that the Third Plan targets for 1980 are too optimistic
for cocoa and seed cotton, 18,000 and 38,000 t respectively, while planned
production for coffee, 12,000 t, and palm oil, 16,000 t, appear more realistic.
The envisaged cash crop diversification would concern essentially cashew-nuts,
fruits, tobacco and sugar cane. The Third Plan provides also for modest
development of livestock, fisheries and forestry.
Bank Group Operations in the Agricultural Sector
1.14      Bank Group lending to Togo stresses the integrated rural development
approach, small farm development and support to economically vital export
crops. To date three credits have been extended for agricultural projects:
(a) A first opportunity for IDA to invest in agriculture in Togo was
the Cocoa-Coffee Development Project (Credit 503-TO, for US$6
million, signed in 1974) the purpose of which was to support vital
export crops at smallholder level. This ongoing project comprises
the rehabilitation, planting and maintenance of 4,400 ha of cocoa
and 4,000 ha of coffee in the Plateau Region. While the coffee
component is ahead of schedule, cocoa is lagging behind (para 3.02),
mainly due to lack of incentive for farmers to uproot old trees for
replanting of new ones. Government is now more aware of the problem
and has in principle agreed to increased compensation payments for
old trees and credits to farmers (para 5.08). The overall replant-
ing targets (cocoa and coffee combined) are being met on schedule
and the project is well managed.
(b)  The Rural Development Project in the Maritime Region (Credit 638-TO,
for US$9.5 million, signed in 1976) allowed IDA to diversify its
involvement, still in conformity with the above stated objectives.
The purpose of the project was to improve and diversify production
of upland crops (maize, cassava, groundnuts, cowpeas and cotton);
develop lowland rainfed rice and vegetables; rehabilitate irrigation
facilities for existing vegetable production; renovate smallholder
coconut plantings; and provide the necessary support services and



6-
infrastructure for about 20,000 farm families. Foodcrop plantings
are on target, while rice and cotton targets are behind schedule,
mainly due to uneven rainfall. Due to drought-related shortfalls
in farmers' revenues, repayment of about 80 percent of 1977 farmers'
credit have had to be rescheduled.
(c)  Similarly, the Rural Development Project in Cotton Areas (Credit
741-TO, for US$14 million, signed in 1977) was aimed at providing
some 53,000 small farmers with technical assistance and inputs to
develop 24,000 ha of foodcrops, this time in rotation with cotton,
the area of which would be expanded by 20,000 ha, and to strengthen
the required infrastructure. The project became effective on March
17, 1978 and physical targets for the 1978 season have been met.
Project Formulation and Preparation
1.15      In the 1960s, cocoa and coffee production stagnated in Togo and very
little new cocoa and coffee was planted. Furthermore, because of low prices,
farmers neglected the maintenance of their plantations (para 1.03 and 1.04).
To remedy the situation, Government, by using FAC assistance, established SRCC
in 1971 to rehabilitate and expand cocoa and coffee cultivation by: (a) taking
advantage of research on cocoa and coffee carried out by the "Institut Francais
du Cafe, du Cacao et Autres Plantes Stimulantes" (IFCC) which had been estab-
lished in Togo since 1967; and (b) providing a package of services consisting
of extension, planting material, inputs and improved infrastructure. After
SRCC had been established, equipped and staffed, and multiplication of planting
material had been undertaken, the stage was set for the implementation of a
project in which smallholders would be assisted to replant and expand cocoa
and coffee plantations. On Government's request the Bank appraised such a
project in 1973 and an IDA credit of US$6 million was approved in 1974 (para
3.01).
1.16      The project planting target was 4,000 ha of coffee and 4,400 ha
of cocoa. The credit agreement stipulated that when 1,000 ha of cocoa and
1,000 ha of coffee had been planted, a study would be carried out to examine
the success or otherwise of SRCC and CNCA/PCU in achieving project objectives.
On the basis of its findings and recommendations a joint Government/IDA/FAC
(co-financier) decision would be taken as to whether a second phase project
should be prepared. During project execution it was agreed among the three
parties, that although there were delays in cocoa planting, preparation of
a second phase project should be undertaken, since the project was making
overall good progress (para 3.01 to 3.06). A combined evaluation and prepara-
tion study was carried out by SRCC, in cooperation with FAC, INDACOM (a con-
sultancy company) and RNWA. The proposed Second Cocoa-Coffee Development
Project was subsequently appraised in October 1978. The mission consisted
of Messrs. O. Honisch, A. Berthier, J. Franz, Ch. Redfern (IDA), J. Chartier
(Consultant), and was assisted by Mr. D. Brown of the Commonwealth Development
Corporation.

II.  THE PROJECT AREA
2.01      The project would be located in the western part of Togo's Plateau
region which is well suited to cocoa and coffee cultivation (Maps No. 10536
and 14213). The area, bordering Ghana, is roughly triangular in shape. It
is delimited by three urban centers (Kpalime, Atakpame and Badou) and covers
about 720,000 ha.
2.02      The topography is heterogenous, encompassing lowlands, plateaux and
mountains, and is divided into four zones:
(i)  the Kloto plain in the south, where both cocoa and
coffee are cultivated (altitude around 200 m);
(ii)  the Plateau of Dayes in the centre, predominantly coffee
(600 m);
(iii) the Plateau of Akposso in the north, also predominantly
coffee (600 m); and
(iv)  the Litime plain on the western border with Ghana,
predominantly cocoa (250 m).
The highest peak is Mt. Agou (986 m), located in the Kloto. Three rivers
are of economic importance: the Amou, the Sio and Haho, all originating
in the southeastern part of the area.
Climate
2.03      The climate is tropical with a bimodal rainfall pattern strongly
influenced by the mountainous character of the area. As a consequence,
the area enjoys generally higher precipitation than the rest of the country.
Rainfall averages 1,500 mm annually and is distributed over eight months in
more than one hundred rainy days. The four months dry season falls between
November and February. Mean rainfall, number of rainy days, recorded extreme
rainfall data per month, and coefficients of variation for representative
stations of the four project zones (para 2.02) are in the Project File.
Generally, the rainfall is considered adequate for cocoa and coffee culti-
vation; temperatures are favorable (annual mean 26 OC) and vary little over
the year (monthly means 250to 28 C).
Soils
2.04      A variety of soils occur in the project area.  They range from
weakly developed lithosols on the top of ridges to well developed soils
on plateaus and slopes, and to colluvial and alluvial soils on lower slopes
and bottomlands. The majority of cultivable soils are ferralitic, derived
from quartz or schist, with some ferruginous soils over granite or gneiss on
the eastern fringes of the area, and a pocket of very fertile brown soils



- 8 -
over basic rock around Mt. Agou. Generally, about two thirds of the culti-
vable soils are considered suitable for both cocoa and coffee cultivation.
Erosion is a problem, particularly in hilly areas, and control measures are
being taken which would be continued under the project.
Administrative Divisions, Demography and Farm Characteristics
2.05      The area consists of three administrative districts (circonscrip-
tions), Kloto, Akposso 2and Badou, and is estimated to have about 360,000
inhabitants (50 per km ) of which some 40,000 live in urban centers.  The
predominant ethnic groups are Ewe, Akposso, Kotokoli and Kabre. Farm size
distribution is skewed particularly in the Litime and in the plateau of Dayes
(Table 1).  The average number of persons and adults per farm family, crops
grown and average farm size are shown below:

Foodcrops            0.52
Total                2.02
From the above figures it is apparent that the average area per farm devoted
to food crops is small, with farmers tending to specialize in the production
of coffee and cocoa.
Land Tenure
2.06      In Togo, land tenure arrangements are more complex than is usual
in West Africa. Land rights are vested in the traditional village authority
under tribal law, but individual village members acquire quasi-permanent land



- 9 -
use rights which they may transfer to non-village members under rental or
sharecropping arrangements, a situation not found in most other West African
countries. For example, under one of the sharecropping systems used for
permanent crops, the tenant clears the land and plants, maintains, and
harvests the crop. For this he receives a certain proportion of the crop
(one-third to one-half), or is paid a fixed sum per harvested headload of
cocoa pods (in 1978 CFAF 800 per headload of 32 kg).  The rights of these
tenants are ill-defined and conflicts between landlords and tenants have
arisen. This system is practised in the cocoa producing area of Litime where
the lack of clear rights for tenants could be detrimental to the cocoa plant-
ing program. To remedy the situation in the Litime area a landowner-tenant
contract would be required. A draft model contract has been prepared by SRCC
and assurances were obtained during negotiations, that a satisfactory contract
would be introduced in Litime not later than by March 31, 1980 (para 8.01,a).
Communications
2.07      The project area has an excellent road connection with Lome and
there also exists a railway connection between Lome and Kpalime. Within the
project area, major rural centers are connected by very good tarmac roads,
and there is also an increasing number of rural roads, built with OPAT
financing or constructed by SRCC under the first project. However, there is
a need for another 300 km of feeder roads to reach remote villages in the
Plateaux of Dayes and Akposso, and in the area of Litime. These roads are
essential to the coffee/cocoa planting program and would be constructed under
the proposed project.
III. RESULTS OF FIRST PROJECT
3.01      The main objectives of the First Cocoa-Coffee Development Project
were the planting of about 4,400 ha of cocoa and 4,000 ha of coffee, strength-
ening the executing agency (SRCC) and the agricultural bank (CNCA), carrying
out applied tree crop research, constructing and rehabilitating about 160 km
of feeder roads and providing for a study to evaluate the project's results
and the feasibility of future investments in cocoa and coffee production.
Physical Achievements
3.02      The progress in achieving physical targets of tree crop plantings
up to 1978, and forecasts for 1979 and 1980, are as below:

Annual incremental production at full development from these plantings
based on a technical package consisting of extension advice, credit, supply
of improved planting material, pest control and fertilizer, is expected
to be about 3,300 t of coffee in 1985, and 1,300 t of cocoa in 1989.  As is
obvious from the above, the coffee planting program is substantially ahead
of appraisal estimates while cocoa plantings are only at half the estimates
but in the aggregate total cocoa-coffee planted by 1978 was nearly met. By
the end of the project in early 1980, the expected total of the two crops
planted would be about 92% of appraisal estimates. The cocoa planting pro-
gram had started off ahead of appraisal estimates as a result of the success-
ful swollen-shoot virus disease (SSVD) eradication campaign in the Kloto,
where about 2,500 ha of cocoa have been cleared since the start of the SSVD
campaign, and where many of the project plantings have taken place. Since
1976, however, the program encountered difficulties in persuading farmers to
cut down old cocoa trees for replanting and in supplying them with planting
material. The shortage of planting material was caused by droughts in 1976
and 1977 which severely damaged seed gardens and young cocoa plantings. To
prevent it happening again an irrigation system was installed for 9 ha of seed
gardens in 1977 and supplies of hybrid cocoa seed are now assured. Proposed
measures to make participation in the cocoa replanting program more attractive
to farmers have been discussed with Government and would include an increase
in the premium paid for cutting down old unproductive plantations (para.
5.08), and the introduction of a new contractual formula for reconciling the
interest of landowners and tenants towards replanting in the main cocoa
producing area of the Litime (para. 2.06). Producer prices increased slowly
over the past fourteen years, but in 1978 Government raised the producer price
of cocoa by 33% and of coffee by 24% (para 6.13 and Table 14). Furthermore,
Government would review annually the farmgate prices for cocoa and coffee, in
consultation with IDA, with the purpose of maintaining adequate producer
incentives. To facilitate these consultations Government would set up, with
the aid of the proposed Technical Assistance Project, a cash crop pricing
analysis unit in OPAT by March 31, 1980 (para 8.01(b).

3.03      Applied tree crop research has been carried out on the basis of
annual contracts between the Ministry of Rural Development, represented by
SRCC, and IFCC (Institut Francais du Cafe, du Cacao et Autres Plantes Stimu-
lantes). Research efforts were mainly oriented towards the introduction
of improved planting materials, the comparison of various Robusta coffee
clones and their multiplication, as well as screening and selection of suit-
able cocoa hybrids and, lately, interplanting of food crops in tree crops.-
Arabusta coffee (a hybrid of Coffea arabica x Coffea canephora) was introduced
in 1975 from the Ivory Coast and is being tested in three ecological zones
thought favorable to it. Recent trials include the comparison of yields and
generative progenies. The planting material research work has given good
results and twelve selected coffee clones and four cocoa hybrids are being
introduced in the project area (Project File, Annex I and Il). Intensive
screening is continuing and the outlook for more improved planting material
is favorable. Fertilizer trials with coffee are in progress but more precise
research work will be required before scientifically based and sub-ecology
oriented recommendations for fertilizer use can be made in the project area.
A pathology and genetics laboratory was created at Kpalime by IFCC in 1977.
It is aiming to establish screening and control of the swollen shoot virus
disease (SSVD) in cocoa. The work is well in progress, and in general IFCC's
work is considered satisfactory.
3.04      The first project included a road construction, rehabilitation and
maintenance program aimed at reaching some remote villages in the difficult,
largely mountainous area and open them up for project planting. An SRCC
Road Unit was established to carry out the program and this has been very
successful. Roads have been constructed on schedule, are of very good quality
and due to excellent planning and management costs are 20% below appraisal
estimates. By end 1978, 127 km of new roads had been built. This compares
with an appraisal estimate of 118 km to be completed by that date and a total
target of 160 km to be constructed by 1980.
Organization, Management and Finance
3.05      SRCC's management of the project planting program has been good.
There are, however, improvements needed regarding training and supervision
of the extension service. Shortcomings are caused mainly by a lack of
meaningful training, the absence of an experienced Head of the Extension
Service and a shortage of qualified medium-level technical staff. These
deficiencies would be remedied under the proposed second project by providing
additional key personnel and reinforcing the staff training program. Manage-
ment of the Project Credit Unit (PCU) has been punctilious but operating costs
have been high relative to lending. At present, annual costs are equal to 22%
of total loans outstanding. This is because (a) by mid-1978 loans outstanding
were only 43% of appraisal estimates; (b) some economies could have been made
in credit administration; and (c) the appraisal estimates underestimated to
some extent justified PCU operating costs. First loan repayments will be
collected during the 1978/79 marketing season for coffee planted in 1974/75.
Under the second project measures would be taken to improve PCU's financial
situation. This would include increasing interest rates, creating village
group centers and simplifying administrative procedures (para 4.09 and 5.06).

3.06      The financial situation of the project is generally good and control
exercised by the General Manager is excellent. However, it takes up a con-
siderable part of his time, and with the increased scope of the proposed
project the creation of the position of Financial Controller is essential to
maintain the quality of control and to train local staff. IDA disbursements
for the project are currently 90% of forecast and are expected to surpass
appraisal estimates by end 1979. The project will be completed in early 1980,
but CFAF 201 million (US$0.9 million) would still be needed for credit to
planters to bring first project plantings to maturity.  In addition, due to
the depreciated exchange value of the IDA credit of US$6.0 million, a further
US$0.5 million would be required to complete plantations, in the first half
of 1980, from planting material produced in nurseries established at the end
of 1979. Financing these two items is proposed under the second project in
order to avoid an interruption of the 1979/80 planting program. However, the
overall results of the first project can be considered as very satisfactory.
In effect, the total areas planted are expected to be close to appraisal
estimates, the number of beneficiaries will remain as estimated, the returns
per ha are expected to be about in line with appraisal, and SRCC is managing
the project efficiently.
IV. THE PROJECT
A.   Project Description
4.01      The project would be a continuation of the first Cocoa-Coffee
Development Project. It would be implemented over a five and a half year
period, and would have the following components:
(a)  planting about 7,500 ha of coffee and 4,000 ha of cocoa by
about 17,000 smallholder farmers;
(b)  providing marketing facilities for plantains which would
be grown as temporary shade for young cocoa trees;
(c)  introducing improved foodcrops to be interplanted in cocoa
and coffee and also grown outside plantations;
(d)  providing farmers with improved extension services, input
supply and credit;
(e)  strengthening SRCC through the provision of a financial manager,
and through better supervision and training of extension agents;
(f)  conducting applied research and producing improved planting
material and seed for:
(i) cocoa and coffee under a contract with IFCC;
(ii) foodcrops under a contract with IRAT;



- 13 -
(g)  constructing low-cost storage space and providing post-harvest
technical advice for cocoa and coffee in up to eighty villages;
(h)  constructing and rehabilitating about 300 km of feeder roads,
and providing maintenance for roads built under both the first
and second project; and
(i)  in PY3, financing a study to evaluate the project and
possibly prepare a follow-up project. In PY2, financing a
consultancy study to examine the Togolese plantain market.
Technical data on the project components are presented in the Project File.
The following paragraphs describe the main proposed project activities and
expected results.
B. Detailed Features
Program of Cocoa and Coffee Plantings
4.02      Most of the land suitable for cocoa and coffee is already under
cultivation. Therefore, the proposed project planting program would be mostly
on land cleared of old and unproductive plantations. In the case of cocoa,
new plantations would be established almost entirely after uprooting old cocoa
trees, while in the case of coffee only about one fourth would be new plantings
after clearing bush or fallow, while the rest would be in old coffee gardens.
A detailed breakdown for the proposed phasing of the planting program is
shown in Table 2. The phasing of plantings and number of farmers participat-
ing in the project is summarized below:

/1   Note:  Completion of first project (para 3.06 and Table 7).
The planting program would be undertaken by smallholders. Each participating
farmer would be expected to plant on the average 0.75 ha of either cocoa or
coffee, typically as follows:



- 14 -
Planting Year                     Nl         N2           N3     Total
Coffee (ha)                      0.5          -          0.25    0.75
Cocoa (ha)                       0.25        0.25        0.25    0.75
4.03      Before an interested farmer could participate, SRCC's extension
service would have to be satisfied that he had land of suitable quality for
cocoa or coffee, and that he was capable of properly establishing and main-
taining his plantation. As in the first project, farmers would be required
to form groups of at least five members with a total area of at least 3 ha
to facilitate delivery of the technical package consisting of extension
advice, the supply of planting material and fertilizers, pest control and
credit. Farmer groups would produce planting material in village nurseries.
This would be supervised by SRCC which would ensure the necessary supply of
either hybrid cocoa pods, rooted cuttings of selected coffee clones or in some
cases, coffee plants in sleeves. The farmer would be responsible for prepar-
ing the plots, including proper clearing, staking out, and digging of planting
holes. For selection and delimitation of plots the farmer would be aided by
SRCC topographers of whom there are one or two attached to each extension
sector. As for village nurseries, land preparation and actual transplanting
would be supervised by SRCC extension agents. Farmers would be required to
plant about 600 plants of banana-plantain per ha as temporary shade one year
prior to cocoa planting. Plantain shade could be complemented by glyricidia.
The plantain would remain for three years in the cocoa plantation (Ni to N3)
and besides giving temporary shade would also provide an important revenue to
the farmer. Coffee would be established without shade plants but maize, rice
and cowpeas intercropping would take place in NI and N2. Cocoa would also be
intercropped with maize and taro in NO. No fertilizer would be applied to
cocoa since fertilizer trials have not shown a response but due to favorable
results with coffee, ammonium phosphate and urea would be applied during the
first three years. After this period a compound fertilizer alternated with
urea in years of radical pruning would be applied. Detailed fertilizer
recommendations are available in the Project File. Cocoa capsid control,
financed by OPAT and carried out systematically in all plantations by spe-
cialized SRCC teams, has been successful and this would continue under
the proposed project as would control of SSVD and further research into this
disease. Systematic pest control for coffee has so far not been necessary.
Planting Material, Yields and Production
4.04       Proven clones of Robusta coffee (Coffea canephora) would be
planted under the proposed project . The IFCC station at Kpalime has
selected and propagated about 12 clones with suitable characteristics for
the project area. Out of this clone bank, suitable qualitative and quanti-
tative combinations of clones would be made for each area to assure yield
stability under various ecological subconditions. Coffee yield estimates are
based on SRCC experience and the assumption that about 25% of project farmers
would have an above average performance, 50% would be average and some 25%
would be below average. Yields would vary due to a five year cycle of
radical pruning, and the adjusted means are expected to be as follows:

Year              3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10   11   12   13   14   15 and on
Yield of Clean  60  350 600 800 850 300 500 800  750  750  250  450  650
Coffee (kg/ha)
Incremental coffee production expected from project plantings would be some
800 t of clean coffee by PY5, 4,300 t by PY10, and would stabilize at 3,200 t
as from PY17 onwards. Togo's total coffee production would however remain
within its present export quota. Details of total and incremental coffee
production are given in Table 3.
4.05      Cocoa (Theobroma cacao) cultivated under the project would be Upper
Amazon x Amelonado hybrids.  Yield estimates are based on SRCC observations
which indicate that in their adherence to husbandry recommendations, about 7%
growers would be above average, 57% average, and 36% below average. Weighted
average yields are estimated as follows:
Year                  4      5     6      7     8      9     10 and on
Yield of Beans
(kg/ha)              30    100   300   500   600   750   750
It is expected that new cocoa plantations established under the project would
generate an incremental production of 1,600 t by PY10 and 2,400 t as from PY13
onwards (Table 3).
The Foodcrop Component
4.06      Togo's cocoa and coffee area has traditionally been a net fooderop
importer from other regions. Since the area is ecologically different from
the rest of Togo and represents only about 10% of the country's area, very
little effort has been made in the past to promote foodcrop cultivation, and
foodcrop research and extension have concentrated entirely on the lowlands.
Under the proposed project, an attempt would be made to intensify foodcrop
production in the area through the provision of a package consisting of
specialized extension services, an applied field trials program, a seed mul-
tiplication program, and the supply of improved seeds and fertilizers to
farmers. Initially, improved foodcrops would be interplanted between cocoa
and coffee and as a second step improved foodcrop seeds would be introduced
outside plantations where they are grown in a mixture of up to seven crops
(maize, cassava, yam, rice, cowpeas, sorghum, groundnuts). As a result of
the package offered to farmers it is expected that yields of the main crops
on a pure stand basis would increase as follows:

On average, annual foodcrop production per farm family would increase by some
90% in cereals, and by about 80% in tubers and legumes. It is expected that
about 12,000, or 70% of cocoa and coffee farmers would adopt improved foodcrop
growing recommendations. By PY5, improved cereals would be grown on some
4,800 ha, legumes on 600 ha and tubers on 1,900 ha. Incremental production
from these areas is estimated to be 3,000 t of grains and 7,000 t of tubers.
Total improved foodcrop production projections are given in Table 4. Details
on the recommended use of fertilizers (100 kg/ha urea annually, and 300 kg/ha
of rock phosphate each fourth year), which would be provided to farmers for
cash, and on foodcrops to be interplanted in tree crops, as well as seed
multiplication projections are in the Project File.
Farm Models, Labor and Budgets
4.07       Two farm models have been used, one representative of the cocoa
area (predominantly Litime), the other of the coffee area (plateau of Dayes,
plateau of Akposso, region of Kloto).

The analysis of labor requirements has been made on farm models combining
cocoa, coffee and foodcrops. Below, peak farm labor requirements have been
compared with the family's estimated labor capacity. The analysis indicates
that an average cocoa or coffee farm should encounter no labor shortage even
assuming that adults would devote only 190 working days per year to the farm.

Plantain Marketing
4.08       As described in para 4.03, the recommended temporary shade plant
for young cocoa would be plantain (Musa paradisiaca) This choice has been
most beneficial to farmers during the first project since plantains grow fast
and can provide a cash income. However, project plantings would result in an
increased supply and a subsequent drop in farmgate prices from present prices
is anticipated. Nevertheless, even assuming that only 70 percent of plantains
would be sold, the estimated revenue over three years (N1-3) would amount to
approximately CFAF 180,000 (about US$800) per hectare, which would be a great
incentive for replanting cocoa. The estimated production of plantain bunches
from 4,000 ha of cocoa to be replanted under the project would rise to 18,500
tons in PY6, before falling to zero in PY9 as the plantain was removed from
the cocoa stands. About 13,000 tons per year (PY6) of this amount would be
produced in the relatively distant Litime area, of which an estimated 70%
(9,000 tons) would be surplus to local requirements. Since an estimated
two-thirds of thi.s (i.e. 6,000 tons) would require organized marketing facil-
ities the project would finance a consultancy study in PY2 to examine the
Togolese plantain market. The study would analyse logistical and organiza-
tional requirements for providing minimum necessary collection, handling, and
transport facilities to deal with up to 6,000 tons of bunches per year from
the Litime area, for which financial provision is made under the project.
Details are in the Project File (Annex VIII).

Village Group Centers
4.09      SRCC and PCU have startd on a pilot basis in selected villages the
creation of village group centers (VGC) through which post-harvest technical
advice could be channeled, low-cost storage for inputs, cocoa and coffee
introduced, extension in basic marketing practices initiated, and credit
recovery facilitated. Six agents of the Service du Conditionnement et du
Controle des Produits Togolais (SCCPT) are assisting in this effort. While
the operation has only just started, initial results in the first season were
encouraging, with farmers earning a premium of CFAF 5 per kg (or about 3% of
producer price) on coffee sold through the group as a result of lower collec-
tion costs. Costs for the VGC component are estimated at CFAF 110 million
(US$0.5 million) without contingencies, and would be mainly for post-harvest
extension activities and purchase of materials for store construction, to
which village members would contribute work. The VGC are not intended to
replace or compete with the widespread and well functioning network of private
licensed buyers, carrying out the primary marketing of cocoa and coffee, but
are designed to facilitate their work through centralization and better
post-harvest care for the produce to be marketed. It has been recognized that
the buyers, if properly organized, could serve, in cooperation with PCU, as a
most efficient tool for credit recovery. During negotiations it was agreed
that Government, through OPAT, would establish by November 30, 1979, an
Organization of Licensed Buyers for this purpose (para 5.11).
Roads
4.10      The SRCC road program, which began in 1972, would be continued under
the proposed project. It would consist of constructing and rehabilitating
300 km of feeder-roads and maintaining (i) the 160 km of roads constructed
under the first project and (ii) those constructed under the proposed project
as they are completed. The program would in part be carried out by the SRCC
Road Unit which is well organized and in the past has performed well in the
mountainous project area. It would construct culverts, small bridges and
other support structures up to 12 m length (200 km at CFAF 400,000/km), while
those above 12 m length would be subcontracted to private enterprises (100 km
at CFAF 700,000/ km). Total per kilometer cost is estimated to be CFAF 2.1
million (US$9,700) for the road construction and rehabilitation component and
CFAF 74,000 (US$335) for the maintenance component. The roads would facili-
tate essential all-weather traffic. They would be laterite roads with a width
of about 6 m and with a 25 cm wearing course of local stone materials. During
the first project, construction and rehabilitation activities in line with
the planting program, focussed on the southern part of the project area, i.e.
Kloto, Dayes, and Akposso South. Construction would concentrate during the
first three years of the proposed second project on the northern part, i.e.
Litime, Akebou and Akposso North (200 km), and during the last two years on
the south, i.e. Kloto and Dayes (100 km). To replace obsolete machinery of
the Road Unit, new purchases would be required. Equipment to be purchased

would include seven tip-lorries (6,5 m3), one grader (140 Hp), two loaders,
one bulldozer (200 HP) and a tractor-trailer for transport of heavy equipment.
Details on the road construction program are in the Project File.
4.11      Studies.  To evaluate physical, managerial, economic and financial
performance of the project, and possibly prepare a follow-up project, a
study would be financed in PY3. Apart from local input (para 5.12) the study
would also require about 12 months of expatriate consultancies for expertise
not available in Togo. Supervision would be provided by the Ministry of
Planning consultancy unit (para 1.06).  Also, a consultancy study would be
financed in PY2, to examine the Togolese plantain market (para 4.08).
Cost Estimate
4.12      Total project cost during the five and a half year investment
period, inclusive of taxes, is estimated at CFAF 7,531 million (US$34.2
million), of which the foreign exchange would be CFAF 2,779 million (US$12.5
million) or 37%; CFAF 4,752 million (US$21.7 million) or 63% would be
local cost. Project cost net of taxes would be CFAF 6,900 million (US$31.4
million).
4.13      Cost estimates, based on end-1978 prices, include all identifiable
taxes amounting to CFAF 625 million (US$2.8 million) or 8% of total project
cost and contain the following contingencies: (a) physical contingencies of
10% on investment and operating costs, salaries excluded; and (b) price
contingencies applied on base costs plus physical contingencies compounded
yearly as follows: for civil works and buildings 9% in 1979/80, 8% there-
after; for vehicles and equipment, 7.5% in 1979/80 and 6.5% thereafter; on
salaries 10.5% throughout; and for other operating costs 9% in 1979/80 and
6.5% thereafter. Regarding credit to farmers, price contingencies have been
provided for a yearly increase of 8% of loans per hectare. However, no
increases have been assumed in the premium for cutting down old cocoa trees.
Total contingencies calculated on the foregoing basis amount to 39% of base
line cost estimates. Detailed estimates are summarized in Table A and a
yearly breakdown is given in Table 7.
Proposed Financing
4.14      The project would be financed as follows.  A proposed IDA credit of
US$14 million would finance 41% of total project cost, or 45% of the project
cost net of taxes. In addition, it is expected that Governnent would receive
from FAC a grant of FF 15 million equivalent to US$3.5 million, and from CCCE
and EEC Special Action Fund loans equivalent to US$7.7 and US$4.6 million,
respectively. CCCE's contribution would be made available through two loans:
a first one equivalent to US$2.2 million to cover the first two years, and a
second one equivalent to US$5.5 million to cover the last three years of the
project. The second CCCE loan would be conditional upon an assessment of
good project performance by a joint supervision mission of all colenders, to
be carried out in mid-PY2. Total external financing would thus amount to
US$29.8 million (CFAF 6,563 million) covering the foreign exchange cost of
US$12.4 million plus US$17.3 million in local costs, or 87% of total project

cost. Government would provide CFAF 968 million, equivalent to US$4.4 mil-
lion, or 13% of total project cost. Excluding taxes, Government's share
would be US$1.6 million (CFAF 352 million) or 5% of total project cost.
Details of the proposed financing plan are shown in Table B.
4.15      Assurances were obtained at negotiations that Government would take
all necessary steps to contract a grant from FAC and a loan from CCCE (para
4.14). If the grant from FAC shall not have become effective by April 30,
1980, and the second loan from CCCE by September 30, 1982, Government would-
provide funds or make agreements for funds to be provided from other sources
to meet the estimated expenditures for carrying out of the project (para
8.01,c). It would be a condition of effectiveness of the IDA credit, that
Government had concluded a financing agreement, satisfactory to IDA, for the
first tranch of the CCCE loan and that this loan had become effective (para
8.02,a).
4.16      Project expenditures, including taxes, to be financed would
include:
(a) Expenditures incurred by SRCC amounting to CFAF 5,838
million (US$26.5 million, of which US$17.9 million base
cost plus US$8.6 contingencies) as detailed hereunder:
(i)  CFAF 507 million (US$2.3 million) for buildings,
vehicles, and equipment;
(ii)  CFAF 1,196 million (USf5.4 million) for feeder
road construction, rehabilitation and maintenance;
(iii) CFAF 2,991 million (US$13.6 million) for expatri-
ate staff cost ($2.8 million) of which salaries 35%,
allowances 11%, social costs 11%, and overheads and
fees 43%, local personnel and operating costs;
(iv)  CFAF 978 million (US$4.5 million) for IFCC and
IRAT contract research and planting material and
seed production;
(v)  CFAF 68 million (US$0.3 million) for studies;
(vi)  CFAF 98 million (US$0.4 million) for capsid control
and swollen shoot eradication.
External co-lenders would finance CFAF 5,178 million (US$23.5 million) of
these expenditures. Government would pass on as a grant these funds to SRCC
together with CFAF 660 million (US$3.0 million) from its own resources.
(b) PCU's expenditures of CFAF 1,693 million (US$7.7 million
of which $1.1 million for contingencies) would be on-lent
by Government to CNCA to cover:

(ii) CFAF 391 million (US$1.8 million) for expatriate
technical assistance (US$0.2 million), local
personnel and operating costs;
(iii) CFAF 1,126 million (US$5.1 million) for loans
to cocoa and coffee farmers; and
(iv) CFAF 132 million (US$0.6 million) to cocoa farmers
as premium for coçoa uprooting.
About CFAF 1,385 million (US$6.5 million) of these costs would be financed by
external co-lenders.
4.17      To assure the efficient and timely implementation of the project,
assurances were received from Government during negotiations that it would:
(a)  (i)  cause SRCC and CNCA/PCU to continue keeping in a
banking institution acceptable to IDA two special
accounts in the names of SRCC and PCU for the pur-
pose of financing the carrying out of the project
(para 8.01 e);
(ii) deposit initial amounts of CFAF 50 million
(US$230,000) and CFAF 25 million (US$115,000) into
the SRCC and CNCA/PCU accounts respectively; and
(iii) replenish the accounts quarterly, in advance, on
the basis of SRCC and CNCA/PCU annual budgets, to
be submitted for IDA review and approval by
November 30 of each preceding year (para 8.01 e);
(b)  the initial deposit of CFAF 50 million (US$230,000) and
CFAF 25 million (US$115,000) into the SRCC and CNCA/PCU
accounts respectively, would also be a condition of
effectiveness (para 8.02 b);
(c)  continue, through OPAT, to finance the capsid control
program in cocoa outside the project plantations as well
as those of the second project plantations (at an estimated
outlay of about US$0.4 million annually), (para 8.01 d);
(d)  continue to provide about CFAF 310 million (US$1.4 million)
to cocoa and coffee farmers in the project area after the
project disbursement period in order to meet all credit
commitments made during the project and to bring all plantings
made under the project to maturity (para 8.01 f).

Procurement
4.18      Goods and services financed by the EEC Special Action Fund would be
procured in accordance with the Special Action Fund guidelines. The items so
financed would be essentially the same as those financed under IDA, CCCE and
FAC. However, they would be grouped in lots eligible for EEC Special Action
Fund financing, totalling US$4.6 million, to be purchased during the first 18
months of project execution. Goods and services financed by CCCE and FAC
would be purchased according to Bank Group guidelines. Those financed under
IDA would be procured under the following procedures:
(i) contracts for goods and services of US$50,000 equivalent
or more would be awarded through international competitive
bidding in accordance with IDA Guidelines, amounting to
US$2 million (of which IDA US$1 million);
(ii) individual contracts for vehicles, equipment and goods for
less than US$50,000 would be awarded on the basis of local
competitive bidding procedures acceptable to IDA. Contracts
for less than US$10,000 would be awarded following prudent
shopping. The total amount for these items would not
exceed US$1.4 million (IDA US$0.7 million);
(iii) civil works (US$2.9 million, IDA US$1.5 million), mainly
road construction, housing, field offices and warehouses,
scattered over a large area and unlikely to attract foreign
bidders, would be carried out under force account by SRCC
or be contracted through local competitive bidding in
accordance with procedures acceptable to IDA;
(iv) services of consultants, applied research and seed multi-
plication, which were considered satisfactory under the
first project, would continue under contracts approved by
IDA, amounting to US$5.4 million (IDA US$2.7 million); and
(v) US$13.5 million (IDA US$6.7 million) would be expended on
salaries and operating costs, and farmers' credit. The
materials and supplies would be obtained in accordance with
the borrowers' normal procedures which are satisfactory.
Disbursement
4.19      IDA funds would be disbursed only after all proceeds from the
EEC Special Action Fund have been disbursed. The proceeds of the IDA credit
would be disbursed over five years. The items and amounts allocated would be
as follows:

Disbursements for local personnel and operating costs and credit to farmers
would be against certificates of expenditure, the documentation for which
would not be submitted for review, but retained by the borrower and available
for inspection by IDA during the course of project supervision. Experience
under the first project has shown that statements of expenditure provided by
SRCC and PCU have been accurate. Moreover, the control of these statements of
expenditure would be reinforced by a specific verification at annual external
auditing. Disbursements for all other items would be fully documented. A
schedule for disbursements is given in Table 15.
Accounts, Audit and Reporting Requirements
4.20      As under the first project SRCC and CNCA would keep separate
accounts for project components under their respective responsibility.
Government would cause the accounts of SRCC and PCU to be audited by inde-
pendent auditors, acceptable to IDA, and audited accounts together with the
auditors' report would be submitted to IDA within six months of the close
of each financial year. This condition has been regularly met under the first



- 24 -
project. Assurances to these effects were obtained from Government during
negotiations (para 8.01 g).  in addition, Government would make arrangements,
satisfactory to IDA, for the independent audit of expenditures covering
disbursements under the IDA credit. The auditor's opinion would cover that:
(i) goods and services have been procured from Bank member countries and
Switzerland; (ii) goods have been received or work performed; (iii) payments
have been made; and (iv) the goods and services are eligible for financing -
under the Credit Agreement and have been used for the purpose of the project.
To keep Government and the co-financiers informed on project progress, brief
but comprehensive quarterly reports, and more detailed annual reports, would
be regularly prepared by SRCC and PCU and promptly submitted to IDA.
V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
5.01      The National Coffee and Cocoa Development Agency (SRCC), estab-
lished in 1971 (para 1.11), which managed the first project successfully,
would continue to administer the proposed project. It would be supported in
research matters by two specialized institutes--IFCC for cocoa and coffee and
IRAT for foodcrops. The National Agriculture Credit Agency (CNCA) would be
responsible for project credit operations through the Project Credit Unit
(PCU), which was established for this purpose at the outset of the first
project. SRCC's weakest points during project execution were training and
supervision of the extension service, and the lack of a Financial Manager.
However, financial control was well executed thanks to the extraordinary
attention paid to the subject by SRCC's General Manager (para 3.06). Under
the proposed project these deficiencies would be remedied by creating the
positions of Heads of Extension Services and Training, and Finance and
Administration (para 5.03 and Chart 19967) and appointing suitable personnel
to these posts. In view of the crucial importance of a well functioning
extension service to the success of the proposed project, an effort would
be made to have the Head of Extension Services and Training in place by
October 1, 1979.
SRCC
5.02      SRCC's principal functions would continue to be:
(a) promoting planting and replanting of coffee and cocoa,
and selecting participants;
(b) assisting farmers to prepare farm plans and loan
applications;
(c) supervising the use of credit supplied by CNCA;
(d) procuring inputs and implements for distribution to
farmers;



- 25 -
(e) supervising nurseries and distributing planting material
and other inputs;
(f) executing the project's infrastructure development
program; and
(g)  conducting applied research with IFCC and IRAT support.
SRCC is administered by a board of directors whose members include represent-
atives of:  the Minister of Rural Development (President); the Ministries of
Planning, Finance, Commerce and Industry, Rural Equipment, Transport, Foreign
Affairs, and Interior; the Directors of OPAT, CNCA and the ORPV (former SORAD)
of the Plateau region; and three representatives of cocoa and coffee growers.
The overall responsibility for project execution would continue to be vested
in the General Manager (GM), who at present is an expatriate technician
seconded by IFCC. He is a well-qualified administrator and Government agrees
that his contract would be extended for another three years under the proposed
project. He would hand over his responsibilities to a qualified and expe-
rienced national acceptable to IDA at the end of PY3.
5.03      The GM would supervise SRCC's main activities divided into
five sections:
(i) finance, administration, accounting, procurement, financial
analyses, progress reporting and communications with banks
and OPAT;
(ii) planting material production; seed garden pest control;
production of hybrid cocoa seed, rooted cuttings and
plants of selected coffee clones, adjusted to the planting
program of the respective project years. This section
would also be responsible for plantation crop protection,
particularly for capsid and SSVD control in cocoa;
(iii) extension services and training, responsible for extension
agents' training, cocoa, coffee and foodcrop advisory work
at sector and village level; and for overall planning,
organization and supervision of the SRCC extension network.
To cover adequately the expanded planting and foodcrop
program, SRCC would increase its number of extension
sectors to thirteen (one more than under first project)
and the number of extension agents (EA) would increase
from some 120 to 150 to give a mean coverage of one EA to
about 100 farmers (a decrease from about 120 farmers per
EA under the first project). Each sector would also be
reinforced by one technical assistant and one EA, who
would specialize in foodcrop advisory work. Sections (ii)
and (iii) would work in close contact with IFCC and IRAT
research stations, so as to remain up-to-date on progress



- 26 -
and results of applied research on one hand, and to pro-
vide a constant feed-back of field problems deserving
research attention on the other hand;
(iv)  general services, including mechanical and civil
engineering designs and works, farmyard operations and
storekeeping; and
(v)  road construction and maintenance, responsible for
executing the roads program.
Assurances were obtained from Government that the General Manager and all
section heads would possess at all times qualifications and experience accept-
able to IDA (para. 8.01, h). The two Heads of Planting Material Production,
and General Engineering Services, are competent expatriates. For lack of
suitably qualified local personnel their services would be retained in the
proposed project. For the proposed two new posts in SRCC (Financial Manager
and Head of Extension Services and Training) it is unlikely that suitable
qualified and experienced Togolese would be available and these positions
would need to be filled by international recruitment. The Head of Road
Construction and Maintenance is an SRCC trained and dynamic Togolese officer,
who would continue in this position. An SRCC organigram is presented in
Chart 19967.
The Research Institutions
5.04      As in the past, SRCC would annually enter into a contract with IFCC
to undertake research work for coffee and cocoa. IFCC has a central station
in Tove, and substations in Dzogbegan, Klabe-Azafi, Tomegbe and Zozokondji.
In 1977, a specialized virological and genetical laboratory, financed by FAC,
was added to Tove to provide for screening of SSVD, and to develop methods of
controlling the disease. The proposed IFCC project oriented research work
would focus on the following:
(i)  Coffee--continuing selection of improved planting
material with particular respect to high and stable
yields and disease resistance. In cooperation with
IRAT, foodcrop intercropping methods applicable to
the early years of coffee plantations would be improved.
Furthermore, emphasis would be given to multilocal
nutrition trials, pest screening, and control where
justified, variety testing in marginal production zones
(Adele, Tabligbo, Akposso), Arabica testing in higher
elevations, and screening of Arabusta performance.
(ii)  Cocoa--improvement of yield potential of cocoa hybrids
tolerant (or resistant) to drought, SSVD and phytophthora;
multilocal foodcrop intercropping trials; comparative
trials with various cocoa regeneration and rehabilita-
tion techniques, particularly in the Litime; and



- 27 -
continuation of research into chemical, genetical and
immunological methods of SSVD control.
A similar contract as with IFCC would be negotiated annually with IRAT for
applied fooderop research work. The contracts would be submitted by March 31
each year to IDA for review and approval. However, contrary to IFCC, IRAT
is not yet established in the project area. Therefore, Government would
provide SRCC with two demonstration farms, including all land, buildings and
stores, (called Centres Polyvalents) located at Adeta and Klabe-Azafi. The
handing over of these two stations to SRCC would be a condition of effec-
tiveness (para 8.02 c). These stations would be used for field trials and
planting material production.  Government would finance IRAT's pre-project
operating costs at Adeta in 1979 (about CFAF 9 million or US$40,000), in
order to speed up the development of the project's foodcrop component.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained to that effect (para 8.01 i).
Foodcrop research would concentrate initially on testing the response of
local varieties to fertilizer, screening of new varieties, improved basic
agronomy and primary seed multiplication. At a later stage, simple multi-
local on-farm trials and demonstrations would be undertaken in cooperation
with extension services.
CNCA
5.05      In order to enable CNCA to handle long-term loans efficiently,
a Project Credit Unit (PCU) was established under the first project and
by mid-1978 PCU's portfolio included over 7,000 loans. This institutional
arrangement assures effective credit services to project farmers and, in
general provides CNCA with experience. Very importantly, it ensures close
coordination with SRCC since the PCU is accommodated in SRCC premises and
is operationally responsible to the SRCC General Manager, although admin-
istratively responsible to CNCA. Under the proposed second project, the
PCU would continue operating under its present structure having a central
section responsible for overall management of loans, general accounting and
central cash operations, and one to two credit agents in each of the SRCC
sectors, responsible for disbursements, recovery of credit in cooperation
with the Organization of Licensed Buyers (para 5.11), individual and farmers'
groups accounts. Assurances were obtained from Government that the head of
PCU, who is at present an experienced Togolese national, would at all times
have qualifications and experience acceptable to IDA (para 8.01 h).
Financing of Project Credit
5.06      PCU was set up with the goal of eventually becoming financially
self-supporting, balancing its investment, staff and operating costs by its
revenues (interest on loans). The unit is well organized, but implementing
this first and relatively small program of supervised long-term agricultural
credit has cost more than had been expected. Although there is room for
some savings on excessively sophisticated paper work, most of the costs were
unavoidable. Due to generally higher costs, and the fact that recovery



- 28 -
started only in 1979, PCU will have an operating deficit at the end of the
first project, estimated at CFAF 145 million (US$659,000). With its present
earnings structure (8.5% interest from loans to farmers minus 1% interest to
Government) revenues from loans under both projects would not be sufficient
to cover PCU's costs and losses due to defaults expected to be incurred over
the total time span of both projects (1975 to 1997). To achieve PCU's finan-
cial equilibrium an interest rate on outstanding farmers' credit of 11% would
be required (Table 8). PCU would collect this rate by charging to farmers an
annual interest of 8.5%, CNCA's current rate on agricultural credit, which is
in line with BCEAO (Central Bank of West African States) regulations, and by
receiving a complementary payment from the government, through OPAT, of an
additional 2.5% per year on outstanding credits to farmers. This would
constitute a compensation by the government to the farmers, which is justified
since the latter receive only 33% of the economic value of cocoa and coffee,
while the government collects 57% after deducting marketing and processing
costs of these crops. OPAT's transfer to pay part of these benefits to com-
pensate PCU would total about CFAF 252 million over some 13 years and enable
PCU to achieve a cumulative financial equilibrium. Assurances to this effect,
were received from Government at negotiations (para 8.01, j). The assumptions
underlying PCU's cash flow projections (Table 9) are: 70% normal repayments,
20% arrears (repayments shifted one year), 10% defaults on commitments, 100%
PcU costs as forecast, including contingencies. The 8.5% interest on farmers'
credit and the OPAT compensatory payments would allow PCU to break even on an
annual basis from 1984 onwards. An operating surplus for PCU would not be
intended, but would be possible, if costs and defaults were kept lower than
anticipated. PCU activities under the proposed second project would be
financed by an interest-free Government loan. Its term would be 17 years with
disbursements from 1980 to 1985 and repayments from 1988 to 1996.
Lending Purposes and Terms
5.07      Long-term credit would be provided for inputs and labor for new
cocoa and coffee plantations. All loans would carry an annual interest rate
of 8.5%. In addition, a once and for all commission of 2% would be levied on
loans for CNCA's general guarantee fund (1%), and special guarantee fund
for the long-term cocoa and coffee credit (1%). The effective annual rate
of interest would thus be 8.83%. The term of coffee credit would be eight
years including a grace period of four years, and the term of cocoa credit
would be twelve years including a grace period of six years. The grace
periods represent the respective gestation periods for coffee and cocoa
plantings, during which interest would be capitalized. The per hectare
income models indicate that participating farmers would be able to afford
these terms (Tables 10 and 11).
5.08      Cocoa planters would be eligible to receive loans totalling
CFAF 80,000/ha (US$363), of which CFAF 1,600/ha (US$7) would be retained and
paid to the CNCA guarantee funds, CFAF 15,250/ha (US$69) would be in kind,
and CFAF 63,150/ha (US$287) would be in cash and disbursed over five years.



- 29 -
In addition, OPAT would pay a premium Df CFAF 60,000/ha (US$273) as compen-
sation for the income forgone from old cocoa and this would be a condition
of effectiveness (para 8.02 d). The premium would be disbursed in five equal
annual tranches. It would represent a sixfold increase from the CFAF
10,000/ha, paid under the first project, which was insufficient and did not
provide adequate compensation to cocoa growers for the income foregone as a
result of replanting and before the new plantations start producing.  The
amount of credit per hectare would be reviewed annually to cover possible
increases of input prices and assure implementation of the recommended tech-
nical package for cocoa and coffee cultivation.
5.09      Coffee planters would be eligible to receive loans totalling
CFAF 95,000/ha (US$432), of which CFAF 1,900/ha (US$9) would be paid to the
guarantee funds, CFAF 18,600/ha (US$85) would be in kind and CFAF 74,500/ha
(US$339) would be in cash and disbursed over four years. The amount of
credit per hectare would be reviewed annually as with cocoa.
Disbursement and Recovery
5.10      Loan contracts would be between CNCA and individual farmers.
However, as under the first project, farmers would be required to form pro-
duction groups of at least five (in order to manage village nurseries) and
to plant at least three hectares to become eligible for credit. Loan dis-
bursement to each individual would also be conditional upon satisfactory
execution of agricultural operations by all members of the group (para 4.03).
This condition would also apply for disbursements of the five tranches of the
premium paid for cutting down old cocoa trees. Farmers groups would continue
to be essentially operational and loan repayment would remain an individual
responsibility, although ultimately this might change with the development
of village group centers (para 4.09).
5.11      Credit recovery would take place in the context of an essentially
uncontrolled primary market situation. Therefore, the recovery effort would
consist of:
(i) effective and persistent follow-up on the repayment
schedule of farmers by the credit agents; and
(ii) introducing an element of controlled marketing through
creation of an Organization of Licensed Buyers.
It has been recognized that the well functioning network of private licensed
buyers could become a most efficient tool of credit recovery, if the buyers
were properly organized. A proposal to this effect was discussed during
negotiations and assurances were obtained from Government that it would,
through OPAT, establish by November 30, 1979, an Organization of Licensed
Buyers (OLB) for this purpose (para 8.01, k). The OLB would cooperate closely
with PCU and the buyers, of whom there are about sixty, would be provided
with lists, containing names of farmers and their portion of credit outstand-
ing for each year and would, together with PCU credit agents, participate in



- 30 -
credit recovery. Village group centers to be introduced would be expected
to centralize and facilitate credit recovery operations. Apart from the
option of imposing penalty interest rates for arrears, which has been assumed
in PCU cash-flow projections (Table 9), farmers in arrears or default could
also be considered debarred from receiving new credit. Further sanctions or
collateral are not considered necessary or practicable since both cocoa and
coffee are productive over decades and permit persistent recovery efforts.
Progress in loan recovery during the project would be the subject of special
attention under project monitoring and supervision.
Monitoring and Evaluation
5.12      The monitoring activities carried out under the proposed second
project would essentially be geared to aid management in project execution,
and to collect experience and data for project evaluation and preparation
of a possible follow-up project (para 4.11). As under the first project,
monitoring and evaluation would be the responsibility of the project's tech-
nical adviser, a Togolese and former senior official, well experienced in
agricultural administration. During the monitoring activities some valuable
skill in data collection and presentation has been acquired. However, tech-
nical, economic and statistical professional advice was lacking. Several
partial case study and data collection surveys have been carried out, which
resulted into a "Rapport de Synthese", giving useful complementary information
on size and types of farms, labor, migration and farm management. These data
were, to the extent possible, exploited in second project preparation. During
the second project, emphasis would be shifted towards an improved system with
more statistical precision in collection of primary data and their evaluation.
To this purpose consultancy visits (7 to 10 days per year) to the project
from a competent and experienced national or international institute or firm
would be organized and financed under "Studies" (Table A). The first such
visit should take place within six months of effectiveness and a detailed pro-
gram would be sent to IDA for review and comments within six months after this
visit. The first order of priority would be for the consultants to agree with
management on the key indicators required to monitor the execution of the
project and the methodology thereof. An important part of these activities
would be monitoring farmers' response both to project technical recommenda-
tions and to financial incentives, and the feedback of farmers' views thereon
to project management. Also of special interest would be the monitoring of
acceptance of the proposed new landlord-tenant contract for cocoa replanting
in the Litime area and of the establishment of farmers' groups.
VI. PRODUCTION, MARKETS, PRICES AND FISCAL IMPACT
A. Yields and Production
6.01      Coffee.  Most of the 7,500 ha of the robusta coffee plantings under
the proposed project (about 75%) would consist of replanting old coffee



- 31 -
gardens of the Niaouli variety with an average annual yield of only just over
100 kg/ha of dry beans and which would continue to produce at this level for
a few years before becoming so low-yielding as to be abandoned. The improved
planting material to be used under the project would typically start producing
about 400 kg/ha in the fourth year after planting, increasing to about 850
kg/ha in the seventh year, when radical pruning would take place and yield
would drop temporarily to 300 kg/ha (para 4.04). Thereafter, yields would.
build up again to about 700 kg/ha, followed by repeated pruning back on a
five-year cycle. These average yield forecasts are considerably lower than
the potential of the IFCC coffee clones when grown under appropriate manage-
ment and with regular manuring and take account of expected varying rates of
adoption of recommended practices by project farmers (Project File, Annex 1).
Allowing for loss of production from old coffee removed for replanting (600
tons per year by the end of the project), incremental production as a result
of the proposed second project would reach 3,500 tons per year by 1995, about
36 percent of Togo's 20-year average production of 9,700 tons. Taking account
of the 2,400 tons net increment now expected to result from the first project,
total coffee production and exports are projected to rise from their recent
(1975-1977) average of about 8,400 tons to about 15,500 tons in 1990 (Table
12), an average annual increase of 4.4 percent. However, this increase would
be well within the present ICA export quota for Togo, which was 13,500 tons
for 1977 (para 6.07 and Table 12)) and which Togo has been unable to fill.
6.02      Cocoa.  Average yields in the main production areas of Litime
and Kloto are estimated to be about 350 kg/ha. This would correspond to
domestic production of the order of 13,000 tons of cocoa annually. However,
the hybrid planting material provided by IFCC for multiplication and distri-
bution by SRCC is capable of producing sustained yields of well over a ton
per hectare under Togolese conditions. In fact, it has been estimated that
efficient smallholder yields could be as high as 1,350 kg/ha. Under the
proposed project the average planter, however, is expected to obtain only
about 750 kg/ha, starting in the ninth year from planting; this yield can be
maintained for at least twenty-five years. The farmer will reap a significant
cocoa harvest, equal to or greater than the average 150 kg/ha lost by clear-
ing old cocoa trees, in the fifth year from planting. About 35% of Togo's
cocoa is more than 40 years old and yields 150 kg/ha or less; the remaining
65% yield about 500 kg/ha. It is on the former group that the project would
primarily focus its attention. Incremental production from the 4,000 ha to
be replanted under the proposed project would be 2,400 tons annually by 1993
(Table 13). Including the 1,300 tons net additional production expected from
the first project (as from 1985), total production and exports are projected
to reach 20,700 tons by 1993, implying an average growth rate of 1.4 percent.
Unlike coffee, virtually all suitable and accessible land for growing cocoa
is used up and scope for increasing production is limited to raising yields.
However, as described in paras 2.06 and 4.02, there are technical, economic
and social constraints which limit the amount of old cocoa which can be
cleared and replanted, although ideally it should be about 5 percent of the
total cocoa area (42,000 ha) each year. At the same time, continuation of
the Government's anti-capsid spraying program is important for maintaining
yields of the existing cocoa trees which are in bearing.

B. World Markets and Prices
Coffee
6.03      High coffee prices during the mid-1950s triggered an expansion of
coffee plantings in most producing countries, which led to an increase in
production and to mounting stocks during the early 1960s. Producer stocks
reached their peak of 90 million bags, equal to 2 years of world import
demand, in 1966. The resulting drop in prices reversed the imbalance between
production and consumption in the following years. Production fell conti-
nuously short of consumption, and stocks were gradually drawn down.  However,
because of the high stocks accumulated during the early 1960s, prices reacted
only slowly to the changing market situation. It was not until the early
1970s that prices again approached their level of the 1950s.
6.04      When the commodity boom of 1973/74 started, coffee prices joined
the upward trend, reaching $1.58/kg in the first half of 1974 after having
averaged $0.88/kg in the 1960s. However, in mid-1974 they suddenly started
to drop again, because of the combination of good production prospects with
the economic recession in the importing countries. Prices fell sharply to a
level of about $1.10/kg, where they remained until the Brazilian frost of
July 1975. Steep price increases followed, reaching a peak of $7.25/kg in
April 1977. Consumers, mainly in the USA, responded by turning away from
coffee to other beverages, and this drop in demand triggered a sharp decline
in coffee prices in the remainder of 1977 which continued into 1978.
6.05      Prices are nonetheless expected to remain above their long-term-
average level until 1980. In 1978, robusta prices averaged $3.28/kg; they
are expected to continue to decline in 1979 and during the early 1980s,
mainly because of price-induced production increases and persistence. The
decline in prices is expected to slow the rate of new coffee plantings,
which will result in a strengthening of coffee markets during the second
half of the 1980s. In current tenrs, prices are projected by the Bank to
rise to $3.41/kg by 1985 and to reach $4.74/kg by 1990.
6.06      In constant 1978 US dollar terms, coffee prices are expected to drop
to $2.32/kg in 1980 and $2.26/kg in 1985, rising again between 1985 and 1990
mainly in response to a projected increase in production costs, to reach
$2.46/kg by 1990. In real terms (constant 1978 US$) these price forecasts do
not vary much from the historical average prices of $2.43/kg during the 1960s
and $2.24/kg during 1970-75.
6.07      The six-year International Coffee Agreement which entered into
force on October 1, 1976 provides for the introduction of export quotas when
prices fall below specified levels but in 1978 coffee prices were still much
higher than these. However, the agreement provides for a revision of the
trigger price levels for its second and third two-year periods. During this
time, now that prices have started falling, export quotas will probably have
to be introduced. Togo's export quota under the 1976 Agreement was for



- 33 -
225,000 bags (13,500 t), with provision for an increase up to 281,250 bags
(16,875 t) in 1981/82. Projected exports as a result of both the first
and the proposed second projects are within the first figure (Table 12). The
ICO has been consulted and offers no objection to the project, since Togo's
present production is so far (about 30%) below the existing quota provisions.
Cocoa
6.08      World cocoa production is expected to grow somewhat faster in 1976-
90 than in 1955-1976. Demand growth, projected at 3.3% per annum, is not
expected to depart much from the production trend in the future. The current
insufficient stocks will need to be replenished. World cocoa production is
projected to increase from 1.5 million tons in the mid-1970s (1974/76) to
about 1.9 and 2.3 million tons by 1985 and 1990 respectively. Grindings in
developing countries are expected to increase rather rapidly, while the growth
of grindings in developed countries will slow down, reflecting producing
countries' expanding capacity to manufacture intermediate cocoa products
more cheaply..
6.09      Exports from producing countries and net imports in consuming coun-
tries, both around 1.1 million tons in the mid-1970s, are projected to grow
to about 1.2 and 1.4 million tons by 1985 and 1990 respectively. Imports of
cocoa beans by developed countries will not grow as fast as in the past,
being gradually supplanted by imports of intermediate products.
6.10      In constant 1978 dollar terms, therefore, cocoa prices are expected
to trend downwards to around $1.93/kg by 1985 and $1.44/kg by 1990, compared
with the 1974/76 average of $2.00/kg and of $4.05/kg in 1977. The major
reasons for this include the high production anticipated in the late 1980s
and early 1990s, notably in Brazil and Ivory Coast, the gradual decrease of
trade in cocoa beans, the increasing success in the use of cocoa substitutes
in chocolate and confectionery, and the effects of international inflation.
6.11      The current (second) International Cocoa Agreement, signed in
1975, will remain in force until September 1979. The International Cocoa
Organization (ICCO) now has 18 exporting and 27 importing members, accounting
for more than 95% of world cocoa production and over 70% of total grindings.
The USA, however, which accounts for close to one-fifth of world imports of
cocoa beans, is not so far a signatory to the Agreement.
6.12      The main features of the Agreement are (i) annual export quotas,
(ii) a buffer stock of up to 250 thousand metric ton capacity, and (iii) a
price range of US c/lb 65-80 ($1.43-1.78/kg) since October 1, 1977. Because
market prices have consistently been above the range for intervention, the
Agreement's economic provisions have never been operative. The present
cocoa export quota for Togo, if enforced, would be 20,500 metric tons, with a
provision for increase to 23,000 tons. However, incremental production from
the first and second projects is only expected to take Togo's production, and
export availability, up to 20,700 tons in 1993 (see Table 13). Adjustments
to quotas would in any case probably be made under a Third Cocoa Agreement,
for which negotiations are currently proceeding.

C. Producer Prices and Fiscal Impact
6.13       Official producer prices for crops marketed through OPAT (para
1.06), including coffee and cocoa, are reviewed annually by Government and
any changes are announced by the President. As shown in Table 14, producer
prices for coffee and cocoa were raised only infrequently during the 1960s-
and early 1970s and did not rise in line with world prices or with domestic
inflation in Togo. Declining trends in production of both commodities since
about 1970 are partly attributable to this decline in real prices paid to
growers. For comparison, the recent evolution of prices in Togo, Cameroon
and Ivory Coast, and average annual CIF prices at Le Havre, is shown below
(CFAF/kg, for first grade).

6.14       Until very recently Government has effectively followed a policy
of maximizing its short-term revenues on coffee/cocoa exports through OPAT
without regard to long-term effects on production. However there is now a
greater awareness of the need to improve incentives and over the last two
seasons Government has pushed up coffee and cocoa prices by 44 and 54 percent
respectively. Government's agreement to raise the special grant ("prime
d'abattage") for uprooting and replanting old cocoa is further evidence of
this change. A combination of adequate producer prices and loans/grants for
replanting cocoa is financially efficient since at their new level prices
should be sufficient to ensure that mature trees are harvested. Even at
their new (1978/79) levels, however, producer prices for coffee and cocoa
still only amount to about 30% of FOB export prices, and thus provide a
substantial measure of revenue creation as well as cost recovery.
6.15       Taxation of coffee and cocoa exports is an essential source of
public sector revenues and it is estimated that net contributions from this
source amounted to some CFAF 5 billion (US$21 million) in 1975/76 and CFAF 13
billion (US$53 million) in 1976/77, as a result of high world prices (Project
File, Annex 7) and assuming maintenance of 1978/79 producer prices and buyers'

- 35 -
margins, the financial surplus to OPAT on coffee/cocoa operations would fall
to about CFAF 6.35 billion (US$28 million) by 1985, in constant 1978 terms.
The financial impact of the proposed project would be to create an accumulated
deficit over the first five years amounting to CFAF 3.7 billion (US$16.7 mil-
lion), taking into account project costs and loss of revenue from cocoa and
coffee cut down to make way for replanting (Table 16). By 1990, however, the
project would generate an additional CFAF 1 billion (US$4.5 million) per year
in revenue, before debt service, on the basis of present producer prices.
6.16      The fiscal impact of the proposed project, as shown in Table 16,
is heavily dependent on the rate at which the Government continues to raise
producer prices, as well as on the actual development of world market prices
for coffee and cocoa. These would be the subject of annual consultation
between IDA and the Government, which would establish a cash crop pricing
analysis unit within OPAT for this purpose (para 3.02). At this stage,
however, one possible expectation would be that Govenment would maintain the
value of the producer price for cocoa (presently CFAF 200 per kg) in real
terms, bringing it to 67% of the forecast FOB value in 1990; and that the
producer price for coffee would be raised to an equivalent percentage of
its forecast FOB value, to maintain a parity of incentives for the two crops.
Resulting prices and financial impact on Government are shown in Table 16.
Alternatively, if the evolution of the world cocoa market and of Togolese
government revenues is such that it is impossible to fully index the cocoa
producer price against domestic inflation, then as a minimum objective pro-
ducer prices for cocoa and coffee should be increased to at least 45 percent
of FOB export values by 1985, as assumed in Table 14. Such a progression
would appear at this stage to be the minimum necessary to maintain adequate
producer incentives consistent with Government revenue creation.
VII.  ECONOMIC BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
Background
7.01      Togo's production and exports of both cocoa and coffee has tended
to decline during the 1970s (Tables 12 and 13), partly as a result of unfavor-
able weather conditions but also due to past neglect of plantations and minimal
replanting of old trees. In part, this was the result of unattractive producer
prices and the lack of improved planting material. Land tenancy arrangements
have also proved an obstacle to the replanting of cocoa. The first, and
proposed second, cocoa-coffee development projects address themselves to
correcting these technical, economic and social constraints with a view to
restoring and improving the productivity of the cocoa/coffee subsector.
7.02      The importance of cocoa and coffee exports to the Togolese economy
is shown below. Their relative decline in importance since 1970 has been due
both to declining volumes of cocoa and coffee production and also to a sudden
increase in the value of phosphate exports as a result of the quadrupling of
phosphate prices in 1974. However, despite the expected growth of earnings



- 36 -
from the mining and mineral processing sectors, cocoa and coffee exports are
projected to account for at least 10 percent of total export earnings (goods
only) through the 1980s and 1990s. Without the continuation of the replanting
programs under the proposed second project, Togo's earnings from agricultural
exports would tend to decline in real terms.

Project Benefits
7.03      The project's primary benefits would be the increases in production
and exports of cocoa and coffee, and thus in foreign exchange earnings, that
it would generate. Were the second project not to proceed, Togo's cocoa and
coffee production after 1985 would tend to stagnate at pre-1970 levels,
despite the increases which will result from the first project. Increased
foreign exchange earnings are imperative if Togo itself is to finance any
significant part of its essential development expenditures. Project-induced
net foreign exchange earnings are estimated to rise to about US$10 million
annually (in constant 1978 terms) by 1993 and thereafter to remain at about
this level.  At the same time, environnent and current levels of technology
preclude rapid agricultural diversification for Togo into alternatives that
are economically more rewarding. In any case coffee and cocoa are the only
high-value cash crops that are suitable in the project area. Togo has an on-
going cotton development program, supported since 1977 by an IDA-financed
project (Credit 741-TO) through which this crop, as well as foodcrops, is
being developed. However, little scope for foreign exchange savings is
offered by programs aimed at substituting for imported foods; not only is
the total value of such imports relatively low but wheat, one of two prin-
cipal imports, cannot be grown in Togo and although sugar, the other, is
being grown, there are doubts that it is economically profitable.
7.04      The project is not aimed at alleviating the condition of the most
impoverished of Togo's principally rural population. Such people would be
those living on the densely populated Lama-Kara plateau and whose per capita
incomes were estimated at about US$65 annually in 1975. However, while the
17,000 farm families expected to participate in the proposed project are



- 37 -
financially better off than the Lama-Kara people, the difference in incomes
is not excessively large, as average per capita incomes in the project areas
were estimated at only US$115 in 1975. Moreover, there are signs that income
levels have declined for many farmers in the project area since the early
1960s when real prices paid for coffee and cocoa were better. IDA assistance
for relief of the problems of the most impoverished Lama-Kara area is being
provided by the ongoing Cotton Areas Rural Development Project and is further
envisaged in a rural development project now under study in the Bassar area
in the north of the country.
The Labor Market in the Project Area
7.05      The project would make considerable demands on local labor resources,
both during the establishment period for new coffee and cocoa plantings and
at full production, notably for coffee and foodcrops. Estimated incremental
requirements are shown below, for the project period (total PYO-5) and at
full development.
Estimated Incremental Farm Labor Requirements (man-years) /_
Project Period   Full Development
(Total)            (Annual)
Coffee                           8,844               5,022
Cocoa                             7,882 /2             326
Foodcrops                        3,774 73            1,224
20,500              6,572
/1   Based on a notional 250 man-days work per year.
/2   Of which 57% for establishment, harvest and removal of
temporary plantain shade.
/3   All labor and production from improved foodcrops treated
as incremental.
For the 17,000 farms expected to participate in the project, out of an
estimated total of 50,000 smallholder farms in the project area, the above
estimate of an additional 20,500 man-years of employment created by the
project represents an average of 300 days per farm, spread over three years.
Annual peak labor requirements are estimated at 359 man-days for participat-
ing cocoa farms (Year N2) and 282 man-days for coffee farms (Year N12 on).
For typical farm families of 6.5 persons including 2.5 adult members, both
of these peaks fall within normal family labor availability, even though some
farmers may employ outside labor or share-cropping tenants as a matter of
choice. In the main cocoa growing area (Litime) in particular, about 50
percent of cocoa farms depend to some extent on the labor of tenants, who are
paid either on a piece-rate basis (presently CFAF 800 per load of 32 kg dry
cocoa beans, equivalent to only about CFAF 150 per man day on a low-yielding
plantation) or by taking a share (usually one-third or one half) of the crop,



- 38 -
which is more profitable. Improved arrangements between landowners and
tenants are currently being studied by SRCC and Government and would be
introduced during the project, particularly with a view to facilitating
the replanting of old cocoa in the Litime area where the problem is most
acute (para. 2.06).
7.06      The determination of the cost of farm labor is based on the value
of foregone output and this in turn depends upon the seasonal pattern of
labor demand for the project. During the season of peak labor demand for
cocoa and coffee harvesting (in the fall), an active labor market exists and
market wages are about CFAF 600 to 700 per man-day, considerably higher than
the official minimum agricultural wage of about CFAF 410 (US$1.86) per 8-hour
workday.  It is also likely that this market rate at peak season will increase
somewhat as a result of the increased labor demand due to the project.
However, the main requirement for incremental labor under the project falls in
the early part of the year (March-May) when there is little alternative demand
for labor in harvesting tree crops or foodcrops. At this season, virtually no
hired labor is used and farm family labor remains seriously underemployed 1/.
Hence, over much of the year the incremental labor required under the project
has a low vaule of output foregone, exacerbated by the possibility of further
costs involved in seasonal migration either to Lome or returning to the
Lama-Kara area from which most laborers have come. Assessing the pattern
of project labor requirements against the seasonal labor market conditions,
a value of foregone labor output at market prices of CFAF 200 per man-day
has been estimated.
Economic Analysis
7.07       Economic rates of return have been calculated for each of the three
project components (coffee, cocoa and foodcrops) separately and for the
project as a whole. Economic costs and benefit streams are shown in the
Project File (Annex XIII). The following assumptions are used in the analysis:
(i)  benefits and costs are expressed in constant end-1978 prices,
net of identifiable taxes and subsidies;
(ii)  cost estimates include physical contingencies at the rates
specified in para 4.13, plus a contingency allowance of 5
percent on estimated farm labor costs;
(iii)  the project's incremental coffee and cocoa production is
assumed 100% sold on the world market in the year of produc-
tion on the basis of the forecast world prices described in
paras 6.06 and 6.10 and production levels given in Tables 12
and 13; (detailed economic farmgate price calculations are
shown in the Project File (Annex XII);
1/   A survey carried out in 1971 indicated on-farm annual employment
coefficients of between 31% (Litime area) and 47% (Plateau de Dayes).



- 39 -
(iv)  the exchange rate is taken as a constant CFAF 220 : US$1.0;
(v) incremental farm labor is costed at the estimated foregone
output value at market prices of CFAF 200 per man-day;
(vi)  project costs (and benefits) have been computed at border
prices by converting all foreign costs to local currency
costs at the assumed official exchange rate (220 CFAF per
US$); converting farm labor output foregone at market
prices into border prices by applying an accounting ratio;
and converting all other local costs and benefits into
border prices by using an estimated standard conversion
factor which reflects tariff distortions at the border.
The accounting ratio for labor output is difficult to
estimate since the output includes both cash and foodcrops;
it has been approximated by using the estimate for the con-
sumption conversion factor, 0.77, for Togo. The standard
conversion factor, used for other local costs and benefits,
is estimated at 0.80 for Togo;
(vii) the coffee and cocoa components are assumed to have an
economic life of 30 years, and the foodcrop component
15 years;
(viii) transfer payments such as cash advances on credit and cocoa
uprooting compensation payments ("primes d'abattage") are
not included, even though they feature in project financing
requirements;
(ix)  full costs of the roads component (15% of project costs)
are allocated as a necessary cost to the coffee (65%) and
cocoa (35%) components, without allowance for additional
benefits, which have not been estimated;
(x) foregone production as a result of uprooting and replanting
of tree crops is fully costed: for cocoa, at an average
yield of 150 kg/ha for 30 years in 100% of cases; for coffee,
at an average yield of 100 kg/ha for 5 years in 75% of
cases;
(xi)  incremental foodcrop production (maize, rice, cowpeas,
sorghum, groundnuts, yam and cassava) are valued on the
basis of present post-harvest market prices (details in
Annex VII); plantain is valued at only 50% of average
market prices to allow for the likely impact of project
production.
7.08      Economic rate of return results are presented below.  The best
estimate for the whole project, using the assumptions given above, is 18%;
costing farm labor at the market price of CFAF 400/day would reduce the ERR



- 40 -
to 13%, which would still be acceptable.  Using the SWR, individual rates of
return for the project components are: cocoa, 14%; coffee, 20% and foodcrops,
25%. The foodcrops component is most sensitive to changes in costs of labor
inputs since initial investments are small (only research and seed multi-
plication centers) and at the market price for labor coffee becomes the most
profitable component.

ERR Sensitivity and Risks
7.09      The sensitivity of the project's rate of return has been tested for
a range of varying situations. The most critical variable is the value of
benefits, i.e., yields and prices. Estimation of yields likely to be attained
by farmers replanting cocoa and coffee under the proposed second project has
been able to take account of SRCC experience gained under the first project.
The expected yield estimates are weighted by the knowledge that not all far-
mers would follow exactly the recommended practices, while the estimates of
net incremental production also take full account of actual yields foregone
during replanting. Thus the major uncertainty entering the yields/prices
variable is that of the future trend of world market prices for coffee (which
accounts for 65% of annual benefits at full development) and for cocoa (25%).
A combined increase in the 1985-90 world price forecasts for these two com-
modities of only 10% would raise the overall ERR from 18 to 21%, using the



- 41 -
estimated shadow price for farm labor.  The price outlook for these commodi-
ties, particularly for cocoa, is being further examined, but at the moment it
appears that an increase in the medium-term (1985 onwards) price for cocoa of
20 percent over the Bank's 1978 projections is warranted, as a result of
reduced output forecasts recently made by the ICCO for two major producing
countries. The ERR for cocoa replanting is improved considerably (by about
3 percentage points) by the assumption of a dependable internal market for-
the banana plantain which is produced during the early years of cocoa estab-
lishment. Without this market the ERR for cocoa on its own would be 11%, on
the price assumption adopted. If, however, the market outlook for cocoa
remained as unfavorable as the that projected in 1978 for the whole dureation
of the project, then the ERR would fall to only 9%, making it a marginal
proposition. This would imply either letting the cocoa sector run down still
further, since no rehabilitation methods have been proved in Togo other than
replanting and capsid control; or else progressively turning cocoa areas over
to coffee, which is the only real alternative, but which would encounter
problems of labor shortage and excessive concentration of production on one
export crop with a fluctuating market.
7.10      Since the project is a follow-up to a generally successful first
project, its risks of failure are much smaller than for a comparable new
venture. Although the replanting of smallholder coffee and cocoa is costly
in terms of both labor and of extension and research support, the first
project has demonstrated that this can be carried out both efficiently and
profitably, provided that sufficient improved planting material is available
and provided that adequate price incentives and financial assistance are
offered to farmers. SRCC has demonstrated its ability to produce and distri-
bute high-yielding coffee cuttings and cocoa seeds and to assist farmers
in establishing their own village nurseries. The installation of irrigation
systems in the SRCC coffee nurseries and cocoa seed garden in readiness for
the second project has helped to guarantee further the supply of planting
material in face of climatic risks. Everything possible is also being done
to guard against the risks of cocoa capsid damage and SSVD invasion from
neighboring Ghana; in fact the areas of Ghana worst hit by SSVD are not
contiguous with Togo. The principal factor which could cause the project
to fail, or fall seriously short of its targets, is economic: the risk that
replanting of cocoa or coffee will appear insufficiently attractive to
farmers, taking account not only of the producer price but also of the finan-
cial package (credit and subsidy) offered to the farmer during the replanting
period. For cocoa, also, there is the danger that landlord-tenant relations
may continue to impede participation in replanting. However progress is
already underway towards reaching a solution to this difficult but not
insurmountable problem.
VIII. ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS
8.01      During negotiations assurances were obtained to the effect that:



- 42 -
(a) Government would implement a cocoa landowner-tenant
contract in the main cocoa producing area of the Litime
not later than by March 31, 1980 (para 2.06);
(b) Government would review annually the farmgate price for
cocoa and coffee, in consultation with IDA, with the pur-
pose of maintaining adequate producer incentives. To this
effect Government would set up, with the aid of the pro-
posed Technical Assistance Project, a cash crop pricing
analysis unit in OPAT by March 31, 1980 (para 3.02);
(c)  Government would take all necessary steps to contract a
grant from FAC and a loan from CCCE. If the grant from
FAC shall not have become effective by April 30, 1980,
and the second loan from CCCE by September 30, 1982,
Government would provide funds, or make agreements for
funds to be provided from other sources, to meet the
estimated expenditures for carrying out of the project
(para 4.15);
(d) Government, through OPAT, would continue to finance the
capsid control program in cocoa, and its control would be
extended to cover second project plantations (para 4.17 c);
(e) Government would: (i) cause SRCC and CNCA/PCU to continue
keeping in a banking institution acceptable to IDA two
special accounts in the names of SRCC and PCU; (ii) deposit
initial amounts of CFAF 50 million (US$230,000) and CFAF 25
million (US$115,000) into the SRCC and PCU accounts respec-
tively; and (iii) replenish these accounts quarterly,
in advance, on the basis of SRCC and PCU annual budgets, to
be submitted for IDA review and approval by May 31 of each
preceding financial year (para 4.17 a);
(f) Government would provide about CFAF 310 million (US$1.4
million) in farmer credit after the project disbursement
period (para 4.17 d);
(g) Government would cause regular auditing of the SRCC and
PCU accounts by independent auditors, acceptable to IDA,
and audited accounts together with the auditors' reports
would be submitted to IDA within six months of the close
of each financial year (para 4.20);
(h) The General Manager of SRCC would be at all times a
qualified and experienced administrator, and the five
heads of SRCC sections (Finance and administration,
Planting material production, Extension services and
training, General services and engineering, Roads con-
struction and maintenance), and the head of the PCU,
would have at all times qualifications and experience
acceptable to IDA (paras 5.03 and 5.05);



- 43 -
(i) In order to advance the introduction of the proposed
project's foodcrop component, Government would finance
in 1979 IRAT's operating costs at the demonstration
farm (Centre Polyvalent) of Adeta, estimated at CFAF 9
million (about US$40,000) (para 5.04);
(j)  To assure PCU's financial equilibrium Government would
make, through OPAT, over and above PCU's receipts from
interest on credits compensation payments to PCU at the
rate of 2.5% per year on outstanding farmers' credit,
estimated to total CFAF 252 million over 13 years
(para 5.06); and
(k)  To facilitate credit recovery, Governnent would establish,
through OPAT, by November 30, 1979, an Organization of
Licensed Buyers, that would cooperate closely with PCU on
credit recovery at points of cocoa and coffee marketing
(para 5.11).
8.02      Conditions of effectiveness of the credit would be:
(a) that Government had concluded a financing agreement,
satisfactory to IDA, for the first tranch of the CCCE
loan and that this loan had become effective (para 4.15);
(b) the initial deposit of CFAF 50 million (US$230,000) and
CFAF 25 million (US$115,000) into the SRCC and CNCA/PCU
special accounts (para 4.17 b);
(c) the handing over to SRCC for purposes of applied research,
production of planting material and seed multiplication, the
two demonstration farms (Centres Polyvalents) of Adeta and
Klabe-Azafi, including all land, buildings and stores (para
5.04);
(d) the increase of the premium, paid by Government through
OPAT, for cutting down old, unproductive cocoa plantations
from CFAF 10,000 per ha to CFAF 60,000 per ha (para 5.08).
8.03      Under these assurances and conditions, this project is suitable for
an IDA credit of US$14.0 million.

1/ Marketing season Oct-Sept ending year showrn.
2/ Base estimate assumes (a) continuation of anti-capsid campaign; (b) adequate
labor and incentives to continue present (fairly low) level of exploitation
and sporadic renewal of old trees; (c) neutral assumption with regard to
smuggling from Ghana, i.e., past average cross-border component of Togolese
marketed production, possibly about 4,000 t (if Togo average yields are only
300 kg), is maintained. Absence of factors (a) and (b) could result in fall
in domestic yields of up to 100 kg/ha, or 30 percent, say 4,000 t again.
Negligible (less than 0.05).
