PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF TOGO
SECOND COCOA/COFFEE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 945-TO)
PREFACE
This Project Completion Report (PCR) reviews experience with the
Second Cocoa/Coffee Development Project (CC II), for which Credit 0945-TO
of US$14 million was approved on June 28, 1979; US$13.7 million (97.7%) of
the Credit was utilized, and the remaining US$0.3 million was cancelled.
The project was co-financed by the Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC) for
US$3.5 million, the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) for
:'S$7.7 million. The European Economic Community (EEC), financed oosts of
LS$4.6 million between the First and Second Projects. The Credit was
closed on December 31, 1986, one year after the planned date.
The PCR was prepared by Societe Nationale pour la Renovation et le
Developpement de la Cacaoyere et de la Cafeirere Togolaise (SRCC) and
submitted to the Bank in its final French version on April 1, 1988. The
evaluation summary and over-iew of the report, prepared by staff in the
Bank's Occidental and Central Africa Department, are based on SRCC's PCR, a
review of the Staff Appraisal Report (No. 2408-TO of June 4, 1979), the
Development Credit Agreement of July 23, 1989, Bank supervision reports,
project progress reports, and project related Bank files.
This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft report was sent to the Borrower for comments on February 16,
1090, for comments by April 6, 1990, but none were received.

REPUBLIC OF TOGO
SECOND COCOAICOFFEE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 0945-TO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
The Second Cocoa/Coffee Development Project (CC II) was designed
to continue efforts made in the mid 1970s to halt the decline in cocoa and
coffee marketing and export earnings, and to ultimately expand and
rehabilitate existing cocoa and coffee cultivation. The decline, which began
in the early 1970s, was mainly due to the absence of development efforts
geared to provide farmers with technical advice, credit, and improved
planting material with high yield potential. During the period, producer
prices were set too low to induce growers to undertake proper maintenance and
replanting, with the resultant aging of the existing plantations. A complex
land tenure system also encouraged low yield cultivation practices and
sharecropping. The project was designed following the Bank Group's strategy
of the day in agriculture, to stress the integrated rural development
approach.
Obiectives
The project wes envisaged as a follow-up to a generally successful,
similar first project. Its major objectives were:
(a) the replanting of about 7,500 hectares (ha) of coffee trees and
4,000 ha of cocoa trees by about 17,000 smallholder farmers, and
assisting farmers in bringing under production cocoa and coffee
planted under the first project;
(b) the provision of marketing facilities for plantain grown as
temporary shade for young cocoa trees;
(c) the promotion of fooderop production by farmers who replanted cocoa
and coffee, as well as by others living in the same areas;
(d) the provision of extension services, inputs, and credit to farmers,
and construction of low-cost storage feailities for cocoa, coffee,
and inputs in up to 80 villages;
(e) the improvement of planting material and seed for cocoa, coffee,
and foodcrops through applied research;



- v -
(f) the building or rehabilitation of about 300 kilometer. of feeder
roads and the maintenance of these roads and others built under
the first project; and
(g) the provision of technical assistance to the executing agency for
financial managment; supervision and training of extension agents;
studies on the requirements for expanding plantain marketing; and
the monitoring and evaluation of the project, including preparation
of a possible third project.
Total project costs were estimated at US$34.^ million, to be
financed by an IDA credit of US$14 million and by three other international
institutionst FAC, CCCE and EEC co-financing US$3.5 million, US$7.7 million,
and US$4.6 million respectively, in addition to the Government's contribution
of US$4.4 million. Funds were to be disbursed over a five and half year
period.
Implementation Experience
The cocoa component, whe credit program, and the planned land
tenure  reforms  encountered  serious  difficulties.    The cocoa planting
techniques introduced under the project, which involved cutting down old
cocoa trees to plant new ones, proved unacceptable to smallholders who
were, in many cases, only sharecroppers and would not forego income that
the  method  demanded.    In  other  cases,  replanting  was  technically
unsuccessful. This, as well as an outbreak of disease and an inadequate
official cocoa price resulted in much lower cocoa plantings than projected,
and in the abandonment of cocoa in some cases. The project fell short of
Its 4,000 ha target for cocoa planting; a total of 1,117 ha were actually
planted and only 710 ha remained in production at the end of the project.
Only 20% of this is expected to yield satisfactory results because of
smallholders' lack of Interest in pest control.
The credit component suffered as a result of high operating costs
of the Project Credit Unit (UCP) and low recovery rates of outstanding
credits. Because of the ceiling on interest rates, UCP accumulated sizable
losses that had to be covered by the Government. Although the rate of
recovery was generally low for all cases of lending, it varied according to
the type of credit awarded (short-term vs medium-term) and speculation
(cocoa vs coffee). The rate of recovery of medium-term credit from cocoa
planters declined steadily from 352 in 1981-82 to 51 in 1985-86, to stand
at 1S in 1986-87. During the same period, the rate of recovery of medium-
term credit from coffee planters declined from 451 to 30Z and recovered to
732 in 1986-87. Recovery of seasonal credit (short-term) fell from 79X to
192 in the same period, but reached 63% in 1986-87. This illustrated many
of the classical problems associated with the use of credit as an incentive
to promote technologies, when there was the risk that they would be of
marginal economic interest (cocoa in this case) to farmers.



- vi -
The project followed the strategy of promoting production
principally through extension and replanting of the orchard, and focused on
promoting investment. Success was measured in terms of area planted. SRCC
proved itself capable of executing the program through the use of an
extension service armed with adequate plancing material, supported by
credit which allowed farmers to hire labor as well as purchase necessary
planting  inputs.    However,  the project was much  less  successful  in
promoting productivity gains, as illustrated by the failure of extension
staff to promote an adequate pruning system and a lack of evidence of
improved maintenance practices. SRCC did not control most of the factors
that would have been crucial in promoting productivity, including land
tenure issues and remunerative product prices.  Globally, therefore, the
project illustrated the need for a strategy ensuring the establishment of
favorable macroeconomic conditions, as a complement to direct intervention
by a well focused promotion agency in order to achieve growth.
Results
The promotion of coffee and foodcrops, and the road building
components of the project were very successful. SRCC performed well from
the beginning in these areas and exceeded its 7,500 ha and 5,200 ha
planting targets for coffee and foodcrops respectively, and its 300 km
target for roads.   A total of 10,988 ha of coffee and 11,745 ha of
fooderops were planted, and 308 km of roads were constructed.
The mid-term review of November 1983 estimated the Economic Rate
of Return at 301, compared to 181 estimated at appraisal, with 41X
estimated for the coffee component and negative net cash flows for cocoa
and fooderop development. This higher ERR reflected several contradictory
developments.   Cocoa and fooderop production appeared to fall short of
expectations, but there was strong coffee development.   Projected U.S.
dollar prices for cocoa and coffee doubled and tripled respectively
compared to appraisal estimates, as the CFA/US$ exchange rate increased
from 220:1 to 330:l.   Project costs in dollar terms remained close to
budget figures. A May 1984 supervision mission, which reoimmended that the
project be extended by one year, reestimated the ERR for the extended
project at 322, on the grounds that 11,700 ha of the coffee and cocoa would
be planted. Actually, 12,105 ha (cocoa 1,117 ha and coffee 10,988 ha) were
achieved at project completion.
Sustainability
Coffee production in Togo has stabilised and grown since the
completion of the project, in part because of SRCC's efforts to promote
investment and encourage good maintenance of plantations, and in part
because of the Government's new pricing policies which increased
dramatically the value of the crop to farmers over two to three years. It
would, however, be constructive to compare this experience with that of a
country whose government has adopted a policy of allowing prices to be
determined and to fluctuate according to world market conditions with the
participation of a promotion agency, in order to better understand the
necessity and advantages of complementary incentive measures.

Findings and Lesson Learned
The project also offered a number of specific lessons.
(a) Land tenure arrangements, which did not adequately apportion the
risks of investment and their benefits between landlord and
tenant, proved to be a serious constraint on improving the quality
of the cocoo' orchard. Land tenure for sharecroppers may have in
fact been 'secure" in the sense that long-term agreements appeared
to have been maintained, but there was little equity in the
financial arrangement involved.
(b) Low rates of credit recovery and high administrative costs
illustrated the error of viewing credit as a production input
whose offer was supply driven, to encourage farmers to invest in
spite of a low level of economic incentives rather than as simple
financial intermediation.
(c) Poor experience with promoting cocoa replanting was in part
explained by the high risk associated with the planting technology
extended. Greater testing of the actual site of application may
have helped minimize the risks in farmers" minds.

REPUBLIC OF TOGO
SECOND COCOAICOFFEE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 0945-TO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
OCCIDENTAL AND CENTRAL AFRICA DEPARTMENT OVERVIEW
Introduction
1.      This Project Completion Report (PCP.) of the Togo Second CocoalCoffee
Development Project (Cr. 0945-TO), is based on the Project Completion Report
prepared by the Societe Nationale pour la Rcnovatioa et le Developpement d- la
CacaoyZre et de la Cafeiere Togolaise (SRCC), (Annex 4) in addition the staff
appraisal report, legal documents, supervision reports, and Bank files have been
consulted and Bank staff involved in project appraisal and implementation have
been consulted. The PCR reflects the views and opinions of Government officials
and Bank staff closely associated with the project and, reviews the project's
Implementation and Impact, and the performance of all parties concerned.
Background
2.      Cocoa and coffee represent two of Togo's four major export co uodities
(the others are cotton and phosphates) making up, on average, 202 of the
country's agricultural export earnings in recent years. In the 19609 however,
their average share of total export earnings was about 502. From 1970 to about
1980, cocoa and coffee production experienced an actual decline due to an overall
aging of the plantations and subsequent loss in productivity, as did the share
of total export earnings, from 60X in 1970 to 14Z in 1980. Growth in phosphate
prices also accounts for part of the decline in the share of exports attributed
to coffee and cocoa exports. Annexes 1 and 2 summarize the downward trend of
cocoa and coffee production and their average share of total export earnings in
the 1970s.
3.      After reaching a peak of 29,000 tons in 1972, cocoa production and
marketing declined considerably to an annual rate of about 15,000 tons over the
period 1973-84. Only 5,500 tons were produced in 1986 despite efforts made by
the Government to rehabilitate and expand areas under cultivation.   Coffee
production reached its peak of 17,000 tons in 1969 and declined steeply until
1978, when it gradually increased to reach 10,300 tons in 1986.



2
4.      Annual fluctuations could be explained primarily by weather conditions.
However, there has been a notable structural decline primarily as a result of
the aging of the coffee/cocoa orchard, failure of farmers to replant, and a
general decline in the quality of husbandry practices. Several factors were
Identified  as  explaining or perpetuating this phenomenon.   Land tenure
arrangements (particularly in the cocoa zone) whereby absentee land ownership
led to increased sharecropping by farmers who were more interested in fooderop
than cash crop production. This tendency was exacerbated by structurally low
prices paid to farmers for export crops. Moreover, there was neither a ready
source of technical advice for farmers on improved trce crop husbandry methods,
nor a supply of improved planting material.
5.      When world prices for cocoa and coffee were at their highest in the mid-
1970s (CFAF 772/kg for cocoa and CFAF 1,122/kg for coffee), Togolese producers
received CFAF 150 kg (cocoa) and 125 kg (coffee) or 19Z and 11X of the FOB value
of the crops. From 1977 onwards, cocoa and coffee producers received on average
382 and 322 of the FOB value. Since 1985, however, there has been a shift in
government policy and producer prices for cocoa and coffee have been pushed up.
Annex 3 summarizes price movements between 1965 and 1987.
6.      It is notable that during the commodity boom of the early 1970s, when
world market prices for cocoa and coffee were rising, prices paid to producers
of coffee and cocoa in Togo stagnated, and as a consequence, production declined
in the face of growing market prospects. The Government opted to draw off
economic gains from the sale of the crop and attempted instead to promote growth
in coffee and cocoa production through non-economic incentives to establish new
plantations and improve production methods.  Production continued to decline,
however, from 17,206 tons and 29,361 tons for coffee and cocoa in 1969 and 1972,
to 4,702 tons and 12,602 tons in 1978 and 1979, (Annex 2).
7.      To address the situation, the Government asked for FAC's assistance and
established SRCC in 1971 to rehabilitate and expand cocoa and coffee cultivation.
The strategy adopted was to promote replanting of high performance varieties.
The role of the SRCC was to promote replanting; develop a capacity for applied
tree crop research, develop nurseries to raise high performance planting
materiall supply credit to prospective planters; and provide technical advice
to farmers on coffee and cocoa planting.  After an experimental stage, the
Government undertook the implementation of a project in which smallholders would
be assisted to replant and expand cocoa and coffee plant'tions.   On the
Government request, the Bank appraised a project in 1973, and an IDA credit of
US$6 million was approved in 1974. This first project, Cocoa/Coffee I, was
implemented over a five-year period and had a planting target of 4,400 ha of
cocoa and 4,400 ha of coffee. At project closing in 1980, 2,164 ha of cocoa and
5,740 ha of coffee had been replanted. Although there were delays in cocoa
planting, it was agreed to continue replanting; thus, preparation of a second
phase project was undertaken, since the strategy was making good ,rogress
overall.

Proiect Obiectives
8.      The Second Cocoa/Coffee Development Project (CC II) had as its objectives
to continue the strategy of extending the area planted with Improved coffee and
cocoa varieties.   Its operational goal was to strengthen SRCC through the
provision and employment of an expatriate general manager, a financial manager,
and qualified section chiefs, and through Improved supervision and training of
extension agents. The program would continue to open and Improve rural roads
in the coffee and cocoa growing region, and provide credit for replanting and
production. The project would also support applied research, associated foodcrop
development and seed production. Over five and a haif years, 7,500 ha of coffee
and 4,000 ha of cocoa would be planted by about 17,000 smallholder farmers. The
primary benefit of this program will be an increase in foreign exchange earnings
from a rise in export revenues of cocoa and coffee. About 110,000 members of
the 17,000 smallholder families will benefit from higher incomes.
Pro1ect Formulation
9.      The project concept was proposed by the Government of Togo, with the
assista-: e of FAC as a response to the declining production of cocoa and coffee
and export earnings. In the 1960s cocoa and coffee production stagnated in Togo
and very little new cocoa and coffee was planted. Furthermore, because of low
prices, farmers neglected the maintenance of their plantations causing both
production and yield to decline even further.
10.     To remedy the situation, the Government devised a strategy aimed at
rehabilitating and expanding cocoa and coffee cultivation by capitalizing heavily
on research on cocoa and coffee carried out by the Institut de Recherche sur le
Cafe et Cacao (IRCC) since 1967, and providing a package of services consisting
of extension, planting material, inputs and Improved road infrastructure to
promote replanting.   It is notable that no attention was given to economic
incentives in this strategy. For example, the evolut'Ion of prices in Togo lagged
considerably behind those paid in Cameroon and Cote d'Ivoire.

No. 2408-TO, June 4, 1979, page 34.
i1.     From 1975 (first year of CC I) to 1986 (closing date of CC II) Government
largely achieved its objective of rehabilitating and expanding plantations. By
1985/86, the total area under cocoa and coffee had increased by 1,940 ha and
11,700 ha respectively. However, since coffee plan.ed in 1982 and cocoa planted
in 1980 would come to production only in 1986, the increase in area under cocoa
and coffee had no 4mmediate effect on exports.
12.     Two Important factors were not emphasized during project formulation
and caused serious implementation problems. First, the financial incentives
given for uprooting old cocoa trees were insufficient to encourage farmers to
apply the recommended technology. Second, project authorities were not able to
arrange for adequate contractual arrangements between land owners and
sharecroppers, the latter receiving only about CFA 501kg for their cocoa
regardless of what the land owner received. They were thus not willing to invest
in improved maintainance practices. If adequate attention had been paid to
economic incentives, production and yield may have met appraisal estimates.
13.     The CC II project was appraised from September 25 to October 25, 1978,
and approved on June 29, 1979. An IDA Credit for US$14 million was signed on
July 23, 1979, and became effective on July 11, 1980. The project was cofinanced
by the Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC), the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation
Economique (CCCE), and the Fonds Europeen de Developpement (FED) with US$3.5
million, US$7.7 million and US$4.6 million respectively.   The project was
extended by a year, and closed on December 31, 1986.

Proiect Implementation
14.     Proiect Manazement. Project management was generally effective although
unable to overcome the technical difficulties which the cocoa component
encountered. The recommended replanting technique (under plantain shadow) was
a failure largely because it was costly in terms of income foregone when old
cocoa trees were cut down, and not attractive financially to sharecroppers.
However, management was effective in exceeding appraisal estimates in coffee
replanting, foodcrop production and road construction.   In view of the poor
performance of the cocoa component, the detailed mid-term review of the project
carried out by the Bank (November 2-19, 1982) revised project objectives and
stopped all new cocoa plantings (after only 500 ha of an expected 4,000 ha had
been achieved).  Other Togolese institutions also performed well in project
execution, including the research establishment, IRCC. The Government generally
fulfilled most of its commitments. General management of SRCC passed from an
expatriate manager to a Togolese manager. In spite of overall satisfactory
results, however, management faced problems both outside and within its control
which adversely affected project implementation.
15.     The problems outside project management control included:
-    The Government's lack of interest in reforming the landlord-tenant
contract for those living in the cocoa production area, translated
into land tenure complexities remaining unresolved;
-    increased costs of imported goods and services, (monthly in CFAF
terms) mainly due to a depreciation of the CFA Franc between 1980
and 1985. The rate of exchange went from CFAF 220.20 to US$1.00
at appraisal to CFAF 498.01 to US$1.00 in the first quarter of 1985;
but subsequently decreased to FCFA 328 in 1986. Meanwhile, the
Government did not pass on to farmers gains in local currency
receipts from export sales of cocoa and coffee resulting from
currency fluctuations;
-    low  producer  prices  for  cocoa  and  coffee  and  subsequent
smallholders'  lack of interest  in these two crops.   Annual
consultations between IDA and the Government to set farmgate prices
were never formalized; however, the issue of prices was taken up
in the context of Structural Adjustment Programs and progress was
made ; and
-    smallholder farmers' refusal to perform anticapsid treatments of
cocoa as advised by SRCC, owing to its cost relative to expected
financial gains resulted in production losses.
16.     The problems within project management's control includeds
-    lengthy delays in submission of withdrawal applications causing cash
flow problems;



6
-    credit management and credit recovery were appallingly low while
credit administration costs were high; and
-    mediocre performance of extension agents in promoting productivity
improvement, due to inadequate training and job programmitg.
These problems were analysed during the appraisal of the follow-up project and
are being addressed under The Third Cocoa/Coffee Project now under
implementation.
17.     Proiect Revisions.   In view of the poor performance of the cocoa
component, an in-depth review of the project was carried out by the cofinanciers
and the Government in November 1982. As a result, the Government took a decision
to reorient the project along the following lines:
(a) the cocoa replanting program was stopped and remained limited to
the 500 ha already planted, and no further credit was extended to
farmers for this activity;
(b) a pilot program for farm level testing of blackpod treatment and
replanting new cocoa trees under the shade of old cocoa trees was
carried out; and
(c) the target for the coffee planting program, which was proving
successful, was increased from 7,500 ha to about 11,000 ha. This
adjustment enabled the project to achieve an overall planting
program still in line with the appraisal target of 11,500 ha.
Physical Progress
18.     Despite the low recovery rate of medium- and short-term credit and the
technical problems described above which disrupted the cocoa component, the
project achieved most of its physical targets. Road construction reached 103X
of its estimate target--an important factor in (a) facilitating research,
production and distribution of improved planting material, extension services,
and credit distribution; (b) increasing   the use of fertilizers by coffee
producers; and improving the conditions of crop marketing.  Coffee planting
progressed satisfactorily and a mid-term target increase from 7,500 ha to 10,500
ha was approved; 10,988 ha of coffee, representing 146% of estimate targets were
actually planted. Although the coffee pruning program started late, it came
close (75%) to achieving its objectives. Interest in pruning soared in the last
two project years, when product prices were raised substantially (1984/85 and
1985/86). The Government did not institute the pruning premium which had been
considered necessary. A major expansion also occurred in the fooderop production,
particularly in the last year of the project.
19.     Over 1981-86, the Project Credit Unit (PCU) awarded 21,000 medium-term
credits to coffee producers and 1,500 to cocoa producers, financing the



7
plantation of a totae  of 11,103 ha of coffee and 748 ha of cocoa.  A total of
CFAF 1,250 million was disbursed in cash and in kind over the same period. About
27,000 short-term credits for fertilizer were also granted for a total of CFAF
286 million. Despite this aggressive credit program, recovery was very low,
reaching only about 30X overall. This dismal recovery performance did not fully
reflect farmers' capacity to pay.   It was due, in the first place to over
optimistic yield expectation and failure to have a proven cocoa replanting
technology to recommand, for which the PCU cannot be held responsible. While
the better coffee plantations were reaching yields close to appraisal estimates,
average ones were more than 30% below target. Product prices were also too low
to give an adequate return on investment. Farmers were not convinced, therefore,
of the utility of the credit, and as a result, of their obligation to repay.
20.     The cocoa replanting technique introduced proved unacceptable to farmers
and, in most cases, was technically unsuccessful. In addition, the prevalence
of mirid pest and blackpod disease undermined the success of the cocoa
plantations. Only 281 (1,117 ha) of estimate target (4,000 ha) were planted, of
which 710 ha remained in production at closing.
21.     Although they had been properly addressed at appraisal, issues related
to land tenure and the sharecropper system, which hindered the progress of the
cocoa replantation program were never addressed by the Government. In fact, poor
tenant-landlord arrangements is held to be one of the main causes of the
project's poor success with the cocoa replanting program in the main cocoa
growing zone (the Litime). In this zone, a high proportion of cocoa plantations
are owned by absentee or partly absentee farmers, many of them Ghanaians, who
manage their farms with sharecroppers. These are usually seasonal migrants who
may return to their own villages when the main cocoa crop harvesting season is
finished. Many absentee farmers own very large farms, some up to 200 ha.
22.     The owners proved to have little interest in their farms other than
taking their share of the crop, for which they expanded little management effort
or expenditure. They had little interest in replanting on their old farms. The
sharecroppers, having neither title nor permanent interest in the land they
managed, were not interested in developing or improving the   plantations.
Efforts over several years by the project to encourage owners and sharecroppers
to establish better contracts, which would give long-term security to the
sharecroppers and thus provide an incentive for them to replant, had little
success. Without firm government backing, success was also uncertain under the
follow-up project. The Government completed a study on this issue in April 1988,
and action on the recommendations are being considered.
Project Costs and Financina
23.     Total project cost was originally estimated at CFAF 7,531 million
(US$34.2 million at FCFA 220.20 to US$1.00), of which the SRCC component
accounted for about CFAF 3,943 million (US$17.9 million) and the UC? component
for FCFA 1,449 million (US$6.6 million). The remaining CFAF 2,139 million
(US$9.7 million) covered physical and price contingencies of CFAF 200 million



8
or US$900,000 million and CFAP 1,939 million or US$8,8 million respectively.
Due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar between 1981 and 1985, project
costs reached CFAF 10,500 million, about 39% over appraisal estimates.
However, the corresponding increase in the CFAF proceeds from the IDA credit
limited the counterpart funding requirement to only 19% of total cost, down
from 63Z estimated at appraisal. In dollar terms, overall project costs were
essentially the same as estimated at appraisal.
Proiect Impact
24.     The project had had an impact on several aspects of Togo's coffee and
cocoa production, although precise production and foreign exchange earning
levels resulting from the project are difficult to identify. First, the
project made a significant contribution to strengthening SRCC's managerial and
execution capabilitv. SRCC was internally restructured to promote its
extension role, and it developed excellent liaison with the research
establishment. This is a necessary condition for the promotion of good
practices through extension in the future. Coffee production and exports have
increased steadily to become the country's major source of foreign exchange
revenue, thus showing that the structural decline in production has been
reversed. Third, the competence of Togolese nationals working to promote tree
crop production has improved through sustained short- and long-term training.
Finally, the infrastructure has improved a great deal. New and better roads
were constructed and carefully maintained, thus accelerating the rate of
creation of new coffee plantations and increasing the use of fertilizers by
local smallholder farmers. The road network also had a positive impact on the
development of trade in the region.
Economic Reevaluation
25.     The mid-term review of November 1983 estimated the Economic Rate of
Return at 30X, compared to 18X estimated at appraisal, with 41% estimated for
the coffee component and negative net cash flows for cocoa and fooderop
development. This higher ERR reflected several contradictory developments.
Cocoa and foodcrop production appeared to fall short of expectations, but
there was strong coffee development. Projected U.S. dollar p.lces for cocoa
and coffee doubled and tripled respectively compared to appraisal estimates,
as the CFA/US$ exchange rate increased from 220:1 to 330:1. Project costs In
dollar terms remained close to budget figures. A May 1984 supervision
mission, which recommended that the project be extended by one year,
reestimated the ERR for the extended project at 322, on the grounds that
11,700 ha of coffee and cocoa would be planted. Actually, 12,105 ha (cocoa
1,117 ha and coffee 10,988 ha) were achisved at project completion.
26.     While acceptable, the ERR should be interpreted cautiously because of
its sensitivity to yields and prices. If yields for coffee have been higher
than estimated, prices have been declining recently. Further decline in
prices could lower the ERR and affect the economic viability of the project.

Institutional Performance and DevelopgMent
27.     Togolese institutions performed well during project execution and, In
certain aress, results were above estimates. SRCC management has been
effective and, as a result of the streamlining of the structure, it is now a
stronger, better organized, more effective field-oriented institution. The
quality of recruiting has been enhanced, and an intensive training program
aimed at preparing Togolese nationals to fill in key managerial positions has
been undertaken. In February 1986, the position of general manager was
transferred to a Togolese. Despite these positive aspects, further
iaprovements are still possible. There should be greater delegation of
responsibilities as budgetary control is overcentralized. An appropriate
staffing pattern should go along with those changes to introduce more
flexibility in the institution.
28.     The Project Credit Unit's performance, on the other hand, was less
than satisfactory. Bad crops, low rainfall and complex land tenure systems
explain part of their failure to recover outstanding loans. However, PCU's
rigid structure exacerbated the recovery problem. The credit was distributed
through loosely constituted groups not sufficiently organized or supervised to
apply group pressure for repaying. The third project which is now underway
proposes measures to enhance the credit component through increased
participation of formal village groups in primary marketing and the marketing
profession regulated by official decree defining their responsibilities in
credit recovery.
Cofinanciers Co)ntributions
29.     The EEC's, CCCE's, and FAC's contributions to the project were
particularly valuable not only in financial terms, but also in support of
studies carried out and in the technical expertise provided for project
execution and nupervision. The three cofinancers contributed
US$15.8 million (462) of the total US$34.2 million credit. At the end of the
project, their actual financing totalled CFAF 3,532 million or 342 of the
total CFAF 10,599 incurred. SRCC was established in 1971 with FAC assistance.
FAC also helped with the preparation and appraisal report and financed socic-
economic studies in the rural areas to detarmine smallholder farmers'
motivation and interest in the project. Results from such studies were
helpful to SRCC and PCU in that it shed light on the difficulties of credit
recovery. Part of the long-term (two years) training expenses of the
Extension Unit Chief and the head of monitoring and evaluation was paid by
FAC. FAC and CCCE are cofinancing the Third Coffee/Cocoa Project with IDA and
the Government.
Bank Performance
30.     During 16 supervision missions (about 264 mandays), the Bank devoted
considerable effort to addressing SRCC's manag_ment needs and PCU credit
recovery problems. Considerable attention was given to credit management and



10
through discussions with the implementing agencies and the Government;
agreements were reached to link marketing and credit recovery. Despite the
careful assessment made at the time of project formulation, problems related
to land tenure turned out to be more complex than foreseen. In addition,
severe drought conditions and a major outbreak of blackpod disease contributed
to failure of the cocoa replanting component and led to , mid-term review of
the project by the Bank (November 2-19, 1982). As a r : z, the Government
took the decision to revise project objectives and stoppee all new plantings
of cocoa. Bank supervisions addressed major problems and came up with
evidence that higher producer prices would Induce smallholder farmers to
devote more effort to the establishment and maintenance of their plantations.
The Government raised producer prices from CFAF 200 In 1979/80 to CFAF 365 in
1985/86 for coffee, and from CFAP 220 to CFAF 330 for cocoa, as part of its
Structural Adjustment Programs.
Lessons Learnt and Areas of Further Investigation
31.     The project followed the strategy of promoting production principally
through extension and replanting of the orchard, and focused on promoting
investment. Success was measured in terms of area planted. SRCC proved Itself
capable of executing the program through the use of an extension service,
armed with adequate planting material, and supported by credit which allowed
farmers to hire labor as well as purchase necessary planting inputs. However,
the project was much less successful in promoting productivity gains as
illustrated by the failure of extension staff to promote an adequate pruning
program and by a lack of evidence of improved maint-nance practices. SRCC did
not control most of the factors that would have been crucial in promoting
productivity, including land tenure issues and remunerative product prices.
Globally, therefore, the project illustrated the need for a strategy combining
favorable macroeconomic conditions, as a complement to direct intervention by
a well focused promotion agency, in order to achieve growth.
32.     The project also offered a number of specific lessons.
a) land tenure arrangements, which did not adequately
apportion the risks of investment and their benefits between
landlord and tenant, proved to be a serious constraint of
improving the quality of the cocoa orchard. Land tenure for
sharecroppers may have in fact been "secure' in the sense that
long-term agreements appeared to have been maintained, but there
was litle equity in the financial arrangements involved;
b)   low rates of credit recovery and high administrative costs
illustrated the error of viewing credit as a production input
whose offer was supply driven, to encourage farmers to invest in
spite of a low level of economic incentive rather than as simple
financial intermediation. Farmers were unwilling to repay their
loans because they did not develop a recurrent demand for



11
financial intermediation services, associated with intensified
production.
c)   the poor experience with promoting cocoa replanting was in part
explained by the high risk associated with the planting
technology extended. Greater testing in the actual site of
application may have helped minimize the risks in farmers' minds.
33.     Coffee production in Togo has increased since project completion,
partly because SRCC's efforts to promote investment and encourage good
maintenance of plantations, and in part because of the Government's new
pricing policies which dramatically increased crop value to farmers over a
period of two to three years. It would, however, be constructive to compare
this experience with that of a country whose Government has adopted a policy
of allowing prices to be determined and to fluctuate according to world market
conditions without the participation of a promotion agency, in order to better
understand the necessity and advantages of establishing such agencies, with
and without complementary incentives measures.

(CREDIT 945-TO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
1.          INTRODUCTION
1.01        At the end of the 1970s, the Togolese economy grow at about 5X per
year, as a result of comparatively favorable prices for phosphates, coffee and
cocoa. In 1977, per capita income was about US$300, although there were
considerable disparities between the urban and rural sectors.
1.02        The Fourth Economic and Social Development Plan (1981-85) aimed at
achieving a 6.5% annual growth rate by implementing a CFAF 370 billion
investment program, using domestic and external resources. As a priority,
rural development was to receive 40% of this investment, the main objectives
being to consolidate food self-sufficiency and increase exportable output.
1.03        The 1981 general population and housing census shows that the
rural sector accounts for 752 of the total population, with a 2.41 annual
growth rate; however, in 1981 the primary sector employed only 66S of the
active population, and its share of national economic activity is gradually
declining. In 1978 it provided only 301 of GDP at factor cost.
Fooderops (maize, sorghum, yams and cassava) constitute 75X of
agricultural output. Cash crops (coffee, cocoa, cotton and palm) had fallen
to only 251 of the total value of exports by the end of the 1970s, after
having constituted over 60% at the beginning of the decade.

1.04        The project area, in the southwest of the Plateau region, covers
about 5,800 ki2, divided into the following four main ecological zones:



18
the eastern plain (about 240,000 ha), which is comparatively
marginal land for coffee and cocoa growing because rainfall is
often inadequate (ranging from 1,200 mm to 1,400 mm);
the piedmont area (about 150,000 ha), which is better watered
(from 1,300 min to 1,500 mm) and therefore more favorable;
the plateaus (190,000 ha), which are divided into four well-
differentiated units (Akebou, Akposso, Dayes and Kloto) and are
suited to coffee growing, being well-watered (from 1,400 mm to
1,600 mm of rainfall);
the Litime pla.i.. in the west (about 30,000 ha), which produces
cocoa almost exclusively.
Soils are very diverse, depending on their origins (i.e. granite
or gneiss in the plain, and quartz or schist on the plateaus) and the local
topography. This diversity, together with agricultural development, have
produced three main types of facies, i.e. forest (degraded, to a greater or
lessex degree), "rich" savannah, and "poor" savannah.
1.05        According to the 1985 census, there are 365,000 inhabitants in the
three administrative districts (i.e. the Prefectures of Kloto, Wawa and Amou)
affected by the project. SRCC's area of activities contains 290,000
inhabitants, mostly belonging to the Ewe (37%) and Akposso (30%) ethnic
groups, with nonnative Kabye settlers constituting 16% of the total
population. Consequently, the following are the main characteristics of the
project area:
=     a quite high population density (50 inhabitants per km2);
=     a population that is ethnically very heterogeneous;
-     diversity of population and ethnic groups in the subregions;
i.e. a "closed" region with a small population (the Akebou
plateau, inhabited by the Akebou), a "closed" region that is
highly populated (the Dayes plateau, inhabited by the Ewe), and an
"open' region (Litime) inhabited by the Lw;, Akposso and Kabye.
1.06        There are about 35,000 farms, with an average of 8.5 persons per
farm. Almost all t'iese farms produce fooderops (generally on several
parcels), usually through a system of associated crops, the main one being
maize (as an early, and sometimes late, crop). Fallowing periods vary,
depending on the area and the pressure on the land; they can be short or
nonexistent on the Dayes plateau, and long on the Akebou plateau.
Cocoa plantations (which are found in concentrated patterns in the
Litime region, but are more scattered elsewhere) generally produce the
Amelonado type, although there are some instances in which Ghanaian planting
*material has been introduced. The plantat4Ons cover about 45,000 ha. The
main technical reasons for their poor yields (from 100 to 150 kg per ha) are



19
their age and the effects of swollen shoot virus disease (Kloto) and
Phytophthora megakarya (Litime).
The coffee plantations tend to be concentrated on the plateaus.
Because some of the former Niaouli plantations have been abandoned, it is
difficult to make an accurate calculation of the area actually under
cultivation, but it is also likely to be about 45,000 ha.
1.07        Land tenure and cultivation systems are particularly diversified
and complicated. The two extreme cases are the landowning farmers (generally
native to the regions), and the sharecroppers (who can be either native or
nonnative to the region), although the latter can become owners under the
Dibi-Madibi' form of contract, which provides for the division of land.
There are many types of sharecropping agreement, reflecting on the
one hand the type of labor required of sharecroppers (i.e. whether planting or
merely operating), and on the other hand the relative strengths of the
landowners and the workers.
In the case of Litime, the land problem is further complicated by
absenteeism on the part of certain owners, disparities of farm size, and the
existence due to historical factors of cross-border families and farms on the
Ghana-Togo frontier.
II.         PROJECT PREPARATION AND FORMULATION
Origins and Background
2.01        This project is a follow-up to the following activities in the
coffee and cocoa sectors:
(i)   in 1967, implementation of an applied research program on cocoa
and coffee, executed by IRCC at the Tova experimental station;
(ii)   in 1971-75, implementation of a partly FAC-financed interim
program of coffee and cocoa development, executed by SRCC, a State
enterprise established by Decree 711165 of November 29th, 1971;
(iii)   as a result of a World Bank appraisal mission in March/April 1973,
implementation over a five-year period (1975-80) of the First
Cocoa/Coffee Development Project, financed jointly by IDA (US$6
million; Credit 503-TO), FAC (a grant of US$1.7 million), and the
Togolese Government (US$2.8 million, including taxes and duties),
with the following objectives:
-     the planting of 4,400 ha of cocoa and 4,000 ha of coffee, by
producing and distributing high quality planting material
and supporting agricultural credi-;
-     institutional development in the executing agency (SRCC) and
PCU (the Project Credit Unit, an administrative component of
CNCA: Caisse Na lonale de Credit Agricole);



20
-     continuation of IRCC's coffee and cocoa experfiments;
-     construction andlor rehabilitation of 160 km of feeder
roads, and maintenance of the existing system;
-     preparation of various studies (including evaluation of the
project, and assessment of the feasibility of a further
project).
2.02        Performance with regard to the physical objectives (which were
partially revised after a supervision mission in September/October 1978)
varied from one component to another;
(i)   The feeder roads target was exceeded by 22S, with construction and
rehabilitation of 196 km, compared with the initial objective of
160 km, and with 1980 construction costs totaling CFAF 1,990,000
per km (including amortization) and maintenance costs totaling
CFAF 48,540 per km (average annual program - 74 km).
(ii)   The program of expanding coffee cultivation exceeded its target by
43%, with 5,740 ha of new plantations, as a result of the
following subprograms:
-     the production and dissemination of planting material
(i.e. seedlings or cuttings);
-     planting credit, granted on the basis of CFAF 73,000/ha,
then CFAF 90,000/ha, and finally (in 1980) CFAF 100,000/ha
(in cash and in kind).
This program benefited 10,993 farmers.
(iii)   she program for rehabilitating old cocoa plantations using hybrid
seed from Zozokondji achieved only 49% of its objectives. Once
the old plantations had been cleared, 2,164 ha were replanted, in
spite of the financial incentives offered (i.e. premiums for
clearance) and the increases in credit (CFAF 40,000/ha, then
CFAF 50,0001ha, CFAF 66,000/ha, and finally -- in 1980 --
CFAF 80,000/ha).
In addition, about 300 ha (142 of the established plantations)
were destroyed by drought.
CFAF 524 million was provided over the project period by OPAT
(Office des Produits Agricoles du Togo) to finance anticapsid
treatment for the old cocoa plantations (on force account).
2.03        Institutional development activities produced the following
results:



21
(i)   the organization of SRCC into three departments (Agricultural
Operations, Roads and General Services);
(ii)   the establishment of five new sectors, increasing the total to 12,
with between 10 and 15 extension workers per sector (with a total
of 120 extension workers, and an average of 120 planters per
extension worker);
(iii)   an increase in the number of agents from 200 to 400, the main
reason being the production of planting material on force account;
(iv)   the formalization of the links between research and development,
as a result of the SRCC-IRCC service agreements;
(v)   increased personne3 resources (from 17 to 21) and improved
procedures in UCP.
2.04        In spite of the good results achieved with regard to physical
components and institution building, the economic and financial resuLts fell
short of expectationst
(i) Yields were revised downward, in the case of both cocoa (from
1,000 kglha to 750 kg/ha, for a normal year) and coffee (from
1,200 kg/ha to 750 kg/ha, in an average year after pruning). As a
result, and in light of the area actually developed, the output
resulting from the project was reassessed downward (from 4,400
tons to 1,300 tons in a normal year in the case of cocoa, and from
4,800 tons to 3,000 tons in the case of coffee).
Consequently, the project's economic rate of return was reduced by
five points (from 33Z to 282).
(ii)   Actual expenditures by SRCC (excluding the roads program) meant
that development costs per ha exceeded the level projected at
appraisal by 252 (CFAF 212,000 instead of CFAF 167,000).
(iii)   Finally, the agricultural credit program encountered the following
serious problems:
-     PCU's operating costs were considerably higher than the
original estimates. Because the volume of loans granted was
smaller than expected, the ratio of operating costs to
disbursements was excessively high (30%).
-     The medium-term loan recovery rate was only 45% (CFAF 26.7
million recovered, out of CFAF 58.9 million).
-    Although better, the recovery rate for short-term loans was
80S at the most.

Description
2.05        The Second Cocoa and Coffee Development Project, which followed up
the First Project financed by IDA Credit 503-TO, was appraised in October 1978
(Appraisal Report 2408-TO, of June 1979). The execution period was intended
to be five and a half years, and the project had the following objectivess
(a)   the planting of about 7,500 ha of coffee and 4,000 ha of cocoa by
about 17,000 smallholder farmers;
(b)   the provision of marketing facilitie- for plantain grown as
temporary shade for young cocoa treed;
(c)   the promotion of improved foodcrops, to be intercropped in the
cocoa and coffee plantations. and also grown outside the
plantations;
(d)   the provision to farmers of improved extension services, inputs
and credit;
(e) the strengthening of SRCC by tl.e appointment of a Financial
Manager and improved supervision and training for extension
workers;
(f)   the improvement of planting material and seed, through applied
research, for:
(i)   cocoa and coffee, under a contract with IRCC;
(ii)   fooderops, under a contract with IRAT;
(g)  the construction of low-cost stores and technical advice for 80
villages on the post-harvest period for cocoa and coffee;
(h)   construction and rehabilitation of about 300 km of feeder roads,
and maintenance of the feeder roads constructed under the First
and Second Projects;
(i)   during the third year, financing for an evaluation study of the
project and the possible preparation of a follow-up project;
during the second year, financing of a consultants' study of the
Togolese plantain market.

Average yields were to be as follows, irrespective of area and
type of farmer:
Year          3    4    5    6    7    8    9    10    11    12    13    14    15

In these circumstances, the additional output resulting from the
project was expected to be 800 tons in the fifth year, and stabilize at 3,225
tons from the 17th year.
Once sustainability was achieved (in the 12th year), income per
man-day would be CFAF 652, i.e. 1892 of its level without the project.

The additional output due to the project was expected to be 1,600
tons in the 10th year, and 2,400 tons once sustainability was achieved (from
the 13th year).
Income per man-day would be CFAF 1,312 from the 12th year, l.e.
127% of its level without the project.
In addition, the old trees were to be kept in production, through
the generalized application of anticapsid treatments.
(c)         Foodcrops
By the end of the project, about 12,000 farmers were to be
benefi.ed by improvements to fooderops (involving growing methods,
fertilization and seed), and the following targets were set with respect to
area (in ha):
Year 1     Year 2    Year 3       Year 4      Year 5
Maize       -        1,000     2,000       3,000        3,000
Rice        -           -        350         700        1,050
Cowpeas     -           -        100         200          300
Groundnuts  -           -        100         200          300
Sorghum     -         200        400         600          800
Root crops  -          310     1,110       1,780        1,860
Plantains   -         600        700         800          900
The following were the projected yieldss
Without -roiect      With proiect
Maize (tons/ha)          0.7                1.3
Paddy (tons/ha)          0.5               1.3
Cowpeas (tonslha)        0.25              0.5
Cassava (tonslha)        5.0               9.0
Project implementation was intended to increase cereal output by
3,000 tons and root crop output by 7,000 tons.  Plantain output was to reach a
ceiling of 18,500 tons in the sixth year.
2.07        Implementation of the coffee and cocoa programs involved:
(i)    the strengthening of extension;
(ii)    production and dissemination of inputs, including high-quality
planting material;



25
(iii)    financing by PCU of some of the planting costs; the IDA financing
supplied to the Government for implementing the agricultural
credit component was onlent to CNCA under the Subsidiary Loan
Agreement at an interest rate of 1%.
The following conditions were applied to the CNCA-PCU financing
provided for planting programs:
-    selection of candidates by SRCC's Extension Service;
-    granting of individual credits to farmers' groups (annual interest
rate = 8.5%), at the rate of CFAF 80,000 per ha (for cocoa) and
CFAF 95,000 per ha for coffee, the loans being released over five
years (for cocoa) and four years (for coffee).
These credits were in kind (CFAF 15,250 per ha for cocoa and
CFAF 18,600 per ha for coffee) and in cash (CFAF 63,150 per ha for cocoa and
CFAE 74,500 per ha for coffee).
Credits were for a period of eight years with a four-year grace
period in the case of coffee, and for 12 years with a six-year grace period in
the case of cocoa.
In addition, a premium of CFAF 60,000 per ha was to be paid to
planters as compensation for clearing old cocoa trees.
In order to ensure equilibrium in PCU's operations, an annual
government subsidy of 2.5Z was added to the 8.5S payable on the credits.
2.08        The following measures were also proposed, in order to make the
programs more attractive to farmers, achieve the desired objectives, and
enhance the microeconomic and macroeconomic impact:
(i)   a study of the custom-based landlord-tenant relationship in the
Litime region, and introduction of standard landlord-farmer
contracts;
(i$)   establishment in OPAT of a Cash Crops Analysis Bureau (Bureau
d'Analyse des Cultures de Rente), with particular responsibility
for the annual negotiation of producer prices with IDA;
(iii)   establishment of an Organization of Licensed Buyers (Organisation
d'Acheteurs Agrees), to be responsible for efficient marketing,
and for improving PCU's loan recovery rate.
2.09        The following were included in the calculation of project costs:
(a) a 10% allowance for physical contingencies for investments and
operating costs (excluding treatments);
(b) an allowance for financial contingencies, calculated as follows:



26
-    C-ivil Works and Buildingss 9% for the first year and 8S for each
of the subsequent years;
-    Vehicles and Equipment:  7.5% for the first year and 6.51 for each
of the subsequent years;
-    Wages and Salaries:  10.5Z for each year;
-    Other operating costs:  9% for the first year and 6.5% for each of
the subsequent years;
-    Credit:  8% for each year.
As a result, the total project cost was US$34.2 million
(CFAF 7.531 billion), with the following breakdown:

2.10        The proposed financing was to be provided by IDA, CCCE, FAC, the
EC, and the Togolese Government (with budgetary and OPAT resources).
(a)         The IDA Credit (US$14 million, or 41% of total project costs) was

The conditions were the same as for the IDA Credit.
Csc)        The CCCE financing was provided under two loan arrangements, the
total amount being F 34.4 million (F 9.4 million + F 25 million), equivalent
to US$7.7 million.
The annual interest rate on these Loans was 4.5Z, and the loan
period was 18 years, with a grace period of four years.
(d)         The FAC financing was to be provided under annual grant
agreements, the total amount being F 15 million (equivalent to US$3.5
million).
(e)         Finally, the Togolese Government contribution was to be US$4.4
million.
The executing agencies (SRCC and CNCA/PCU) managed the financing
in accordance with the pari passu arrangements, with the following breakdown
of expenditures among donors:
IDA   :    54%
CCCE  s    33%
FAC   :    13%



29
2.11        The IDA Credit was to be released in 18 quarterly disbursements,
in accordance with the schedule shown in Annex I.
2.12        For the Government, project implementation was to result in net
foreign exchange gains totaling about US$10 million (at 1978 prices),
beginning in 1993. As regards employment, the planting programs would require
a work force of 20,500 additional man-years. Once sustainability was
attained, additional employment would amount to 6,750 man-years.
Assuming: (i) an exchange rate of US$1 = CFAF 220; (ii) an
additional labor cost resulting from the lag behind market prices (i.e.
CFAP 200 per man-day); (iii) output losses resulting from the clearance of old
trees; (iv) an economic life of 30 years for the coffee and cocoa components,
and 15 years for the foodstuffs component; (v) the assumption that the roads
component would be 652 of the coffee program and 35% of the cocoa p;ogram, the
estimated economic rates of return were as follows:
18% overall;
14% for the cocoa component;
20% for the coffee component;
25% for the fooderops component.
The increase in labor costs to match market prices (CFAF 400 per
man-day) reduces the overall ERR to 13%.
III.        PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Establishment of the Prolect
3.01        During negotiations for the IDA Credit, the Government entered
into the following commitments:
- - A landlord-tenant contract was to be introduced and applied in the
main cocos producing area (Litime).
-     There were to be annual consultations with IDA on producer prices
for coffee and cocoa. To this end, a Cash Crops Analysis Bureau
(Bureau d'Analyse des Cultures de Rente) was to be established in
OPAT.
-     In order to facilitate loan recovery, an Organization of Licensed
Buyers (Organisation d'Acheteurs Agres) was to be established.
-     Anticapsid treatment would continue to be applied to all cocoa
trees in Togo, with OPAT financing.
_     SRCC and CNCA/PCU accounts and financial statements were to be
annually audited by independent experts.



30
The Government was to provide the IDA financing to SRCC under a
Grant Agreement, and to CNCAIPCU under a Loan Agreement.
In order to ensure PCU's financial equilibrium, the Government
(through OPAT) was to pay CNCAIPCU an annual 2.5% supplement on
farmers' credits that were still outstanding.
So that fooderop experiments could be conducted and seeds
produced, the Centres Polyvalents of Adeta and Klabe-Azafi were to
be transferred to SRCC. In addition, the Government was to cover
IRAT's expenditure on the Adeta Center for FY79.
The qualifications and expertise of appointees to the posts of
General Manager, Director of PCU, and SRCC Section Chiefs (i.e. in
Administration and Finance, Production of Planting Material
Training and Extension, General Services and Engineering, and Road
Construction and Maintenance) had to be approved by IDA.
Moreover, effectiveness of the Credit was subject to the following
conditions:
(i)   completion of a Loan Agreement with CCCE and a Financing Agreement
with FAC;
(it)   an Initial deposit by the Government of CFAF 50 million In the SRCC
account and CFAF 25 million in the CNCA/PCU account.
3.02        In spite of the lessons that had been learned when the First
Project became effective, and although the same causes produced the same
effects, the IDA and EC Credits became effective on July 11, 1980, about one
year after signature of the Credit Agreements (July 23, 1979), and over three
months after the deadline for effectiveness, which had been set for March 31,
1980. The reasons for this were delays in the payment of the Togolese
financing (April 21 and 25, 1980) and in the signature of the Loan Agreement
with CCCE (November 29, 1979). In any case, the delay had no particular effect
on SRCC's operations or on the implementation of programs.
3.03        As will be seen in greater detail later in this report, in general
the Government fulfilled its commitments:
(i)   Standard landlord-tenant contracts were proposed, for both coffee
and cocoa planters. However, they were of very limited success,
especially among landlords in the Litime region, for whom they were
particularly intended.
(ii)   As a result of a consultant's study in 1983 on the policy governing
agricultural price setting, an Agricultural Price Analysis Unit was
established in OPAT. On the other hand, the annual consultations
between the Government and IDA for setting producer prices were
never really formalized. Very fortunately, however, this did not
prevent yearly price changes.



31
(iii)   In 1980, in an attempt to rationalize agricultural product
marketing and improve loan recovery, STCP (the Togolese Product
Marketing Enterprise) was established by merging the agricultural
product buying activities of the main local commercial enterprises,
with OPAT becoming a minority stockholder in the new organization.
(iv)   The Government supplied the loan financing necessary for project
execution to SRCC (under the Second Grant Agreement of April 1,
1980) and CNCA (under the Second Subsidiary Loan Agreement of
April 1, 1980).
(v)   Under the Second Subsidiary Loan Agreement, the Government
undertook to repay to CNCA a portion of the intersst (2.51) accrued
on the amounts disbursed by CNCA.
(vi)   The SRCC and PCU accounts and financial statements were regularly
inspected; moreover, the accounts of SRCC, as a government
enterprise, were required to be audited each year. In addition to
the independent audits, an international auditing firm annually
examined the accounts of SRCC and PCU.
(vii)   OPAT took financial responsibility for anticapsid treatment for all
cocoa plantations, either by paying SRCC bills or by directly
supplying the necessary materials.
(viii)   SRCC's internal organization changed over time, since certain
officials (including some in the Office of the General Manager)
were replaced. Nevertheless, this did not interfere with project
execution, and occurred with the agreement of all parties
concerned.
(ix)   Finally, the Adeta and Klabe-Azafi Centers, which were transferred
to SRCC, were used for IRAT experimental programs and seed
production.
3.04        The following changes were made during the course of the project:
(i)   The following technical changes should be noted:
-     Cocoa replanting after land clearance and the use of
plantains for temporary shade was abandoned in favor of
replanting new cocoa trees under the shade of old cocoa
trees. No further credit was extended for the original
proced4re, or premiums for clearance paid (January 1983).
-     The 1984-86 cocoa program was restricted to full-scale trials
(Supervision, April 1984).
-     Foodcrop experiments were partly redirected toward the
adaptation of production systems (April 1985).
(ii)   The following financial changes were made:



32
The project was extended by one year (1986; Supervision,
1984).
The pari-passu arrangements were altered in light of the
financing available for FY85 and FY86. The revised breakdown
was as follows:
IDA s 852; CCCE s 9%; FAC s 62.
In these circumstances, budgetary conditions (see Annex 2)
made it possible to extend the project until the end of
1986.
Physical Progress
3.05        Improvements in communications with certain zones, and in the road
system throughout the project area, continued in accordance with the following
approved technical standards: (a) maximum gradient 4%; (b) width - from 8 m
to 10 m; (c) laterite surfacing:  depth = 20 cm; width - 6 m; (d) side
ditches; (e) use of satulos (TNt ? Not found] for small-scale crossing works.
The physical components were implemented throughout the project
area. From 1981 to 1986, 308 km of new roads were constructed, slightly
exceeding the original targets. By the end of 1986, 625 km of roads had been
constructed or rehabilitated.
At the same time, regular maintenance was performed, consisting of
cutting away new growth (either by hand or by mechanized means), or of cutting
followed by reshaping. 'Heavy' maintenance also involved the resurfacing of
selected stretches. On average, 160 km were reshaped each year. (The
maintenance program applied to both the SRCC system and 'farmers' tracks.')
3.06        Road construction costs increased from CFAF 1,662,000 per km in
1980 to CFAF 2,700,000 per km in 1986 (excluding amortization), an average
annual increase of 10.5%. At the same time, the price of a 140-G Caterpillar
grader rose from CFAF 24 million in 1980 to CFAF 46 million in 1985
(equivalent to an annual increase of 18%). Allowing for equipment
depreciation, the cost in 1986 was CFAF 4.09 million per km.
The cost of maintaining 1 km of road in 1986 was CFAF 86,000
(excluding amortization) and CFAF 150,000 (including amortization), a
considerable increase over 1980. However, these costs remain very competitive
with the prices charged by contractors, and reflect good site organization and
efficient management of equipment.
3.07        A study by the Monitoring and Evaluation Unit on the economic
impact of the road program confirmed the role played by this component in
increasing both the area devoted to coffee growing and the amount of input
use. There are grounds for assuming that the roads provide considerable
benefits for the private commercial sector, although this was not analyzed in
the study.



33
3.08        The coffee program was based on the following principles, which
also applied to the First Project:
(i)   the selection of candidutes (organized into farmers' groups) on
the basis of SRCC technical criteria (soil studies and land
surveys) and PCU financial criteria (the requirement that
applicants be current in servicing previous credit, and
establishment of a group fund);
(ii)   the implementation of two subprograms, i.e. B (using cuttings) and
C (using seedlings).
However, the Second Project was characterized by the following:
(i)   a division into 'productivity zones," reflected in the geographical
revisions of the programs;
(ii)   the beginning of pruning operations;
(iii)   the transfer to private nurseries (in 1986) of a portion of the
seedling production activities initiated in the SRCC and IRCG
propagation centers.
3.09        Annex 4 shows the areas planted.  From 1981 through 1986, 10,988 ha
of new plantations were established, so that the original target was exceeded
by 46%. In particular, the following should be noted:
(i)  Because Zone I was very productive (with a yield exceeding 800 kg
per ha in the west of the plateau), whereas Zone II was
intermediately productive (with a yield ranging from 600 kg per ha
to 800 kg per ha in the east of the plateau) and Zone III showed
poor productivity (with a yield of under 600 kg per ha, in the
plain and the piedmont regions), activities were gradually
transferred from Zone III to Zones I and II:
1975-80                         1981-86
Sector                Percentage per Zone              Percentage per Zone

Total             27.6  32.11  40.29   100         50.8  31.3  17.9    100



34
(ii)   The planting rate speeded up in the final two years (i.e. programs
B and C):
1981  t  1,744 ha
1982  t  1,570 ha
1983  s  1,870 ha
1984  s  1,740 ha
1985  s  1,924 ha
1986  s 2,140 ha
(iii)   The proportion between program B and program C remained virtually
constant, with an average breakdown of 35% for seedling planting
and 65% for cutting planting (village nurseries).
(iv)   About 50% of the area's farmers were affected by these programs
(i.e. 21,625 planters, although this figure will include some
double -- or even triple -- counting because of those farmers who
operate more than one plantation).
3.10    The establishment of new coffee plantations depends on the
distribution of planting material produced in the SRCC propagation centers at
Kougnouhou (Akebou), Kiabe Azafi (Akposso), Dzogbegan (Dayes), Ezize (Plaine)
and the Tove IRCC center. Output from the various centers considerably
increased from 1981 to 1986, without any need for expansion or major investment
at this level. The centers' productivity and 'profitability' therefore
improved, as followss
1981         1986        Difference
Output of seedlings (total)                870,000      1,585,000          +82%

Cost price per rooted cutting (CFAF)        8.32         9.15             +10%
As can be seen, the subsidy on the planting material supplied was
reduced.



35
In addition, supplies of seedlings to private coffee growers (through
cash sales) considerably increased (from 8.4% of total deliveries in 1982 to
18.3% of deliveries in 1986).
The production of seedlings by private nurseries (launched in the
final year of the project) could provide a basis for new activities in the
third phase of the Project, subject to satisfactory evaluation.
3.11     Excluding 1983, which was characterized by an exceptional drought, the
fertilization rate for coffee plantations in process of being established (i.e.
the first three years) was almost 100%.
Fertilization of coffee plantations already in production (i.e. from
their fourth year) consists of the application of 400 kg/ha of 20-10-10
complete fertilizer, financed by PCU/OPAT seasonal credits. This produced
clear improvements:
1981        1982    1983       1984      1985     1986
Amount applied
(tons)                   187.4       607.5   557.8      1,085.9  1,819.3  2,473.0

Nevertheless, there would be some justification in applying
different levels of fertilization from one 'productivity zone' to another.
3.12        It is usually recommended that coffee trees be pruned every five
years (i.e. on bud-bearing branches). DOA productivity studies (on a sample
representing about 30% of the areas planted) showed a decline in yields from
the seventh harvest. When the objectives were planned, therefore, these
results were taken into account, and the orchard was pruned one third at a time
from the seventh harvest. As a consequence, gradually more satisfactory
results were achieved, reaching a satisfactory level in 1985:

3.13        The cocoa program was based on replacing the old Amelonado cocoa
trees with Amelonado-Upper Amazon hybrids produced on the 16 [TN: ha?; unit
not given on original] of the Zozokondji seed field using the following
methodss (a) total clearance and use of plantain for temporary shade;
(b) interplanting with the old cocoa trees, and gradual clearance of the
latter; (c) the opening of trails in forest regrown after cutting; however, it
fell far short of the expected results. In 1983, the suspension of planting
credits and the premiums for felling old trees served only to slow down the
program even more, although the effects of this measure should not be
exaggerated.
In spite of the initial target of planting 4,000 ha in five years,
only 1,117 ha were planted in the six years of the project, i.e. 28%. In spite
of frequent replacement of seedlings (a mortality of between 30% and 35% being
frequent on land replanted after cutting), by the end of the project only 710
ha remained:

3.14        As provided in the Credit Agreements, anticapsid treatments of
cocoa trees were financed by OPAT and applied to all cocoa plantations (by
spraying the young cocoa trees and using thermal-fog applicators for old trees;
i.e. those over five years old). The areas treated ranged from 50 to 60,000
ha, but statements on this issue are to be regarded with caution, even though
the treatments were performed on force account.

Each year, between CFAF 180 million and CFAF 220 million were
allocated to these operations, the average cost per ha treated (in two
applications) ranging from CFAP 4,000 to CFAF 5,000.
To increase the efficiency of the treatments, the following two
studies were prepared: (a) an analysis of mirid population monitoring, by SRCC
and IRCC, so that the action schedule could be made more effective;
(b) identification of problems relating to anticapsid control, by an external
consultant (December 1986), the recommendations of which will provide
guidelines for activities under the Third Project.



37
3.15        The output losses due to Phytophthora megakarya (black pod disease)
were extensive, and IRCC calculates that they affected between 501 and 60% of
total potential output. Through demonstrations, followed by extension
activities, SRCC attempted to induce farmers to safeguard their cocoa trees by
spraying. The results were poor, in terms of both number of farmers (from 200
to 300 per year) and the area of land receiving some degree of treatment (about
100 ha). The reasons for this acknowledged failure lie in the low productivity
of the cocoa trees and the conditions governing operations. Because of the
cost of treatment (from CFAF 20,000 to CFAF 25,000 per ha in labor, materials
and equipment), and the anticipated increase in output, generally only those
landowners farming their own land find it economically attractive to apply
these treatments. For sharecroppers, the outcome is economically negative,
except for those parcels that are potentially highly productive (i.e. over 450
kg per ha), and these are extremely uncommon.
3.16        The foodcrops programs began to develop properly only toward the
end ef the project (i.e. in the 1985 and 1986 crop seasons). Annex 5 shows the
results for the project areas. It will be noted that, overall, the original
targets were exceeded by 2252, and the revised objectives by 358%. Naturally,
maize was the most dynamic crop in the program, with 8,615 ha (produced by both
intercropping and single cropping, and grown as both an early and a late crop).
3.17        However, the impact of these activities on yields and output has
yet to be confirmed, because the mere distribution of high-quality seed and the
dissemination of improved growing methods (relating to the production calendar
and seed densities) do not seem to be the main factors in increasing yields;
fertilizers (for maize and rice) and sprayers and pesticides (for cowpeas) are
essential, and this is confirmed by the series of tests carried out on maize by
DOA in 1985. These showed: (a) a 'variety effect" ranging from 5% to 152,
depending on the use or nonuse of fertilizers; (b) a "fertilizer effect"
ranging from 20% to 30%, depending on the varieties and growing methods used.
Because of the lack of credit support, materials were paid for in
cash, and the results reflect this. Nevertheless, in 1986 about 22 tons of
fertilizers were supplied for the maize crcp season, and it may also be assumed
that farmers used some of their coffee fertilizer on their foodcrop parcels
(although the amounts in question are probably small).
3.18        Initially, IRAT was responsible for seed production and
distribution (from its station in Adeta). Subsequently, a network of farmers'
nurseries was gradually developed, and by 1986 it was producing part of the
seed supply, under IRAT's technical supervision.

TOTAL             39.3        31.1        44.7         61.4
It should be noted thats  (a) from 10% to 20% of the total fooderop
area monitored by the project received high-quality seed; (b) production costs
(the purchase price for maize from farmers' nurseries being CFAF 106 per kg in
1986) and the cost of handling, packing and certification (i.e. the IRAT level
of about CFAF 200 per kg) are very much higher than the selling price (CFAF 140
per kg).
Related Activities
3.19        The Government called upon SRCC to conduct Togolese-financed full-
scale experiments on irrigated coffee production. Ten ha were planted on a
former irrigated production area in Mission Tove (35 km from Lome), and
irrigation was by sprinkler. A cost analy;is for the first five years of
operations indicates that, in local condliions, the break-even point would be
about 1,800 kg per ha of green coffee.   onsequently, the 1985186 yields (1,997
kg per ha) would make the operation financially profitable, under rigorous
operational and management conditions.
3.20        After 1980, it was not possible to continue the attempts to
establish coffee and cocoa marketing groups, because of opposition from the
private commercial sector and OPAT. Instead of operating through the normal
commercial channels, SRCC and PCU launched the following two upstream
processing programst
(i)   SRCC provided Brazilian husking equipment (with a capacity of two
tons of unshelled coffee per hour) at transfer prices of
CFAF 1,545,000 for the unit and CFAF 670,000 for the engine to a
private operator (for cash) and a group affiliated to UNICOOP KLOTO
(on credit).
After six years of operations, the results could not really be
considered good. Taking costs and debt servicing into account, the
break-even point is about 80 tons of green coffee per crop season.
For various reasons, particularly competition from private
manufacturers (who generally act as collection centers) the amount
processed -- after reaching a level of 54 tons in the year the
equipment was installed -- has been about 30 tons at the most.



39
(ii)   As part of a medium-term capital works credit program, CNCA/PCU
installed 16 very small-scale coffee processing plants in 1984185
and 1985/86, for groups and private operators. The process of
forming groups is to continue (there were 12 applications for
1986187).
Studies
3.21        With FAC financing, an MRE mission took place in 1983 and produced
a report in March 1984. This evaluation was updated in 1985 and the
information it provided on the human and socioeconomic setting (e.g. the
distribution of ethnic groups, the labor force, appropriations and development
activities) and the motivations guiding farmers in the region enabled SRCC and
PCU to understand the problems affecting cocoa programs and loan recovery. The
study also drew attention to the ambiguity inherent in the expansion of coffee
growing (i.e. whether the strategy should focus on land tenure or farming
operations as such).
3.22        Consulting firms prepared two studies on PCU's loan recovery
problems. Le paysan et le credit ("Farmers and Credit," 1983184) was general
in nature, and therefore not directly related to the project. The other, a
study of marketing and coffeelcocoa loan recovery (1985), was more particularly
concerned with the CocoalCoffee Project.
3.23        It should also be noted that a preparatory study for the third
phase of the project was prepared as part of the joint FAO/World Bank program,
and that this phase was jointly appraised in February 1986.
In addition, consultants performed missions to support SRCC's
services and related agencies (IRCC and IRAT) in implementing their programs
(see 'Institutional Development").
Procurement and Construction
3.24        Most of the investment in buildings was made during the initial
phases of the project. The following activities were performed in the second
phaset
-     an increase in storage capacity, with the construction of large
facilities (Sodo and Klabe Azafe for SRCC, and Adeta for IRAT);
-     an expansion of management infrastructure in Kpalima (mainly by
adapting existing buildings);
-     improvements in operating conditions (i.e., radiotelephone
equipment, tubewells and water towers, self-generated electric
power and computerization).
3.25        Much of the civil engineering and transportation equipment was
renewed during SRCC II. As a result, the following items were acquireds



40
2 D7 Caterpillars;
1 D6 Caterpillar.
NB: In 1987, the unspent balance for SRCC II was partly used to acquire a
Komatsu D8 bulldozer.
3 140-G Caterpillar graders;
1 IH loader;
3 agricultural tractors (Renault and MF);
22 heavy dumpster and flatbed trucks (from France, the Federal
Republic of Germany and Japan);
77 light vehicles (France).
3.26        Procurement was conducted according to the standard World Bank
procedures and Togolese administrative regulations (i.e. prior authorization,
and submission to the Central Contracts Committee).
Bid selection criteria included the availability of efficient
after-sales services in Togo, and the need for a degree of standardization in
the stock of equipment to be established and managed.
Costs and Financing
3.27        SRCC II concluded on December 31, 1986.  In light of the resources
remaining as of that date, the various donors allowed SRCC to use the unspent
balances to finance specific expenditures up to June 30, 1987.
Consequently, the final status of the financing was as follows:
(M)    EC Special Action Account (used up as of June 30, 1981)
Amount allocated:       US$4,600,000
Drawn down: SRCC:       CFAF   931,210,472
PCU/CNCA:   CFAF   146,139,242
Total:      CFAF 1,077,349,714
(ii)    FAC Grant
Amount allocated:        CFAF   750,000,000
Drawn down: SRCC:       CFAF   579,039,262
PCU:        CFAF   156,278,334
Total:      CFAF   735,317,596



41
(iMi)    CCCE Loan
Amount allocated:       CFAF 1,720,000,000
Drawn down: SRCCt       CFAF 1,355,911,617
PCU:        CFAF   363,545,694
Total:      CFAF 1,719,457,311
(iv)    IDA Credit
Amount allocated: SRCC: US$11,010,000
PCU: US$ 2,990,000
(The unallocated funding was distributed.)
Drawn down: SRCC:       US$10,959,253.57
PCUs        USS 2,748,228
Total:      CFAP 4,920,286,000
The following Togolese funding was added to the above external
financing:
(v)    BIE (financing for off-project activities, such as the Mission Tove
irrigated coffee production area):
CFAF 92.7 million;
(vi)    OPATISRCC (mainly financing for antimirid control):
CFAF 1,563.2 million;
(vii)    SRCC self-financing (following up BIE financing for off-budget and
seed production activities):
CFAF 34 million;
(viii)    OPATIPCU (share in cost of producer credit, and total financing of
seasonal credits):
CFAP 357.6 million;
As a result, the total project cost was CFAF 10,499,900,000, with
the following breakdowns
SRCC:       80.91
PCU:        19.1%
External financing:  80.51:   IDA (24-TO and 945-TO):  57.17
CCCE                  s 16.41
FAC                   s  71
Government: 19.5%



42
3.28        A breakdown by year of project costs and financing (see Annex 6)
indicates the following:
-     a marked acceleration in credit drawdown from FY84;
-     a large unspent balance on Credit 945-TO as of December 31, 1985,
since 70% of the Credit had been withdrawn as of the scheduled
project completion date.
3.29    A breakdown of expenditures by category for Credit 942-TO (see Annex 7)
shows an average overrun of 8.8% on project costs (excluding the "unallocated"
item).
Financing for the "Buildings," "Roads" and "Studies" items was only
partially withdrawn. The largest overrun, in absolute terms, was that
affecting "Local Personnel and Operating Costs."
3.30        The quarterly analysis of disbursements on Credit 945-TO (see
Annex 8) shows that the actual disbursement rate was much lower than planned.
In particular, actual disbursements had reached only 50% of the planned level
as of the scheduled closing date.
There were the following two reasons for this:
i)    the comparatively slow start-up (55% of planned disbursements as of
June 30, 1982, even though the value of the US$ had not yet greatly
increased);
(ii)    a sharp increase in the value of the US$ during the financial years
from 1982/83 to 1985186.
In addition, the disbursement rate considerably speeded up from
FY85186, partly as a result of changes in the pari-passu arrangements among the
donors.
3.31        Annex 9  shows results by cost center from FY80 to FY86.  However,
the data for 1980 included the unspent balance on SRCC I, and no breakdown by
cost center is available for the unspent balance in 1987.
Annex 9 shows the following:
(i)    Four cost centers absorbed most of the Credit (from 152 to 172 of
the total): Roads, Crop Protection, Extension and Training, and
the Office of the General Manager (although it should be noted that
technical assistance service contracts were charged to the Office).
(ii)    "Crop Protection" almost entirely consisted of antimirid control.
On average, CFAF 200 million per year was spent on treatments for
old cocoa trees.



43
The araa treated can be calculated relatively accurately, and so
the cost of one treatment (consisting of two applications) was
about CFAF 5,000 per ha.
(iii)    Costs were as follows:
Office of the General Manager:       50%, or CFAF 590 million
Extension and Trainings              75%, or CFAF 920 million
Production of Planting Material:    90%, or CFAE 500 million
Miscellaneous:                       75%, or CFAF 470 million
Roadss                               50%, or CFAF 675 million
The cost of the coffee program was CFAF 3.155 billion from 1981 to
1986, with 10,988 ha established, a cost of CFAF 287,000 per ha.
(In SRCC I, the cost of establishing one ha of coffee was
CFAF 220,000, excluding road costs.)
IV.         ECONOMIC IMPACT
4.1         The overall economic outcome of the project results from the sum
total of SRCC's various activities. The effects of some of these can be
quantified, but in other cases they are difficult to determines
Mi)    The construction and maintenance of over 600 km of roads (including
308 km in this project) facilitated and -- in certain cases --
directly led to the implementation of planting programs (see study
by the Monitoring and Evaluation Unit). However, the effects on
commerce and transportation, which have not been quantified, must
also be taken into account.
(ii)    The impact of extension messages on fooderop output has not been
clearly determined. Nevertheless, research and extension have
shown that the use of fertilizers has a greater effect than the use
of high-quality seed or improved growing methods, which are -- in
the absence of fooderop credit -- the two main messages to be
disseminated, and which are capable of increasing maize
productivity by between 10% and 20%. By the final year of the
project, one or both of these messages was being applied to between
25Z and 30% of the total area devoted to maize   Itivation.
However, because of the very high price/supply elasticity,
producers may not automatically derive a financial gain from
increased output.
(iii)    Cocoa-related activities can be analyzed by focusing on the
following two areas:
-     On the one hand, the establishment of new hybrid plantations:



44
A survey of 80 ha in the Litime region during the 1983184 crop
season shows the following estimated yields (in kg per ha):
Y4         Y5      Y6      Y7        Y8      Y9 and subsequent
Indeterminate  76     160     245       345      -
Planned    30        100     300      500      600     750
The expected yield, in a normal year, will be about 500 kg per ha.
Consequently, the average productivity of the new plantations is
one third lower than the initial projections, and this average
probably also masks considerable disparities.
On the other hand, pest and disease control for old cocoa
trees:
Antimirid treatment has produced only a marginal improvement in
productivity per ha, and its main effect is to prevent the rapid
disappearance of old infested plantations, thus maintaining a
minimum level of output, even where productivity is poor.
(iV)    Close monitoring has made it possible to gather comparatively
aoaurate data on coffee growing (except for the Niaouli area, on
which there is still little information, and plantations
established outside the SRCC/PCU credit programs, amounting to a
few hundred ha).
Annual harvest estimates are applied to a large sample; for
example, the calculations for the 1986187 harvest were based on
251 villages and an area of 3,107 ha.
The 1986187 results (see Annex 10), as adjusted for changes in
planting density, show that the projected yields (in kg per ha)
have been exceeded by a clear margin:
Y1    Y2    Y3   Y4    Y5    Y6    Y6    Y8    Y9    Y10
Projected
yield    -     -     60   350   600   800   850   300   500   800
Actual yield
(1986/87)   -     -    227   677   997   930   1,043 968   984   880
(Data from Y8 are not included in the comparison, because the
effects of pruning have not yet been precisely assessed.)



45
Nevertheless, it should be noted that productivity for 1986187 may
not be representative of average conditions, even though it is
still too early to speak of 'average conditions." Average yields,
calculated by the same methods, were as follows:
1982/63  (Survey of 172 villages s 4,566 ha) s 424 kg per ha
1983/84  (Survey of 190 villages s 4,030 ha) : 399 kg per ha
1984/85  (Survey of 208 villages s 5,394 ha) t 483 kg per ha
1985/86  (Survey of 243 villages 3 3,054 ha) s 529 kg per ha
1986/87  (Survey of 251 villages s 3,107 ha) : 843 kg per ha
These averages mask quite definite disparities, and three
different zones can be identified on the basis of productivity
levels (see Annex 11)
Zone I:    A high altitude area in the west of the Plateau
region, with average productivity in a normal year
(exceeding 800 kg of green coffee).
Zone II:   A high altitude area in the east of the Plateau
region, providing an average productivity in a normal
year ranging from 600 kg to 800 kg of green coffee.
Zone IIIs   An area in the plains with an average productivity in
a normal year of undee 600 kg of green coffee.
4.2         Because yields were larger than projected, and the planting area
targets were exceeded, the output targets directly related to SRCC II were
obviously exceeded by a clear margin.
Because the various programs overlapped (e.g. the fertilization
and pruning during SRCC II of plantations established during SRCC I), it seems
somewhat unrealistic to attribute the increased output of... [TN: Left blank
in original)...to this project alone.
Output resulting from the projects (taking all the planting years
together) have been as follows (in tons):
1981  : Not determined
198k  :     1,940
1983  t    2,747
1984  :    4,175
1985  :    5,376
1986  :    9,856
An unquantified amount of Niaouli should be deducted from the above outputs
(since it was replaced by Robusta).



46
4.3         Over the 1980-87 period, producer prices and amounts marketed by
OPAT were as follows (see Annex 12)s
Coffee                              Cocoa
Producer price    Amount          Producer price      Amount
(CFAF per kh)   (in tons)         (CFAF per kg)     (in tons)
1980/81     200           8,883                 220            16,336
1981182     215           9,237                 225            11,018
1982183     235           5,941                 235             9,805
1983184     290           2,689                 275            15,573
1984/85     315          10,066                 300             9,795
1985186     365           8,606                 330            14,272
1986187     400          10,500                 360           (10,000)
A comparison between the estimated output of "SRCC Robusta' and
OPAT data on amounts marketed clearly shows a reduction in the share of
Niaouli in the output marketed.
The amounts of cocoa (in tons) recorded by OPAT do not necessarily
correlate with the output from the new plantations.
4.4         From 1980181 to 1985/86, the revenue earned (based on FOB prices)
averaged CFAF 23 billion (see Annex 13), with coffee replacing cocoa as the
main source of foreign exchange.
Producer prices continue to be under 50Z of the economic value of
output:
Producer price as 2 of FOB price
1980/81     s    36.5
1981/82     s    36.1
1982183     s    28.2
1983/84     s    26.6
1984/85     t    26.8
1985186     s    35.5
4.5         At farm level, coffee and cocoa are still comparatively more
profitable than fooderops.
Depending on the productivity levels In question, labor costs
generally exceed CFAF 1,000 per day. However, it will be necessary to
calculate the actual amounts of labor used more accurately (see Annex 14).
V.          INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
5.01        As had been planned, the project was executed by the following
four agencies:



47
SRCC, which is supervised by the Ministry of Rural Development and
administered by a Management Committee that includes
representatives from the various ministries concerned;
PCU, a specialized bureau of CNCA;
IRCC, which undertakes coffee and cocoa experiments and the
production of planting material;
IRAT, which undertakes fooderop experiments and seed production.
SRCC
5.02        SRCC's internal organization and its operational mechanisms were
extensively revised as a result of the diversification of its programs of
activities and the adoption of recommendations contained in the document
prepared by the Ministry of Rural Development and entitled Nouvelle Stratezie
du Developpement Rural ("The New Rural Development Strategy").
In comparison vith its organization chart at the beginning of the
project, SRCC's structure at the end of the project was characterized by the
following features:
-     an Administrative and Financial Directorate, covering four
Services;
-     a separate Training Unit (previously attached to Extension);
-     a Monitoring and Evaluation Unit, regarded as a source of
specialized information for the Office of the General Manager,
rather than a mechanism for the close monitoring of activities
performed by the various Services;
_     a Directorate of Improvements and Maintenance (Direction des
Amenagements et de la Maintenance), into which were integrated the
former Departments of Roads and General Services, and which was
divided into four Services;
-     a Directorate of Agricultural Operations responsible for the
previously separate activities of Extension and Training and
Planting; it also provides for activities relating to Crop
Protection and the new 'Environmental Structuring' program, and is
based on the following personnel:
-   4 Sector/Agency Chiefs (at prefecture or subprefecture level);
-   15 Subsector Chiefs;
-   180 Extension agents.
5.03        At the same time, the following changes were introduceds



48
(i)    The number of permanent staff was increased from about 400 at the
beginning of the project to 580 as of December 31, 1986 (72X being
appointed to the Directorate of Agricultural Operations).
(ii)    Overall, the newly hired staff was better qualified, with
personnel at Al grade being appointed to posts of responsibility,
and the staff at extension agent level being partially replaced,
in accordance with the policy of the Ministry of Rural Development
(i.e. the 1985 "Ministerial Test").
5.04        Until February 1986, the position of General Manager was occupied
by an expatriate IRCC engineer. The process of replacing him by a high-level
Togolese official (previously Director of the Office of the Minister of Rural
Development) in no way hindered the progress of project execution.
During the project, IRCC supplied the entire expatriate technical
assistance team, consisting of: (i) the General Manager, until February 1986;
(ii) the Technical Advisor to the General Manager, from March 1986; (iii) the
Chief of the Extension and Training Service (who became Director of
Agricultural Operations) throughout the project period; (iv) the Chief of the
Equipment Service (who became Director of Improvements and Maintenance)
throughout the project period; (v) The Head of the Training Unit (established
in 1984).
In addition to this permanent assistance team, IRATICIRAD (the
Agricultural Economics Laboratory) provided support for the Monitoring and
Evaluation Unit, in the form of periodic missions in 1985 and 1986.
5.05        In view of the approaching replacement of the expatriate team, the
training of the future Togolese appointees became a priority in the final
phase of the project. As a result, the Chief of the Extension Service and the
Head of the Monitoring and Evaluation Unit received long-term training in
France (lasting two years), partly financed by FAC.  The Chief of the Rural
Civil Works Service received a specially devised four-month course on the
responsibilities of the Directorate of Improvements and Maintenance.  The
opposite number to the Head of the Training Unit received a six-month course
on the training of instructors.
As regards implementation personnel, SRCC itself provided training
in the form of short courses on specific topics, without the need for any
interruption in professional activities.
In addition, it should be noted that SRCC played a role in serving
both Togolese and non-Togolese external students following short courses.
5.06        Because the volume of its operations was increasing, SRCC
computerized certain of its activities.
It installed Thomson hardware (Micromega 16 and Micromega 32, with
a capacity of 20 MB), data input operators were trained, and the following
software was either directly installed or specially devised for processing
SRCC operations: (i) STAT hardware, for the Monitoring and Evaluation Unit,



49
enabling it to process its surveysg (ii) VENUS hardware, designed and
installed for processing DAP data (on payment,, general accounts, cost
accounting, budgetary accounts and financial management); (iii) Suivi des
Plantations ("planting monitoring") and Entrais ("fertilizer") software,
prepared and installed for processing documentation on the 29,000 farmers
registered with the Directorate of Agricultural Operations.
5.07        The annual audits and specific tasks performed by firms
specializing in organizational issues and auditing (e.g. the DAP Procedures
Manual) have steadily improved DAF's internal operations and formalized the
movement of information between DAF and the Technical Services.
No particular reservations have been expressed with respect to
accounts management, and SRCC's accounts have regularly received approval.
Experiments (by Related Institutions)
5.08        Under annual agreements with SRCC, IRCC undertakes the following
two activities: (i) supplying planting material that SRCC is unable to
produce, since IRCC operates the Zozokondji biclonal seed production fields
(16 ha, including 9 ha of irrigated land), the coffee seed production fields,
and the Tovi-Xpimi vegetative propagation center; (ii) it undertakes
supplementary research on coffee and cocoa in test stations or other locations
(i.e. the main station at Tove and three secondary stations), and also --
since 1985 -- as part of a series of field experiments on cocoa (the main
subject being the establishment of cocoa trees using water-saving techniques).
In addition, IRCC specialists working in the Swollen Shoot Virus
Disease Research Unit (an off-project activity) provide support, in their
various specialized fields, for SRCC activities. In particular, the
entomologist is concerned with the Plant Protection Service's antimirid
activities.
5.09        Under the terms of an annual agreement with SRCC, IRAT is
concerned with the following two activities:
(i)    the production and processing of foodcrop seeds, either directly
or by farmers;
(ii)    experiments (on the Adtea station, on the Dayes and Klabe-Azafi
test locations, and in the field) mainly concerned with maize and
rice, and to a lesser degree with cowpeas and groundnuts; root
crops (i.e. cassava and yams), although of considerable Importance
for the project area, have not yet been the subject of particular
experiments, because suitably adapted varieties have not been
introduced.
It should be noted that the counterpart to the expatriate expert
received long-term training in France (two years), financed by the project.



50
Credit
5.10        The agricultural credit component was implemented by PCU (the
Project Credit Unit), which is responsible administratively to CNCA and
operationally to SRCC's General Manager. PCU's Directorate and administrative
staff are accommodated in SRCC's headquarters, and supervise a network of loan
agents at SRCC subsector level.
The terms for credits were the same as applied during the first
project, i.e.s
-     borrowers had to operate land in the project area;
-     borrowers were to belong to a farmers' group;
-     SRCC was to provide technical extension;
-     credit was to be properly used, and applicants had to be current
in servicing previous credit.
Financing for the credit component was to come from the following
sources:
a Loan Agreement between the Government and CNCA, in the case of
IDA financing;
-     OPAT, with regard to seasonal credits and subsidies for planting
credits.
5.11        From FY81 through FY86, about 21,000 coffee credits and 1,500
cocoa credits were granted in the medium-term planting category (see
Annex 15), with 11,103 ha of coffee and 748 ha of cocoa. The amounts released
(in cash and in kind) in the 1981-86 period totaled CFAF 1.25 billion (this
includes the final tranches for plantations established in 1979 and 1980, but
excludes the first tranche for planting in 1986).
Because of problems in the execution of the cocoa program,
planting credits were suspended in 1984.
Over the same period, over 27,000 seasonal credits were granted
(see Annex 16). These short-term credits served to finance fertilizer for
coffee plantations that were already in production (from the fourth year), the
standard application being 400 kg/ha of complex fertilizer (20-10-10). The
total amount granted over this period was CFAF 286 million.
Finally, and even though this relates to an off-project activity,
it should be noted that CFAP 42 million was granted for financing (through
medium-term loans) either individually or collectively operated husking
equipment, using the CNCA "FED General' line of credit.
5.12        Planting credits were of the following three typest



51
-     Program B coffee credits (cuttings);
-     Program C coffee credits (seedlings);
-     cocoa credits.
The following table shows the various features of these programs (see

5.13        Establishing a guarantee fund for medium-term credits had two
objectives: to provide a partial guarantee for the credits granted, and thus
eliminate the least reliable farmers, as far as possible; to train clients in
the use of banks for saving. Moreover, encouraging voluntary saving is one of
the duties of the loan agents.
So far, this activity has had comparatively little effect. In
FY85186, voluntary and compulsory savings totaled about CFAF 12 million
(voluntary savings accounting for CFAP 7.8 million).
5.14        There is a wide range of recovery rates, depending on the type of
credit in question, but overall they are poor (see Annex 18).
Although the premium for clearance and replanting was allocated to
credit repayment, recovery rates for cocoa credits are derisory, and this
justifies declaring all such credits immediately payable.
In spite of a considerable improvement over the last financial
year, recoveries of coffee credits are not satisfactory, particularly since
CFAF 80 million in debts have been canceled because of the destruction of



52
plantations during the 1981-83 period. Similarly, and for the same reasons,
CFAF 68 million in debts on cocoa credits had been canceled, with a CFAF 148
million OPAT subsidy to offset these cancellations.
The recovery rate for seasonal credits is also poor.
5.15        Recovery rates also differ from one SRCC sector to another (see
Annex 19).  The beat rates are for highly productive areas (Akposso and
Ak6bou). However, in view of the action taken by the authorities
(particularly in Amlame) and the role of buyers in credit recovery (about 701
of recovery in 1986187 was by licensed buyers), it cannot be assumed that
there is an inevitable correlation between productivity levels and recovery
rates.
VI.         MAIN FEATURES OF THE THIRD PROJECT
6.01        Experience with the Second Project encouraged the Togolese
Government and the donors to consolidate it by implementing a Third Project.
There was a joint appraisal mission in February 1986, and the Third Project's
duration, component programs and costs were negotiated in Washington in
September 1986.
The project's plafned duration is five years (from January 1987 to
December 1991), and the cost is CFAF 11.654 billion, with the following
breakdown:
IDA (1745-TO)       I  CFAF 6.249 billion (SDR 14.9 million);
CCCE                s  CFAF 2.050 billion;
FAC                 s  CFAF 1.015 billion;
Togolese Government :  CFAF 2.340 billion;
(including PCU:  CFAF 1.240 billion).
6.02        The Third Project has the following main objectives:
implementation by SRCC of the following main components:
-     planting of about 7,500 ha of coffee;
-     planting of 450 ha of cocoa between 1987 and 1989 and, if
warranted by the results, of an additional 1,550 ha of cocoa
in 1990 and 1991;
-     establishment of farmers' groups to undertake primary
marketing and gradually assume certain responsibilities,
particularly with regard to the management of agricultural
credit;
continuation, through IRAT and IRCC, of research on
fooderops, coffee and cocoa;
expansion of the areas producing intercropped fooderops
using improved seed;



53
-     sttengthening of anticapsid and blackpod disease control;
-     construction of 250 km of new roads, and maintenance of
those constructed during the first two phases;
granting of credits to coffee and cocoa farmers by CNCA, through
PCU.
6.03        In relation to the programs and objectives of the Second Project,
the Third Project is characterized by the following features;
the strengthening of training for higher level personnel, so that
the expatriate technical assistance can be rapidly replaced;
the conditionality applied to implementation of the cocoa program,
since its continuation in the second part of the project is
dependent on the application of measures regulating appropriations
and development, and on a midproject evaluation of the cocoa
sector;
the increased transfer of responsibility to farmers, linked to the
establishment of multipurpose farmers' groups;
the importance of field experiments (with which the Directorate of
Agricultural Research will be closely associated) both for coffee
and cocoa research and for research on fooderops;
the elimination of cash credits, and the assumption by CNCA of
total responsibility for the credit component as a Togolese-
financed program, as part of the conversion into grants of the
funds previously provided under Subsidiary Loan Agreements between
the Government and CNCA.
